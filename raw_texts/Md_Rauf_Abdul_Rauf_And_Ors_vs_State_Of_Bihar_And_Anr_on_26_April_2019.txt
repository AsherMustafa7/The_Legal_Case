Md. Rauf @ Abdul Rauf And Ors vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 26 April, 2019
498(A)/34 of the Indian Penal Code and 3/4 D.P. Act against the petitioners in the
circumstances set forth below."
3. The allegation against the petitioners is of demand of dowry.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the present case is mala fide for the purpose of
harassing the petitioners and also patently illegal. It was submitted that earlier the opposite party
no. 2 had filed Complaint Case No. 2677 of 2010 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Purnea on
02.08.2010 against the petitioners under Sections 323, 504 and 498A of the Indian Penal Code and
3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. It was submitted that in the complaint case allegations are
with regard to snatching of necklace, earrings, assault and demand of dowry of Rs. 50,000/-.
Learned counsel submitted that the FIR was filed on 23.11.2010, which also speaks of assault, abuse
and demand of dowry of Rs. 1,50,000/- It was submitted that in the complaint filed, the allegations
under Sections 323, 504, 498A of the Indian Penal Code and 3/4 of The Dowry Prohibition Act,
1961, whereas in the present FIR it is only under Sections 498A/ 34 of the Indian Penal Code and
3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Learned counsel submitted that filing of the complaint case is
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.3253 of 2015 dt.26-04-2019 three and a half months prior to filing
of the FIR, but such fact has not been mentioned in the FIR and moreover, in the complaint the
allegation is that the demand of dowry was of Rs. 50,000/- whereas in the FIR the amount of dowry
sought has been enhanced to Rs. 1,50,000/-. Learned counsel submitted that in the complaint case,
the Court below has convicted some of the accused. Learned counsel submitted that based on the
same allegations and after trial there being conviction of some of the accused, the present case also
basically raising the same accused could not be allowed to continue as it would be an abuse of the
process of the Court.
5. Learned APP fairly submitted that based on the same allegations, there could be multiple cases.
6. Learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 submitted that the two cases are not the same,
inasmuch as, in the present case, there is allegation of attempt to murder of the opposite party no. 2,
which was not there in the complaint case. However, on a query of the Court that even in the FIR,
the allegation is not of any attempt of murder but only an allegation that the opposite party no. 2
had been informed that her father-in law has sent 7 and 8 unknown persons with arms to kill the
opposite party no. 2 and her father, how could it be said to be an Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.3253 of 2015 dt.26-04-2019 attempt to commit murder and also moreso, in view of the fact that
in the complaint case, the allegations were more wide as compared to the present FIR and further
that after filing of the complaint the opposite party no. 2 had not gone back to the matrimonial
home so as to give any fresh or different cause of action and also that such fact of filing of complaint
was suppressed in the FIR, learned counsel could not give any answer.
7. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for
the parties, the Court finds that a case for interference has been made out.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioners has rightly pointed out that the opposite party no. 2 having
filed the complaint in which there were widespread allegations and then filing an FIR after three and

Md. Rauf @ Abdul Rauf And Ors vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 26 April, 2019
a half months without even indicating filing of the complaint case and with lesser allegations and
also no fresh or different cause of action having arisen as opposite party no. 2 had not gone back to
the matrimonial home after filing of the complaint case, clearly the present FIR cannot be permitted
in law. The same, thus, is an abuse of the process of the Court which is required to be prevented by
exercise of inherent power of the Code under Section 482 of the Code.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.3253 of 2015 dt.26-04-2019
9. Accordingly, the application is allowed. The entire criminal proceeding arising out of Barhara PS
Case No. 139 of 2010 (G.R. No. 2863 of 2010) pending before the Court below at Purnea including
the order dated 13.12.2011, by which cognizance has been taken, stands quashed.
