informant and they are living together. Now, she is on family way. In this regard, a

expected that the trial court may fix a date for the verification of the compromise and
after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an appropriate order with respect to the
same in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period
of one month from today. While passing the order verifying the compromise, the
