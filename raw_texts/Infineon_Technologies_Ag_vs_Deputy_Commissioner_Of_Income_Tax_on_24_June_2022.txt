THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR FURTHER
HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The respondent authorities have sought to reopen the assessment of the petitioner for the year
2010-2011. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner has preferred this writ petition on the ground that
the proposed reopening of the assessment is time barred.
2. The respondents contend that the same is not time barred and it has been initiated in accordance
with law and prays for dismissal of the writ petition.
3. Given the facts and circumstances of the case, as per the provisions of Section 149 of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 as it stood then, the respondents were required to reopen the assessment by issuing a
valid notice within a period of six years from the end of relevant assessment year. The said
proposition of law is not disputed by either of the parties.
4. In the instant case, the authorities have issued a notice dated 31.03.2017, which reads as under:-
"Whereas I have reason to believe that your income chargeable to tax for the
assessment year 2015-16 has escaped assessment within the meaning of section 147
of the Income-tax Act.
I, therefore, propose to assess the income under section for the said assessment year
and hereby required you to deliver to me a return in the prescribed form of your
income for the said assessment year within 30 days from the date of service of this
notice.
This notice is being issued after obtaining the necessary approval of the
Commissioner of Income-tax (International Taxation), Bangalore."
5. Thereafter on 11.04.2017, the authorities have issued a corrigendum which reads as under:-
"This is with reference to the notice issued under section 148 of the Income Tax Act,
1961 dated 31.03.2017. It is to be informed that there has been a typographical error
in the notice issued to you wherein the assessment year has been mentioned as
2015-16 instead of 2010-11. Hence, the Assessment Year 2015-16 as mentioned in
Line - 2 of the said notice should be read as "Assessment Year 2010-11"."

6. The case of the petitioner is that though the initial notice is dated 31.03.2017 it was in fact issued
on 04.04.2017 and has produced a copy of the track consignment of the relevant post office, which
shows that the notice in this case was booked on 04.04.2017 and was delivered on 12.04.2017. Given
the period of limitation, the notice was required to be issued on or before 31.03.2017 and the notice
issued on 04.04.2017 does not confer the jurisdiction upon the authorities as it becomes time
barred.
7. The respondents have not been able to substantiate their contention that it was issued on
31.03.2017 and not on 04.04.2017.
8. Further, the notice states that the income that has escaped assessment within the meaning of
Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 pertains to the assessment year 2015-2016.
9. By way of corrigendum dated 11.04.2017, the authorities have sought to correct the mistake in the
original notice and have stated that the same has been issued for the assessment year 2010-2011 and
not 2015- 2016.
10. It is contended by the petitioner that the corrigendum dated 11.04.2017 has to be considered as a
fresh notice and it cannot be a corrigendum to the earlier notice. What is sought to be corrected is
not a mere procedural irregularity as contemplated under Section 292- B of the Income Tax Act,
1961 but a material mistake. On the said ground, it is contended that even presuming the date of
issuance of first notice is dated 31.03.2017, issuance of the second notice in the style of corrigendum
which is admittedly done on 11.04.2017 is time barred.
11. The first notice categorically states that the authorities intend to reopen the assessment to
determine to escaped income for the assessment year 2015-2016. The authorities get the jurisdiction
to reopen the assessment upon issuance of a notice as contemplated under Section 148 of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 and by the first notice, the authorities have invoked their jurisdiction to
reopen the assessment for the assessment year 2015-2016 and not 2010-2011. With regard to the
assessment year 2010- 2011, it can be said that the authorities have sought to invoke their
jurisdiction by issuance of notice dated 11.04.2017 which is styled as corrigendum. By the said
corrigendum, it cannot be said that it has sought to cure a procedural irregularity as contemplated
under Section 292- B of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and it has to be held that they have invoked the
jurisdiction to reopen the assessment for the year 2010-2011 only after issuance of the said
corrigendum on 11.04.2017 which is clearly time barred.
12. Even otherwise as mentioned above, the petitioner has been able to demonstrate that though
first notice is dated 31.03.2017, the same has been issued only on 04.04.2017, which is time barred.
13. For the said reasons, the writ petition succeeds. Hence, the following:-
