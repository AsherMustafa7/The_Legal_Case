COMMON ORDER
Introductory Statement:
1.1 ‘Veda Nilayam‘ was acquired. It was the residence of Selvi J. Jayalalithaa, the
former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. She owned it. Ms. Jayalalithaa died on
05-12-2016. Subsequently, her house was acquired by the Government un-
der the provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition,Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act., 2013 (RFCTLARR Act) with
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 a view to convert it into a
memorial for her.
1.2 Ms. Jayalithaa was a spinster and she died intestate. The petitioners herein, Shri. Deepak and
Smt.Deepa (henceforth Deepak and Deepa), respectively are her nephew and niece (children of Ms.
Jayalalithaa’s pre-deceased brother Jayakumar), and are the successors-in-title to Ms. Jayalalithaa’s
estate. They challenge the acquisition of ‘Veda Nilayam’ in these writ petitions.
2. To facilitate a focused analysis, this Order is divided into Section-A and Sec- tion-B. In Section A,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 4
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
this Court proposes to deal with Facts & Pleadings. In Section B, the arguments of the counsel on
either side and the discussion and decision of the Court are dealt with.
SECTION-A FACTS & PLEADINGS FACTS:
3. There are two sets of facts: (a) Facts relating to a certain proceedings for ob- taining Letters of
Administration (hereinafter would be termed as LoA) that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 Deepak has filed; and (b) Facts pertaining to acquisition of ‘Veda
Nilayam’. In normal circumstances the former (that which relates to LoA) may not have merited
anything more than a passing reference in a proceeding challenging the acquisition based on title.
However, it has assumed considerable significance, thanks to the defense-strategy of the
respondents. Proceedings for grant of LoA:
4. The facts here are:
(cid:133) On 16-08-2017, Deepak (the petitioner in W.P.Nos.9285 of 2020 and WP.No.1708
of 2021) had approached the Tahsildar, Mylapore Taluk, for obtaining a legal heir
certificate to the effect that he and Deepa are the heirs of Ms. Jayalalitha. This was
forwarded to Tahasildar, Guindy, who vide his proceedings dated 22.09.2017, refused
to grant it and re- quired Deepak to approach the Court.
(cid:133) Meanwhile, on 09-10-2017, a certain K.Pugazhenthi and P.Janakiraman had filed a
O.P. D.No.35654 of 2017 for issuance of Letter of Adminis- tration. They claimed
themselves to as members of AIADMK, the polit- ical party whose affairs Ms.
Jayalalithaa had presided. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135
of 2020 (cid:133) Deepak on his part has approached this Court in O.P.No.630 of 2018 for
obtaining LoA, in which, his sister, Deepa (petitioner in WP.No.10135 of 2020) was
arrayed as a respondent. Deepa filed an affidavit before the Court consenting to the
issuance of LoA in the name of Deepak and her-
self.
(cid:133) On 09.08.2018, a learned Single Judge of this Court passed an order re-
jecting Pugazhenthi and Janakiraman’s right to maintain a petition for obtaining a LoA. Challenging
this Order in O.P.D.No.35654 of 2017, Pugazhenthi and Janakiraman preferred an intra court
appeal in O.S.A.No.445 of 2018, before a Division Bench of this Court. This ap- peal laid only against
the Administrator General of Tamil Nadu. The Di- vision Bench however, suo moto directed the
impleadment of Deepa and Deepak, in the appeal before it. The Bench also withdrew O.P.630 of
2018 that was pending adjudication before the learned Single Judge to its file.
(cid:133) On 27-05-2020, the Division Bench pronounced separate orders in O.P.630 of 2018 and OSA 445
of 2018. This Court allowed the petition in O.P.No.630 of 2018 and declared the petitioners herein
as heirs of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 Ms.Jayalalithaa, but

J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
disposed the appeal preferred by Pugazhenthi and Jayaraman. The operative portion of these Orders
are extracted:
Case No. Operative portion
O.P.No.630 of (1) The petitioner Mr.J.Deepak and the respondent
2018 Ms.J.Deepa are the class-II legal heirs (****)
of late Chief Minister Dr.J.Jayalalithaa, being the son and the dauther of the late Chief Minis-
ter Dr.J.Jayalalithaa's brother Late J.Jayaku- mar (2) The petitioner and the respondent are entitled
to the Letters of Administration in respect of the estate held individually by the Chief Minister
Dr.J.Jayalalithaa or in the names of the firms or companies and the credits of the deceased J.-
Jayalalithaa, as mentioned in the Affidavit of valuation filed by the petitioner viz., Ex.P10 (3) The
petitioner and the respondent shall allot a few properties, according to their discretion and create a
registered Public Trust in the name of their late aunt Dr.J.Jayalalithaa“ for the pur- pose of doing
public and social service as per their affidavits filed before this Court within a period of eight weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
O.S.A.No.445 of 36. While confirming the order of the learned Single 2018 Judge rejecting original
petition filed by the appellants at SR stage itself, this Court suo moto invoking Article 226 and
Section 151 of CPC, passes the following or- der :
(a) The State Government shall consider and decide the suggestion of this Court to
avoid making Poes Garden property ' VEDA NILAYAM' as ' memorial' by acquiring
the property, as it would incur huge expenses to the public ex-
chequer.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
Case No. Operative portion
(b) The State Government shall consider the sug- gestion that Poes Garden property 'VEDA
NILAYAM' be made as ' Official Residence-
cum-Office of the Chief Minister of the State', after acquiring the property as per law, after is- suing
notice and hearing the second and third respondents viz., J.Deepa and J.Deepak.
(c) The State Government may consider the sugges- tion of this Court to convert a portion of the
property as 'memorial' in the memory of late Chief Minister J.Jayalalitha and rest of the property as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 6
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
'Official Residence-cum-Office of the Chief Minister of the State'.
(d) There shall be a direction to the State to provide round the clock security to the second and third
respondents viz., Mrs.J.Deepa and Mr.J.Deepak forthwith at their cost.
(e) The legal heirs viz., the second and third re- spondents are directed to liquidate any one of the
proeprties of deceased J.Jayalalithaa and deposit the amount in a fixed deposit in any one of the
nationalised bank and pay for expenses incurred towards security to be provided by the State, as per
this order.
(****) This Court, Vide order dated 29.05.2020 in O.P.No.630 of 2018 and O.S.A.No.445 of 2018
had clarified that the petitioners herein (Deepak & Deepa) are the legal heirs of Late Former Chief
Minister Dr.J.Jayalalitha as per Section 15(2)(a) and Section 15(1)(d) of the Hindu Succession Act
and are entitled to succeed to her estate. Hence 'Class-II' of 'II Class' found in the order dated
27.05.2020 stands deleted. The Acquisition Proceedings:
5. Facts pertaining to acquisition are not disputed. And, as would be seen
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 later, their
relevance in the context of the arguments advanced and the decision arrived is also
minimal. Secondly, the pleadings too are slightly scattered, and hence they are
grouped after a conjoint reading of the affidavits filed on either side, and the typed
set of papers that both have filed. As most of the facts so disclosed do not impact the
critical issues to be considered by this Court in the later stage of this order, they are
tabulated as under for convenience:

Pleadings:
Petitioners’ case:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
6. In the backdrop of the consolidated facts as are tabulated above, the core-
contention of the petitioners as supporting their cause of action, may now be stated:
● At no point of time, the Government gave the petitioners any opportunity to
present their version to the intended conversion of Veda Nilayam into a memorial for
Ms. Jayalalithaa.
● Acquiring a property for converting it into a memorial does not fall with-
in the meaning of ‘public purpose’ as defined in Section 2 of RFCTLARR Act.
● During the pendency of OP.No.630 of 2018 and O.S.A.No.445 of 2018 before the
Division Bench, Deepak had requested the Land Acquisition Officer, vide his
communication dated 03.09.2019, to postpone the en- quiry, till the orders were
passed in the above cases. ● While so, without waiting for the orders, the Land
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 17
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
Acquisition Officer had issued a public declaration dated 06.05.2020 under Section
19 of the RFCTLARR Act. As per this declaration, the Government has made a
statement that the ownership of the property is yet to be ascertained. This is not
consistent with the Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 ● Later, the
Government has come out with a memorial for Dr.J.Jayala-
lithaa at the place of her burial at considerable expenses to the public ex- chequer and
hence converting her house into another memorial cannot be justified.
● The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) has not been properly done and the
Government has given a go by to Section 4(4)(f) of the RFCTLARR Act and avoided
exploring the possibility of an alternate site for acquiring the property. The SIA
report had not considered the feasibility of an altern- ate place. It has given a go by to
the Environmental Impact Study, which is mandatory under Section 4(4) of the Act.
The SIA report is a vacuous document filed without proper application of mind. The
procedure adop- ted for acquiring the property violates due process of law. At no
time, have the respondents respected the doctrine of principle of natural justice.
● Challenging the acquisition the Poes Garden & Kasthuri Estate Owners Association
instituted W.P.No.9229 of 2020 before this Court, seeking to quash the entire land
acquisition proceeding. This came to be disposed of by this Court on 15.07.2020,
recording the statement of the learned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 Additional Advocate General that the acquisition
proceedings have not culminated into any final orders, and also recorded the
statement of the learned Additional Advocate General that the Government is actively
considering the suggestions made by the Division Bench of this Court in OSA 445 of
2018.
● The Award No.1/2020 was hurriedly passed by the third respondent vide his
proceedings dated 22.07.2020. Indeed, the award was passed even before the
Government had taken a decision on the matter as per the dir- ections of the Division
Bench passed in O.S.No.448/2015. Con- sequently, the award passed suffers from
manifest perversity as it is against the violation of the principles of natural justice. ●
The Land Acquisition Officer approached the issue without understand-
ing the spirit behind the RFCTLARR Act. This apart, as per the Rule 18(4) of the
Tamil Nadu RFCTLARR Rules, 2017, if the compensation amount is more than
Rs.8.0 crores, then the award must be passed only by the Collector.
● Both the petitioners were not given an opportunity to participate in the land
acquisition proceedings, though they have been declared as the heirs
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 18
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
Dr.J.Jayalalithaa, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. ● The Government have
invoked Section 16 of the Act, during the pen-
dency of W.P.No.9229 of 2020. On 22.05.2020, an ordinance was pro- mulgated,
which later culminated into a legislation on 19.10.2020, for taking control of the
movables and other valuables in Veda Nilayam. The entire process totally ignored the
petitioners herein, who are heirs of late Dr.J.Jayalalithaa, former Chief Minister of
Tamil Nadu. ● The entire proceedings picked up a momentum from May, 2020,
when the country was in a total lock down during the first wave of COVID-19. It is in
this setting, the ordinance too was passed on 22.05.2020.
(b) Counter of the Respondents:
7.1 For the respondents-State, at least three counters are filed. The Income Tax
Department which is arrayed as the 6th respondent in W.P.10135/2020 has filed its
separate counter. Before detailing the line of defenses taken by them, it will be
appropriate to list how the official respondents positioned themselves:
Case No. Counter filed by Counter filed for whom WP.9285/2020 District Collector
(R2) District Collector WP.No.10135/2020 Land Acquisition Officer/ District
Collector and Revenue Divisional https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020 Case No. Counter filed by Counter filed for whom Revenue Divisional
Officer(R5) Officer (R4 & R5) WP.No.1708/ 2021 District Collector (R2) Tamil
Development and Information Depart-
ment and Land Acquisition Officer/Revenue Divisional Officer (R1 & R3) In other
words, the District Collector, Chennai had taken the responsibility of defending the
two petitions that Mr.J.Deepak had filed, whereas the Land Ac- quisition
Officer/Revenue Divisional Officer took the responsibility to file counter affidavit to
WP.No.10135/2020, filed by Mrs.J.Deepa, even though the District Collector,
Chennai was arrayed as the fourth respondent. 7.2 All the counters filed either by the
District Collector / Land Acquisition Of-
ficer, as the case may be, broadly narrate the various procedural facts that were followed by the
Government from the stage of Hon'ble Chief Minister's state- ment on the Floor of the House to
convert 'Veda Nilayam' into a memorial till passing of the award. (These facts are already stated
succinctly in the tabula- tion in Paragraph 5 above). The material facts of defense raised in the
counters are bullet-pointed as below :
● The petitions are not maintainable in view of the Orders passed in OS-
A.No.445 of 2018, and non-compliance of certain directions by the petitioners, in
t e r m s o f L o A g r a n t e d t o t h e m i n O P . N o . 6 3 0 o f 2 0 1 8 .
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 ● The petitioners
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 19
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
herein are not the owners of the property. They only fall under the category of
'persons interested' within the meaning of Section 3(x) of the RFCTLARR Act.
● That a memorial will fall within the inclusive definition of “public purpose' under
Sec.2(1) of the RFCTLARR Act. To support it, refer- ence was made to several
authorities (all of which are later relied on by the learned Advocate General in his
arguments). ● The central theme to the public purpose for acquisition is explained in
the counter of the District Collector, the 2nd respondent in W.P.No.9285 of 2020,
and it is relevant to extract the following para- graphs :
“19. ........ The late Hon'ble Chief Minister, being a leader who lived for the welfare of
the public, would have most definitely appreciated and welcomed the steps taken by
the Government to convert the residence to a Memorial to serve as a symbol of
motivation, especially to girls/women and to inspire them to achieve their goals
against all odds. It is submitted that the petitioner who was not publicly seen or even
associated with late Hon'ble Chief Minister, when she was alive and had faced various
challenges/adversities, both political and personal, is now claiming
proximity/familiarity with her purely for the sake https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 of retaining the properties.
23. ....... The Hon'ble Chief Minister was a leader of National and Global fame and
conversion of her residence to a memori-
al would not only be a matter of pride and motivation to the people of this State but the same would
also promote tourism industry by attracting visitors as it is common that tourist who visit other
Countries/States would always visit such memorials and the memorials become places of tourism
importance. 29(d). ...... In continuation to the above, it is submitted that considering the history and
achievements by the former Chief Minister Selvi.J.Jayalalithaa, a conscious decision was taken to
convert 'Veda Nilayam' into a memorial to showcase her con- tribution to the society and to
highlight the fact that the former Chief Minister considered the people of Tamil Nadu as only family
and worked tirelessly for their interest and welfare. Hence, the Government of Tamil Nadu decided
to convert the residence of former Chief Minister Selvi.J.Jayalalithaa into a memorial. Further, it is
submitted that conversion of resid- ences of popular leader into Government Memorial is not a new
phenomenon, it is worldwide practice that respective Gov- ernments construct memorials to
preserve the late leader's memory in the minds of public, not only for their country's cit- izens and
also for the other country citizens to know the achievements of great leaders.”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 ● For the purpose of establishing
a foundation for making long-term ar-
rangements for conversion of 'Veda Nilayam' into a memorial, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly
has passed the Tamil Nadu Purat- chi Thalaivi Dr.J.Jayalalithaa Memorial Foundation Act, 2020,
for up- keep and management thereof, and for matters incidentally thereto. This Act had come into
force retrospectively from 22.05.2020. ● Right through, the petitioners have been only requesting to
drop the acquisition, but this has been considered by the Chief Secretary, pur- suant to the Orders of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 20
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
this Cout in WP.No.26286/2017 dated 22.10.2017. At the earliest instance, he has rejected it as not
feasible of compliance and this Order was not challenged. ● That the petitioners were given due
opportunity to participate in the enquiry at every stage of the acquisition, and therefore they cannot
question it. Having granted absolute opportunity at all stages, the peti- tioners cannot claim that
they have been denied opportunity. ● That there is no need for any rehabilitation and resettlement
package as the petitioners were not displaced by the acquisition. Neither of the petitioners have
been residents of ‘Veda Nilayam’ in the last few https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020 decades. It is neither their place of residence nor is their livelihood dependent on the
same.
● Veda Nilayam has been acquired to convert it into a memorial to at-
tract public and tourists. It is being preserved to depict the life and times of the late former Hon'ble
Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, for which the State legislature has enacted Act No.32/2020 for
transfer and maintenance of the movables and other valuables inside the premises to the care of the
Government. The inventory of the articles, movables etc., in Veda Nilayam too have been prepared.
● Intervention of COVID-pandemic has little relevance, since it was the continuation of the process
of acquisition commenced earlier to the onset of pandemic and at no stage, the petitioners can be
stated to have been prejudiced and thereby, since they were heard at all times. ● The petitioners’
core-contention to oppose acquisition was emotional and sentimental, neither of which merit
consideration when there is a public purpose for acquisition.
● No prejudice would be caused to the petitioners, nor their rights would be prejudiced in any
manner by the opening of the memorial. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of
2020 ● The award has been passed legally, and since there was a claim for apportionment of
compensation by the interested persons, the com- pensation amount of Rs.67,90,52,033/- was
deposited before the Prin- cipal District Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai. 7 .3 In the counter
affidavit of the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, the 6th respondent in WP.No.10135 of 2020,
he only claim that as on 31.01.2021, the tax arrears to the tune of Rs.37,54,61,691/- is due from late
Selvi.J.Jayalalithaa and that has to be first settled to the Department.
SECTION B Preliminary Statement:
8.1 In this section the arguments, discussion on the arguments and the conclu- sion arrived by the
Court are dealt with. The entire arguments and the discus- sion thereon are divided into three parts:
(cid:136) Part I deals with the maintainability issue raised by the Government. (cid:136) In Part II,
this Court considers if the acquisition of Veda Nilayam in-
volves a ‘public purpose’ within the meaning of RFCTLARR Act, and if the exercise of
the power of acquisition is tainted by a colourable exer-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 cise of the power of
eminent domain.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 21
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
(cid:136) In Part III allegations of procedural lapses are discussed. 8.2 Few preliminary
aspects may have to be stated here:
(cid:136) The pleadings of the petitioners do not support the gamut of arguments that they
later constructed. This is also reasonably matched by the re-
spondents. What is however significant here is that both sides advanced arguments,
knowing full well the case of the rival, with necessary copies of documents and also
authorities to back them. When facts, documents and arguments are available before
the Court, it may not matter if a line of legal argument is not adequately projected in
the pleadings. After all, pleadings are intended to provide procedural fairness, and
when parties are appraised of the issues involved lack of clarity in pleadings becomes
inconsequential.
(cid:136) This Court is aware that in this case, it is dealing with an issue involving the
working of public law, and in the process it has also spotted a facet in it that
possesses the complexion of a fundamental right. Therefore, it becomes obligatory on
the Court to test the Executive actions on a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 braoder plane of Constitutional and administrative
law, and not to con-
fine itself to a meticulous analysis of the pleadings as if it were a civil suit.
8.3 The learned Advocate General and the Additional Advocate General have shared
their responsibility in defending the action. While Shri. S.R.Rajagopal, the learned
Additional Advocate General argued Part-I on the maintainability of the writ
petitions, the other two parts were argued by Shri. R.Vijaynaray-
anan, the learned Advocate General.
PART I: MAINTAINABILITY Arguments of the Respondents:
9. Thiru.S.R.Rajagopal, the learned Additional Advocate General presented the grounds of challenge
to the maintainability of the writ petitions. His arguments are summed up thus:
● Both Deepa and Deepak assert in their respective affidavits that they de-
rive their title to litigate only under the Letters of Administration. ● The LoA granted
to t hem h ow eve r , is a lim ited grant. Consequently the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 operative portion
of the orders of the Division Bench effectively scuttles petitioners’ ambitious designs
to challenge the acquisition. ● The operative portion of the order in O.P.630 of 2018
would indicate that the Division Bench of this Court was not oblivious to the ongoing
ac- quisition proceedings which had by then been commenced, but on the other hand,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 22
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
had taken cognizance of it. This becomes evident from the order of the Division
Bench directing the Government to consider util- ising a part of the residence of the
late Jayalalithaa, then under acquisi- tion, as the Official Residence cum Office of the
Chief Minister of the State. This direction would operate as an approval to the
acquisition and would bind both Deepa and Deepak. This direction of the Division
Bench given to the Government operates as an exception to the LoA within the
meaning of Sec.256 of the Indian Succession Act and limits the extent of the
authority of the LoA. Sec.218(2) of the Succession Act grants ample discretion to the
Court in the matter of grant of LoA, and the person in whose favour the LoA is
granted is required to carry out those functions and duties only. Reliance was placed
on the authority in Illachi Devi Vs Jain Society Protection of Orphans India & Others
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 [(2003) 8 SCC
413].
● The Division Bench heard both O.S.A. 445 of 2018 and O.P.630 of 2018
simultaneously but disposed them by separate orders. The resultant effect is that the
order in O.P.630 of 2018 has merged with the order passed in O.S.A.445 of 2018.
Secondly, both Deepa and Deepak were parties to both proceedings, and this is
indicative of their tacit surrender of rights that they might have had under Sec.15 of
the Hindu Succession Act and submission to the testamentary jurisdiction of this
Court. They are there- fore, estopped from falling back on their right under Sec.15 of
the Hindu Succession Act, to challenge the acquisition proceedings. ● The
Constitutional right to property of Deepa and Deepak has accrued to them only on
27-05-2020, vide the orders of the Division Bench, and since they are parties to the
same, they are bound by it. The rule of es- toppel by conduct operates and bars them
from maintaining these peti- tions. Reliance was placed on the authorities in in

● Order XXV Rule 46 and 47 of the Original Side Rules mandate that an inventory as
required under Sec. 317 of the Indian Succession Act be filed in Form 67 of Original
Side Rules. The writ petitioners have not produced the original LoA, nor have they
spoken about their compliance with the mandatory filing of statement of
accounts/inventory of all the assets of Ms. Jayalalithaa.
● The award has been passed by the Land Acquisition Officer on 22-07- 2020. If at all
the petitioners can have a grievance it might relate to the adequacy of the
compensation and nothing more. For this they will have to move the appellate
authority under Section 64 of the Right to Fair Compensation Act, by preferring an
application to the Collector. When there is an effective alternative remedy available, it
is impermissible for the petitioners to camouflage their real intent to challenge a
concluded acquisition proceedings. Reliance was placed on the decision in Gen- pact

Arguments for the Petitioners:
10. The counsel for the petitioners replied:
● The Division Bench vide its order dated 29-05-2020 by which it amended its earlier
order had declared that both the petitioners are the heirs of Ms. Jayalalithaa. Ever
since the petitioners have become the lawful owners of ‘Veda Nilayam’.
● That the Division Bench was not called upon to decide the legality of the acquisition
proceedings, nor has it attempted to do so when it passed its orders in OP 630 of
2018, and OSA 445 of 2018. Therefore, whatever directions it has given therein
cannot take away the right of the petition- ers to challenge the acquisition as the
lawful owners of the property-ac- quired.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 Discussion &
Decision
11. The subject of maintainability of the petitions will be discussed under two heads: (a) Effect of the
Order of the Division Bench in the proceedings granting LoA; and (b) Effect of Sec.64 of the
RFCTLARR Act.
(a) LoA Vs Maintainability:
12.1 The arguments touching upon the maintainability of the writ petitions, were advanced with
great degree of conviction by either side. Sadly they were off the track on the lane of law, and failed
to convince this Court on the point of their sustainability. If these arguments are examined for their
qualitative-merit, what instantly strikes the attention of this Court is the fallacy of the basic premise,
which either side, perhaps, have unwittingly, entertained. As would be seen later, it turned out to be
a legal adventure or rather a misadventure in juris- prudential misconception, that the vesting of the
ownership of ‘Veda Nilayam’ in Deepak and Deepa is a consequence of the order of the Division
Bench, dated 29-05-2020. The difference which either side, however, has managed to bring to their
respective arguments is in the choice of the terminologies: while the petitioners opted for the word
‘ownership’ the respondents preferred vest- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020 ing of ‘Constitutional right to property’.
12.2 If this basic premise is examined further, it would now require this court to start with a
supposition that between the date of the death of Ms.J.Jayalalitha and the date of the order of the
Division Bench, the ownership of the property remained suspended, or more accurately was in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 24
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
vacuum. 13.1 “An Ownerless property is unknown to law” is an axiomatic statement in
jurisprudence. Salmond says that ownership “in its most comprehensive signi- fication, denotes the
relation between a person and the right that is vested in him”. He proceeds to state that ownership is
a residuary right that inheres in a person in relation to the right held by him/her. Austin qualifies
ownership as a right which is “indefinite in point of user, unrestricted in point of disposition and
unlimited in point of duration.” Every jurists has, thus, attempted to ap- proximate their idea of
ownership as a ‘relation’ that inheres in a person over an object as Prof.Holland may put it, or ‘a
right’ as Salmond may advocate. Broadly, ownership is the relationship between a person and a right
– an invis- ible cord that connects a person to a right that adds value to his existence. The
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 right may be in relation to a
tangible or an intangible property and vary from a leasehold right to a right over good will. It may
vary from an absolute to deriv- ative title over a property.
13.2 The point of contextual significance however is, what will happen to the ownership upon the
death of its holder? This depends on the heritability at- tached to the right. There are certain rights
which are personal to an individual, such as a right to an office, and these rights die with the owner
of the rights. There are other rights which are heritable in nature, such as a right over a prop- erty.
Where a property possesses an inherent character to outlive the death of the person who has held
the right over it, then that right cannot exist in a vacu- um. It needs to vest in a person, since
ownership is the relationship that juris- prudence builds between a person and the right, that
relationship cannot hang in a state of suspense. It is here that the law on inheritance or succession
of rights comes in. The foundation of the law of succession is essentially a statement which
enumerates the persons in whom the relationship which the dead-person had over the property may
vest. They provide the rules to identify the person for vesting of ownership.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 13.3 The next point is about
ascertaining the moment when ownership disap- pears in a dead person and re-appears in the
successors-in-interest of the de- ceased. The answer is uncomplicated: It happens the moment the
owner dies. As the ownership is a relationship between its holder and the right, it does not wait, nor
is it postponed, but vests instantly as an incidence or a legal con- sequence of the death of the owner.
The time which spes successionis takes to transform into a right of succession is just a heartbeat –
its stopping. It accord- ingly vests in the heirs, or legatees, or executor - but the vesting is
immediate. This explains why jurisprudence has created a fiction to equate an unborn child to a
living person - to enable vesting of the right of the deceased. If however, there are no successors
available, the property will vest in the State by escheat. It can now be derived that where a right is
heritable, ownership is neither des- troyed nor does it disappear, and that which disappears in one
person reappears in another. And the moment succession opens Article 300 A of the Constitu- tion
steps in to bring the right so vested within its protective umbrella. 13.4 The aforesaid exposition is
not a cocktail of an unknown or an unexperi- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020 enced variety, but is a jurisprudential brew, far too familiar to the Courts. Lord
Parker, tendering the advice of the Privy Council in Meyappa Chetty v Supra- manian Chetty [AIR
1916 PC 202], observed thus:

J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
“Assuming, but without deciding, that this is to be deemed to be a suit which the
testator would, if he were living, have a right to institute, their Lordships have come
to the conclusion that this contention cannot be up- held. It is quite clear that an
executor derives his title and authority from the Will of his testator and not from any
grant of probate. The personal property of the testator, including all rights of action,
vests in him upon the testator’s death, and the consequence is that he can institute an
action in the character of executor before he proves the will. He cannot, it is true,
obtain a decree before probate, but this is not because his title depends on probate,
but because the production of probate is the only way in which, by the rules of the
Court, he is allowed to prove his title.” In Sheonath v Madanlal [AIR 1959 Rajasthan
243] a learned Single Judge of the Rajasthan High Court came to a similar conclusion
and had opined thus:
“As I understand the provisions contained in sec. 213 whether of the Act, or of the
Indian Act it clearly seems to me that section does not vest any right or rather any
substantive right in anybody. What it really does is to regulate this mode of proving a
will, that is, procedure. It is indeed, to my mind beyond doubt or dispute that the
rights of the parties with respect to the succession of the estate of the deceased Kan
Singh insofar as they are https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of
2020 vested or substantive rights fall to be governed by the personal law applic- able
to the parties, and that is the Hindu Law.” In Raja Kakarklhpudi Venkata Sudarsana
Sundara Narasayamma Garu Vs. Andhra Bank Ltd. Vijayawada [AIR 1960 AP 273] a
Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court reached a similar conclusion and
had observed as under:
“62. Even before the obtaining of the probate on the death of the testator, the
property vests in the executrix ‘as such’. It is not Section 213 which deals with the
vesting of the property of the deceased persons, but Section
211. The vesting of the property of the deceased persons in the executor as such does
not arise from the probate. The executor derives his title from the will. Immediately
upon the testator’s death his property vests in the executor, for, the law knows no
interval between the testator’s death and the vesting of the property (vide Whitehead
v. Talor [1834 1-0 A and E Page 210.] and Raja Ram v. Fakuruddin Saheb [58 M.L.J.
Page 211.] therefore, even without obtaining the probate of the will, the executor be-
comes the representative of the estate of the deceased. All that the grant of the probate does is not to
give him title, but only to make his title certain (vide Hewsonv. Shelley). [1914 II Ch. 13 at 38.] In
Cherichi Vs Ittianam [AIR 2001 Kerala 184] a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court concluded as
under:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 “The prohibition
under Section 213 of the Act is regarding establishing any right under the Will
without getting probate or letters of administration and that section cannot be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 26
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
understood as one by which the vesting of right as per the provisions of the Will is
postponed until the obtaining of probate or letters of administration.” This
observations of the Kerala High Court were cited and approved by the Su- preme
Court in Crystal Developers v Asha Lata Ghosh [(2005) 9 SCC 375]. In FGP Ltd. v.
Saleh Hooseini Doctor [(2009) 10 SCC 223], where the Supreme Court reiterated the
aforesaid view and opined as under:
“47. Therefore, it is Section 211 and not Section 213 that deals with the vesting of
property. This vesting does not take place as a result of probate. On the executor’s
accepting his office, the property vests on him and the executor derives his title from
the will and becomes the representative of the deceased even without obtaining
probate. The grant of probate does not give title to the executor. It just makes his title
certain.
52.Even if the will is not probated that does not prevent the vesting of the property of
the deceased on the executor/administrator and consequently any right of action to
represent the estate of the executor can be initiated even before the grant of the
probate.”
14. If the generality of the jurisprudential concept discussed above is now tele-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 scoped into the specifics of this
case, it would mean that ‘Veda Nilayam’ along with the other estates of Ms.Jayalalithaa had vested
in her heirs, (who indisput- ably are Deepa and Deepak) the moment she passed away. Therefore,
the or- der of the Division Bench, as amended on 29-05-2020, if read in this context, has to be
understood merely as a declaration of status of the legal heirship of Deepak and Deepa in law,
viz-a-viz the estate of their aunt Ms.Jayalalithaa.
15. The next aspect is about understanding the effect of the directions given by the Division Bench.
The learned AAG made two points:
(cid:133) First, by virtue of the direction given to the petitioners in O.P.630 of 2018, the
petitioners were directed to constitute a Trust with some of the assets of late
Jayalalithaa as its corpus, and hence the LoA, in effect is a limited LoA. Therefore,
the petitioners have only certain Court-directed obligations to perform and are not
the absolute owners with any right to challenge the acquisition of ‘Veda Nilayam’.
(cid:133) Secondly, in issuing a set of directions in O.S.A 445 of 2018 to the Gov-
ernment to convert a part of ‘Veda Nilayam’ into the official residence-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 cum-office of the
Chief Minister of the State, the Court, in effect, has af- firmed the validity of the
acquisition. And, inasmuch as the petitioners are parties to the aforesaid
proceedings, the directions of the Division Bench binds them. Indeed, they are
estopped from challenging the ac- quisition.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 27
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
16.1 This line of argument is too tedious as it seemingly ignores the interplay of legalities attending
them. To begin with, the basic premise itself is faulty, since the respondents attach excessive
significance to the LoA than what the law per- mits. The law on vesting of rights on the death of its
owner and the LoA has already been explained, and contextually, the argument of the learned
Addition- al Advocate General literally begs the question. Secondly, the LoA is issued only to
administer the estate and no more. And, stricto sensu it is only optional for a Hindu as is provided
under Sec.213(2) of the Indian Succession Act. Sec.218(1) of the Act, provides that while granting a
LoA, the Court cannot ig- nore the successor-at- law of an estate. Therefore, an understanding of the
dir- ections given by the Division Bench in its order granting the LoA cannot ignore the legal
incidences of the LoA.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 16.2 The next aspect is, how to
appreciate the two sets of directions given by the Division Bench? Of the two sets of directions those
given in OSA 445 of 2018 are seen issued in exercise of the powers of the Court under Article 226 of
the Constitution and Sec.151 CPC. [See the tabulation in paragraph 5 above]. These directions tend
to deal with the ownership of the petitioners to which they have succeeded by operation of law,
and/or with their right of user which ownership grants them as a necessary incidence. How far can
then they bind the petitioners in a manner that the Government contends? In K.A. Raveendran Vs
District Collector, Vellore District and others [2021(4) CTC 527], I had an occasion to hold:
“….. right to property has a close nexus to right to life under Art.21 of the
Constitution, since the former, to a substantial extent, defines the quality of life a
citizen has secured for himself under the Constitution. In Delhi Air- tech Services
Private Limited v State of U.P [2011 9 SCC 354] the Su- preme Court termed the right
to property as a human right under Article 21 and alluded to it as the seed bed for
securing other human freedoms such as liberty. The Supreme Court observed:
“30. It is accepted in every jurisprudence and by different political thinkers that some
amount of property right is an indispensable https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 safeguard against tyranny and economic oppression
of the Govern- ment. Jefferson was of the view that liberty cannot long subsist
without the support of property. “Property must be secured, else liberty cannot
subsist” was the opinion of John Adams. Indeed the view that property itself is the
seed-bed which must be conserved if other constitutional values are to flourish, is the
consensus among political thinkers and jurists.” The growth of Constitutional
jurisprudence in this country has been chiefly characterized by the constant search of
the Constitutional Courts to dis- cover the expandability of the concept of right to life
under Article 21. Its objective is to include as many, exclude none, and at all times to
check the Executive temptations to tread upon it, even accidentally, except in accord-
ance with the procedure established by law. The multitude of rights that go to
constitute right to life, sometimes termed as penumbral rights, are com- parable to
the advaita philosophy in that each of such fractional right itself possesses the
characteristics of the whole. Soham. Hence, an understand- ing of the right to
property only in economic terms may not be a right idea, nor will be an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 28
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
understanding that its infringement should produce a tan- gible loss. An
infringement of right to property will therefore enjoy an ex- panded meaning
proportionate to the expandability of the right to life under the Constitution.…” Given
the significance which right to property enjoys under the Scheme of our Constitution,
a divestiture of a vested right of the citizen can be justified only
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 by the ‘authority of
law’. It may include a transfer inter vivos at the instance and volition of the holder of
the right, or by testamentary transfers, or by a pro-
cess of forced-divestiture of rights by a decree of the Court or Tribunal, or by
confiscation or acquisition by the State in exercise of its statutory power of em-
inent domain. If any of these modes of divestiture of rights become the subject matter
of an action, then the Court may pronounce on the legality of the di-
vestiture, or on the mode adopted, and its jurisdiction does not stretch beyond that.
No court therefore, has the power to order the divestiture of a right collat-
erally, or to interfere with any aspects of right of ownership or enjoyment of the
property, unless there is a statutory sanction for its action.
17. Contextually, how far can judicial pro-activism go? The outer contours of Judicial activism and
creativity is markedly defined by strong internal restraint and discipline. The courts shall at no time
plead helplessness when rights of the citizens are in peril, but it is also required to be underscored
that judicial pro-activeness is but a compelling response to an impelling situation that im- perils the
rights of the citizens. While negotiating them, judicial methods helps themselves with an allowance
to breach the line of conventionalism to stray https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020 into the zone of unorthodoxy, still they cannot go astray to tread into areas which
Constitutionalism fears to tread. In the march of our Constitutional juris- prudence, this has
happened many times as they ought to be, yet, and to re-em- phasis, they are contrived to redeem
the rights to the citizen, and not to destroy or amputate them. That which the Constitution frowns,
the Court shall desist from engaging.
18. How far the directions given in OSA 445 of 2018 bind Deepa and Deepak? And, is the mere fact
that they were parties before the Division Bench suffi- cient to deny them their right to challenge the
acquisition of ‘Veda Nilayam’ in a separate proceeding? In other words, can this set of directions be
considered as a judicial approval to the intended acquisition? This Court holds it in the negative.
The reasons are:
(cid:136) First, it is beyond the scope of the proceedings before the Division Bench, which, to
reiterate, was only required to identify the right person in law who is entitled to be
issued with the LoA. Therefore the directions are at the best an obiter and not the
ratio of the decision. (cid:136) Secondly, in terms of the Court’s authority to interfere with
the right to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 29
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
property of a citizen under Article 226 of the Constitution, unless it can be
demonstrably established that the powers under Article 226 is capable of being
equated to any ‘authority of law’ under Article 300A of the Constitution, it will be
nigh difficult to pin the petitioners down to the set of directions which the Division
Bench has issued. It may have to be stated that both Article 226 of the Constitution
and Sec.151 CPC are em- powering provisions which clothe the Court with the
jurisdiction to rem- edy a wrong brought before it. It will therefore be a shocking
contradic- tion if not a painful anathema to the understanding of the Constitution, if
remedial provisions are to be read as enabling exproprietary interfer- ence with the
private estate of the citizens. The nature, scope, intent, character and purpose of
Article 226 of the Constitution and/or Sec.151 CPC, defies an interpretation that they
can be the fountainhead of any ex- proprietary or regulatory power of the Court that
can authorise interfer- ence with the right to private property. Any idea to the
contrary will be plainly anti-Constitutional. It can be now derived that these
provisions are incapable of being equated to any ‘authority of law’, within the
meaning of Article 300-A of the Constitution.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 (cid:136) Thirdly, the
proceedings before the Division Bench does not involve the legality of the acquisition
of ‘Veda Nilayam’, though in passing, it might have been referred to. Some
statements might have been made, they do not foreclose the right of the petitioners to
challenge the acquisitions. Does it require any exposition, or even an emphasis, that
inasmuch as the Constitutional right to property has been telescoped and identified
as a fundamental right under Article 21, it cannot be waived as held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in Basheshar Nath Vs ITO [AIR 1959 SC 149]?
(b) Maintainability Vs Sec.64 of the Right to Fair Compensation Act
19. The next limb of the submission on the maintainability is that this Court should not exercise its
discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Con- stitution as the petitioners have an effective
alternate remedy under Sec.64 of the Act. There is hidden in it yet another fallacy. If Sec.64 is
examined for its scope and purpose, it is beyond any pale of controversy that the remedy of an
aggrieved person is confined to (a) measurement of land; (b) amount of com-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 pensation; (c) person to whom it
is payable; (d) the rights of Rehabilitation and Resettlement under Chapter V and VI of the Act;
and/or (e) the apportionment of compensation among the persons interested. Sec.64 neither
expressly nor impliedly empowered the authorities to sit in appeal over an allegation of col- ourable
exercise of power of eminent domain and to determine if the acquisi- tion involves a public purpose
within the meaning and framework of the Act. That which is not statutorily enabled is legally
prohibited. See: Etti Gounder & Others Vs The District Collector, Namakkal District & Others
[2021-5- LW.262 (paragraphs18.1 to 18.3)]. This argument fails too.
20. To conclude, this Court holds that the set of directions which the Division Bench has issued in
O.P.630 of 2018 and OSA 445 of 2018 do not bind the pe- titioners (as much as the respondents
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 30
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
themselves have rejected the Court’s sug- gestion of converting part of Veda Nilayam into the
residence of the Chief Min- ister of Tamil Nadu). The writ petitions are therefore, maintainable.
PART II DOES A MEMORIAL CONSTITUTES A PUBLIC PURPOSE &
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 COLOURABLE EXERCISE OF
POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN
21. The petitioners contend that RFCTLARR Act does not enable or permit ac- quisition of a
property for constituting it into a memorial, since the definition of public purpose read with the
Statement of Object & Reasons (SOR, for short) along with the preamble to the Act does not
authorize any such purpose. Their strategy is to use the SOR & the preamble as interpretative tools
to limit the op- erative width of the expression ‘public purpose’ in Sec.3(za) read with Sec.2(1)
thereof. To sustain this argument, they also lean back on the Statement of Ob- jects & Reasons of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and the definition of the phrase ‘public purpose’ in Sec.2(f) therein. A
comparative study of these two enactments, according to them, provide the indicators to understand
the con- ceptual shift in the legislative intent in moving from a regime of ‘absolute power of eminent
domain’ of the British vintage to a qualified power of acquis- ition of private property.
22. The Government’s stance is threefold:
(cid:136) That the definition of ‘public purpose’ in Sec.3 (za) read with Sec.2(1) of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 the RFCTLARR Act
is an inclusive one, and hence an acquisition for es- tablishing a memorial (for Ms.
Jayalalithaa) is permissible under the Act. Reliance was placed on the ratio in
Ramanlal Bhailal Patel Vs State of Gujarat [(2008)5 SCC 449]. The Court, in the
guise of judicial review may not read in a restriction which the legislature, in its
wisdom, has chosen not to impose.
(cid:136) Determining what constitutes public purpose is within the exclusive do-
main of the Government, and this can neither be questioned. Reliance was placed on
the judgements in Daulat Singh Surana Vs First Land Acquisition Commissioner
[(2007)1 SCC 641], Sooraram Pratap Reddy & Others Vs District Collector & Others
[(2008)9 SCC 552], Bajirao T. Kote & anothers Vs State of Maharashtra [(1995)2 SCC
442] and Scindia Employees Union Vs State of Maharashtra & Others [(1996)10 SCC
150]. Besides, a declaration under Sec.19 of the RFCTLARR Act (corresponding to
Sec.6 of the Land Acquisition Act) is conclusive as to the public purpose involved in
the acquisition vide the judgement in Sooraram Pratap Reddy & Others Vs District
Collector https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 & Others
[(2008)9 SCC 552].
(cid:136) Constructing or constituting an existing structure as a memorial for lead-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 31
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
ers and men of pre-eminence has been a pan world practice, and acquisi- tion for the
purpose has always been acknowledged to involve a public purpose. The ratio in
Kanaiyalal Maneklal Chinai Vs State of Gujarat [(1969)3 SCC 456] and Ashok Maruti
Rawoot Vs State of Maha- rashtra [PIL 36/2012, decided on 25-02-2013 (Bombay)
(DB)], were cited.
23. Taken superficially, these arguments are suggestive of certain interpretative intricacies of
familiar variety which are, and can be, resolved by the known tools of statutory interpretation.
However, a closer consideration reveals that they are layered. Does RFCTLARR Act, 2013,
accommodate an acquisition for a memorial? What factors decide that? This requires reacquainting
the known forensic indicators.
24. Eminent domain signifies the authority of the State to reassert, either tem- porarily or
permanently, through its agencies, its dominion over any portion of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 the soil of the State including
private property without its owner’s consent for a public good founded on public exigency. Eminent
domain is an essential attrib- ute of every State, and is founded on the principle that the interest and
claim of the whole community is always superior to the interest of an individual. Histor- ically, it is
founded on a presupposition that property remains in the Govern- ment, or in the aggregate body of
the people in their sovereign capacity. 25.1 The origin of the concept of eminent domain is traced to
the writings of the Dutch Humanist and Philosopher Hugo Grotious who is stated to have ob- served
in De Iure Belli Ac Pacii (on the Law of War and Peace) (1625) thus:
“The property of subjects is so far under the eminent control of the state, that the
state or the sovereign who represents it, can use that property, or destroy it, or
alienate it, not only in cases of extreme necessity, which sometimes allow individuals
the liberty of infringing upon the property of others, but on all occasions, where the
public good is concerned, to which the original framers of society intended that
private interests should give way. But it is to be added that when this is done the
State is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.” Existence of a
‘public good’ accompanied by a duty to “make good the loss”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 characterize the
expropriation of property through power of eminent domain. An amplified
restatement on this is found in the following passage of the de- cision of the
Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in State of Bi- har v Kameshwar
Singh [AIR 1952 SC 252].
“The concept of the public use has been inextricably related to an appro- priate
exercise of the power and is considered essential in any statement of its meaning.
Payment of compensation, though not an essential ingredient of the connotation of
the term, is an essential element of the valid exercise of such power. Courts have
defined “eminent domain” so as to include this universal limitation as an essential
constituent of its meaning. Authority is universal in support of the amplified
definition of “eminent domain” as the power of the sovereign to take property for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 32
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
public use without the owner’s consent upon making just compensation.” 25.2.
Section 3(f) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, provided an inclusive definition of the
term “public purpose”. The definition opened with the words:
“Public Purpose includes..” A close examination of the early decisions under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894, would show that Courts have, advisedly, guarded themselves
from attaching any definite meaning to the definition con-
tained in Section 3(f). Thus, in Hamabai Framjee Petit v. Secretary of State for India
[AIR 1914 PC 20], the Privy Council was prepared to accept the fol-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 lowing
observations of Batchelor, J of the Bombay High Court, as stating the accurate legal
position:
“General definitions are, I think, rather to be avoided where the avoidance is possible,
and I make no attempt to define precisely the extent of the phrase ‘public purposes’ in
the lease; it is enough to say that, in my opin- ion, the phrase, whatever else it may
mean, must include a purpose, that is, an object or aim, in which the general interest
of the community, as op- posed to the particular interest of individuals, is directly
and vitally con- cerned.” The concept of “public purpose” was well articulated by the
First Bench of this Court in Thambiran Padayachi v State of Madras [AIR 1952 Mad
756]. The learned judges adverted to several American decisions and literatures
alluding to the synonymous expression “public use”, and approved the following pas-
sage from Willis on Constitutional Law :
“What is a public use? On this question there have been two view points. One may be
called the older viewpoint and the other the newer viewpoint. According to the older
viewpoint, in order to have a public use there must be a use by the public……
According to the newer view point there is a pub- lic use if the thing taken is useful to
the public………In this case there is not necessarily a general use by the public but
there is a general benefit to the public. Private enterprises are thus allowed to
exercise sovereign power of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135
of 2020 eminent domain not because they are taking the property for their own use
but because in taking the property for their use they are benefiting the pub- lic”
Referring to this newer viewpoint Nichols writes:
“Judicial opinion which follows the broad or liberal concept con- siders that the
narrow doctrine has been repudiated and is no longer the prevailing view. ‘Public use’
is considered ‘public benefit’ and it is not considered essential that the entire
community or even any con- siderable portion thereof should directly enjoy or
participate in any improvement in order that it constitutes a public use” This decision
of the Madras High Court was cited with approval by the Law Commission of India in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 33
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
its 10th Report on the Law of Acquisition and Requisi-
tioning of Land (1958). The Commission noted that an inclusive definition best
served the purpose as “in an ever changing world, the connotation of the ex-
pression “public purpose” must necessarily change.” Quoting the American jurist
Alfred Jahr, the Commission opined that “to formulate anything, even though it were
possible, would, in a changing world, be unwise if not futile.
The Law of each age is ultimately what that age thinks the Law should be.” The
Commission concluded by observing as under:
“All that can, therefore, be attempted in a legislation of this kind is to provide an
inclusive definition, so as to endow it with sufficient elasticity to enable the courts to
interpret the meaning of the expression ‘public pur-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 pose’ according to
the needs of the situation, and this is what we have at- tempted.” In Sooraram Pratap
Reddy v. Collector [(2008) 9 SCC 552], the Supreme Court held that the expression is
incapable of precise and comprehensive defin-
ition, adding that it is neither desirable nor advisable to attempt to define it. The
Court opined that it is used in a generic sense of including any purpose wherein even
a fraction of the community may be interested or by which it may be be-
nefited. Also see Somawanti v State of Punjab [AIR 1963 SC 151].
26. Has then the idea of public purpose undergone any conceptual shift under Sec.3(za) of the
RFCTLARR Act? The metamorphic transition of the defini- tion of the expression ‘public purpose’
from the preliminary stage of Land Ac- quisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2011, to its
final version in Sec.3 (za) of the Right to Fair Compensation Act provides the right back- ground.
This definition was, however omitted, thanks to an amendment brought to that effect before the
Parliament when the Bill came up for consider- ation. What the Government has, and what the
Court requires to consider is the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
referential definition of ‘public purpose’ found in sec.2(1) of the Act.
27. Sec.2(1) of the Act reads:
“The provision of this Act relating to land acquisition, compensation, re- habilitation
and resettlement, shall apply, when the appropriate Govern- ment acquires land land
for its own use, hold and control, including for Public Sector Undertakings and for
public purpose, and shall include the following purposes namely:

scheme un- dertaken by the Government, or any local authority or a corporation owned or
controlled by the State.
28. The definition of ‘public purpose’ being what it is, the arguments of the pe- titioners now aim to
limit its operative space with the theme disclosed in the SOR for the Act as well as that in the
Preamble. While considering this as- pect, this Court is mindful of its role in interpretation of the
statute and the pro- cess involved in it:
(cid:136) The principal aim of the Court is not to create for itself a need for inter-
preting the provisions of an enactment with a set of interpretative-tools, unless the
Statute itself presents a scenario requiring the Court to inter- pret. Courts are not to
substitute its wisdom to replace the legislative wis- dom, for it is the latter’s job to
legislate.
(cid:136) A need for interpretation arises when the words and expressions which the
legislature has opted to employ to convey its intent or an idea, taken in their plain
and ordinary meaning, either lead to ambiguity in under-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 standing them, or
absurdity while working it. But, not otherwise. (cid:136) And, to appreciate the extent to
which the Court may fall back on the SOR for an Act or to its the Preamble, there is
hardly a need for ex- pounding anything new since the law on the point is too firmly
en- trenched, to highlight which no more than two authorities (separated by some
fifty-eight years) are sufficient: In State of West Bengal v Union of India [AIR 1963
SC 1241], the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held:
“It is however well-settled that the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying
a Bill, when introduced in Parliament, cannot be used to determine the true meaning
and effect of the substantive provisions of the statute. They cannot be used except for
the limited purpose of understanding the background and the antecedent state of
affairs leading up to the legislation. But we cannot use this statement as an aid to the
construction of the enactment or to show that the legislature did not intend to
acquire the proprietary rights vested in the State or in any way to affect the State
Governments' rights as owners of miner- als. A statute, as passed by Parliament, is
the expression of the col- lective intention of the legislature as a whole, and any
statement made by an individual, albeit a Minister, of the intention and objects of the
Act cannot be used to cut down the generality of the words used in the statute.”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 In Jaishri
Laxmanrao Patil v. State of Maharashtra, [(2021) 8 SCC 1], the Hon’ble Supreme
Court has reiterated:
“111.There cannot be a disagreement with the proposition that where the provisions
of the statute or its wordings are ambiguous, the first attempt should be to find
meaning, through internal aids, in the stat- ute itself. Failing this, it is open to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 36
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
court to find meaning, and re- solve the ambiguity, by turning to external aids, which
include the Statements of Objects and Reasons, as well as parliamentary reports, or
debates in Parliament. To this Court, it appears that the task of in- terpreting the
provisions of … does not begin by relying on external aids such as Statement of
Objects and Reasons (which throw practic- ally no light on the meaning of the
provisions), or even the Select Committee Report. The task of interpretation is first to
consider the overall scheme of the provisions, and secondly, after considering the
provision, proceed to resolve any perceived ambiguity, if found, by resorting to aids
within the statute. It is at the third stage, when such resolution is impossible, that
external aids are to be looked into.”
29. The core principles of statutory-interpretation being what they are, the argu- ments of the
petitioners must be tested on its anvil. When so done, this Court finds:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 (cid:136) As in its earlier
version in Sec.3(f) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the RFCTLARR Act vide
Sec.2(1) also provides an inclusive definition of ‘public purpose’. What is made
obvious by the statute, such as where the acquisition by the Government for it to own,
hold and control, and the other categories which are listed in Sec.2(1)(a) to (f) hardly
requires any interpretation. What is not made obvious in the definition shall have to
be necessarily read into the word ‘includes’, provided that the object behind
acquisition is useful to the public as to constitute public purpose as has been
understood by the Courts.
(cid:136) An acquisition for establishing a memorial is not expressly enabled in the definition
of ‘public purpose’ as in Sec.2(1) of the Act. The Government now requires the court
to read it within the phrase that authorizes the ap- propriate Government to acquire
land “for its own use, hold and con- trol”, alongside Sec.2(1)(b)(vi) which inter alia
authorizes acquisition for promoting tourism.
(cid:136) The petitioners however, would contend that neither of the two situations can
accommodate an acquisition for establishing a memorial, and that,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 that which may
qualify to be read within the inclusive character of the definition – the not so
obviously stated heads in the list of public pur- poses, are those that share a common
character with any of those that are expressly stated. In other words, the intended
public purpose must have the features of infrastructural projects. The only support
they summoned to strengthen this argument is the Statement of Objects and Reason
and the Preamble of the Act.
30. This now raises two primary questions:
(cid:136) First, should the unsaid heads of acquisition which may be brought with-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 37
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
in word ‘includes’ in Sec.2(1) have for its object only infrastructure? (cid:136) Second, if the
first is decided against the petitioners, then to ascertain if there is a public purpose
involved in acquiring Veda Nilayam to consti- tute it into a memorial.
31.1 Turning to the first, this Court finds that Sec.2(1) does not stop with infra- structure projects
exclusively, but also allows for acquisition for other purposes https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 as well. The definition may not be as specific as it was in the Bill, but
this is what the legislature has presented the country with. The theme of acquisitions for purposes
which are not made evident by the definition clause therefore, can- not be restricted to
infrastructure alone, but it can be for diverse purposes. That is the legislative intent – to grant the
Government ample elbow room to operate, lest it would defeat the purpose of making the definition
inclusive. On this point, this Court is in agreement with the arguments of the learned Advocate
General.
31.2 The bottom-line is that the Government can acquire private property for any purpose of its
choice, provided the purpose is ‘useful to the public’. This is the key. This is the test. To state it
differently, as long as the purpose behind an acquisition is useful to the public, it can be read as
falling within the inclus- ive definition of Sec.2(1) of the Act. This leads to two questions:(a) Is an ac-
quisition for establishing a memorial useful to the public? And, (b) whether ac- quiring ‘Veda
Nilayam’ in particular for constituting it into a memorial for Ms.Jayalalitha, its former owner and
the former Chief Minister, is useful to the public.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
33. This immediately brings to fore the scope of judicial review of an adminis- trative decision to
acquire private lands.
Judicial Review and Public Purpose:
34.1 In Khudiram Das Vs State of West Bengal [(1975)2 SCC 81], it was held that there is nothing
like unfettered discretion immune from judicial re- viewability. The truth is that in a Government
governed by the rule of law, there can be no such thing as unreviewable discretion. The power of
eminent domain being statutory, it necessarily follows that the validity of its exercise is not immune
from judicial scrutiny under Article 226 of the Constitution. Way back in 1798, Justice Samuel
Chase famously declared in the case of Calder v Bull [3 US 386):
“An ACT of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law), contrary to the great first
principles of the social compact, cannot be considered a rightful exer- cise of the
legislative authority.” As an instance of such abuse, Chase, J cited the instance of the
legislature au- thorizing a law that takes property from A and gives it to B. Obviously,
such https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 laws served
no public use, vitiating the exercise of power. However, in United States v.
Gettysburg Electric Ry Co, [160 US 668 (1896)], Justice Rufus Peck- ham held that
when the legislature has declared the use or purpose to be a pub- lic one, its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 38
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
judgment will be respected by the courts, unless the use be palpably without
reasonable foundation. In Old Dominion v United States [(269 US 55 (1925)],
Holmes, J of the U.S Supreme Court went so far as to declare that the decision of the
Government on public purpose was entitled to deference unless it was shown to
involve an impossibility.
34.2 The test of “palpably without reasonable foundation” has been applied to examine the concept
of “public purpose” in India as well. See Sooraram Pra- tap Reddy v. Collector, [(2008) 9 SCC 552].
Turning to the scope of judicial review, the Courts in India have however, have not accorded
absolute discre- tion to the Government on the question of public purpose. The position is that the
view taken by the Government on what constitutes public purpose (in ac- quiring a land) will only be
a “prima facie one”, the ultimate arbiter will be the Courts. This is clear from the decision of a
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in State of Bombay v. R.S. Nanji, [1956 SCR 18], wherein
it was ob- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 served thus:
“Prima facie the Government is the best judge as to whether ‘public pur- pose’ is
served by issuing a requisition order, but it is not the sole judge. The courts have the
jurisdiction and it is their duty to determine the matter whenever a question is raised
whether a requisition order is or is not for a ‘public purpose.” To the same effect is
the decision in Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat [1995 Supp (1) SCC
596]. In Srinivasa Cooperative House Building Society Ltd. v. Madam Gurumurthy
Sastry, [(1994) 4 SCC 675], the Court ad- ded that the acquisition in question must
indicate that it was towards the wel- fare of the people and not to benefit a private
individual or group of individuals joined collectively. In Dev Sharan v. State of U.P.,
[(2011) 4 SCC 769], the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held:
“17. It must be accepted that in construing “public purpose”, a broad and overall view
has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest
number of people. Any attempt by the State to acquire land by promoting a public
purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at
the cost of the interest of a large sec- tion of people, especially of the common people,
defeats the very concept of public purpose. Even though the concept of public
purpose was introduced by preconstitutional legislation, its application must be
consistent with the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under fundamental rights and also the
directive principles.” In Menaka Gandhi Vs Union of India [AIR 1979 SC 597],
V.R.Krishna Iyer, J pointed out that the catch-all expression ‘public interest’ is
sometimes an easy temptation to cover up from the public that which they have right
to know, which appeals in the short run but avenges in the long run. Therein is
hidden the authority of the State to acquire private property in the guise of public
pur-
pose, which the Court ought to weigh in a particular case to ensure that it does not
avenge in the long run.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 39
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
35. To collate the factors which the judiciary has evolved to determine the scope of judicial review
vis-a-vis the public purpose behind an acquisition, the Government’s decision on what constitutes
public purpose is only a prima facie assessment, and it is not conclusive. Power of judicial review
has its own operational space and rules, within which every administrative action can be tested. This
undoubtedly enables the Court to scan the Government’s idea of a ‘public purpose’ which is readable
within the inclusive definition of Sec.2(1) and to ascertain that the stated public purpose is not a
mask for a malafide ac- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 quisition
which has for its intent only benefit for a particular group than public at large, or is plainly
irrational, unreasonable, or perverse, to borrow the Wed- nesbury principle as amounting to a fraud
on the statute. See: Sooraram Pratap Reddy v. Collector, [(2008) 9 SCC 552].
36. Every time an acquisition is challenged as a colourable exercise of statutory power, it pushes the
Court to shift its focus from merely scrutinizing the exist- ence of statutory power to acquire, but to
get into its deeper layers to ascertain if the object behind acquisition is useful to the public. This is
the distinctive line of demarcation that separates what the learned Advocate General has ar- gued
and what this Court proposes to do. To expatiate it, where the object be- hind an acquisition reflects,
without anything more, a public purpose, then the Court’s role is limited. However, the duty of the
Court may go beyond that to examine if the stated object of an acquisition leaves a larger question as
to the very existence of a public purpose. Precisely for this reason this Court may not concur with
the argument of the learned Advocate General that the Govern- ment’s declaration of ‘public
purpose’ is final and conclusive. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
37. Turning to the various authorities that were cited, the facts in Sooraram case [(2008)9 SCC 552]
involves a challenge to acquisition of land for a com- pany for establishing a leisure cum business
infrastructure for tourism, and the Court found that acquisition had for its purpose - developing
infrastructure. The usefulness to the public is inbuilt in the acquisition, as the facts of that case
reveal. In Daulat Singh Surana case [(2007) 1 SCC 641] , the acquisition was intended for
constructing an office cum residence of the Deputy Commissioner of Police at public expense. The
Court held that it involves a public purpose within the meaning of Sec.3(f) of the Land Acquisition
Act. Under the RFCTLARR Act, it will obviously fall under the category of acquisition that enables
the Government to own, hold and control the property acquired, and hence there will be least
difficulty in holding that the acquisition was for a pub- lic purpose. In Bajirao’s case [(1995)2 SCC
442] land was acquired for estab- lishing a road connecting Sai Mandir at Shirdi with ‘Dwaraka Mai
Mandir. And it requires no greater evidence to demonstrate public purpose than the fact that crores
of Sai devotees are actually using the said road. Acquisition of land for public purpose was,
therefore, written all over the project. In Scindia Em- ployees Union case [(1996)10 SCC 150] the
acquisition was intended for ex- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
pansion of the dockyard for defence purposes. Is there not a public purpose self evident in the very
project for which acquisition was made? It is in the context of the facts involved in each of these
cases that the Hon’ble Supreme Court has declared that the Government’s decision on what it
considers as public purpose cannot be second guessed in the judicial review. However, in none of
the cases, the Court has negated the power of judicial review over an Executive de- cision to acquire
private lands. The ratio of various authorities of the Hon’ble Supreme court are facts-specific, and
they do not advocate universal applica- tion dehors the facts involved in a particular case. Here, as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 40
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
elsewhere, we must remember the warning of the Lord Chancellor the Earl of Halsbury in Quinn Vs
Leatham [1901 AC 495]:
“Every judgement must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or
assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expression which may be found
there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified
by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. A case is
only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for
a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.”
38. The principles thus far made available in the test-kit of judicial review
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 evolved (See paragraph 35 above)
for evaluating the correctness of an adminis- trative action involved in land acquisition are not
exhaustive. They not only aid the Court in the review of the administrative actions, but also serve as
a useful guide to the Executive in demonstrating that its actions must not only be just, legal and fair,
but must also be seen to be so. Judicial review is an ‘agni pariksha’ for the Executive action, and it
gives constant opportunities as well as reminders for it to be clean, and to come clean before the
voting populace of this Republic. If the statement that the Courts are the sentinel on the qui vive is
valid in our Constitutional scheme of things, it leaves a prodding message to match its level of
creativity to the demands of changing times and circum- stances. The demand on judicial creativity
in responding to an Executive action is therefore, proportionate to the latter’s ability to
outmaneuver the Statute with the pretense of its compliance. Having stated thus, this Court is
equally con- scious that it must refrain from treading into domains where the Constitution has
created its own institutions of governance. Power of judicial review is no more than ascertaining if
the Executive actions conform to the Constitutional and/or statutory standards, and no more. The
discipline required in exercising the power of judicial review can be compared to the skill required in
playing an https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 out-swinger, bowled on
the length on the off stump on a grassy, bouncy track – the can’t-avoid-deliveries that feed
irresistible temptation to go for them. The Courts are often dragged to play them, and at times
cannot avoid playing them. How well it plays these balls – it deals with its power of judicial review,
will be the test of its character which gets converted into the scorecard of its perform- ance in the
functional audit by the citizens of this Country. These aspects will now guide this Court in scanning
if the acquisition for a memorial for Ms. Jay- alalithaa is useful to the public as has been believed
and projected by the Gov- ernment.
39.1 A memorial is constructed or constituted to retain the memory of a person or a thing, or an
event for the future generation. Can an acquisition for a me- morial qualify for it to be considered as
involving a public purpose within the statutory scheme of RFCTLARR Act? The answer can be a Yes
and No. Gen- erically it can be; but individually it need not be. It is not determined by a mere
intellectual exercise in statutory interpretation if a definition is an inclus- ive definition or in
ascertaining if a memorial can be brought within the elastic limits of an inclusive definition under
Sec2(1), or about the Government’s https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of
2020 power of acquisition, but by its organic content - its usefulness to the public. In other words,
the fact that the legislature has opted for an inclusive definition for ‘public purpose’ does not imply

anything that the Government terms as in- volving public purpose can be automatically brought
within the inclusive defin- ition. On the other hand, it has to satisfy the test of ‘usefulness to the
public’ for it to gain an entry within the definition.
39.2 A memorial is not a piece of structure, nor a monument, nor an art-exhibit for promoting
tourism, but is a symbolism of the principles that characterized the person for whom a memorial is
proposed. The criterion is to state the obvi- ous: There lived the person who will never return, yet
whose life is not re- moved, nor should ever be removed from public memory and social conscious-
ness. It is not dictated by professional achievements, political populism, an im- age carefully
groomed by cultivated charisma, electoral victories, but is defined by how dedicated the life has been
to the cause of, not a caste (or even anti- caste), or a political party, but to the society, to preserve
rights of its members, to conserve its culture and wealth in the spirit of Constitutional values. A life
that was must be the message it should leave. Its value must be measured by
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 the dedication and sacrifices made
- not in anticipation of any accolades or in expectation of an honour in the Ashoka hall of fame, but
in the realisation of one’s duty to the society. Memorials would then be erected for those lives, not
just in their honour but also as a reminder to inspire and motivate genera- tions of citizens.
40. In the context of reading an acquisition for a memorial within the inclusive definition in Sec.2(1)
of the Act, as already held that it will no more be a mat- ter for an unilateral declaration of the
Government, but is a matter for judicial review, more so when the acquisition faces an allegation of
colourable exercise of statutory power. If it is not, there is a grave risk of wasting public money on
erecting memorials for those whose life, taken wholly and not selectively, hardly has a message for
the public. As long as public money is involved, a scrutiny by the court to examine if a memorial
constitutes a public purpose can- not be avoided.
41.1 Support for the decision of the Government to constitute ‘Veda Nilayam’ into a memorial for
Ms.Jayalalithaa was sought to be drawn from the judgement https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kanaiyalal Maneklal Chinai Vs
State of Gujarat [(1969)(3) SCC 456]. The challenge in that case was to the acquisi- tion of a land at
the instance of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation for estab- lishing a memorial for Mahatma
Gandhi, not on the ground that establishing the memorial did not constitute a public purpose, but
on the ground of its legality - on the competency or the the power of the land acquiring authority to
invoke the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894. In its judgement the Hon’ble Su- preme Court
has observed:
“The land is needed for setting up a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi at a place
associated with him, and we regard, because of the universal venera- tion in which
the memory of Mahatma Gandhi is held in our country, that the purpose was a public
purpose.” 41.2 Is this not a statement on the quality of the man that Mohandas Kara-
mchand Gandhi was, that justified treating his memorial as one involving a public purpose? And, in
drawing strength from this passage, has not the Gov- ernment acknowledged that the benchmark for
establishing a memorial with public money can be justified only if the life and contribution of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 42
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
person for whom the memorial is proposed approximates the life of Gandhiji and those of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 his ilk?
42. When on a dark South African night a young M.K.Gandhi, the barrister, was thrown off the
train, he did not bite the incident as an insult personal to him, but allowed it to agonise his soul as it
was abhorrent to his perception and understanding of humanity. His consciousness was ignited and
so was his con- science. He used a racial slur to galvanize his inner energy and channelized it to bind
the nation together, to dare and shame the British imperialism. He rarely matched the looks of a
movie star to breed a fan-following, yet he ap- pears exemplarily handsome in the hearts of world
citizens for the conviction he held, for the methods he adopted, and the walk the talk he did.
Winston Churchill might have used his choicest expletive to term him a half naked fakir, but
Gandhiji along with his followers replied with his fortitude to frustrate the British. In serving the
nation he set himself no destination. He lived half na- ked, died half naked, earned nothing and gave
everything – his blood, sweat, toil and tears for the cause of the nation. His life is a story of
sacrifices. He has his critics, then and now, and his political philosophy and strategies are fre-
quently commented upon. That however, is the hallmark of a free society that
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 this country is, and has always
been. But they neither undermine nor discredit the sacrifices Gandhiji had made. Beyond the fame
and popularity he might have had in his time, the essential Mahatma is relevant even to this day. His
life indeed is his message. Can the immortality that the Mahatma has attained ever be compared
with the idolation of an orchestrated brigade of excited fol- lowers that one often witnesses?
43. Any memorial for Gandhiji and/or any of those who joined him with a sense of renunciation, is a
befitting tribute that the nation can give them. These me- morials will remind generations of our
countrymen that there lived these men, not as characters in fables or comics but in flesh and blood,
on the face of this country, for them to emulate. Is it not therefore necessary if the persons in whose
memory Government contemplates dedicating memorials, no matter how worshipful it may
consider that they are, meets this criteria? Is it not necessary for them to inform the people of this
country, and not just the members of the political party to which the leader belonged, that the life of
the leader indeed was a message: a life of sacrifices, integrity, fidelity to Constitutional ethos, to
state a few? It may now mean that any life in public life may deserve a memori-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 al at the cost of public money only
when it also has demonstrably dedicated it- self to the service of the society or even a section
thereof, but along the lines of the Constitutional values.
44. Reverting back to the core issue, is the decision of the Government to con- stitute the residence
of late Ms.Jayalalithaa as a memorial at the cost of public money useful to the public? The
popularity of the leader, or the respect a leader may have commanded, or the electoral successes
achieved by themselves may not be adequate, since their mechanics and dynamics are regulated by a
com- bination of complex-calculus of politico-social psychology and strategies. And, these factors
can only demonstrate prima facie, the value and indispensability of the leader to the political party
or any organisation to which the leader may belong. However, justification for acquisition of private
property in law is only based on its usefulness to the public at large, unrelated to the excitement or
sen- timents of the political party in power. Therefore, and to reiterate, when an ac- quisition is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 43
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
challenged as lacking a public purpose, its determination is not de- pendant exclusively on what the
Government states, but by the quality of mater- ial which the Government places before the Court to
demonstrate the existence https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 of a
public purpose. Has this been done in this case?
45. In contemporary times, where there is a perceptible depreciation of ethical standards and
corrosion of moral values which cumulatively leave their adverse impact on the Constitutional
responsibility and institutional integrity, there may not be too many leaders who may match the
standards of those who gave their lives for the cause of the nation or the humankind. In other words,
if a life of the leader has only a relative value to some and not to the substantial number, then there
is a risk of it becoming a memorial for a group of followers, and not the public, and may well fail in a
judicial review of an alleged colourable action of the Executive.
46. There is another fact, which was mildly touched in the affidavit of the petitioner but on which
not much argument was heard is that the Government indeed has built a memorial – an imposing
phoenix shaped one at the Marina beach, where Ms.Jayalalithaa was laid to rest. This was stated to
have been constructed at the cost of about Rs. 80.0 crores of public money. Its relevance in the
context cannot be ignored. This was challenged in a public interest https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 litigation before this Court in W.P 21701 of 2018. This decision was
defended by the Government of Tamil Nadu contending that the decision to erect a memorial for the
former Chief Minister was a policy decision. A Division Bench of this Court, vide its order dated
23.01.2019, dismissed the writ petition primarily on the ground that there was no challenge to the
clearances accorded/sanctioned for construction of the memorial. Nevertheless the Division Bench
did point out:
“32. It has become a practice rather a norm to build memorials in honour and
memory of former Chief Ministers and leaders of this Country and public money had
been spent for that purpose and the justification is that memorials/statutes would
remind the public about the contribution made by them towards the development of
the State/Country.
33. It is pertinent to note at this juncture that public money can be spent for
construction of hospitals, school, colleges, implementation of developmental projects
and provision of basic facilities/amenities to the citizens, in honour and memory of
great leaders and it would be an ever lasting memory in the mind of the
citizens/people. However, it is for the Government concerned to take a call and this
Court cannot issue any positive direction to do so.” (emphasis supplied) This order
was challenged in S.L.P (Civil) 7518 of 2019 before the Hon’ble
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 Supreme Court,
but was dismissed, in limine, vide an order dated 22.04.2019.
47.1 The Marina memorial does not involve any acquisition, but does it not inform that a memorial
indeed has come up for Ms.Jayalalithaa? ‘Veda Nilayam’ is only a few kilometers away from the
Phoenix-memorial. Is it not one memorial too many? What is the inspirational story that ‘Veda
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 44
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
Nilayam’ may provide which the Marina memorial does not? What then is the public purpose in
acquiring a private residence of the former Chief Minister? Beyond the smoke screen of ‘policy
decision’, and the Government’s (presumed) prerogative to attribute ‘public purpose’, this Court is
still searching for an answer. And, the fact that the notification for acquisition has been published a
couple of years before the Court had cleared the construction of the Marina memorial for the former
Chief Minister is immaterial, for what ultimately matters to this Court is defraying public money on
a second memorial for the same Chief Minister.
47.2 If the grounds which the Government speak through the affidavit of its bureaucrat, the District
Collector, (See: Paragraph No.7.2) for explaining the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 public purpose is filtered, they project certain personal traits of
Ms.Jayalalithaa, the respect she commanded etc., Elsewhere, the same Collector had addressed a
communication dated 07-07-2020 to the Director, Tamil Development & Information (Memorials),
(the circumstances under which this was written was not evident) it refers to certain welfare
measures when Ms. Jayalalithaa was heading the Government. This Court does not intend to engage
in a probe if the personal traits of a leader, or if the welfare measures introduced by the leader as the
Chief Minister are sufficient to justify expending public money for erecting a memorial. Are not
providing welfare measures without any personal gain is the duty of any Government? At any rate
are the reasons cited explain why there ought to be a second memorial for the same leader?
48. From time immemorial, mankind has demonstrated an indefatigable energy to erect
monuments to immortalise their dead. The Pyramids at Giza in Egypt built by the pharaohs or our
own Taj Mahal at Agra by the Emperor Shah Jahan for his Begum are apposite examples. But the
India of today is not a land of pharaohs or Emperors, but one which belongs to the people of this
country. The India of today is an India wedded to the ideals of Constitutionalism,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 Republicanism and the Rule of
law, and the Courts, as sentinels, must abjure any attempt by the political dispensation to keep alive
practices, which may have been readily acceptable in the by-gone times of the Rajas and the
Maharajas. It’s our 75th year of our independence and the 72nd year of our Constitution, but the
hangover of the past appears to stay with a section of our countrymen.
49. In a State where the substantial number of its populace are struggling for a dignified life under
the Constitution, for whom Part III and Part IV of the Constitution are yet to become relevant, the
Court may not remain insensitive and play Dhridarashtra when the Government decides to divert
crores of public money mindlessly. Has not the cry of the citizens reached the powers that be? The
Daridra Narayanas of this country are being promised El Dorado since independence. With no
intent to make a political statement, yet with no intent to blindfold itself to the reality around, it
must be told that the electoral processes this country witnesses have become a quinquennial revival
or renewal of these promises. This is not to discount the strident growth the country has seen in
multiple spheres, but it equally cannot be discounted that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 we have miles to go to see the smiles on the face of every citizen of
this country. The Court now pauses here to ponder on the following lines from the poem “The Poet
VIII” by Khalil Gibran:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 45
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
“Until when shall human beings honor the dead And forget the living, who spend
their lives Encircled in misery, and who consume themselves Like burning candles to
illuminate the way For the ignorant and lead them into the path of light?”
50. Public law is not driven by sentiments – be of the public or of the media, in- cluding the social
media. Nor its understanding and administration is con- trolled by the free speech of the informed
or the uninformed, as both are sus- ceptible to personal prejudice, and may be tainted by an
undisclosed motiva- tion. Courts, therefore, are not expected to trim their sails the way the societal
sentiments flow. They are there to assert their role to uphold the rule of law. It stands between the
leviathan State and the citizens, not with any presupposi- tion, but with a sense of duty to uphold
the rule of law - a sacrosanct Constitu- tional duty in that. The following words of Y.V. Chandrachud,
CJ in Mohd Ahmad Khan v Shah Bano [(1985) 2 SCC 556] are apt here:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 “Inevitably, the
role of the reformer has to be assumed by the courts be- cause, it is beyond the
endurance of sensitive minds to allow injustice to be suffered when it is so palpable.”
51.1 The public trust doctrine implies that the Governments in this democracy are the custodian of
public wealth and resources (including public money), which this country is blessed with, and that it
ought to manage them as a pru- dent manager of finances for public good. Fiscal prudence is the
soul of fiscal management and is inbuilt in the governance of public affairs. As a prudent manager of
public funds it is the duty of the Government to deploy public mon- ey where the investment fetches
tangible returns to the public at large. It in- cludes welfare measures for the public, such as health,
education, housing, transportation, and the list is endless, and also expenditure necessary for the
preservation and protection of our public and Constitutional institutions that serve the public. But
the basic criterion is that the public expenditure by a Government must be measurable in terms of
the benefit it generates for the public. Fiscal indiscipline, with no care to go for a cost-benefit
analysis to demonstrate the existence of a public purpose, will be a painful betrayal of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 Constitutional faith, which every
Government, conscious of its Constitutional duty to govern with a sense of commitment to its
people, should refrain from. 51.2 Here it is not out of place to refer to Article 282 of the Constitution,
which enables the Union and the States to make grants irrespective of whether the subject-matter of
the purpose falls in the Seventh Schedule, provided that it is for a “public purpose”. The bottom line
is that all expenditures by the Governments are permitted, be it statutory or otherwise, only if there
is a larger public purpose to support it. In Bhim Singh v Union of India [(2010) 5 SCC 538], a
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the transfer of funds under Article 282 to the
MPLAD scheme on the ground that the scheme furthered the objectives underlying the directive
principles of State policy enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution. In other words, the Court tested
the considerations of "public purpose" from the standpoint of Part IV of the Constitution. Even so,
the Court clarified that judicial interference was possible where the action complained of was
unconstitutional, meaning thereby, that where the requirement of public purpose, which
circumscribes the wide powers under Article 282 was absent, the Court was not powerless to
interfere. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 46
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
52. In Common Cause v. Union of India, [(2015) 7 SCC 1], the Hon‘ble Supreme Court has held:
“7. In the earlier order dated 23-4-2014 [Common Cause v. Union of India, (2014) 6
SCC 552] , this Court, after holding that reasonableness and fairness consistent with
Article 14 of the Constitution would be the ultimate test of all State activities
proceeded to hold that the deployment of public funds in any government activity
which is not connected with a public purpose would justify judicial intervention. We
would like to say something more.
9. Articles 38 and 39 of the Constitution enjoin upon the State a duty to consistently
endeavour to achieve social and economic justice to the tee-
ming millions of the country who even today live behind an artificially drawn poverty line. What can
be the surer way in the march forward than by ensuring avoidance of unproductive expenditure of
public funds.” The context in that case was different, but the content of what is stated is appo- site.
Thus in all cases, where the public purpose is not so evident and becomes a subject matter of a
judicial review, then it becomes necessary for the Govern- ment to demonstrate that the intended
object of acquisition is useful to the pub- lic and to justify the public expenditure involved in it, lest
it would be, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, a wasteful expenditure.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
53. In Rajeev Suri Vs Delhi Developmental Authority [2021 SCC Online SC 7] (popularly known as
the Central Vista case), the Hon’ble Supreme Court emphasised the need for judicial scrutiny to
ensure that public resources, in- cluding public funds, are aligned in the direction of beneficial use
in public in- terest. The Court held:
“What emerges from the above discussion is that for proving a viola- tion of public
trust, it falls upon the petitioners to establish that public resources are being
squandered and used or planned to be used in a manner which cannot be termed as
beneficial public use. The Court would look for an actual deprivation of public’s right
over common resources. As for the respondents, it falls upon them to establish that
the proposed use of public resources is aligned in the direction of ben- eficial use and
in public interest. In the present case, the respondents have elaborately
demonstrated the imminent need for the project.”
54. The march of law on judicial review has silently upgraded its forensic kit to include a search for a
relationship between the public expenditure and public benefit while reviewing if the public trust
doctrine has been breached. Contex- tually, it may mean that in all cases of judicial review of an
acquisition of prop- erty in which the alleged ‘public purpose’ is not so evident, or is questionable
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 and debatable, it makes sense for
the Court to ascertain if there exists a cost - benefit relationship between the cost of acquisition and
the intended good for the public. The Court may not seek proportionality of the benefit to the cost
in- volved (lest it may become a super Government), still the cost-benefit nexus has to demonstrated
by the Government prima facie to justify acquisition. There is however, a flip side to the application
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 47
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
of this principle. If care in ap- plying it is compromised, then it may tempt the Court to overreach
the scope of its power to unwittingly review the policy decisions of the Government and its power of
fiscal management. That is a prohibited area. Hence despite its ob- jectivity, and utility, cost-benefit
analysis has its perils if it is treated as a for- mula of general application in judicial review, but can
be a tool of great objec- tivity otherwise.
55. In the Central Vista case, the Government was able to demonstrate the public expenditure –
public benefit nexus, to justify the expenditure involved in the project. But in this case, where the
public purpose involved in the acquisi- tion is not self-evident, and is debatable in law, the
Government has not trav- elled enough to convince this Court that the cost of acquisition of ‘Veda
Ni- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 layam’ bears a nexus to the
public benefit to flow out of it. There is not even an attempt to explain the nature of public purpose
or how the public at large would benefit by the acquisition. The public trust doctrine apparently
stands grossly breached.
56. Somewhere in the course of his arguments, the learned Advocate General has listed the instances
where residences of leaders or other preeminent persons have been converted into memorials. It is
not adequately known whether those properties were acquired, or if the court was called upon to
decide if they in- volved any public purpose within the scheme of the statute. Secondly, they are
examples merely and hence these instances by themselves cannot be adequate to justify particular
acquisition of ‘Veda Nilayam’. And, thirdly, and as outlined earlier, India of today is not the Raj of
the yesteryear for its administrators to bask under a fallacy that the wealth of the State is the wealth
of the ruler. No, it is the wealth of the ruled – The People. It is time that the Governments have
accustomed themselves to this Constitutional reality.
57. In the final analysis, this Court is left with little option than to hold that ac-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 quisition of ‘Veda Nilayam’ cannot
be said to involve a ‘public purpose’ in law. The acquisition fails. The fact that an award has been
passed is of no con- sequence. And, the fact that a formal inauguration of Veda Nilayam – the
Memorial on 28-01-2021, Vide Orders of this Court in dated 27-01-2017 is equally of no
consequence.
PART III PROCEDURAL LAPSES
58. The results are known, but the game is not yet over. The petitioners have listed a few procedural
lapses, which according to them, can reach them ashore on their own strength. Of them, two stands
out, and the discussion will be con- fined to them. They are:
(a) That Social Impact Assessment is a farce. The appointment of the SIA Agency and
the technical expert in the SIA Committee were not in con-
formity with the Rules.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 48
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
(b) No notices issued at any stage of the acquisition, and hence procedural fairness was breached
besides violation of principles of natural justice. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020
59. A short introduction to the scheme of RFCTLARR Act and the Rules framed thereunder may be
of assistance in appreciating this part:
(cid:136) Broadly, when the Government proposes to acquire land, the process is initiated
with a preliminary public notification. Under the Land Acquisi- tion Act, 1894, Sec.4
thereof covered it, while in the RCFTLARR Act it is provided in Sec.11. Where
however, the RCTFLARR Act differs from its predecessor enactment is that under the
present Act, there are certain statutorily prescribed preparatory functions or duties
that ought to pre- cede the preliminary notification. They involve a Social Impact
Assess- ment study, evaluating Rehabilitation and Re-settlement package for those
who might be affected by the acquisition, constitution of authori- ties for discharging
these preparatory responsibilities etc. Besides, there is an Expert Committee which
the Government ought to constitute under the Act, for evaluating the reports of the
previously mentioned Commit- tees constituted for the SIA study and the
Rehabilitation and Resettle- ment proposals. Once the Expert Committee gives its
concurrence and clears the proposal for acquisition, the process would go to the stage
of issuing preliminary notification under Sec.11. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 (cid:136) Sec.11(1) does not stipulate that personal or
individual notices should be issued to those who are interested in the property
notified for acquisition. A public notice through dailies is statutorily sufficient. Here
it is worth noting that the first proviso to Sec.11(4) provides that a owner of the
property on application can obtain exemption of the property from acquisition.
(cid:136) Under Sec.15, any person interested in the land may object to the prelim-
inary notification and the Land Acquisition Authority is required to en- quire into it.
(cid:136) Once the preliminary notification under Sec.11 is issued, even as the per-
sons interested in the property might raise their objection under Sec.15, the Land
Acquisition Authority might proceed to the next stage of enter- ing the property in
terms of Sec.12 for surveying and identifying the property proposed to be acquired by
their boundaries, and collecting ma- terials/information that may be relevant for
taking a final decision on the acquisition. Here, again the proviso to Sec.12 mandates
that the Appro- priate Government shall not step in to the property in the absence of
the owner and without giving him/her 60 days notice to grant the owner an
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 opportunity of
being present during inspection. (cid:136) If the Statutory scheme thus far discussed is
carefully analysed, it makes evident that the scheme of the statute makes a
perceptible distinction be- tween the owner of the property and the person interested.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 49
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
While a land owner of a property is defined in Sec 3(r), a ‘person interested’ is
defined under Sec.3(x) of the Act. Going by the definition, Sec.3(r) is an inclu- sive
definition, whereas Sec.3(x) has a restricted definition. These are now extracted:
Section Definition
3(r) "land owner" includes any person :-
i. whose name is recorded as the owner of the
land or building or part thereof, inthe records of the authority concerned; or ii. any
person who is granted forest rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional
Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (2 of 2007) or under any
other law for the time being in force; or iii. who is entitled to be granted patta rights
on the land under any law of the State including assigned lands; or iv. any person
who has been declared as such by an order of the Court or Authority;
3(x) "person interested" means :-
i. all persons claiming an interest in compensa- tion to be made on account of the
acquisition of land under this Act;
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
Section Definition
ii. the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers, who have lost any forest
rights recognized under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers
(Re-
cognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (2 of 2007);
iii. a person interested in an easement affecting the land;
iv. persons having tenancy rights under the rel-
evant State laws including share-croppers by whatever name they may be called; and v. any persons
whose primary source of liveli-
hood is likely to be adversely affected;
All the owners of property therefore are ‘person interested’, but the converse is not true. This
distinction has a relevance as would be seen later.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 50
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
(cid:136) Once hearing on the objections of the ‘persons interested’ is completed under Sec.15, and if the
Appropriate-Government does not find materials to drop the acquisition based on those objections,
then, it may proceed to make a declaration under Sec.19 of its need to acquire the land for a pub- lic
purpose along with a declaration on resettlement of those who would be displaced by the
acquisition. This is followed by a public notice un- der Sec.21 for taking possession of the property
and for passing an award.

60. Going by a strict construction of the statute, except under the proviso to Sec.12, there is no
express provision that mandates issuance of personal/indi- vidual notice to the owner of the
property at any of the stages of the acquisition. The Act indeed is silent on it. And, this court is aware
that in all cases where an acquisition is under challenge, it is not just dealing with the civil rights of
the citizen, but the Constitutional right to property with a potential possibility of impacting the
fundamental right to life of the person interested (which in- cludes the owner) under Article 21.
61. This is the statutory setting in which petitioners’ allegations of procedural lapses/violations
would be tested. Their allegations can be divided into three parts: First, that pertains to
appointment or constitution of various authorities such as the Social Impact Agency, or constituting
the District Collector, Chen- nai as the Appropriate-Government for purposes associated with the
RFCT- LARR Act, and the latter’s power of delegation of his authority to the Revenue Divisional
Authority. Second, that which relates to SIA and Rehabilitation and Resettlement package, where
the petitioners allege that the authorities do not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020 strictly adhere to the statutory command. Lastly, to the issue of notices – or,
non-issue of notices & fairness of procedure. Of them this Court will focus only on the last two, and
they will be now considered in the same order.
(a) Social Impact Assessment and Rehabilitation & Resettlement:
62. Though both sides strenuously argued this aspect, for the reasons to be dis- closed shortly, this
Court does not propose to stay on this point for long.
● A close reading of Sec.4 to Sec.6 of the RFCTLARR Act informs that a Social Impact Assessment is
required where a proposed acquisition for advancing an intended public purpose impacts a large
section of the lo- cality where the lands are acquired, or where the project is proposed. And,
rehabilitation and resettlement is required only where the acquisi- tion involves displacement of
families of ‘persons interested’ in the prop- erty acquired including that of its owners.
● So far as the acquisition of ‘Veda Nilayam’ is concerned, this a residen-
tial building in a residential area, and it has been there for long. And, as on the date of preliminary
notification it was unoccupied. This implies, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 &
10135 of 2020 the continued existence of this residential property for a purpose which the
Government has contemplated would only involve transfer of owner- ship merely – transfer from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 51
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
the owner of the property to the Government by a statutory process. And the purpose for which it
was acquired in- volves only a change of user of the building – from a residence to a memorial. A
forced transfer of ownership of an existing building hardly can impact the Society, which in the
context must be read as the inhabi- tants of Poes Garden.
● Hypothetically what if Ms. Jayalalithaa herself had executed a Will, or constituted a Trust during
her life time, donating her residence to the Government either for her memorial, or for any public
charity of her choice? (The Government is informed in this mode there is no public money involved)
And, how is this situation different when the Govern- ment acquires the same building? The second
part is about change of user from a residential purpose to a memorial. This change of user of an
existing building at the best may fall within the domain of Town Plan- ning Authority, but at no time
it requires a Social Impact Assessment study. And, inasmuch as none are displaced by the
acquisition there is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 hardly any
need for providing a resettlement & rehabilitation package. To explain it, even though title or
ownership of ‘Veda Nilayam’ had vest- ed in Deepak and Deepa as Class II heirs of late Jayalalithaa
(See Section B, Part I of this order), they are not in actual physical possession of the property.
Rehabilitation and Resettlement under the RFCTLARR Act contemplates actual physical
displacement of those who are affected by the acquisition, and it will be illogical to extend this to all
cases of ac- quisition.
63. There is little to doubt the settled proposition that when law prescribes mode of doing an act,
then it shall be done in the manner prescribed and no oth- er. The question is, where will the
provision have application? Hence, where there is no need for its application, or where the
application is rendered mean- ingless and fails to stand the scrutiny of common sense, the
procedural pre- scription does permit deviation. Therefore, to probe into the legitimacy of the SIA
Agency constituted or into the correctness of the SIA study themselves are irrelevant. And, the
Government scores a few consolation points here. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285
& 10135 of 2020
(b) Non Issue of Notices & Fairness in procedure:
64. The statutory analysis which this Court has undertaken in paragraph 61 does reveal that except
at the solitary stage of entering the property proposed to be acquired by the Authorities for
surveying etc., under Sec.12, no where the Act has positively stipulated issuance of notices to the
land owner. After all with or without individual notices, Deepak mostly, and Deepa a couple of times
have registered their objections to the intent of the Government to acquire ‘Veda Nilayam’. And,
they have been considered by the Land Acquisition Officer even though were not in their favour.
Having stated thus, it may also have to be recorded that there appears to be a conscious move by
those in charge of acquisition proceedings to drive the ‘land owner’ to a statutory-re- dundancy. This
is first reflected in the stance taken in the counter of the Dis- trict Collector where it was asserted
that the petitioners are not the owners of Veda Nilayam, and that they are only ‘persons interested’
under Sec.3(x) of the Act.

J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
65.1 Irrespective of whether any notices were statutorily required to be issued or not, this Court
witnesses a few startling aspects in the procedure adopted, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 which it will struggle to ignore unless its conscience is
compromised:
(cid:136) The facts tabulated in paragraph 5 shows that on 25.06.2019, the Gov-
ernment has published the preliminary notification under Sec.11 of the RFCTLARR
Act read with Rule 13 of the TN-RFCTLARR Rules, 2017 in Form-IV. In column 8,
the name and address of the ‘persons interest- ed’ is required to be notified and
column 9 is intended for recording the name of the registered holder. Interestingly, if
not shockingly, in col- umn 8 of Form-IV of the instant case, it is recorded that the
heirs of the registered holder are ‘yet to be ascertained’. This is followed by another
notification under Sec.11(5) r/w. Rule 14(1) in Form-V, where under, ob- jections to
the preliminary notification were invited. In column 5 of Form-V, the name and
address of the person interested / registered owner have to be entered. Here again
the authorities have recorded that “the legal heir are yet to be ascertained”. The final
declaration of acquisi- tion dated 03.02.2020 under Sec.19 in Form-VI also carries
the same for- ward.
(cid:136) The deceased is no ordinary person. She was Ms.Jayalalithaa, a one
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 time matinee idol,
who entered politics to slowly graduate to become the Chief Minister of the State, and
indeed held that office for three terms. And, she passed away when she was still the
Chief Minister. It needs no reminder that the Government that was in power at the
relevant time when the acquisition of Veda Nilayam was initiated was the very Gov-
ernment that she had left as a legacy for the MLAs of the very political party whose
affairs she presided. The world has always known that she was a spinster, and that
there was no direct lineal descendants for her. And, she was given a State funeral and
her last rites were performed by Deepak, one of the petitioners herein. Is this not a
tacit acknowledg- ment by the political party that was then in power that Deepak was
her heir? Still, when Deepak approached the Tahsildar, a lower rung offi- cial in the
bureaucratic set up for the issuance of a legal heir certificate, the latter refused to
issue it vide his proceedings dated 22.09.2017, and directed him to approach the
Court. It may be amusing to know that one of the reasons why he refused the legal
heirship certificate was that Deepak had not produced the death certificate of late
Jayalalithaa !! The amusement is more if it is seen in the context of the counter of the
Dis- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 trict Collector
in defense of the acquisition as extracted in paragraph 7.2 above. Now, irrespective of
whether a legal heir certificate issued by a Tahsildar has any conclusive significance
for deciding the heir-ship of a person, and notwithstanding the fact that there was
none to dispute the status of Deepak and Deepa, the Tahsildar had chosen to reject it.
Was the Tahsildar laboring under a misconception? That seems unlikely since the
power of the Tahsildar to hold an enquiry and issue a legal heir cer- tificate to Class II
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 53
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
legal heirs is covered by several judgments of this Court. See: M Arumugam v
Tahsildar, Madurai [2013 CDJ MHC 6017], N.R Raja v Tahsildar, Madurai [WP MD
15901 of 2018], T.S Renuka Devi v Tahsildar [W.P MD 37214 of 2015], R. Lokesh
Kannan v District Collector [WP MD 5586 of 2017], Sudalaimuthu v The Dis- trict
Collector [W.P MD 16708 of 2018] and Indrani Palaniappan v The Tahsildar [W.P
35263 of 2019]. This Court does not want to read too much into it, or rather intends
to give the benefit of doubt to the Tah- sildar concerned presently.
(cid:136) Be that as it may, within about two weeks of Tahasildar’s proceedings,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 on 09-10-2017, a
certain Pugazhethi in the company of another Janakira- man, both claiming to be the
members of the ruling political party, ap- proached this Court and applied for LoA to
administer the estate of late Ms. Jayalalithaa, in O.P.D.No.35654 of 2017. This
petition was not taken on to the file of this Court as a learned Single Judge of this
Court rejected it on a point of maintainability. But these party-men would per- sist
with their claim for LoA, as they would now challenge this order in OSA 445 of 2018
before the Division Bench. It is extremely suspicious that these men, whose inner
party status was no more than party workers, would have filed these proceedings on
their own accord. Has not the Government considered it necessary not to take notice
it? Does it require a Sherlock Homian intelligence to unravel any breathtaking
mystery? Plainly not, for it is an easy pick from a comics: create a roadblock for the
petitioners in asserting their ownership over the property, and exploit the judicial
process to accomplish it. If the Tahsildar’s decision to reject the legal heir certificate
to Deepak is now fitted in the context, the nee- dle of suspicion naturally starts tilting
towards the motives of the Gov- ernment. Is this the opening chapter of what may be
considered as a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
poorly drafted game-plan?
65.2 Let the facts be sequentially arranged to obtain greater clarity about the
suspected strategy:
(cid:136) On 16.08.2017, Deepak had moved the Tahsildar for grant of legal heir certificate
for him and Deepa. On the next day, on 17.08.2017, the Chief Minister makes a
statement on the floor of the House of the Government’s intention to convert ‘Veda
Nilayam’ into a memorial for the late Ms.Jayalalithaa. On 22.09.2017, the Tahsildar
rejected Deepak’s request for a legal heir certificate. On 09-10-2017, two party-men
suddenly spring up from nowhere and approach this Court for grant of LoA. And, no
sooner than the rejection of Deepak’s request by the Tahsildar, on 05.10.2017,
G.O.Ms.No.180 was issued in a tearing hurry, granting ad-
ministrative sanction for the project. Is it a repeat of ‘Solomon Grundy’..? Where do these facts lead
one to, and what for? Now comes the set of notifications/notices for acquisition, from the
preliminary noti- fication under Sec.11 to final declaration of acquisition under Sec.19, in Forms IV,
V & VI, in all of which, the authority concerned maintained https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 54
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 that the heirs of Ms. Jayalalithaa were yet to be ascertained. (cid:136) When
Deepak was denied the legal heir certificate he was forced to move this Court in OP.No.630 of 2018
for obtaining LoA and were tied to a legal process. This litigation was unnecessary in law if only the
Govern- ment had acknowledged the petitioners as Class II heirs of Ms.Jayalalithaa. But, they found
themselves stranded between a pro- ceeding before the Court and the acquisition of Veda Nilayam.
Has not this situation now enhanced the probability of a hassle-free acquisition as the petitioners
are deflected off their course? If this inference is wrong, then what other inferences of better and
different quality is possible from the course of events that the unassailable documents project? The
state- ments in Forms IV, V and VI that the heirs of late Jayalalithaa cannot be considered innocent
statements and must be read in the context of what has been narrated herein above. Quo vadis
fairness?
66. Relying on the decision in State of U.P. Vs Keshav Prasad Singh [(1995) 5 SCC 587], the learned
Advocate General argued that where there is a public https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 purpose, the Government has the power to acquire even disputed
land. Indis- putably it can, but in the instant case where is the dispute and who disputed it? What is
on view, is that other than the Government or its officials and the plant- ed party-men there were
none to dispute the title of the petitioners to Veda Nilayam?
67. The maneuvers adopted have not without their ramification on the rights of the petitioners,
which, to re-emphasis, is not a Constitutional right merely, but is a fundamental right to life:
(cid:136) Under proviso to Sec.11(4) of the RFCTLARR Act, when a preliminary notification
for acquisition is published under Sec.11(1), a land owner of a notified land has the
right to apply to the District Collector to seek ex- emption of the land from
acquisition. This right is personal to the land owner and accrues only after the
preliminary notification. The District Collector may have the power to reject it, but
the right to apply for ex- emption is statutorily provided, and it cannot be denied. In
the instant case this is denied to the petitioners. The Government might have mis-
conceived or let itself to be misled into believing that the petitioners
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 might not have
been the land owners within the meaning of Sec.3(r) of the Act or might have chosen
to be indifferent to the rights of a land owner under the RFCTLARR Act, but it is a
chance that it has taken in law, and in an adjudicatory process by the Court it will not
be taken lightly.
(cid:136) The other aspect is about the power of the Appropriate Government under Sec.12 of
the Act to enter the property proposed to be acquired for surveying etc. The proviso
to it provides that it should be done in the presence of the land owner to procure
whom it mandates that 60 days notice should be given to the land owners. Here again
in treating the pe- titioners not as land owners, was there an attempt to treat Veda
Ni- layam as nobody’s property? The worse is yet to come. An Ordinance thereafter
came to be promulgated inter alia for taking control of the movables and other
valuables in Veda Nilayam, and the Government through its officials has entered the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 55
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
building and claims to have taken an inventory of the articles, again in the absence of
the owners. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020
68. Procedural compliance is not a facade or a mask for emasculating procedu- ral fairness. In State
of Orissa v. Mamata Mohanty, [(2011) 3 SCC 436], the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held:
“The rule of law inhibits arbitrary action and also makes it liable to be invalidated.
Every action of the State or its instrumentalities should not only be fair, legitimate
and above board but should be without any affection or aversion. It should neither be
suggestive of discrimination nor even give an impression of bias, favouritism and
nepotism. Procedural fairness is an implied mandatory requirement to protect
against arbitrary action where statute confers wide power coupled with wide
discretion on an authority. If the procedure adopted by an authority offends the
fundamental fairness or established ethos or shocks the conscience, the order stands
vitiated. The decision-making process remains bad.
In Manoj Narula v. Union of India, [(2014) 9 SCC 1], it was pointed out by a
Constitution Bench of the Hon‘ble Supreme Court observed:
“...The faith of the people is embedded in the root of the idea of good gover- nance
which means reverence for citizenry rights, respect for fundamental rights and
statutory rights in any governmental action, deference for unwritten constitutional
values, veneration for institutional integrity, and inculcation of accountability to the
collective at large. It also conveys that the decisions are taken by the decision-making
authority with solemn sincerity and policies are framed keeping in view the welfare of
the people, and including all in a homo- geneous compartment. The concept of good
governance is not a Utopian con- ception or an abstraction. It has been the demand
of the polity wherever demo-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 cracy is nourished.
The growth of democracy is dependent upon good gover- nance in reality and the
aspiration of the people basically is that the adminis- tration is carried out by people
with responsibility with service orientation.” What is, therefore, strikingly apparent
from the aforesaid narrative is that the acquisition proceeding should be even
remotely seen as a fiat accompli that it scuttles the possible claims of the land owners.
See: Nareshbhai Bhagubhai v Union of India, [(2019) 15 SCC 1]. It is, therefore,
obvious that the State has lot to explain the way it handled the procedure in the
instant case, and if it was fair and reasonable in procedural compliance mandated by
the statute. In Vidya Devi Vs State of H.P., [(2020 2 SCC 569], the Hon‘ble Supreme
Court held:
“12.9. In a democratic polity governed by the rule of law, the State could not have
deprived a citizen of their property without the sanction of law. Reliance is placed on
the judgment of this Court in Tukaram Kana Joshi v. MIDC [(2013) 1 SCC 353 :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173540800/ 56
J.Deepak vs The Secretary To Government on 24 November, 2021
(2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 491] wherein it was held that the State must comply with the
procedure for acquisition, requisi- tion, or any other permissible statutory mode. The
State being a welfare State governed by the rule of law cannot arrogate to itself a
status beyond what is provided by the Constitution.
12.10. This Court in State of Haryana v.Mukesh Kumar [(2011) 10 SCC 404 : (2012) 3
SCC (Civ) 769] held that the right to property is now con-
sidered to be not only a constitutional or statutory right, but also a human
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 right. Human rights have been
considered in the realm of individual rights such as right to shelter, livelihood, health, employment,
etc. Human rights have gained a multi-faceted dimension.”
69. Respect for the statute – its spirit and the soul, and the concern for the rights of the citizens are
inalienable facets of Executive fairness, but in the acquisition of Veda Nilayam they are sacrificed.
Keenness of the political parties in power to honour their leaders is understandable, but in the
present case it appears to have gone awry when it failed to distinguish political leadership from
owner- ship over the property. Excitement can be a killer, and in the instant case it does not
appeared to have spared even the Government and its machinery. When there is a rule book in
place, why should there be a clamour for doing the same thing differently? Assuming there is a
public purpose (which this Court has already held in Part II that there is none), it needs to be said
that the meth- ods adopted for acquisition are hardly appreciable. Legitimacy of power not backed
by legitimate means of exercise can hardly be sustained in public law. The sequitur is that the
acquisition of Veda Nilayam fails on yet another ground.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.9285 & 10135 of 2020 On the course to conclusion:
70. On 27-01-2020, this Court had by an interim order allowed a formal inau- guration of Veda
Nilayam as a memorial for Ms. Jayalalithaa. This Court how- ever, restrained the Government from
opening the doors of the building. It also directed the District Collector, Chennai, to hand over the
keys of the building to the Registrar General. This Order was challenged by the Government before
the First Bench of this court in W.A.348 to 350 of 2021. The Hon’ble Division Bench has modified
the order of this Court only to a limited extent when it per- mitted the District Collector to retain the
keys of Veda Nilayam. The rele- vance of introducing this fact has significance in the concluding
paragraph of this order.
The Verdict:
71. When the acquisition goes, the award passed by the Land Acquisition Au- thority goes with it.
Consequently, the status quo ante has to be restored. Ac- cordingly, this Court passes the following
order:
(a) All the three writ petitions are allowed. This Court sets aside the notices in
No.A1/3476/2018 Form-IV dated 25.06.2019, Notice A1/3496/2018

(b) The compensation amount which the Government has deposited in the Court pursuant to the
award is liable to be returned with all accrued interest to the Government.
(c) The District Collector, Chennai, in whose custody the keys of ‘Veda Nilayam’ is, is directed to
hand them over to the petitioners within a period of three weeks from the date of the receipt of copy
of the order, which includes a Web copy of the Order.
(d) The Income Tax Department (6th respondent in W.P.10135 of 2020) is free to proceed for

law.
(e) Consequently connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. No costs. Note: This Court has taken
