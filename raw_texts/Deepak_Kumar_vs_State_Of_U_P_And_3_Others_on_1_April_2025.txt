4. This is a second bail application. The first bail application of the applicant was rejected vide order
dated 28.10.2023 passed by this Court passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.45338 of 2023.
5. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that he does not intend to file response to the counter
affidavit of the first informant. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the applicant has been
falsely implicated in the present case. It is argued that since the victim has in the FIR stated that she
has lodged the FIR after she came to know that the applicant has married to some other girl on
25.11.2022 and previously on a pretext to marry her and after getting employment there was
physical relationship between them would not amount to rape but the initiation of the present case
would be an act of revenge. It is argued that the victim was examined as P.W.1 before the trial court
who in great detail was cross-examined and there are contradictions in her statement and she states
that her maternal grandmother (nani) got her age entered in the school records which was incorrect.
It is argued that the victim had lodged the FIR at a point of time when she was mentally not in a fit
condition and looking to the same the implication of the applicant in the present case is false. It has
also been pointed out that the applicant is not having any criminal history as stated in para 31 of the
affidavit and is in jail since 25.8.2023.
6. Per contra learned counsel for the first informant and learned counsel for the State vehemently
opposed the prayer for bail and argued that the first bail application of the applicant was rejected by
this Court on merits. The victim was minor at the time of incident. It is argued that the present case
is a case of rape in which trial has started and the testimony of witnesses are being recorded. It is
argued that the victim while being examined as P.W.1 before the trial court has supported the
prosecution case and since the victim has supported the prosecution case before the trial court also
the appreciation of her evidence is for the trial court to do at the appropriate stage, as such bail
application of the applicant be rejected.
7. After hearing the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it is evident that the first bail
application of the applicant was rejected by this Court vide order dated 28.10.2023, the said order
reads as under:-
"1. List revised.
2. Sri Dewarshi Kumar Rai, Advocate states that he has filed his vakalatnama in the

5. This bail application under Section 439 of Code of Criminal Procedure has been
filed by the applicant-Deepak Kumar, seeking enlargement on bail during trial in
connection with Case Crime No.31 of 2023, under Sections 376, 506 IPC and 3/4
POCSO Act, registered at Police Station Kalyanpur, District Kanpur Nagar.
6. The FIR of the matter was lodged on 27.1.2023 by the victim herself against the
applicant alleging therein that he had allured her on promise to marry after getting
employment and committed rape upon her since the year 2017. In the year 2018, he
got employment in the police department after which he was asked by her to marry to
which he started avoiding it. She has come to know that the applicant has married to
some other girl on 25.11.2022. The FIR be thus lodged.
7. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the applicant has been falsely
implicated in the present case. It is argued that the FIR was lodged under Sections
376, 506 IPC and 3/4 POCSO Act in spite of the fact that the victim had disclosed her
age to be 21 years therein. While placing para no.13 of the affidavit, it is argued that
as a matter of fact Nisha Devi and the victim were friends and are relatives studying
in the same class. Nisha Devi was having friendship with the applicant before her
marriage and she has married with the applicant and when the victim got annoyed of
the marriage with Nisha Devi, she has lodged present FIR. It is argued that the
applicant during the period of investigation challenged the FIR along with prayer for
staying of arrest before this Court in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.2402 of 2023
(Deepak Kumar Vs. State of U.P. and 2 others) in which Division Bench of this Court
vide order dated 13.02.2023 directed that the applicant shall not be arrested till the
next date of listing or till submission of police report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C.,
copy of the same is annexed as Annexure No.6 to the affidavit filed in support of bail
application. It is argued that the victim as per her High School Certificate is having
her date of birth 15.09.2001 and as such she is aged about 21 years and a major. It
has also been pointed out that the applicant is not having any criminal history as
stated in para 18 of the affidavit and is in jail since 25.8.2023.
8. Per contra learned counsel for the first informant and learned counsel for the State
vehemently opposed the prayer for bail and argued that the victim at the time of
incident i.e. in the year 2017 was aged about 16 years and was a minor. It is argued
that the applicant is named in the FIR, in the statement of the victim recorded under
Sections 161 Cr.P.C. and 164 Cr.P.C and role has been assigned to him. The applicant
had assaulted the victim and her family members regarding which a FIR was lodged
as Case Crime No.388 of 2023 under Sections 147, 323, 506 IPC, Police Station
Kalyanpur, District Kanpur Nagar by the victim herself. The applicant had challenged
the proceedings of the present case after submission of charge sheet and cognizance
but the said petition was dismissed vide order dated 10.8.2023 passed in Application
U/S 482 No.29317 of 2023 (Deepak Kumar Vs. State of U.P. and another) passed by
coordinate Bench of this Court, copy of the said order has been produced by learned
counsel for the applicant, the same is taken on record.

9. After hearing the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it is evident that
the victim at the time of incident was a minor girl. The applicant is named in the FIR,
in the statement of the victim recorded under Sections 161 Cr.P.C. and 164 Cr.P.C and
role has been assigned to him. The applicant is employed in the police department as
such there are good chances of his tempering with the evidence.
10. Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find it a fit case for
bail, hence, the bail application is rejected. "
8. The present bail application is a second bail application. The argument that the FIR was lodged as
a revenge by the victim/first informant does not appear to be having any substance inasmuch as
there is simplicitor allegation of rape committed on a minor girl. The victim has supported the
prosecution case before the trial court. The trial court shall be in its right to appreciate the
statements of the witnesses recorded before it at the appropriate stage. There is no fresh and new
ground argued.
9. Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find it a fit case for bail, hence, the
bail application is rejected.
