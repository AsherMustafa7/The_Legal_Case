Mrs. Jasmeet Kaur Mokha vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 August, 2021
Learned Government Advocate has vehemently opposed the bail application stating that the
applicant has taken active part in commission of the alleged offences. She along with other
co-accused persons has satiated the cravings of money at the time when the public at large was
suffering from Covid-19 (Pandemic) and was in dire need of remdesivir injections and vials of
remdesivir have also been recovered from the possession of the applicant. Hence, prayer is made to
reject the bail application.
Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, this court is of the view that this is not a case in
which the applicant is required to be kept in custody during the whole trial but without commenting
anything on the merits of the case, this application is allowed and it is ordered that the applicant-
accused Mrs. Jasmeet Kaur Mokha be released on bail on her furnishing a personal bond for a sum
of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac only) with a solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction
of the trial court for securing her presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in
this regard during trial and for complying with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of
Section 437 of Cr.P.C.
In view of the outbreak of Â€ÂœCorona Virus Disease (COVID-19)Â€Â, the applicant shall also
comply with the rules and norms of social distancing.
Further, in view of the order passed by the Hon'Â€Â™ble Supreme court in suo motu
W.P.No.1/2020, it would be appropriate to issue the following directions to the Jail authorities :-
1. The Jail Authority shall ensure the medical examination of the applicant/s
3 MCRC-39393-2021 by the jail doctor before his/her/their release.
2. The applicant shall not be released if she is suffering from Ã¢Â€ÂœCorona Virus DiseaseÂ€Â and
for this purpose, appropriate tests will be carried out.
3. If it is found that the applicant is suffering from Â€ÂœCorona Virus DiseaseÂ€Â, necessary steps
will be taken by the concerned authority by placing him in appropriate quarantine facility.
4. If the applicant is not found infected with the alleged virus, the jail authority shall ensure his
transportation from the jail to his place of residence. The transportation shall be done in full
compliance of the rules and norms of social distancing.
