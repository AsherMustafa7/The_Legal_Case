Court delivered the following:
JUDGMENT
These appeals are filed against the judgment and award dated 02.02.2015 passed by the Senior Civil
Judge & Additional MACT, Bailhongal (for short, 'the Tribunal'), in M.V.C. No.2818 of 2012.
2. Claimant suffered accidental injuries on 07.05.2012 due to rash and negligent driving of
Mahindra Jeep by its driver. She filed claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for
awarding just and proper compensation.
3. The Tribunal, by its judgment and award dated 02.02.2015, awarded a total compensation of
Rs.3,39,000/- with interest at 9% per annum. The owner as well as the insurer of the Mahindra Jeep
were held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. Further, the Tribunal directed the
insurer of the Mahindra Jeep to deposit the compensation.
4. Being aggrieved by the judgment and award of the Tribunal, the insurer of the Mahindra Jeep has
filed M.F.A. No.101646 of 2015 challenging the liability fastened on it, and the injured claimant has
filed M.F.A. No.103479 of 2015 seeking enhancement of the compensation.
5. The leaned counsel for the appellant- insurance company submits that the claimant was traveling
as a gratuitous passenger at the time of the accident and as such, the liability to pay the
compensation could not have been fastened on the insurance company.
6. The learned counsel for the claimant justifies the impugned judgment and award passed by the
Tribunal insofar as fastening of liability to pay the compensation on the insurance company as well
as on the owner of the jeep. Learned counsel relies on a Division Bench decision of this Court in the
case of Narasamma and others Vs. M.Saibaba and another reported in 2004 ACJ 1608
7. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
material on record.
8. As per the statement given before the police at Ex.P.9, on the date of the accident, the claimant
had alighted from Mahindra Jeep and when she was about to take the luggage, the driver of the
Mahindra Jeep took the vehicle in reverse direction rashly and negligently resulting in causing of
injuries to the claimant. The Tribunal taking into consideration the contents of Ex.P.9 has recorded
a finding that the claimant cannot be termed as a gratuitous passenger, but she was a third party.
The Tribunal has also taken into consideration that the charge sheet was filed against the driver of
the Mahindra Jeep and that the driver was convicted in the criminal case. The Tribunal has rightly
held that the claimant is a third party and fastened the liability jointly and severally on the insurer
as well as the owner of the Mahindra Jeep. In the absence of any evidence contrary to the finding
recorded by the Tribunal, I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the award passed by the
Tribunal.

9. Insofar as the appeal filed by the claimant seeking enhancement of the compensation is
concerned, it is seen that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper and it does
not call for any interference.
10. Accordingly, both the appeals i.e., M.F.A. No.101646 of 2015 filed by the insurance company and
M.F.A. No.103479 of 2015 filed by the claimant are dismissed.
The amount in deposit before this Court be transmitted to the Tribunal for disbursement in
accordance with law.
The claimant is entitled to withdraw the entire compensation awarded by the Tribunal.
