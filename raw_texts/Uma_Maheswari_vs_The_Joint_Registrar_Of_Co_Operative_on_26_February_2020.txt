COMMON ORDER
It is stated in the affidavit filed in support of W.P.No.3430 of 2016 by the petitioner that the District
Recruitment Bureau called for applications from the candidates by fixing the eligibility, for the post
of Salesman, in which, for BC candidates, the age limit has been prescribed as 32 years. The
petitioner and others applied for the said post. The fourth respondent herein also applied for the
said post. Even though the fourth respondent filled up in her application stating her date of birth as
20.04.1980, thus she crossed 33 years as on the date of application, she was selected and appointed
as Sales Woman. In this connection, the petitioner has made a representation dated 05.01.2016 to
the first respondent. Seeking a direction to the first respondent to consider and pass orders on the
representation, this writ petition has been filed.
2.W.P.No.10945 of 2016 has been filed by the fourth respondent in W.P.No.3430 of 2016 stating
that she joined the Alathur Primary http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.3430 and 10945 of 2016
Agricultural Cooperative Credit Society, Alathur, by order dated 04.06.2014 and from that date, she
is working in the Society; that due to lack of knowledge even though she was born on 14.08.1982,
her parents have not applied for the birth certificate and only after joining the society she applied for
the same and obtained it. Even though in her educational certificates, her date of birth has been
shown as 20.04.1980, her original date of birth is 14.08.1982 only. In this connection, she received a
show cause notice from the Society calling for explanation with regard to her age. She also made a
representation in this connection on 21.03.2016 to the second respondent. Seeking a direction to the
second respondent to consider and pass orders on the representation, this writ petition has been
filed.
3.This Court has heard the submissions made by the learned counsel on either side.
4.In respect of W.P.No.3430 of 2016, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and
