ORDER
The petitioner has challenged the impugned Notice No.7/18- 19/122621 dated 20.11.2018 general
revision 2018-19 for the Assessment in the aforesaid demand notice contrary to Section 99 of the
Chennai City Corporation Act, 1919.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a similar issue was interfered in
W.P.Nos.19880 & 19886 of 2021 by this Court by its order dated 24.11.2021 holding that the
determination of tax is to be based on the principle of natural justice. It is further submitted that
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the income of the theatre cannot be basis for demanding property
tax.
Relevant portion of the said order, reads as under:-
“15. A reading of the aforesaid provisions makes it clear that the Council by resolution
may determine the properties, for which, the property tax can be levied. It states that
the property tax can be levied on all buildings and lands within the city save those
which are exempted under the Act or any other law. Section 99 of the Act stipulates
that the property tax may compromise:-
i. a tax for general purposes;
ii. a drainage tax for the purpose of defraying the expenses connected with the
drainage system of the city;
iii. a lighting tax for the purpose of defraying the expenses connected with the
lighting of the city:
16. Definition of 'building' within Section 3(4) of the said Act is a wider purport as it
includes :-

T.N.K.Govindaraju Chetty And ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
(a) a house, out-house, stable, latrine, godown, shed, hut, wall (other than a
boundary wall not exceeding eight feet in height) and any other structure whether of
masonry bricks, mud, wood, metal or any other material whatsoever;
(b) a structure on wheels or simply resting on the ground without foundations; and
(c) a ship, vessel, boat, tent, van and any other structure used for human habitation
or used for keeping or storing any article or goods;
17. Section 100 of the Act deals with the method of assessment. It reads as under:-
100. Method of assessment of property tax.----
( 1 ) E v e r y b u i l d i n g s h a l l b e a s s e s s e d t o g e t h e r w i t h i t s
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis site and other adjacent premises occupied as
appurtenances thereto unless the owner of the building is a different person from the
owner of such site or premises.
(2) The annual value of lands and buildings shall be deemed to be the gross annual
rent at which they may at the time of assessment reasonably be expected to let from
month to month or from year to year less a deduction, in the case of buildings, of ten
per cent of that portion of such annual rent which is attributable to the buildings
alone, a part from their sites and the adjacent lands occupied as an appurtenance
thereto and the said deduction shall be in lieu of all allowance for repairs or on any
other account whatever:
Provided that----
(a) in the case of---
(i) any Government or railway building; or
(ii) any building of a class not ordinarily let the gross annual rent of which cannot in
the opinion of the commissioner be estimated the annual value of the premises shall
be deemed to be six percent of the total of the estimated market value of the land at
the time of assessment and the estimated cost of erecting the building at such time
after deducting for depreciation a reasonable amount which shall in no case be less
than ten per centum of such cost, and
(b) machinery and furniture shall be excluded from valuations under this section:
Provided further that where the annual value of any land or building is attributable
partly to the use of such land or building or any portion thereof for the display of any
advertisement or advertisements and tax is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis levied
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146850736/ 3
T.N.K.Govindaraju Chetty And ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
under this Act in respect of such advertisement or advertisements, the annual value
of such land or building for the purpose of assessing then property tax thereon shall
be ascertained as if such land, building or portion is not used for the display of such
advertisement or advertisements.
(3) The State Government shall have power to make rules regarding the manner in
which the person or persons by whom and the intervals at which, the value of the
land, the present cost of erecting the building and the amount to be deducted for
depreciation, shall be estimated or revised in any case or class to cases to which
clause (a) of the first proviso to sub-section (2) applies, and they may, by such rules,
restrict or modify the application of the provisions contained in Schedule IV to such
case or class of cases.
18. A reading of proviso (a)(ii) to Section 100(2) of the Act indicates that any building of a class not
ordinarily let out where the gross annual rent of which cannot in the opinion of the Commissioner
be estimated, the annual value of the premises shall be deemed to be 6% of the total of the estimated
market value of the land at the time of assessment and the estimated cost of erecting the building at
such time after deducting for depreciation a reasonable amount which shall in no case be less than
10% of such cost.
19. A cogent reading of Section 99(2) of the Act and the proviso to Section 100(2) of the Act
indicates that the Council has empower to identify the buildings, class of building which can be
subject to the property tax under the provisions of the aforesaid Act. Section 99(1) of the Act also
states that what are the element which may be including for determination of property tax payable
under the said Act.
20. The power of the Council under Section 99(2) of the Act also extends to prescribing the rate of
tax as is evident from a reading of Section 99(2) of the Act. It uses the expression percentage of
annual value. Same is once again reproduced https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis below for the sake of
clarity:-
99. Description and class of property tax.---
(1) ................
(2) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, these taxes shall be levied at such
percentages of the annual value of buildings and lands as may be fixed by the council
:
Provided that the aggregate of the percentage so fixed shall not, in the case of any
land or building, be less that 15½ per cent, or greater than 25 per cent of its annual
value.

21. Thus, the Resolution passed by the Council on 08.12.2010 and 20.09.2018 fixing the different
rate of tax for theaters and other buildings in deviation of the method prescribed in proviso to
Section 100(2) of the Act would be contrary to law and any demand made by the Commissioner or
officers to such power delegate to power and collected tax would be contrary to Article 265 of the
Constitution of India.
22. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Nagpur Corporation Vs. Nagpur Handloom Cloth Market, Co.,
AIR 1963 SC 1192 has considered the scope of definition of 'building' and held as under:-
12. “Building” is defined in the Act by Section 5(7) as including “a house, outhouse,
stable, hut, shed or other enclosure, whether used as a human dwelling or otherwise
and shall include verandahs, fixed platforms, plinths, doorsteps, walls and the like”.
The definition is an inclusive definition, and contains inherent indication that a part
of a building would be a building for the purposes of imposition of liability to pay
rates, and assessment of such liability. It is manifest that under the scheme of the Act
read with the rules, conservancy tax and water rate are to be levied as rates on the
gross annual letting value and a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis rate can only be
levied from a person in respect of the tenement or premises occupied as an
independent unit. The assessment rules provide for levy of rate on the gross annual
letting value of the building, and inasmuch as the expression “building” according to
the definition given in Section 5(7) of the Act would include a part of a building, the
Corporation is competent to frame a list in respect of several tenements occupied by
different persons treating each tenement as a separate building for levy of tax. That is
implicit in Rule 10(b) and also in Rule 10(c) of the assessment rules.
23. In Devon Rai Kapur Vs. New Delhi Municipality, AIR 1980 SC 541 also, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that the assessment / revision of property tax shall be only in accordance with provisions
of Section 100 of the Act on the annual value to be ascertained and determined on the principles.
24. I therefore do not find any merits in the impugned Final Assessment Orders made by the second
respondent demanding the tax in terms of Council Resolution No.543/2010 dated 08.12.2010 and
the Council Resolution No.800/2018 dated 20.09.2018.
25. Under these circumstances, the impugned Final Assessment Orders are quashed and the cases
are remitted back to the second respondent for proper determination of tax to be paid by the
petitioners in accordance with proviso to Section 100(2) of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation
Act, 1919.
26. If desired, the respondents may issue a fresh proposal to the petitioners within a period of four
(4) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, wherein, a proper method of calculation
may be indicated If the petitioners accept the same, they shall pay the admitted liability forthwith
together with interest for the delayed payment. Otherwise, the petitioners shall reply to the same
within a period of four (4) weeks thereafter and thereafter appropriate order may be passed. Entire
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis exercise shall be carried out within a period of twelve (12) weeks

T.N.K.Govindaraju Chetty And ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. It is made clear there is no question of passing any
provisional assessment order under the Act.
27. These Writ Petitions stand disposed with the above observations. No cost. Consequently,
connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.”
3. The learned counsel for the second and third respondents submits that the revision has been
made pursuant to Council Resolution No.543/2010 dated 08/12/2010 and therefore submits that
the impugned order is in accordance with the aforesaid resolution of the council.
4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner; the learned Additional Government Pleader for the
first respondent and the learned counsel for the second and third respondents.
5. Since the issue is squarely covered by the decision of this Court rendered in W.P.Nos.19880 &
19886 of 2021, this writ petition is allowed in terms of the above order.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
6. Consequently, the third respondent is directed to re-quantify the property tax after issuing a
proper demand notice to the petitioner. The third respondent shall thereafter call upon the
petitioner for a personal hearing and pass fresh orders on merits within a period of twelve weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
