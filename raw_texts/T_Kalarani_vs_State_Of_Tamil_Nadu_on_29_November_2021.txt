The said writ petition was filed by the first appellant in W.A.No.16 of 2012, seeking to declare
Section 4(1) Notification and Section 6 Declaration as lapsed by virtue of Section 24(2) of the Right
to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,
2013 [in short "Act, 2013"]. The said writ petition was allowed, vide order dated 21.07.2015, against
which the appellant board has filed the aforesaid writ appeal.
3. Facts of the case, briefly narrated, are as follows. For the sake of convenience, the array of parties
in W.A.No.16 of 2012 is adopted.
3.1. The appellants 1 to 4 / writ petitioners are the joint owners of the property in S.Nos.2/10,
measuring an extent of 0.31 acre, S.No.2/11, measuring an extent of 0.15 acres and in S.No.2/13

purpose of construction of houses by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board under the neighbourhood
scheme in respect of the properties belonging to the petitioner and other adjacent properties
totalling 17.67 acres.

Urban Department dated 06.07.1978 and published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette on
26.07.1978. Section 6 Declaration was issued in G.O.Ms.No.715, Housing and Urban Department

one after another and all the cases have ended in favour of the respondent Board.
3.5. The request made by the first appellant on 06.11.2004 to the respondents 2 and 3 praying for
reconveyance of the land was rejected vide orders dated 04.03.2004 and 10.02.2010 passed by the
second respondent. Challenging the said orders, the appellants 1 to 4 initially had filed W.P.No.3246
of 2011 on the ground that the lands were not utilized for the purpose for which they were acquired
and therefore, prayed for reconveyane of the lands under Section 48-B of the Act, 1894. The Writ
Court taking into consideration of the fact that the proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 is completed and possession of the property is admittedly with the Tamil Nadu Housing
Board and by relying upon the decision in Tamil Nadu Housing Board v. L.Chandrasekaran (dead)
by LRs. and Others [(2010) 2 SCC 786] has dismissed the writ petition, vide order dated 09.02.2011.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Challenging the same, the appellants 1 to 4 have filed W.A.No.16
of 2012.
3.5. After the enactment of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the first appellant viz., Tmt.T.Kalarani once again filed
W.P.No.34236 of 2014, seeking to declare Section 4(1) Notification and Section 6 Declaration as
void by invoking Section 24(2) of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013. The said writ petition, after

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(iii) Compensation has not been paid even after a period of 45 years from the date of Section 4(1)
Notification. The learned counsel for the appellants, in support of his contentions relied upon the

6. Mr.A.M.Ravindranath Jeyapaul, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the respondents Board
would submit that Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 would come into operation in cases where the
award under the Old Act had been passed five years or more prior to the commencement of the Act
and either of the two conditions are satisfied, namely where the physical possession of the land has
not been taken or compensation has not been paid to the landowners and in the case on
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis hand, physical possession of the lands had been taken by the Land
Acquisition Officer and handed over to the Tamil Nadu Housing Board and the compensation had
been deposited in the Civil Court and as such, the order of the Writ Court in W.P.No.34236 of 2014
warrants interference.
7. This Court has considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials on record.
8. Admittedly, in the case on hand, the acquisition proceedings commenced in the year 1978 by
issuance of Section 4(1) Notification on 06.07.1978, Section 6 Declaration on 03.06.1980 and award
came to be passed in two phases (i) Award No.10/86-87 on 19.09.1986 in respect of S.Nos.1/3, 1/4,
2/3 and 199/3 and Award No.1/90-91 on 31.08.1990 in respect of S.Nos.2/10, 2/13 and 2/11.
Though several writ petitions were filed by various land owners at various points of time challenging
the land acquisition proceedings in W.P.No.7490/82, W.A.No.621/90 in W.P.No.7490/82,
W.P.No.6078/91, W.P.No.1508/91, W.P.No.16474/91, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.No.16678/91, W.P.No.389/2005, W.P.No.16340 /07 and W.P.No.3246/2011 (filed by the
appellant in W.A.No.16/2012), all those writ petitions ended in favour of the respondents /Tamil
Nadu Housing Board. After the enactment of Act, 2013, the first appellant had filed W.P.No.34236
of 2014, by invoking Section 24(2) of the said Act, which ended in her favour, against which
W.A.No.1641/2016 has been filed before this Court by the respondents Board.
9. It is the primordial contention of the appellants that possession of the lands still vests with them
and compensation amount was not paid even after 45 years from the date of Section 4(1)
Notification and as such, in the light of the decision in Indore Development Authority case (cited
supra), they are entitled to get relief under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013.
10. The respondents 2 and 3 in their counter affidavit has stated that the lands were taken in respect
of S.Nos.1/3, 1/4, 2/10 and 2/13. The compensation amount of Rs.10,30,638.10 was handed over to
the Land https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Acquisition Officer on 21.03.1980 vide Cheque
No.562136 dated 29.02.80 and the same was kept under Work Deposit and the compensation was
duly deposited under Section 31(2) of Land Acquisition Act before the competent Civil Court in
respect of Survey Numbers 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, in LAOP Nos.224 of 1998, LAOP Nos.223 of 1988
respectively on the file of the Sub-Court, Salem. The compensation amount of Rs.49,718/- in respect
of Survey Numbers 2/10, 2/13 and 2/11 was handed over to the Land Acquisition Officer on
08.01.1992, vide Cheque No.623342 dated 31.12.1991 and the same was duly deposited and later it
was deposited in Sub Court Salem on 23.09.2016, vide Land Acquisition Officer Letter No.ROC 3/87
vide Cheque No.02124288 dated 31.08.2016.
11. It is further seen from the counter affidavit of the respondents that possession has been taken
over by the Land Acquisition Officer between 24.11.1986 and 28.07.1999 and patta for the land in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161686190/ 5
T.Kalarani vs State Of Tamil Nadu on 29 November, 2021
T.S.No.1/3. 1/4, 2/3, 2/10 and 2/13 were transferred to the Tamil Nadu Housing Board as per the
revenue records and after taking over the lands in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.F.No.1/3 etc.,
to an extent of 2.71 Acres, the respondents Board has proposed to develop Commercial plots and
Residential plots and the Director of Town and Country Planning / Chennai had approved 18
Commercial Plots, vide LP/DTCP No.60/2003 dated 18.3.2003 and the Board has also approved the
Scheme, vide Board Resolution No.4.01 dated 21.07.2006 for Rs.96.54 Lakhs and as per the
approved layout, the development works of 18 commercial plots has been completed during the year
2010.
12. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in a landmark decision in Indore Development Authority v.
Manoharlal and Others [(2020) 8 SCC 129] has held as under:
"343. By and large, concluded cases are being questioned by way of invoking the
provisions contained in Section 24. In our considered opinion, the legality of
concluded cases cannot be questioned under the guise of Section 24(2) as it does not
envisage or confer any such right to question the proceedings and the acquisitions
have been concluded long back, or in several rounds of litigation as mentioned above,
rights of the parties have been settled. ........
366.9.Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to
question the legality of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis concluded proceedings of
land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of
enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred
claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question
the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of
compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition."
13. In the case on hand, the entire land acquisition proceedings got concluded in the year 1990 itself
and the lands were utilized for the purpose for which they were acquired, as evidenced from the
counter affidavit filed by the respondents and the appellants are unable to produce any substantive
material before this Court to refute the aforesaid stand taken by the respondents. In the light of the
aforesaid decision of this Court, the appellant cannot challenge the land acquisition proceedings
which got concluded long back in the year 1990 and therefore, the claim of the appellants is legally
unsustainable.
14. That apart, according to the appellants, the respondent Board has not satisfied the twin
conditions, namely possession has not been taken over and compensation amount has not been paid
and as such, in the light of Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 entire land acquisition
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis proceedings are declared to be lapsed. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Indore Development Authority case (cited supra), in the penultimate paras held as under:
366.3. The word “or” used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation
has to be read as “nor” or as “and”. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings
under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act takes place where due to inaction of authorities
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161686190/ 6
T.Kalarani vs State Of Tamil Nadu on 29 November, 2021
for five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land
has not been taken nor compensation has been paid. In other words, in case
possession has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse.
Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is
no lapse."
In the light of the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, if any of the conditions has been
satisfied by the respondent Board i.e., taking over possession or compensation amount has been
paid, the appellants cannot invoke Section 24(2) of the Fair Compensation Act, 2013.
15. In a latest decision in Land and Building Department through Secretary and another v. Attro
Devi & Others [2023 LiveLaw (SC) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 302], the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held as under:
13. It is also a fact to be noticed and taken care of that large chunk of land is acquired
for planned development to take care of immediate need and also keep buffer for
future requirements. Such portion of land may be lying vacant also.
As has been observed in Indore Development Authority’s case (supra) by this Court, the State
agencies are not supposed to put police force to protect possession of the land taken after process of
acquisition is complete. As far as the case in hand is concerned, the land even if was lying 5 vacant,
is required now for a project of national importance for construction of the
DelhiSaharanpur-Dehradun Highway starting from Akshardham Junction to Delhi/UP Border, in
the State of Delhi in Phase-I of Bharatmala Pariyojana.
14. It is the undisputed fact on the record, as has been noticed in the impugned order passed by the
High Court, the possession of the land was taken over by the Land Acquisition Collector and handed
over to Delhi Development Authority. Report of possession proceedings dated 06.12.2012 has also
been placed on record. Hence, one of the conditions being satisfied, we need not examine any other
argument.
15. Keeping in view the aforesaid fact and the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court
in Indore Development Authority’s case (supra), in our opinion the order passed by the High Court
cannot be legally sustained and the same is accordingly set aside. However, the respondents shall be
entitled to receive compensation as per their entitlement. The Land Acquisition Officer should also
take steps to pay the same to the rightful owner." https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
16. In the case on hand, the respondents Board has produced the Possession Certificate in their
typed set of documents in ROC.No.3/87 dated 28.07.1999, issued by the Special Tahsildar (LA),
Neighbourhood Scheme, Salem-8, in and by which possession of the lands in T.S.Nos.1/4, 2/10,
2/13 totalling an extent of 0.96 acres has been taken over, vide Award No.1/90-91 dated 31.08.90
and handed over to Mr.I.P.Chidambaram, Surveyor, Salem Housing Unit of Tamil Nadu Housing
Board, who has signed in the said document. Thus, it is clear that the possession of lands in question
has been taken over by the respondent Board as early as on 28.07.1999 and the respondents Board
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161686190/ 7
T.Kalarani vs State Of Tamil Nadu on 29 November, 2021
has satisfied one of the twin conditions. Therefore, in the light of the decision Indore Development
Authority case (supra), the claim of the appellants by invoking Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 is
legally unsustainable.
17. In the light of the reasons assigned above, the W.A.No.1641 of 2016 stands allowed and the order
of the Writ Court dated 21.07.2015 in W.P.No.34236 of 2014 is set aside. Accordingly, W.A.No.16 of
2012 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis stands dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petitions are dismissed.
