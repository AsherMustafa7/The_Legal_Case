9. A perusal of the finding of fact recorded by the Trial Court in the Suit under Section 229(B) of the
U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act fully demonstrates that case of the petitioner regarding his right title and
possession in respect to the plot in question has not been accepted by the Revenue Court in the Suit
for declaration. The judgment of the Consolidation Courts, which are annexed along with counter
affidavit also demonstrates that in the Consolidation proceedings orders were passed against the
petitioner.
10. Considering the fact that the Suit under Section 229(B) of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act filed by the
petitioner has been dismissed by the Trial Court and the order has attained finality, there is no
illegality in the order rejecting the application under Section 198(2) of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act.
11. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, there is no illegality in the impugned
orders passed in the proceeding under Section 198(2) of the U.P.Z.A. L.R. Act.
12. The writ-petition is dismissed.
13. No order as to costs.
