Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 and the petitioners have constructed residential houses in the respective land
in question and therefore, disputes the contention of the respondent- BDA with regard to taking
possession of the land in question. He also referred to revenue documents to substantiate
possession in respect of the schedule property by the petitioners and further submitted that, the
respondent-authorities have not substantially implemented the scheme as required under Section
27 of the Act and also in terms of the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
OFFSHORE HOLDINGS PRIVATE LIMITED Vs. BANGALORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY
reported in (2011) 3 SCC 139. It is also contended by the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners by referring to Order dated 04.12.2009 in W.P.No.19994 of 2007, that, the respondent-
authorities have not taken possession of the land in question and accordingly, sought for
- 20 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 interference of this Court. By referring to Notification issued under Section 16
of the Land Acquisition Act, (Annexure-F), learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted
that, no notice has been issued to the petitioners and the Notification under Section 16 of Land
Acquisition Act at Annexure-F is in cyclostyle form, no mahazar has been drawn, nor the signature
of the witnesses find place in Annexure-F and that apart, disputes the signatures in the said
Notification, where no address of the witness is mentioned and as such, refers to the Judgment of
the Division Bench of this Court in the case of DR. A. PARTHASARATHY AND OTHERS Vs. STATE
OF KARNATAKA reported in ILR 2017 KAR 3489 and contended that, the impugned Notifications
in the present case are liable to be quashed as the respondent-authorities have abandoned the
acquisition proceedings. Learned counsel appearing for
- 21 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 the petitioners also places reliance on the Order passed by this Court in the
case of SRI.

8. Per contra, Sri. Murugesh V. Charati, Sri. B.S. Sachin, and Sri. G.M. Ananda, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the respondent-BDA, argued that the Writ Petitions are liable to be dismissed
on the ground of delay and laches and further, the petitioners have not disclosed the alienation of
the land in question and accordingly, sought for dismissal of the Writ Petitions. It is also argued by
the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-BDA that the respondent-BDA has taken
possession of the land in question and Layout Plan has been produced in W.P.No.18273 of 2016 and
as such, sought for dismissal of the Writ Petitions as the respondents have implemented the scheme
substantially. It is also submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-BDA, that as
the possession of the land in question has been taken under Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act
and compensation is deposited in the

NC: 2025:KHC:3935 R.D. Account of BDA and therefore, contended that, no interference is called
for insofar as the impugned Notifications are concerned and accordingly, sought for dismissal of the
Writ Petitions.
9. Sri. Ravindranath B., learned Additional Government Advocate appearing on behalf of
respondent-State argued in similar lines with learned counsel appearing for the respondent-BDA
and sought for dismissal of the writ petitions.
10. In the light of the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, it is not in
dispute that the respondent-authorities have issued the Preliminary Notification on 07.11.2002
under Section 17(1) of the Act followed by Final Notification dated 09.09.2003 under Section 19(1)
of the Act. It is also not in dispute that the Award came to be passed on 12.12.2003. It is argued by
the learned
- 24 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 counsel appearing for the respondent-BDA that, the petitioners have alienated
a portion of the land in question and in this regard, perusal of the Sale Deed dated 13.08.2001
(Annexure-R1 in W.P.No.18269 of 2016), wherein, an extent of 35 x 40 ft in Sy.No.47/1, an extent of
40 x 30 ft in Sy.No.47/1 (Annexure-R2 W.P.No.18269 of 2016), an extent of 40 x 44 ft in Sy.No.47/1
(Annexure-R3 W.P.No.18269 of 2016), wherein, small bits of land has been sold by the petitioners
as per Annexures-R1 to R3 in W.P.No.18269 of 2016, which is less than 5% of the total extent of land
sought to be acquired by the respondent-BDA and therefore, the contentions raised by the
respondent-BDA that the entire extent / major portion of the land is sold, cannot be accepted. It is
also argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that, small bit of land was sold to put up
compound wall as well as making the landscape suitable for

NC: 2025:KHC:3935 residing in the house. That apart, except order passed in W.P.No.18269 of
2016, nothing is produced insofar as other Writ Petitions are concerned and therefore, the
contention raised by the respondents cannot be accepted and on this score itself, the Writ Petitions
cannot be dismissed as larger extent of the land (nearly 95%) is in possession of the petitioners.
11. Insofar as the contention raised by the respondents with regard to the delay in passing of the
Award is concerned, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. ULTRA-TECH CEMENT LTD.
Vs. MAST RAM & ORS., reported in (2024) SCC OnLine SC 2598 has held that the right to property
is a human right and failure to pay the compensation is a violation of Article 300-A of the
Constitution of India. It is to be noted that, Award came to be passed on 12.12.2003 and perusal of
the Order Sheet of the respondent-BDA at Annexure-G insofar as payment of
- 26 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 compensation is concerned, the compensation is said to have been deposited
in the R.D. Account of the respondent-BDA itself on 27.07.2005 and same has not been deposited
before the Civil Court till date as required under Section 31 of Land Acquisition Act. This would
makes it clear that the petitioners were unaware about the deposit of the compensation by the
respondent-BDA and therefore, the delay and laches in filing the petitions does not arise in these
petitions and further, the petitioners were approaching this Court challenging the Endorsements
and acquisition proceedings earlier also.
12. Nextly, in view of the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
about the Notification issued under Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act is concerned, on careful
examination of the Notification issued under Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, patently reveals
that, there is no
- 27 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 mahazar witness to the Notification nor the addresses of the persons who had
taken the possession of the schedule land at their instance is reflected in the notification under
Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, and that apart, the Notification issued under Section 16 of
the Land Acquisition Act is in a cyclostyle form to be filled up by the respondent-authorities and at
this stage, it is relevant to cite the Judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in DR. A.
PARTHASARATHY (supra), wherein, paragraph Nos.8 to 12 read as under:
"8. From the facts of this case we can conclude that more than 131 acres 33 guntas of
land was initially notified for acquisition, whereas in the final notification only 108
acres 17 guntas of land was notified. The land used for implementing the scheme was
to the extent of 13 acres 34 guntas, which comprised barely 12% of the land finally
notified for acquisition. The BDA has not been able to place on record any valid
reason for not proceeding to implement the scheme with regard to the land beyond
13 acres 34 guntas.

Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
- 28 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 Land was initially notified for acquisition in the year 1978 which
is more than three and a half decades back. The award, though passed in 1986, was
not complied with by the BDA, as admittedly the compensation so awarded
(particularly in the case of the appellants) was deposited after twenty-three years, in
the year 2009. All this clearly shows the non- seriousness of the BDA in
implementing the scheme for which acquisition of a vast tract of land was made by it.
9. From the above, it is clear that the Authority did not have intention of
implementing the scheme over the entire portion of land which was acquired, but it
had done so only to create a land bank, which is not the purpose for which
Development Authorities have been created. If this is permitted, then any
Development Authority can misuse the land acquisition proceedings by notifying and
acquiring large tracts of land which may be in hundreds, or even thousands of acres,
for future development, which may be proposed to be carried out even after three,
four or five decades, and deposit the compensation at the rate as on the date of
notification which may be awarded by the Special Land Acquisition Officer, and
deposit the same after several years, as in the present case, it is after thirty one years
of the initial notification for acquisition, and twenty three years even after the award
had been
- 29 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 passed. The Development Authorities are not in the business of
land dealing, as the purpose is different, which is proper development of cities, which
may include providing of residential accommodation to citizens, but not create a land
bank by way of compulsory acquisition of land, thereby depriving the legitimate
owners of land for profiteering purpose by BDA. In the present case, nearly 90% of
the land so notified to be acquired, has remained unutilized for more than three and a
half decades. The possession of the land belonging to the appellants is said to have
been taken in the year 1986 under a 'mahazar' which cannot be relied upon, and we
have no reason to disturb the finding of fact recorded by the Writ Court in this
regard, in para 27 of its judgment, which was on perusal of the original record and is
reproduced below:
The first question that falls for my consideration is, whether the possession of the
land is taken by the Government from the petitioners ? My answer to this question is
emphatically 'no', for the following reasons:
(a) The perusal of the records reveals that the things are not done in a manner known
to law.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29566244/ 15
Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
The mahazar on which all reliance is placed is deficient in more than one respect. It contains the
signatures of five persons, but their names, much less their addresses, are available.
- 30 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935
(b) The alternative portions like (i) the petitioners were present/not present (ii) BDA has taken over
the possession/the owners have handed over the possession (iii) malkies are existing/not existing
are retained as they are. The non-applicable portion is not even struck off. The mahazar prepared is
in the cyclostyled form. It is hard to give any credence to such a mahazar.
(c) No acknowledgments for having served the copy of the mahazar on the petitioners is produced. It
is also not the case of the respondent BDA that the notice calling upon the petitioners to handover
the possession was sent under RPAD.
10. The facts in the case before the Apex Court in the case of TAMIL NADU HOUSING BOARD (AIR
1986 SC 3377) were different from the facts of the present case and as such, the ratio laid down in
the said judgment would not be applicable to these cases. Possession of land so notified for
acquisition has to be taken in a proper and valid manner. The findings recorded by the Learned
Single Judge, that there was no independent witness which had signed the mahazar, nor the names
and addresses to show the identity of the alleged witnesses was given, would be sufficient to show
that the 'mahazar' was not prepared
- 31 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 in a valid and legal manner. The same was done in a mechanical manner on a
cyclostyle form, and the Learned Single Judge has rightly held that 'it is hard to give any credence to
such mahazar'. Learned Counsel for respondents has also not denied the fact that no notice was ever
given to the appellants for handing over possession and straight away the 'mahazar' had been
prepared, the authenticity of which is extremely doubtful.
11. Besides this, the other facts as noticed by the Writ Court, are also very relevant and have not been
disputed by the parties. The appellants had been depositing betterment charges and property tax
relating to the land in question till the year 2007. The building plan on the schedule property had
also been sanctioned by the concerned authority. The BDA itself had passed a resolution on
24.9.1992 to denotify the lands of Sy.No.4 belonging to the appellants, from acquisition. The Joint
Director of Town Planning of the BDA had also, on 13.1.1993, certified that there existed residential
building, with wells and pump house as well as trees standing on the said land. The said Authority
also stated that the BDA would have no objection in the land being developed by the appellants for
residential purpose. The BDA had gone to the extent of passing a resolution requesting the State
Government to denotify the acquisition of
- 32 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29566244/ 16
Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 Sy.No.4 belonging to the appellants. All this would clearly go to show that
possession of the land remained with the appellants and that BDA was not inclined to utilize the
land of the appellants to the purpose of its scheme.
12. From the facts, it is also clear that since the BDA had failed to execute the scheme substantially,
as it could utilize only about 12% of the land notified for acquisition within five years from the
publication of the declaration under Section 19(1) of the BDA Act. In our view, in the facts of the
present case, the provisions of Section 27 of the BDA Act would be applicable and thus, provisions of
Section 36 of the BDA Act providing for applicability of certain provisions of the Land Acquisition
Act would become inoperative."
13. It is the case of the petitioners that, the possession of the land in question is with the petitioners
and further neither possession nor mahazar has been drawn to take possession of the land in
question. In this backdrop of the facts on record and looking into the Notification issued under
Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act referred to above, as well as the revenue records produced in
the
- 33 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 Writ Petitions, I am of the view that, the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel appearing for the petitioners has to be accepted. In the case of MRS. POORNIMA GIRISH
Vs. REVENUE DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS reported in ILR
2011 KAR 574, this Court, at paragraph Nos.8 and 9, held as follows:
" 8. Having heard Sri. Krishnappa, Learned Counsel for the petitioner and Sri. Abdul
Khader, Learned Counsel for the respondent - Authority on merits, it is found that
the situation is one which is irredeemable and irretrievable for the Authorities as the
Authority by its own inaction and letharginess has allowed the acquisition
proceedings insofar as the petitioner is concerned to lapse. Therefore, the acquisition
proceedings in terms of the Preliminary Notification under Section 17 of the Act and
Final Notification under Section 19 of the Act are hereby quashed only insofar as it
relates to the land in possession of the petitioner in terms of the report now placed
before the Court according to which the petitioner is in possession of site measuring
40 feet by 60 feet.
- 34 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935
9. It is also open to the authority to ensure that the structure, if any, on the site is
brought in conformity with the building bye-laws and regulations which are in force
in the concerned area. It is rather surprising nay annoying that a public authority like
the Bangalore Development Authority behaves in a most irresponsible manner to
remain inactive without responding to either the land owners' travails and even has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29566244/ 17
Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
the tenacity to ignore and bypass even Court orders, as if this Court had in a situation
similar and in a cause brought before this Court earlier by a group of land owners,
has already passed orders [passed in writ petition No.16133 of 2004 and connected
matters disposed of on 6.6.2006], it is the bounden duty of the public Authority like
the Bangalore Development Authority to have implemented and obeyed that order in
letter and spirit and not to drive every citizen to seek relief only before this Court."
14. It is also pertinent to mention here that the aforementioned Judgment of the learned Single
Judge was confirmed in the case of COMMISSIONER OF BDA Vs. MRS. POORNIMA GIRISH in
Writ Appeal No.4824/2010 disposed of on 01.03.2014, by the Division Bench of this Court.
- 35 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935
15. In view of the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that
compensation is not deposited before the Civil Court as required under Section 31 of Land
Acquisition Act and the said submission was not countered by the learned counsel for the
respondent-BDA who submitted that, compensation is deposited in R.D. account of
respondent-BDA itself and in this regard, it is apt to cite the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY Vs. SUKHBIR SINGH AND OTHERS
reported in (2016) 16 SCC 258. Paragraph Nos.9 to 9.3 therein, read as under:
"9. The scheme of the Land Acquisition Act, in so far as the making of award and the
payment of compensation to persons interested, is as follows.
On the day fixed, the Collector after the inquiry that is contemplated under Section
11, has to make an award which must contain the necessary ingredients mentioned in
Section 11. As soon as the award is
- 36 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 made, under Section 12(2) of the Act, the Collector is to give
immediate notice of the award to such of the persons interested as are not present
personally. This provision, when read with Section 31 of the Act, makes it clear that
the statutory scheme is that the Collector is to tender payment of compensation
awarded by him to the persons who are interested and entitled thereto, according to
the award, on the date of making the award itself. It is therefore, clear that under the
statutory scheme, the Collector must be armed with the amount of compensation
payable to persons interested as soon as the award is made. Such persons have to be
paid the sum mentioned in the award, it being well settled that the award is only an
offer which may be accepted or rejected by the claimants. If accepted, whether under
protest or otherwise, it is the duty of the Collector to make payment as soon as
possible after making the award. It is only in a situation where the persons interested
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29566244/ 18
Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
refuse consent to receive monies payable, or there be no person competent to alienate
the land, or if there be any dispute as to title to receive compensation or its
apportionment, is the Collector to deposit the amount of compensation in the
reference court. It is only after these steps have been taken that the Collector may
take possession of the land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government
free from all encumbrances. The Act further makes it clear, on a
- 37 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 reading of Section 34, that where such compensation is neither
paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, interest is payable at the
rate of 9 per cent per annum for one year and 15 per cent per annum thereafter. This
is because a person becomes divested of both possession and title to his property
without compensation having been paid or deposited, as the case may be. This
statutory scheme has been adverted to in some of the decisions of this Court.
9.1. In New Reviera Coop. Housing Society v. Special Land Acquisition Officer,
[(1996) 1 SCC 731] at para 3, this Court held:
"3....Once the award has been made and compensation has been deposited or paid
under Section 31 of the Act, the Land Acquisition Officer is entitled to take possession
and the possession thereby taken stands vested in the State under Section 16 of the
Act free from all encumbrances..."
9.2. In Sunder v. Union of India, [(2001) 7 SCC 211] at para 24, this Court held:
"24.... What the legislature intended was to make the aggregate amount under
Section 23 of the Act to reach the hands of the person as and when the award is
passed, at any rate as soon as he is deprived of the possession of his land. Any delay
in making payment of the said sum should enable the party to have interest
- 38 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 on the said sum until he receives the payment. Splitting up the
compensation into different components for the purpose of payment of interest
under Section 34 was not in the contemplation of the legislature when that section
was framed or enacted."
9.3. In Bangalore Development Authority v. R. Hanumaiah, [(2005) 12 SCC 508] at para 47, this
Court held:
" 47....Section 31 contemplates that on making of an award under Section 11 the
Collector shall tender amount of compensation awarded by him to the person
interested and entitled thereto according to the award and shall pay to them unless
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29566244/ 19
Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
prevented by any one or more of the contingencies mentioned in the subsequent
clauses. None of those contingencies arose in the present case. Thus, once the
amount was tendered and paid the acquisition process was complete. After making
the award under Section 11 the Collector can take possession of the land under
Section 16 which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government free from all
encumbrances. In the instant case, after making the payment in terms of the award,
possession was taken. The acquisition process stood completed. ..."
(underlining emphasised)
- 39 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935
16. Indisputably, Award amount is not deposited before the Civil Court as required under law and
therefore, I find force in the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
that the procedure adopted by the respondent-BDA to deposit the compensation in their R.D.
Account is contrary to the Judgment in SUKHBIR SINGH (supra). Though the learned counsel
appearing for the respondent-BDA refers to the Layout Map enclosed in W.P.No.18273 of 2016 and
on careful examination of the same would indicate that no steps have been taken by the
respondent-BDA after issuance of the acquisition Notifications except drawing up of the Layout Map
and no allotment of sites has been made insofar as the land in question is concerned nor
development of the land for Layout is given effect to. That apart, as observed above, Award amount
is not deposited in a manner known to law and therefore, following the
- 40 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 declaration of law made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of URBAN
IMPROVEMENT TRUST Vs. SMT. VIDHYA DEVI AND OTHERS in C.A.No.14473 of 2024 disposed
of on 13.12.2024, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court condoned the delay of 21 years in
approaching the Court for redressal of grievance of the respondents therein. It is also relevant to cite
the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of KOLKATA MUNICIPAL CORPORATION
AND ANOTHER VS. BIMAL KUMAR SHAH AND OTHERS reported in AIR 2024 SC 2819.
Paragraphs 28 to 31 reads as under:
28. These seven rights are foundational components of a law that is tune with Article
300A, and the absence of one of these or some of them would render the law
susceptible to challenge. The judgment of this Court in K.T. Plantations (supra)13
declares that the law envisaged under Article 300A must be in line with the
overarching principles of rule of law, and must be just, fair, and reasonable. It is, of
course, precedentially sound to describe some of these sub-rights as

Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 'procedural', a nomenclature that often tends to undermine the inherent worth
of these safeguards. These seven sub-rights may be procedures, but they do constitute the real
content of the right to property under Article 300A, non- compliance of these will amount to
violation of the right, being without the authority of law.
29. These sub-rights of procedure have been synchronously incorporated in laws concerning
compulsory acquisition and are also recognised by our constitutional courts while reviewing
administrative actions for compulsory acquisition of private property. The following will
demonstrate how these seven principles have seamlessly become an integral part of our Union and
State statutes concerning acquisition and also the constitutional and administrative law culture that
our courts have evolved from time to time.
30. Following are the seven principles:
30.1. The Right to notice: (i) A prior notice informing the bearer of the right that the
State intends to deprive them of the right to property is a right in itself; a linear
extension of the right to know embedded in Article 19(1)(a). The Constitution does
not contemplate acquisition by ambush. The notice to acquire must be clear, cogent
and meaningful. Some of the statutes reflect this right.
- 42 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935
(ii) Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Section 3(1) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of
Immovable Property Act, 1952, Section 11 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and Section 3A of the National
Highways Act, 1956 are examples of such statutory incorporation of the right to notice before
initiation of the land acquisition proceedings.
(iii) In a large number of decisions, our constitutional courts have independently recognised the
right to notice before any process of acquisition is commenced
14. 30.2. The Right to be heard: (i) Following the right to a meaningful and effective prior notice of
acquisition, is the right of the property-bearer to communicate his objections and concerns to the
authority acquiring the property. This right to be heard against the proposed acquisition must be
meaningful and not a sham.
(ii) Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Section 3(1) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition
of Immovable Property Act, 1952, Section 15 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and Section 3C of the National
Highways Act, 1956, are some statutory embodiments of this right.

Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:3935
(iii) Judicial opinions recognizing the importance of this right are far too many to reproduce. Suffice
to say that that the enquiry in which a land holder would raise his objection is not a mere formality.
30.3. The Right to a reasoned decision: i) That the authorities have heard and considered the
objections is evidenced only through a reasoned order. It is incumbent upon the authority to take an
informed decision and communicate the same to the objector.
(ii) Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Section 3(2) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of
Immovable Property Act, 1952, Section 19 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and Section 3D of the National
Highways Act, 1956, are the statutory incorporations of this principle.
(iii) Highlighting the importance of the declaration of the decision to acquire, the Courts have held
that the declaration is mandatory, failing which, the acquisition proceedings will cease to have
effect. 30.4. The Duty to acquire only for public purpose: (i) That the acquisition must be for a
public purpose is inherent and an important fetter on the discretion of the authorities to acquire.
This requirement, which conditions the purpose of acquisition must stand to
- 44 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 reason with the larger constitutional goals of a welfare state and distributive
justice.
(ii) Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Sections 3(1) and 7(1) of the Requisitioning
and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952, Sections 2(1), 11(1),15(1)(b) and 19(1) of the Right
to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,
2013 and Section 3A(1) of the National Highways Act, 1956 depict the statutory incorporation of the
public purpose requirement of compulsory acquisition.
(iii) The decision of compulsory acquisition of land is subject to judicial review and the Court will
examine and determine whether the acquisition is related to public purpose. If the court arrives at a
conclusion that that there is no public purpose involved in the acquisition, the entire process can be
set-aside. This Court has time and again reiterated the importance of the underlying objective of
acquisition of land by the State to be for a public purpose.
30.5. The Right of restitution or fair compensation: (i) A person's right to hold and enjoy property is
an integral part to the constitutional right under Article 300A. Deprivation or extinguishment of
that right is permissible only upon restitution, be it in the form of monetary compensation,
rehabilitation or other similar

Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 means. Compensation has always been considered to be an integral part of the
process of acquisition.
(ii) Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Sections 8 and 9 of the Requisitioning and
Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952, Section 23 of the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and Sections 3G and
3H of the National Highways Act, 1956 are the statutory incorporations of the right to restitute a
person whose land has been compulsorily acquired.
(iii) Our courts have not only considered that compensation is necessary, but have also held that a
fair and reasonable compensation is the sine qua non for any acquisition process 30.6. The Right to
an efficient and expeditious process: (i) The acquisition process is traumatic for more than one
reason. The administrative delays in identifying the land, conducting the enquiry and evaluating the
objections, leading to a final declaration, consume time and energy. Further, passing of the award,
payment of compensation and taking over the possession are equally time consuming. It is
necessary for the administration to be efficient in concluding the process and within a reasonable
time. This obligation must necessarily form part of Article 300A.

Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act,1952, Sections 4(2), 7(4), 7(5), 11(5), 14,

of the National Highways Act, 1956, prescribe for statutory frameworks for the completion of
individual steps in the process of acquisition of land within stipulated timelines.
(iii) On multiple occasions, upon failure to adhere to the timelines specified in law, the courts have
set aside the acquisition proceedings.
30.7. The Right of conclusion: (i) Upon conclusion of process of acquisition and payment of
compensation, the State takes possession of the property in normal circumstances. The culmination
of an acquisition process is not in the payment of compensation, but also in taking over the actual
physical possession of the land. If possession is not taken, acquisition is not complete. With the
taking over of actual possession after the normal procedures of acquisition, the private holding is
divested and the right, title and interest in the property, along-with possession is vested in the State.
Without final vesting, the State's, or its beneficiary's right, title and interest in the property is

NC: 2025:KHC:3935 inconclusive and causes lot of difficulties. The obligation to conclude and
complete the process of acquisition is also part of Article 300A.

Smt. Chikkamuniyamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 27 January, 2025
ii) Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Sections 4 and 5 of the Requisitioning and
Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952, Sections 37 and 38 of the Right to Fair Compensation
and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and Sections 3D
and 3E of the National Highways Act, 1956, statutorily recognise this right of the acquirer.
iii) This step of taking over of possession has been a matter of great judicial scrutiny and this Court
has endeavoured to construe the relevant provisions in a way which ensures non-arbitrariness in
this action of the acquirer 20. For that matter, after taking over possession, the process of land
acquisition concludes with the vesting of the land with the concerned authority. The culmination of
an acquisition process by vesting has been a matter of great importance. On this aspect, the courts
have given a large number of decisions as to the time, method and manner by which vesting takes
place.
31. The seven principles which we have discussed are integral to the authority of law enabling
compulsory acquisition of private property. Union and State
- 48 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 statutes have adopted these principles and incorporated them in different
forms in the statutes provisioning compulsory acquisition of immovable property. The importance
of these principles, independent of the statutory prescription have been recognised by our
constitutional courts and they have become part of our administrative law jurisprudence.
17. Following the declaration of law made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to above, I do not
find any substance in the arguments advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the
respondent-BDA, that the writ petitions have to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches.
18. In the result, as the respondents have not taken possession of the land in question in a manner
known to law nor deposited the compensation before the Civil Court and that apart, the perusal of
the Order dated 04.12.2009 in W.P.No.19994 of 2007, wherein, this Court allowed the Writ Petition
filed by the petitioners herein and thereafter, the petitioners are agitating
- 49 -
NC: 2025:KHC:3935 their rights continuously, which could be inferred from the Note Sheets/Order
Sheets produced at Annexure- G to the Writ Petitions that the petitioners are in possession of the
land in question and therefore, the petitioners have made out a case for interference in these Writ
Petitions.
19. Hence, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Writ Petitions are allowed.
