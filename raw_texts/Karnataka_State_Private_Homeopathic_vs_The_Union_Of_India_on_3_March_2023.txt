THIS W.P. COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,
ALOK ARADHE J., MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The petitioner No.1 is an Association of Private Homeopathic Medical Colleges in the State of
Karnataka. The members of petitioner No.1 - Association with an intent to impart education in
Homeopathy system of medicine have established Colleges and teaching hospitals under the
provisions of Homeopathic Central Council Act, 1973, in different parts of the State. In the said
colleges, education is imparted in homeopathy in Under Graduate and Post Graduate courses. The
petitioners in this writ petition seek the following reliefs:
(a) Issue a writ in the nature of declaration, declaring that Sections 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 43, 44, 55
(2)(i)(m) of the National Commission of Homeopathy Act, 2010 (Central Act No.15/2020) (vide
Annexure A) are manifestly arbitrary, unworkable and unconstitutional and strike down the
aforesaid provisions.
(b) Issue a writ of certiorari or any other writ, order or direction to declare that the Regulations of
2022 (vide Annexure N) notified by the respondent No.2, in so far as they seek to regulate, finding it
necessary; and permits adopting NEET of National Medical Commissioner and counselling process;
and a seat matrix stipulating 'quotas' for admission in private institutions, as manifestly arbitrary
and illegal.
(c) Issue a writ of Certiorari or any other writ, order, or direction to declare that 'the Addendum'
dated 13.12.2022 bearing No. AKUKA 253 PIM 2022 (vide Annexure P) issued by the respondent
No.3 is illegal, unreasonable and unenforceable; and quash the same.
(d) Issue a writ directing that, counselling for the 'Management Quota' of 60% as of last academic
year having been completed by the members of the 1st petitioner Association based on NEET merit
list and G.O. dated 13.10.2022 same be permitted and continued; the KEA filling the balance of
Government quota seats to sub serve the reservation policy of the state per 'seat sharing' Annexure
K; and these petitioners be permitted to conduct 'counselling for NRI / Management Quota seats'
based on inter se merit of applicants to the individual institutions at their level; subject to a rider
that 'the fee notified' is tentative, that 'the fee fixation committee' would examine some of the fee
proposal that may be filed and approved; on which event, said 'fees' determined would be applicable
for the current year on-words as well. Further be pleased to direct the KEA to inform the students to

Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
(e) Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ,; directing the 6th respondent - Fee
Regulatory Committee to determine the fee for the Homeopathy colleges for the Academic year
2022-23, within a fixed time frame taking into consideration the balance sheets of a few colleges to
arrive at an average fee to be applied to all the institutions in the State in view of the counselling
process commencing and, also to take into consideration the comprehensive guidelines issued by
the NCH for determination of fee and;
(f) Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, directing the state to cause
determination of 'tuition fee' payable by a committee in terms of Section 6 and 7 of 2006 Act and
that till 'the Fee Regulatory Committee' take the decision fixing the fee, amounts indicated in Govt.
Order dated 13.10.2022 (vide Annexure K) be operated.
(g) Grant such other order or reliefs as this Hon'ble Court deems fit to grant in the facts and
circumstances of this case.
2. The relevant facts need mention, which are stated hereinafter. The State Government issued a
notification dated 27.01.2018, wherein it was provided that in view of decision taken by ministry of
Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Sidda and Homeopathy, it has decided to adopt National Eligibility
Entrance Test (NEET) in place of Common Entrance Test for Ayush course in Government as well as
private colleges in the State of Karnataka from the academic session 2018-19 and the admission
shall be based on the rank in NEET examination. The petitioners thereupon challenged the said
order in a writ petition viz., W.P.No.41486-534/2018 in which an interim order was granted on
11.10.2018, by which petitioners were permitted to admit students who were meeting the academic
qualifications prescribed in the Regulations but have not appeared in NEET.
3. For the academic year 2019-20, the Council for Homeopathy amended the Homeopathy (Degree
Course) Regulations, 1983. Regulation 4A was substituted with Regulation 4A(i), which provided
that there shall be uniform entrance examination to all medical institutions at the under graduate
level viz., NEET for admission to under graduate courses, which was to be conducted by an authority
designated by Central Government. The petitioners thereupon once again filed an application in
W.P.No.41486-534/2018 to pass an interim order for academic session 2019-20. A division bench of
this court by an order dated 20.09.2019 passed an interim order permitting the petitioners to make
admission to the seats which remained unfilled after all NEET qualified students had made their
choices.
4. The aforesaid interim order was challenged by Central Council of Indian Medicine before Hon'ble
Supreme Court by way of Special Leave Petition. The Civil appeal viz., Civil Appeal No.603/2020
was decided by an order dated 20.02.2020. The Hon'ble Supreme Court did not disturb the
admission already made but upheld the validity of the notification prescribing NEET for admission
to ayurveda courses. However, validity of the notification issued by Homeopathic Central Council
was not decided and the petitioners were granted the liberty to raise the issue before the High Court.
In view of order passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, this court by an order dated 11.12.2020 disposed
of the writ petition.

Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
5. For the academic session 2020-21, several institutions were unable to admit the students from
merit list of NEET. The institutions therefore, approached the Central Government for redressal of
their grievance. The Central Government by a communication dated 15.01.2021 brought down the
minimum percentile from 50 to 40-30 percentile depending on the category of candidates.
6. The Karnataka Examination Authority by an order dated 25.01.2021 issued a notification dated
25.01.2021 for counseling for admission to Ayush courses for the academic year 2020-21. A division
bench of this court in W.P.No.100650/2021 and other connected matters, by an order dated
31.08.2021 allowed the writ petition and quashed the Regulations and directed the respondents to
approve the admission made in pursuance of the interim order passed in the writ petition.
7. The Homeopathy Central Council Act, 1973 was repealed by a new enactment viz., the national
Commission for Homeopathy Act, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 2020 Act' for short), which
received the assent of the President on 20.09.2020. The Central Government by an order dated
05.07.2021 issued under Section 3 of the 2020 Act constituted National Commission for
Homeopathy. The National Testing Agency issued a public notice dated 13.07.2021 inviting online
applications for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test as per Section 14 of the National Medical
Commission Act, 2019.,
8. The National Testing Agency notified the conduct of NEET examination for academic year
2022-23 on 17.07.2022. The National Commission for Homeopathy on 09.09.2022 circulated two
letters inviting comments and suggestions over the draft Regulations for National Commission for
Homeopathy (Homeopathy Degree Course - B.H.M.S) Regulation, 2022 and the National
Commission for Homeopathy (Minimum Standards of Requirement for Homeopathy Colleges and
Attached Hospitals) Regulations, 2022. The State Government by a communication dated
13.10.2022 convened a meeting to arrive at a consensual arrangement for providing appropriate fee
structure and seat sharing. The petitioner No.1 thereupon submitted representations on 09.11.2022
and 05.12.2022 to re-consider the fee structure.
9. The State Government after holding meeting with members of petitioner No.1-Association and
other stake holders passed an order on 13.10.2022 providing for annual fee structure and seat
matrix in respect of admissions to graduate and post graduate courses in Homeopathic colleges for
academic year 2022-23. The Ministry of Ayush issued an advisory on 18.10.2022, which was treated
as National Commission for Homeopathy as guidelines for grant of admission to academic year
2022-23. The National Commission for Homeopathy, however, on 06.12.2022 notified the
Regulations viz., National Commission for Homeopathy (Homeopathy Graduate Degree Course -
Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery (B.H.M.S.)) Regulations, 2022 (hereinafter referred
to as '2022 Regulations' for short). Thereafter, on 06.12.2022, the calendar was notified regulating
imparting of courses of study. It was directed that courses shall commence from 1st October of the
year. An addendum was issued vide government order dated 13.12.2022 by which it was provided
that seats for Homeopathy courses shall be filled as per the Regulations of 2022 notified on
06.12.2022 through Karnataka Examination Authority.

10. For the academic session 2022-23 also, large number of seats were vacant. Thereupon the
petitioners once again filed an interlocutory application in W.P.No.1261/2022. Thereafter, a division
bench on 22.11.2022 passed an interim order, permitting admissions to students academically
qualified but without NEET ranking. The said order was challenged by National Commission for
Homeopathy before Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Civil Appeal was decided by an order dated
13.02.2023 by which order passed in W.P.No.1261/2022 dated 22.11.2022 was set aside and the
matter was remitted to the High court to decide the same on merits finally before last date proposed
for admission, which was to be extended by National Medical Council. The petitioners thereafter
filed an application for early hearing 20.02.2023 which was listed before this Court on 22.02.2023.
Thereupon, this Court directed the petition to be listed for final hearing on 01.03.2023. The
arguments were heard on 02.03.2023 as well as today. Admittedly, the last date for admission to
B.H.M.S. course is tomorrow i.e., 04.03.2023. In the aforesaid factual background, this petition
arises for our consideration.
11. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submit that the fundamental rights acknowledged and
recognized which are available to private educational institutions on account of decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court viz., Right to admit and to impart secular education is subject to reasonable
restrictions and is not permissible to impose any restriction by subordinate or delegated legislation,
as is sought to be done by the guidelines issued by Ayush Department of Central Government.
Section 14 of 2020 Act is wholly disproportionate to the object sought to be achieved and suffers
from manifest arbitrariness. It is also urged that provisions of the Act suffer from doctrine of non
retrogression and hit by principles of proportionality. It is contended that Section 14 of the 2020 Act
providing for uniform NEET can operate only in the manner prescribed and such a manner is
required to be specified by the Regulations.
12. It is argued that institutions imparting education in homeopathy courses are not of All India
character and there is no excess demand over availability, giving scope for malpractices and
therefore, requiring assessment of inter se merit for grant of admission to competing aspirants for
admission does not arise. It is also urged that equating and comparing the study of homeopathy
with allopathic medicine and dentistry and applying rigors of provision for grant of admission and
standards of education provided for such courses is manifestly arbitrary and suffers from the vice of
non application of mind. It is submitted that impugned legislation is violative of fundamental rights
guaranteed to the petitioners.
13. It is pointed out that Sections 3, 4 and 10 2020 Act are hit by principles of non retrogression
inasmuch as the aforesaid provision contemplate nominees of the Central Government only. It is
submitted that Section 43 and 44 of the 2020 are enabling provisions and therefore, no direction to
hold the NEET can be given under the same. It is contended that Section 55(2)(m) does not enable
the Central Government to issue instructions. It is argued that Clause 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 to 4.7 of the 2022
Regulations are hit by doctrine of proportionality. It is further contended that Regulations notified
on 06.12.2022 do not have any retrospective operation to govern the grant of admission for
academic year 2022-23 which commenced from 19.07.2022.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140557780/ 7

14. It is urged that the Regulations of 2018 cannot be applied for admission for academic session
2022-23 as the same have been quashed by this court in W.P.No.10065/2021. It is argued that since,
neither the Regulations nor the guidelines apply for the academic session 2022-23, therefore, the
petitioners be permitted to admit the students on the basis of their academic eligibility. In support
of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
'TMA PAI FOUNDATION VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA', (2002) 8 SCC 481, 'P.A.INAMDAR VS.
STATE OF MAHARASHTRA', (2005) 6 SCC 537, 'CHRISTIAN MEDICAL COLLEGE VS. UNION

SCC 353, 'INDEX MEDICAL COLLEGE VS. STATE OF M.P.', (2021) SCC ONLINE SC 318.
15. Learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.2 viz., National Homeopathy Commission submitted
that the Act and the Regulations framed therein have been enacted with an object to provide
medical education system, which includes access to quality and affordable medical education and
there is no violation of either any fundamental rights of the petitioners or any other constitutional
provision. It is also contended that under Section 59(2) of 2020 Act notwithstanding repeal of the
old Act and the Rules, the Regulations made shall continue to be in force and shall operate till new
standards or requirement are specified under the Act. It is also urged that Act 2020 empowers the
Central Government under Sections 43 and 44 of the Act to issue the guidelines and directions to
National Council for Homeopathy for effective implementation of the Act and the guidelines dated
18.10.2022 shall govern the process of admission for academic session 2022-23. It is also submitted
that requirement of holding a common examination has already been upheld by Hon'ble Supreme
Court. In support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on decisions in ' MODERN
DENTAL COLLEGE & RESEARCH CENTRE VS. STATE OF M.P.', (2016) 7 SCC 353, 'CHRISTIAN
MEDICAL COLLEGE VELLORE ASSOCAITION VS. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS', AIR 2020
SC 4721 and 'DENTAL COUNCIL OF INDIA VS. BIYANI SHIKSHAN SAMITI, (2022) 6 SCC 65.
16. Learned Deputy Solicitor General of India for Union of India supported the submissions made
by Learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.2 and has submitted that the Act and the Regulations
are valid. It is further submitted that prescription of minimum standards of education in respect of
Ayurvedic, Unani and Homeopathic schemes have been upheld by Hon'ble Supreme Court by
judgment dated 20.02.2020 in Civil Appeal No.603/2020 (UNION OF INDIA VS. FEDERATION
OF SELF FINANCED AYURVEDIC COLLEGES, PUNJAB AND ORS.). Reference has also been
made to decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'SHRI RAM KRISHNA DALMIA VS.

17. Learned Additional Government Advocate has supported the submissions made by Learned
Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 and learned ASGI and has submitted that the order dated
13.12.2022 was issued in consonance with the Regulation framed by National Commission. Learned
counsel for Karnataka Examination Authority has supported the stand taken by other respondents.
18. We have considered the submissions made on both sides and have perused the record. The Act
2020 was enacted inter alia with an object to provide for medical education system which improves
access to quality and affordable medical education, ensures availability of adequate and high quality
homeopathic medical professionals in all parts of the country. The fundamental challenge in this
writ petition is to Section 14 of the Act, which provides that there shall be Uniform National
Eligibility cum Entrance Test for admission to under graduate Homeopathy in all the institutions
governed under the Act. Section 43 of the Act provides that the Commissions and Autonomous
Boards shall be bound by the directions on the question of policy as the Central Government may
give in writing to them from time to time. Section 44 deals with the power of the Central
Government to give directions to State Government for carrying out the provisions of the Act.
Section 55 deals with the power of the Commission to make Regulations. Section 55(2)(m) deals
with power to frame regulations in the manner of conducting common counselling by the designated
authority for admission to the post graduate seats in all medical institutions under Section 16(3) of
the Act. Section 14 of the 2020 Act is extracted below for the facility of reference:
14. (1) There shall be a uniform National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test, for admission
to the undergraduate in Homoeopathy in all medical institutions governed under this
Act.
(2) The Commission shall conduct the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test in English and in such
other languages, through such designated authority and in such manner, as may be specified by
regulations.
(3) The Commission shall specify by regulations the manner of conducting common counselling by
the designated authority for admission to all the medical institutions governed under this Act:
Provided that the common counselling shall be conducted by the designated authority of --
(i) the Central Government, for All India seats; and
(ii) the State Government, for the remaining seats at the State level.
19. In exercise of powers conferred in Section 55(2) of the 2020 Act, the Regulations viz.,
Regulations 2022 have been framed. The said Regulations were framed on 06.12.2022.
20. It is well settled in law that validity of an Act can be assailed either on the ground of lack of
legislative competence or on the ground that the same contravenes either any of the fundamental
rights or the constitutional provisions. The Act 2020 has been enacted in exercise of powers under
Entry 65 and 66 of List 1 of VIIth Schedule to the Constitution of India. There is no challenge to the
provisions of the Act on the ground that Parliament lacks legislative competence to enact the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140557780/ 9
Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
21. A Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in PREETI SRIVASTAV (Dr.) Vs. STATE OF M.P. (1999)
7 SCC 127 has held that norms for admission can have a direct impact on standards of education.
Similar view was taken in VETERNARY COUNCIL OF INDIA Vs. INDIAN COUNCIL FOR
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH (2000) 1 SCC 750 and it has been held that power to regulate
standard of education casts a corresponding duty to conduct an All India Examination. Thus, even
in the absence of a specific provision, it has been held that power to regulate standard of education
casts a corresponding duty to conduct an All India Examination. However, in the instant case,
Section 14 of the 2020 Act expressly prescribes NEET for admission to under graduate in
Homeopathy in all Medical Institutions. Thus, the legislature in its wisdom, has taken a view that
merit based admission can be ensured to a common entrance test namely NEET.
22. The right to admit the students is an essential facet of right to administer educational institution.
However, the same is not absolute and could be regulated. In T.M.A. PAI FOUNDATION Vs. STATE
OF KARNATAKA (2002) 8 SCC 481, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:
50. The right to establish and administer broadly comprises of the following rights:
(a) to admit students:
(b) to set up a reasonable fee structure:
(c) to constitute a governing body:
(d) to appoint staff (teaching and non-
teaching): and
(e) to take action if there is dereliction of
duty on the part of any employees.
Whether the admission of students to
minority educational institution, whether aided or unaided, can be regulated by the
State Government or by the University to which the institution is affiliated?
Admission of students to unaided minority educational institutions, viz., schools and
undergraduates colleges where the scope for merit-based selection is practically nil, cannot be
regulated by the concerned State or University, except for providing the qualifications and minimum
conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic standards.
The right to admit students being an essential facet of the right to administer educational
institutions of their choice, as contemplated under Article 30 of the Constitution, the state
government or the university may not be entitled to interfere with that right, so long as the
admission to the unaided educational institutions is on a transparent basis and the merit is
adequately taken care of. The right to administer, not being absolute, there could be regulatory
measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof, and it is more so
in the matter of admissions to professional institutions.
A minority institution....
23. Similarly, in P.A.INAMDAR Vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (2005) 6 SCC 537, it has been held
as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140557780/ 10
Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
76. So far as the admissions based on common entrance test are concerned, it is
submitted that paragraphs 58 and 59 of Pai Foundation permit regulations to be
framed for admission in professional institutions by State agency to ensure admission
on merit.
In the absence of CET and centralized counselling, private educational institutions would pick and
choose candidates ignoring merit, as has been evident from the Karnataka experience. If the private
professional educational institutions conceive that merit cannot be ignored in granting admission,
direction to make selection based on CET does not in any manner adversely affect the character of
the minority institution. The State regulation providing for CET is a reasonable restriction and it will
pass the test of Article 19(6) both in respect of aided and unaided non-
minority institutions. Private unaided institutions have also to admit students on the basis of merit
in a fair and transparent manner in the interest of student community. Right of private educational
institutions to admit students can be regulated. Such regulations if in national and public interest do
not in any manner impinge on the right of minority.
92. As an occupation, right to impart education is a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) and
therefore, subject to control by clause (6) of Article 19. This right is available to all citizens without
drawing a distinction between minority and non-
minority. Such a right is, generally
speaking, subject to laws imposing
reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public. In particular, laws may be enacted on
the following subject: (i) the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practicing any
profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business: (ii) the carrying on by the State, or by a
corporation owned or controlled by the State of any trade, business, industry or service whether to
the exclusion, complete or partial of citizens or otherwise. Care is taken of minorities, religious or
linguistic,, by protecting their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their
choice under Article 30. To some extent, what may be permissible by way of restriction under Article
19(6) may fall foul of Article 30. This is the additional protection which Article 30(1) grants to the
minorities.
24. In MODERN DENTAL COLLEGE AND RESEARCH CENTRE VS. STATE OF M.P.', (2016) 7
SCC 353, it has been held that right to administer an institution includes a right to admit students
and to set up a reasonable fee structure. However, the same is subject to Regulation. Thus, from
perusal of judgments of Supreme Court in T.M.A. PAI FOUNDATION, supra as well as
P.A.INAMDAR and MODERN DENTAL COLELGE AND RESEARCH CENTRE, supra, it can safely
be gathered that right to administer an educational institution which includes a right to admit
students, is not an absolute right and can be regulated.
25. In ABDUL AHAD AND ORS. Vs. UNION ON INDIA (2020) 1 SCC ONLINE SC 627, a three
Judge Bench of Supreme Court has approved the principles laid down by a Constitution Bench of
the Supreme Court in MODERN DENTAL COLLEGE AND RESEARCH CENTRE supra, upholding

Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
the introduction of common entrance examination for the following reasons:
1. The legislature in its wisdom has taken the view that merit-based admissions can
be ensured only through a common entrance test followed by centralised counselling
either by the State or by an agency authorised by the State.
2. In order to ensure rights of the applicants aspiring for medical courses under
Articles 14, 15, and 16 of the Constitution of India, legislature by the impugned
legislation introduced the system of common entrance test (CET) to secure
merit-based admission on a transparent basis.
3. If private unaided educational institutions are given unfettered right to devised
their own admission procedure and fee structure, it would lead to situation where it
would impinge upon the "right to equality" of the students who aspire to take
admission in such educational institutions.
4. Common entrance test by State or its agency will ensure equal opportunity to all
meritorious and suitable candidates and meritorious candidates can be identified for
being allotted to different institutions depending on the courses of study, the number
of seats and other relevant factors.
5. Having regard to the larger interest and welfare of the student community to
promote merit and achieve excellence and curb malpractices, it would be permissible
for the State to regulate admissions by providing a centralised and single-window
procedure.
6. Holding such CET followed by centralised counselling or single window system
regulating admissions does not cause any dent on the fundamental rights of the
institutions in running the institution.
7. While private educational institutions have a "right of occupation" in running the
educational institutions, equally they have the responsibility of selecting meritorious
and suitable candidates, in order to bring out professionals with excellence. Rights of
private educational institutions have to yield to the larger interest of the community.
8. The freedom of private educational institutions to establish and run institution,
impart education, recruit staff, take disciplinary action, admit students, participate in
fixation of fees is in no way being abridged by the impugned legislation;
it remains intact.
26. In CHRISTIAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, VELLORE ASSOCIATION VS. UNION OF INDIA AND
OTHERS, AIR 2020 SC 4721, a three judge bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court while examining the
validity of the notifications issued by Medical Council of India and Dental Council of India, which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140557780/ 12
Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
provided for NEET for admission to MBBS course has upheld the prescription of NEET to MBBS
course and has held that prescription of NEET has been made to improve the quality of medical
education and is a step in furtherance of a duty from the State enshrined under Article 47 of the
Directive Principles of State Policy. The view taken in P.A.INAMDAR supra that admission based on
merit are in national interest and strengthened the national welfare were also referred. The relevant
extract of para 58 reads as under:
58. Thus, we are of the opinion that rights under Articules 19(i)(g) and 30 read with
Articles 25, 26 and 29(1) of the Constitution of India do not come in the way of
securing transparency and recognition of merits in the matter of admissions. It is
open to regulating the course of study, qualifications for ensuring educational
standards. It is open to imposing reasonable restrictions in the national and public
interest. The rights under Article 19(1)(g) are not absolute and are subject to
reasonable restriction in the interest of the student's community to promote merit,
recognition of excellence and to curb the malpractices. Uniform Entrance Test
qualifies the test of proportionality and is reasonable. XXXX
27. The prescription of NEET fulfils the twin tests of proportionality and reasonableness. The object
of prescription of test is to ensure that qualified students take admission in B.H.M.S Course, which
is in the interest of the patients whom they treat. Merely because number of seats are more and the
candidates are less, the requirement of merit based admission cannot be dispensed with and the
private educational institution cannot have an unfettered right to admit the students regardless of
their merit. The doctrine of non retrogression provides that State should not take any measures or
steps that deliberately lead to retrogression on the enjoinment of rights either under the
Constitution or otherwise.
28. In the instant case, by enacting Section 14, the right of the petitioners to admit students in
educational institutions has merely been regulated and the same does not amount to violation of the
rights of the petitioners under the constitution or any other enactment. Therefore, principle of
doctrine of non retrogression is not applicable to the facts of the case. In view of aforesaid
enunciation of law by Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is held that Section 14 of the Act neither suffers
from manifest arbitrariness nor the test of proportionality or in violation of the doctrine of non
retrogression. Therefore, the challenge to constitutional validity of Section 14 of 2020 Act is
repelled.
29. Before adverting to the challenge made to Sections 3, 4 and 10, it is apposite to take note of the
same, which are extracted below for the facility of reference:
(3) The following persons shall be appointed by the Central Government as ex officio
Members of the Commission, namely:-- (a) the President of the Homoeopathy
Education Board; (b) the President of the Medical Assessment and Rating Board for
Homoeopathy; (c) the President of the Board of Ethics and Registration for
Homoeopathy; (d) Advisor (Homoeopathy) or Joint Secretary to the Government of
India in-charge of Homoeopathy, in the Ministry of AYUSH; (e) the Director,

territories in the Advisory Council for a term of two years in such manner as may be prescribed. (c)
six members to be appointed from amongst the nominees of the States and Union territories, under
clause
(d) of sub-section (2) of section 11, of the Advisory Council for a term of two years in such manner as
may be prescribed:
Constitution of National Commission for Homoeopathy. Composition of
Commission. 3 of 1956. 4 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINARY [PART II--
Provided that no Member shall either himself or through any of his family members,
directly or indirectly, own or be associated with or have any dealings with the
managing body of a private or non-government medical institution which is regulated
under this Act.
Explanation.--For the purpose of this section and section 19, the term "leader" means the Head of a
Department or the Head of an Organisation.
10. (1) The Commission shall perform the following functions, namely:-- (a) lay down policies for
maintaining a high quality and high standards in education of Homoeopathy and make necessary
regulations in this behalf; (b) lay down policies for regulating medical institutions, medical
researches and medical professionals and make necessary regulations in this behalf; (c) assess the
requirements in healthcare, including human resources for health and healthcare infrastructure and
develop a road map for meeting such requirements; (d) frame guidelines and lay down policies by
making such regulations as may be necessary for the proper functioning of the Commission, the
Autonomous Boards and the State Medical Councils of Homoeopathy; (e) ensure coordination
among the Autonomous Boards; Meetings of Commission. Power and functions of Commission.

necessary, to ensure compliance by the State Medical Councils of Homoeopathy of the guidelines

deemed to be Universities which are governed under the provisions of this Act. (j) exercise such
other powers and perform such other functions as may be prescribed. (2) All orders and decisions of
the Commission shall be authenticated by signature of the Secretary and the Commission may
delegate such of its powers on administrative and financial matters, as it deems fit, to the Secretary.
(3) The Commission may constitute sub-
committees and delegate such of its powers to them as may be necessary to enable them to
accomplish specific tasks.
30. The validity of aforesaid provisions is assailed on the ground that Central Homeopathy Council
comprises of officers of the Government and the aforesaid provisions are in violation of doctrine of
non retrogression. Section 3 of the 2020 Act deals with the power of Central Government to
constitute National Commission for Homeopathy. Section 4 of the 2020 Act provides for
composition of Commission. The commission comprises of the persons to be nominated as ex officio
members of the commission as well as the persons referred to in Section 4(4) of the Act, which can
be appointed as part time members of the Committee. Section 10 of the 2020 Act, deals with powers
and function of the Commission. The contention that Commission comprises only of officers of the
Central Government is incorrect, as the Commission comprises part time members also. The
Commission has been constituted under the 2020 Act to perform its functions under the Act. The
aforesaid provisions by no stretch of imagination suffer from the doctrine of non retrogression. The
aforesaid provisions have also not been shown to be per se arbitrary. Therefore, the contention that
the aforesaid provisions are manifestly arbitrary or are unworkable cannot be accepted.
31. A challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 43 and 44 of the 2020 Act has been made on
the ground that in exercise of aforesaid powers, no direction could be given to hold NEET as the
same are enabling provision. It is apposite to take note of Section 43 and 44 of the Act, which read
as under:
43. (1) Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this Act, the Commission and
the Autonomous Boards shall, in exercise of their powers and discharge of their
functions under this Act be bound by such directions on questions of policy as the
Central Government may give in writing to them from time to time: Provided that the
Commission and the Autonomous Boards shall, as far as practicable, be given an
opportunity to express their views before any direction is given under this
sub-section.
(2) The decision of the Central Government whether a question is one of policy or not shall be final.
44. The Central Government may give such directions, as it may deem necessary, to a State
Government for carrying out all or any of the provisions of this Act and the State Government shall
comply with such directions.
32. The aforesaid contention need not detain us, as suffice it to say that Section 14 of the 2020 Act
itself contains a provision for admission to B.H.M.S course through NEET. The Act itself requires
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140557780/ 15
Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
holding of NEET for admission to the course. Therefore, in any case, the aforesaid contention made
on behalf of the petitioners does not render the provision Sections 43 and 44 of the 2020 Act bad in
law. Therefore, the challenge to the validity of the aforesaid provisions also fails.
33. The validity of Section 55(2)(m) of the 2020 Act has been assailed on the ground that the same
does not permit the Central Government to issue advisory instructions to the National Testing
Agency. Section 55(2)(m) reads as under:
55. (1) The Commission may, by notification, make regulations consistent with this
Act and the rules made thereunder to carry out the provisions of this Act.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such regulations
may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely:--
(m) the manner of conducting common counselling by the designated authority for
admission to the postgraduate seats in all medical institutions under sub-section (3)
of section 16;
34. Even assuming that Section 55(2)(m) of the 2020 Act does not authorize the Central
Government to give advisory / instructions to National Testing Agency, the provision itself cannot
be struck down. At the most, order, if any, issued under the said provision can be struck down.
Therefore, challenge of the petitioners to the power to frame Regulations in the matter of
conducting the common counselling by designated authority for admission to post graduate seats in
all medical institutions does not suffer from any infirmity. The aforesaid challenge is also repelled.
35. Now we may advert to the challenge made to the Regulations on the ground that the same is hit
by principles of proportionality. It is trite law that there is a presumption in favour of
constitutionality or validity of a subordinate legislation and the burden is on the person who
challenges the same. A subordinate legislation can be assailed on any of the following grounds:
(i) Lack of legislative competence.
(ii) Violation of fundamental rights.
(iii) Violation of any provisions of the Constitution.
(iv) Failure to conform to the parent statute.
(v) Repugnancy to the laws of the land.
(vi) Manifest arbitrariness / unreasonableness to an extent where the Court might well say that
legislature never intended to give authority to make such rules. [See: 'DENTAL COUNCIL OF INDIA
VS. BIYANI SHIKSHAN SAMITI', (2022) 6 SCC 65]
36. The 2022 Regulations have been framed in exercise of powers under Section 55(2) of the 2020
Act. The challenge to the Regulation made on behalf of the petitioners does not fall in any of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140557780/ 16
Karnataka State Private Homeopathic ... vs The Union Of India on 3 March, 2023
aforementioned grounds. Regulation 4 provides for eligibility criteria for admission and manner of
admission, which does not suffer from any infirmity much less by doctrine of proportionality. The
challenge to the validity of the 2022 Regulations also fails and is hereby repelled.
37. Now we may deal with the contention of the petitioners that the guidelines dated 18.10.2022 as
well as Regulations dated 06.12.2022 do not have a retrospective operation and cannot apply to
admission process, which was already commenced on 17.07.2022. It is trite law that every statute
shall be construed as prima facie prospective unless expressly or by necessary implication it is made
to have a retrospective operation. A power conferred to make a subordinate legislation must be
exercised in conformity with the parent Act. A subordinate legislation can be given a retrospective
effect and operation if any power in this behalf contained in the main Act. [See: 'HUKUM CHAND
VS. UNION OF INDIA', (1972) 2 SCC 601, 'MAHABIR VEGETABLE OILS P. LTD. VS. STATE OF
HARYANA', (2006) 3 SCC 620, VICE CHANCELLOR M.D.UNIVERSITY ROHTAK VS. JAHAN
SINGH (2007) 5 SCC 77 and 'FEDERATION OF INDIAN MINERAL INDUSTRIES AND OTHERS
VS. UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER', (2017) 16 SCC 186].
38. From perusal of Section 55 of the 2020 Act, which deals with power to make Regulations, it is
evident that the same does not confer any power to frame Regulations with retrospective effect. The
Regulations dated 06.02.2022 do not provide that they would operate from any anterior date.
Similarly, the guidelines dated 18.10.2022 issued in exercise of powers under Section 43 and 44 of
the 2020 Act also cannot apply to process of admission, which was already commenced on
17.07.2022. It is noteworthy that Government order dated 13.10.2022 was passed after consulting
the petitioners. The petitioners in pursuance of aforesaid order have admitted the students in their
quota of seats. Therefore, the same binds the petitioners.
39. In view of preceding analysis, our conclusions are as under:
(i) Sections 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 43, 44 and 55(2)(m) of the National Commission for
Homeopathy Act, 2020 are valid and constitutional.
(ii) The National Commission for
Homeopathy (Homeopathy Degree Course -
B.H.M.S) Regulation, 2022 are also intra vires.
(iii) The guidelines framed by Ministry of Ayush dated 18.10.2022 and the
Regulations framed by National Commission for Homeopathy dated 06.12.2022 do
not apply to the process of admission to B.H.M.S under graduate course which have
already commenced on 19.07.2022.
(iv) The Government Order dated
13.12.2022 making the 2022 Regulations
applicable in respect of admission to B.H.M.S. under graduate course for academic
session 2022-23 is quashed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140557780/ 17

(v) The petitioners shall be permitted to admit students on remaining vacant seats on
the basis of academic eligibility for the academic session 2022-23 only.
With the aforesaid directions, the writ petition is disposed of.
