ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 17-10-2025
1. The Writ petition is filed for the
following reliefs:-
1. For issuance of an
appropriate writ/order/direction to
quash the letter No. 692 dated
19.09.2018
issued by District Magistrate-Cum-President of District Selection Committee, Kaimur at Bhabua by
which, he has alloted to PDS shops pertaining to Bhagwanpur Block, District- Kaimur which was
mentioned at Sl. No. 25 of the selection list.
1/A. That the petitioner further prays for issuance of any other appropriate writ/order/direction
upon the respondent authorities to consider the case of the petition for issuance of license for PDS
against the U/R Kota. Patna High Court CWJC No.17120 of 2019 dt.17-10-2025 1/B. That the
petitioner further prays for issuance of any other appropriate writ/order/direction to which, he is
found entitled to.
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016

Dharmendra Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 17 October, 2025
provides for the provision of revision. Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the
license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of
the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub- Patna High Court CWJC No.17120 of 2019
dt.17-10-2025 clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the Writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee, he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the Patna High Court CWJC
No.17120 of 2019 dt.17-10-2025 same has lapsed. He prayed for a direction to the concerned
authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the Writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within two months from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the complaint/ application shall be condoned by the authority
concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within three months from the date of filing of
the same.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
