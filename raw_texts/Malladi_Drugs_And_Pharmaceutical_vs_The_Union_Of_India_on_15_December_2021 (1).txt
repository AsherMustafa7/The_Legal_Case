Malladi Drugs And Pharmaceutical ... vs The Union Of India on 15 December, 2021
2. The petitioner company has manufacturing unit at State Industries Promotion Corporation of
Tamil Nadu (herein after called as “SIPCOT”) industrial complex, Ranipet, Vellore District and it
carries manufacturing activities of Ephedrine Pseudoephedrine and Phenylephrine. It is situated at
14.26 acres and an additional area 12.22 acres for the purpose of green belt which is necessary for
compliance with environmental norms. The said land was originally purchased by the petitioner
from the SIPCOT. While being so, the fourth respondent conducted a survey relating to the
acquisition of land for Chittoor – Ranipet NH4. Thereafter, the notification has been issued in the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Central Government, union gazette in Ref No.594, S.O.No.674(C)
under Part II, section 3 sub section 2 dated 15.02.2018. The first respondent also issued notification
under Section 3A(1) of the Nation Highways Act, 1956 (herein after called as “the Act”) dated
06.03.2018, thereby proposed to acquire lands, a part of which the petitioner's land comprised in
survey Nos.263/2A, 263/2B, 263/3A1A, 263/A1B, 263/3A2, 263/3B, 263/3C, 264/2, 264/3A,
264/3B, 266/2, 266/4, 267/3, 283/1A1, 285/1B of Vanapadi Village, Walajapet Taluk, Vellore
District. The said notification under 3A(1) of the Act, dated 06.03.2018 was published in the
Newspaper viz., Dina Thanthi and Indian Express on the same date.
3. The proposed highway runs in the middle of the petitioner's premises and it bifurcates the
manufacturing unit of the petitioner and since the existing factory is an integrated unit, the
proposed acquisition would render the seamless integration redundant and will result in the closure
of the factory. Therefore, the petitioner made representation on 24.11.2018 and thereafter on
10.01.2019 made another representation. Since there was no reply from the respondents, the
petitioner made another representation dated 25.01.2019. Though the petitioner raised objections,
the petitioner is not against the acquisition proceeding but only seeks a realignment of the proposed
highway https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and requested for personal hearing. It was not
considered by the respondents as such, the petitioner company approached this Court in
W.P.No.4466 of 2019 challenging the notification issued under Section 3A(1) of the Act dated
06.03.2018.
4. While pending the Writ Petition, the petitioner's objections by representations were rejected by
the second respondent by an order dated 20.02.2019, stating that the alignment as proposed by the
respondents cannot be modified at this stage. Thereafter, the first respondent had issued
notification under sub section (2) of Section 3D of the Act, published in Central Government gazette
on 13.02.2019, declaring that the land specified shall vest absolutely with the Central Government,
free from encumbrances. Therefore, the petitioner filed petition to amend the prayer thereby
challenging the notification issued under Section 3D(2) of the Act. This Court by an order dated
11.03.2019 directed the respondents to consider the petitioner's objection/representation dated
04.02.2019 and also directed the technical expert body to look into the feasibility of accepting any
one of the alternative alignment plan suggested by the petitioner.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
5. Thereafter, the petitioner made representation on 29.04.2019 to the respondents 3 to 6 seeking
personal hearing to explain as to how the alignment proposed by NHAI would result in the factory
having to cease manufacturing activities and how the proposed alignment are only a minor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171977534/ 3
Malladi Drugs And Pharmaceutical ... vs The Union Of India on 15 December, 2021
adjustment to what is proposed by NHAI and demonstrate how the same is feasible and more
economical than the alignment that is sought to be implementation by the respondents. Thereafter,
the impugned order dated 07.05.2019 was passed by the fifth respondent for the reason that the
alternative alignment suggested by the petitioner cannot be considered.
6. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the impugned order
passed mechanically without application of mind and without giving opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner to explain and substantiate the alternate alignment plan. The alternative alignment plans
have been devised by the petitioner company by hiring experts. Therefore, the petitioner company
ought to have been given a fair opportunity to substantiate its merits. Though the petitioner made
several representations seeking opportunity of hearing, the same were not considered before passing
the impugned order. Therefore, it violates the principles of natural justice and the impugned order
cannot be sustained.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 6.1. He further submitted that when this Court specifically
directed the respondents to appoint technical expert body to take decision with regard to
realignment of the proposed road, the petitioner should have been given opportunity before passing
the impugned order. Further, the finding in the impugned order pertaining to the feasibility of
alternative alignment plans lack clarity, reason or any application of mind and without considering
the reasons stated by the petitioner, the impugned order has been passed. The alignment proposed
by the fifth respondent would result in the factory having to cease manufacturing activities and the
proposed alignments are only minor adjustment and it would be more economical, feasible and
useful to all general public.
6.2. He also submitted that as per the realignment plan submitted by the petitioner, no building will
be affected and only in the vacant land, the proposed road will be laid. The petitioner company has
obtained 39 licenses and permission to operate the unit from various State and Central Government
Departments and therefore after demolition of the structures, the unit will not be granted fresh
approval, permission and licenses. If the proposed alignment of the road accepted, the
manufacturing facility will have to be shut down and livelihood of the the employees would be put in
peril and that the action of the respondents hit by Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7. Per contra, the fifth respondent filed counter and the leanrned Standing Counsel submitted that
the Government of India by the notification dated 15.02.2018 has published gazette under Section
3A(1) of the Act and substance of notification was also published on 15.03.2018, inviting objections
from the interested persons. However, the petitioner has not submitted any objection as against the
acquisition proceedings, within the prescribed time limit of 21 days viz., on or before 04.04.2018 for
considering under Section 3C(2) of the Act, enquiry. On receipt of the report from the fourth
respondent, the first respondent had published declaration notification under Section 3D(1) of the
Act, dated 13.02.2019, including the petitioner's land. After the said notification, the entire land vest
with the Central Government free from all encumbrances. Subsequently, the petitioner made
representation vide suggesting alternate alignments with the request to realign the alignment which
was notified under Section 3A(1) of the Act dated 15.03.2018. Since the alternate proposal was not in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171977534/ 4
Malladi Drugs And Pharmaceutical ... vs The Union Of India on 15 December, 2021
conformity with the IRC guidelines and against the technical design of Detailed Project Report
(herein after called as “DPR”) of the consultant, the petitioner was informed on 07.05.2019 that the
proposal cannot be accepted.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 7.1. The subject land is situated at 115.830 Km., and was abutting
the existing national highways. As per DPR, a bypass to Ranipet town has been proposed from
106.800 Km., to 116.900 Km. As per DPR, the new alignments has been proposed about 10.60 m
from the existing national highway and the alignments has been fixed with minimal land acquisition
in petitioner's land without compromising geometry & IRC standards and specifications for four
lane national highways. Therefore, the proposed alignment has been fixed judiciously in accordance
with the requirement of road widening by complying the IRC guidelines. As per the alignment, an
extent of 17.159 sq.m., has been proposed for land acquisition out of total extent of 1,42,185 sq.m.,
belonging to the petitioner which is abutting the edge of the factory. The DPR Consultant prepared
land plan schedule as per approved alignment by avoiding major part of the petitioner land without
compromising geometrics. The alignment has been fixed with minimal acquisition of petitioner's
land by keeping the alignment in the rear end of the factory.
7.2. While pending this Writ Petition, this Court by an order dated 17.12.2019, directed the fifth
respondent to provide opportunity of personal hearing along with its experts to make suggestions
for the alternate alignment plans on 03.01.2020. In compliance with the direction of this Court, the
fifth https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis respondent had constituted a technical Committee to explore
the feasibility to adopt the suggested alignment of the petitioner, consisting of D.S.Arvind, Joint
Advisor, D.V.Narayan, G.M.(Tech), PD Krishnagir and N.Varadarajan, D.G.M (Tech), PD, Salem.
The meeting was held by the Committee comprising the Technical Officers along with General
Manager of DPR Consultant M/s. Secon Private Limited on 03.01.2020, with the representatives of
the petitioner. In fact, the petitioner company's Vice President, enquired about the method adopted
in finalizing the alignment. In response, the General Manager of DPR Consultant, mentioned that
the alignment will be finalized duly taking into consideration of technical parameters such as speed,
geometric requirements with minimum impacts on the buildings, forest area, water bodies etc.
Accordingly, the most feasible alignment was finalized and sent to the third respondent.
7.3. In that meeting the distance of flare post i.e., about 19 m., from the proposed ROW and 27 m.,
from the proposed carriage way approved alignment was discussed. It was also mentioned by the
General Manager of DPR Consultant that the flare post of TCL & Ultramarines Industries situated
adjoining to the petitioner company exists very close to existing road about 13- 16m. Therefore, the
Committee explained that as the alignment was already https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis approved
in 2013 duly following various procedures, the land acquisition process also completed upto Section
3D of the Act and the enquiries under Section 3G is over. It is difficult at this stage for modification
of alignment as the same will result in realigning about 1.5 km., length. The modification also will
affect other land owners, which may lead to litigation. On the request made by the petitioner, the
Committee decided to meet again after receipt of the details which were submitted by the petitioner.
7.4. Again, the second meeting was held on 07.03.2020, on receipt of the details from the petitioner.
The Committee explained that the area required for composting could be accommodated in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171977534/ 5
Malladi Drugs And Pharmaceutical ... vs The Union Of India on 15 December, 2021
remaining area modifying the alignment for an extent of 1.8 km., at this juncture is not possible as
3D activities are already completed and further proceedings would delay the project and also
public/legal problem. Therefore, the petitioner was suggested to examine alternative plan to
accommodate the composting yards in the left over area and carrying the effluent generated from
the plant to compositing yards through utility ducts, which can be accommodated under the
proposed alignment. Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the modification in the alignment
approved during 2013 is not feasible at this juncture, as substantial land acquisition activities upto
3D stage and also enquires under 3G also https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis completed. Hence, the
learned Standing Counsel appearing for the fifth respondent submitted that the request of the
petitioner cannot be considered at this stage and prayed for dismissal of this Writ Petition. In
support of his contention, the learned Standing Counsel appearing for the fifth respondent relied
upon the following reported judgments :-
(i) 2011 (12) SCC 69 – Union of India Vs. Kushala Shetty
(ii) 1997 (1) SCC 134 – Ramniklal N. Bhutta & anr Vs. State of Maharashtra & ors.

9. The Government of India vide gazette No.1159 S.O.1728(E) dated 12.05.2016 has issued 3(a)
notification for appointment of CALA, Vellore as Competent Authority for acquisition of additional
land required for the project of Ranipet/Walajahpet – Tamil Nadu/Andhra Pradesh border section
of NH-4. After approval of proposed alignment the Special District Revenue Officer & CALA, Vellore
has submitted draft 3A notification including the petitioner's lands in the survey Nos.263/2A for an
extent is 235 sq.mt., and 285/1B extent is 9148 sq.mt., in Vanapadi Village, Walajah Taluk, The
Government of India vide S.O.674(D) dated 15.02.2018 has published Gazette under Section 3-A(1)
of the Act and the substance of notification was also published in two local dailies viz., Indian
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171977534/ 6
Malladi Drugs And Pharmaceutical ... vs The Union Of India on 15 December, 2021
Express and Daily Thanthi on 15.03.2018, inviting objections from the interested persons under
Section 3C of the Act. However, the petitioner did not submit any objections as against the
acquisition proceedings within the prescribed time limit of 21 days i.e., on or before 04.04.2018 for
considering in equiry under Section 3C(2) of the Act.
10. Thereafter, on receipt of the report from the fourth respondent, the first respondent herein
published the declaration notification under Section 3D(1) of the Act in the gazette of Government
of India vide S.O.865(E) dated 13.02.2019 including the petitioners lands in survey Nos.263/3B2,
623/3C2, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 263/3C3, 264/2B, 264/3A2, 264/3B2, 266/1B, 266/2B,
266/4B, 267/3B, 283/1A1B & 285/1B2 in Vanapadi Village, Walajapet Taluk, Vellore District. The
petitioner challenged the notification dated 06.03.2018 under Section 3A(1) of the Act in
W.P.No.4466 of 2019. While pending the Writ Petition, the notification under Section 3D(2) of the
Act was published on 13.02.2019. Therefore, the petitioner amended the prayer challenging the
notification issued under Section 3D(2) of the Act. Further, by an order dated 11.03.2019, this Court
directed the technical expert body to look into the feasibility of accepting any one of the alternative
alignment plans submitted by the petitioner, with other directions as follows:-
“11. Therefore, in the present case, by consent of both the parties, this Court directed
the technical expert body to look into the feasibility of accepting any one of the
alternative alignment plan stated by the petitioner company. But, considering the
limited scope of the request made by the petitioner herein, this Court is inclined to
pass the following orders:
(i) The respondents are directed to consider t he petitioner objections/
representation dated 04.02.2019 and to take a decision and communicated dated
04.02.2019 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and to take a decision and
communicate the said decision to the petitioner within four weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order.
(ii) It is made clear that in the terms of the notification vide
Ref.No.Na.Ka.No.G4/2/2016, dated 06.03.2018, and notification under sub Section
(2) of Section 3D of the National Highways Act, 1956, dated 13.02.2019 are subject to
the decision of the expert report.
(iii) The Writ Petition is disposed of with the above direction. No costs. Consequently,
the connected Writ Miscellaneous petitions are closed.
(iv) Till the final decision is taken in respect of the above said objection/
representation made by the petitioner, the respondents shall no take any coercive
action against the petitioner” This Court specifically directed the respondents to
consider the petitioner's request and take decision and communicate the said
decision to the petitioner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171977534/ 7
Malladi Drugs And Pharmaceutical ... vs The Union Of India on 15 December, 2021
11. Accordingly, as directed by this Court, the fifth respondent considered the petitioner's
representation and forwarded to the DPR Consultant M/s. Secon Private Limited by a letter dated
30.03.2019. The DPR Consultant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis had examined the suggested
alternate alignment and recommended that “the alternate alignment proposal No.1 passes through
eight number of building and as such it cannot be considered at this state. Insofar as the alternate
alignment No.2, is of poor geometrics. Therefore, the proposal alignments suggested by the
petitioner is not suitable for national highways design. The said proposal requires additional
acquisition in order to maintain proper geometrics to comply IRC guidelines to maintain road safety
and the desired speed level. It also results in initiation of the land acquisition process afresh,
detailed studies, which is time consuming and delays the implementation of the project. Therefore,
the request for realignment of the road has been rejected by the fifth respondent and the same has
been challenged in this Writ Petition.
12. While pending this Writ Petition, as directed by this Court by an Order dated 17.12.2019, the fifth
respondent constituted a Technical Committee consisting of D.S.Arvind, Joint Advisor,
D.V.Narayan, G.M.(Tech), PD Krishnagir and N.Varadarajan, D.G.M (Tech), PD, Salem and
thereafter the Committee convened meeting on 03.01.2020 with the representatives of the
petitioner. Finally the Committee intimated as follows:-
“13.7........the distance of flare stack will be about 20m from the ROW and 27 m from
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis proposed carriage way, also as the area
required for composting could be accommodated in the remaining area modifying the
alignment for an extent of 1.8 Km at this juncture is not possible as 3(D) activities are
already completed and further revision would delay the project considerably and also
result in public/legal problems as this may also lead to litigating with other affected
land owners as well as newly affected land owners. Accordingly M/s.MDPL was
suggested to examine the alternative plan of accommodating the composting yards in
the left over area and carrying the effluent generated from the plant to composting
yards through utility ducts, which can be accommodated under the proposed
alignment.” Therefore, the Committee requested the petitioner to submit Pollution
Control Board approval and concluded that the modifications in the alignment
approved during 2013 is not feasible at this juncture.
13. That apart, though this Court directed the respondents to consider the petitioner's
representation by the technical experts to explore the possibility of utilizing the alternative land, it
doesn't mean that the expert Committee https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis should consider about
the effect on the petitioner's factory premises, if the proposed alignment of road laid. Thus, the fifth
respondent rightly considered the request of the petitioner and passed the order dated 07.05.2019.
In fact, while pending this Writ Petition, on the request of the petitioner, this Court directed the fifth
respondent to form a Committee of experts and accordingly, the Committee was formed and
conducted detail enquiry by two meetings and finally concluded that the modification in the
alignments approved during 2013 is not feasible. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
petitioner vehemently contended that the very same authority viz., the fifth respondent herein,
without even forming a Committee of experts from the outside, passed impugned order. Further the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171977534/ 8
Malladi Drugs And Pharmaceutical ... vs The Union Of India on 15 December, 2021
fifth respondent only initiated the proposed alignment of road on the petitioner's factory. Therefore,
the same fifth respondent should not have considered the request made by the petitioner.
14. In this regard, the learned Standing Counsel appearing for the fifth respondent relied upon the
judgment reported in 2011 (12) SCC 69 in the case of Union of India Vs. Kushala Shetty in which, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that NHAI is a professionally managed statutory body having
expertise in the field of development and maintenance of National Highways. The projects involving
construction of new highways and widening and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis development of
the existing highways, which are vital for development of infrastructure in the country, are entrusted
to experts in the field of highways. It comprises of persons having vast knowledge and expertise in
the field of highway development and maintenance. NHAI prepares and implements projects
relating to development and maintenance of National Highways after thorough study by experts in
different fields. Detailed project reports are prepared keeping in view the relative factors including
intensity of heavy vehicular traffic and larger public interest. The Courts are not at all equipped to
decide upon the viability and feasibility of the particular project and whether the particular
alignment would subserve the larger public interest. In such matters, the scope of judicial review is
very limited. The Court can nullify the acquisition of land and, in rarest of rare cases, the particular
project, if it is found to be ex-facie contrary to the mandate of law or tainted due to mala fides.
15. That apart, it is well settled that the Court will not normally transgress in to the field of policy
decision or opinion of experts of the particular field. The Court cannot make a rowing enquiry as to
whether a public policy is wise and whether better public policy can be involved. In the absence of
any malafide or unreasonableness or unfairness, the decision of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis authorities cannot be faulted at all. Therefore, this Court finds no
infirmity or illegality in the order passed by the fifth respondent and this Writ Petition is devoid of
merits and is liable to be dismissed.
16. Accordingly, the Writ Petition stands dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous
petitions are closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
