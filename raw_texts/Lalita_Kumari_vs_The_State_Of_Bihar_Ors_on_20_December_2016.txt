Lalita Kumari vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 20 December, 2016
The writ petitioner has moved the Court for quashing
Patna High Court CWJC No.16753 of 2016 dt.20-12-2016
2/6
of order dated 19.09.2006, passed by the respondent no. 7 in Case
No. 10 of 2016, by which the petitioner has been declared to be
disqualified from the post of Mukhiya of Panchayat Raj, Chakwa
Bharwari, Block-Baheri, District-Darbhanga and the seat has been
held to be vacant with a direction that the same be filled up in
accordance with law.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
though her date of birth recorded in the Matriculation certificate is
15.01.1996
, but the same is an error for which steps have been taken for correction. He submitted that the
Nagar Panchayat, Bakhtiyarpur had issued a birth certificate in which the date was recorded as
05.01.1993 and in the Aadhar Card also, the date of birth recorded is 05.01.1993. Similarly, he
submitted that in the transfer certificate issued by the school, the date of birth is recorded as
05.01.1993. Learned counsel submitted that once there was a dispute with regard to the date of birth
and there were documents to show that she was born in January, 1993, the respondent no. 7 ought
not to have interfered in the matter as recording of the date of birth in the matriculation certificate
is a rebuttable fact and is not a conclusive proof of the date. He further submitted that even the
power to go into the question of disqualification based on the date of birth is beyond the jurisdiction
of the respondent no. 7, as such dispute can only be Patna High Court CWJC No.16753 of 2016
dt.20-12-2016 adjudicated in an election petition as the petitioner having been elected and given
certificate has also assumed office of the post of Mukhiya. Learned counsel submitted that the
respondent no. 7 has not considered the documents produced on behalf of the petitioner while
passing the impugned order and, thus, the same cannot be sustained. Learned counsel further
submitted that if in future, it is held that the entry of the date of birth in the Matriculation certificate
is erroneous, the petitioner would have suffered irreparable loss as she cannot turn the clock back
and, thus, would have lost the period even though being eligible for being elected as a Mukhiya.
Learned counsel appearing for the respondents no. 5 to 7, submitted that the power to go into such
aspect flows from the statute which in turn has the sanction and backing of the Constitution of
India. He submitted that Article 243-F(1) of the Constitution of India lays down in clear terms that
the minimum age for a person to be qualified for membership of a Panchayat is 21 years. He further

Lalita Kumari vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 20 December, 2016
submitted that if with regard to the same, there is any question for deciding such disqualification, it
shall be referred for the decision of such authority and in such manner as the Legislature of a State
may, by law, provide. It was submitted that in terms of such constitutional provision, the State
Legislature in its wisdom has enunciated the disqualifications in Section 136(1) of the Bihar
Panchayat Raj Act, Patna High Court CWJC No.16753 of 2016 dt.20-12-2016 2006 (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Act') in which it has clearly been written that a person shall be disqualified for
election or after election for holding the post, meaning thereby that even after election, such
disqualification can be gone into. He submitted that Section 136(2) of the Act clearly provides that
the matter relating to disqualification shall be considered by the State Election Commission either in
the form of a compliant, application or information by any person or authority or even suo motu. It
was submitted that in the present case, the petitioner was noticed, upon receipt of complaint from
respondent no. 8, and after hearing the parties, the order has been passed. He further submitted
that from the order impugned itself, it is clear that all documents, on which the petitioner has placed
reliance, have been mentioned and considered. Learned counsel submitted that even the Courts
have held that the probative value of date of birth in Matriculation certificate has greater evidentiary
value compared to the certificate issued by the Mukhiya, Headmaster of the local school or a local
doctor. For such proposition, he has relied upon Division Bench judgments of this Court in the case
of Annu Kumari vs. State Election Commission reported as 2014(4) PLJR 667; Smt. Sudha Kumari
vs. State Election Commission reported as 2015(4) PLJR 249 and an unreported decision in the case
of Rani Devi vs. The State Election Commission & Ors. in L.P.A. No. 267 of 2013 dated Patna High
Court CWJC No.16753 of 2016 dt.20-12-2016 06.03.2013.
Having considered the rival contentions, this court does not find any merit in the present writ
application. The admitted position is that the petitioner had passed the Matriculation Examination
in the year 2011 and as per the date of birth recorded in such certificate, he was born on 15.01.1996.
That entry remains till date and the plea that such entry is erroneous and for which steps have
already been taken for correction, would not be of much relevance for the simple reason that more
than five years have passed before the petitioner has made any effort to get the entry corrected,
which clearly is a result of the adverse effect of such an entry in light of the pendency of the
complaint against her with regard to her being underage and, thus, disqualified for the post of
Mukhiya. Even the birth certificate issued by the Nagar Panchayat, Bakhtiyarpur is dated
17.06.2016, i.e., much after the nomination and election and so cannot be said to be an
unimpeachable document or a contemporaneous document. The admitted position being that before
the respondent no. 7, there being various documents, reliance placed on the entry made in the
Matriculation certificate, in the considered opinion of this Court was the best document to be relied
upon in view of it having greater probative value compared to any other certificate. Such view finds
support in the judgment of the Division Benches of Patna High Court CWJC No.16753 of 2016
dt.20-12-2016 this Court in the cases referred to by learned counsel for the respondents no. 5 to 7.
As far as the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner that if in future a correction is made
with regard to the date of birth in the Matriculation certificate, the petitioner would have suffered,
the Court can only observe that it would be only on account of laches on the part of the petitioner
herself, inasmuch as, the Matriculation certificate was issued in the year 2011 and despite that she
did not to move the authority concerned for any correction soon thereafter. This is also indicative of

her conduct where she wanted to have an alternate certificate by which she gets an advantage of
three years in future for any employment.
In view of the discussions made hereinabove and taking an overall view of the matter, the Court
does not find any error in the order impugned so as to warrant any interference.
Accordingly, the writ application stands dismissed.
