IN THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
AT JABALPUR
WP No. 4783 of 2023
(VAISHALI WADHWANI AND OTHERS Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND OTHERS)
Dated : 08-05-2023
Shri Sanjay Kumar Agrawal - Advocate for the petitioners.
Shri Rohit Jain - Govt. Advocate for respondent No.1.
Shri Parag Tiwari - Advocate for respondent No.2.
This petition is filed on the ground that preliminary examination was conducted on 12/01/2020 by
the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission for recruiting persons to various posts under the
M.P. State Civil Services. Result of preliminary examination was declared on 21/12/2020.
Petitioners had cleared that exam then main exam was conducted between 21/2/2021 and
26/06/3/2021. Petitioner had cleared that main exam also for which result was declared on
31/12/2021.
It is submitted that in the meanwhile, Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in W.P. No.542/2021
decided on 7th April, 2022 held that even reserve category candidates are entitled to seek migration
from reserve category to general category on the basis of their merits, therefore, taking this decision
in consideration, respondents have revised the merit list and have held petitioners to be not eligible
even for main examination. It is submitted that this exercise conducted behind back of the
petitioners has caused prejudice to the petitioner inasmuch as earlier Hon'ble Division Bench of this
High Court in W.P. No.8750/2022 after considering the judgment passed by another Division
Bench in W.P. No.542/2021 on 7th April, 2022 vide its order dated 02/01/2023 held that
preliminary examination is only a screening test and, therefore, migration will not be permissible.
Taking this judgment into consideration which has considered the earlier judgment dated 7th April,
2022, it is submitted that revision of result of the preliminary examination on a subsequent decision
from a retrospective effect is uncalled for.
Since petitioners have already qualified the main exam, they cannot be debarred from undertaking
the interview and that interview be made subject to outcome of this writ petition.

Though this contention put forth by Shri Sanjay K. Agrawal is challenged by Shri Parag Tiwari,
learned counsel for respondent No.2,-M.P. Public Service Commission, but, prima facie, there
appears to be substance in the arguments. Firstly, whether the decision dated 7th April, 2022 can be
applied retrospectively is the moot question even if its validity as has been doubted by the
subsequent decision in W.P. No.8750/2022 is overlooked for the moment in hypothetical manner.
Secondly, the fact is that once petitioners had cleared the prelims and main examination, then can
they be debarred on the basis of the subsequent judgment i.e. whether the decision dated 7th April,
2022 will have retrospective application or will be prospective in nature. Third question is that
whether those candidates who were permitted to migrate presuming the validity and correctness of
the decision dated 7th April, 2022 to be intact, then can the authorities still revise the result
retrospectively or they are required to create supernumerary slots for accommodating such
migration without adversely affecting the rights of the petitioners or similarly situated persons who
had cleared the prelims as per those parameters which were applicable at the time of declaration of
result and thereafter succeeded in main exam also.
These being the issues which needs to be answered by the respondents, let respondents permit the
petitioners to participate in the interview subject to the outcome of this petition and file their
additional reply within four weeks.
List this case in week commencing 19th June, 2023.
