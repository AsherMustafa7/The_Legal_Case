The Central Agricultural University ... vs Shri Gopal Bhandari on 30 January, 2023
ORDER (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] The Central Agricultural University, Manipur, and its officials filed this writ
petition aggrieved by the order dated 13.05.2016 passed by the Central
Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, in O.A. No. 040/00155/2015. The said
Page 1 O.A. was filed by the respondents herein assailing their termination from
service under orders dated 16.03.2015. By its order dated 13.05.2016, the Tribunal
noted that the University and its officials had shown little interest in contesting the
O.A. and had not even filed a reply, justifying the termination orders, and held on
facts that the termination of the applicants before it was in violation of the principles
of natural justice and contrary to the stipulation made in their appointment letters.
The termination orders dated 16.03.2015 were accordingly set aside and the
University and more particularly, the Registrar of the University, was directed to
reinstate them immediately along with consequential benefits.
By order dated 07.10.2016 passed in this writ petition, a Division Bench of this Court
suspended the operation of the order dated 13.05.2016 passed by the Tribunal. On
16.11.2016, the interim order dated 07.10.2016 was directed to continue until further
orders and is presently operative. [2] Heard Mr. BP Sahu, learned senior counsel,
appearing for the petitioners, viz., the University and its officials; and Mr. H.
Maipaksana, learned counsel for the respondents, viz., the applicants in the O.A. [3]
Advertisement No. 2 of 2012 dated 15.06.2012 was issued by the Central Agricultural
University, Manipur, inviting applications for filling up the posts of Library Assistant
(1 post), Live Stock/Farm Assistant (2 posts), Field- cum-Lab Assistant (5 posts) ,
Medical Attendant (1 post), Driver(2 posts), Handyman-cum-cleaner(1 post) and
Multi Tasking Staff {(Field-cum-Lab Attendant/Cook/Helper/Messenger etc.)(6
posts)}. These posts were at the College of Agricultural Engineering and Post Harvest
Technology, Ranipool, Sikkim. The Advertisement did not indicate that the posts
were temporary in Page 2 nature or were contiguous with any particular scheme. The
respondents herein were selected and appointed as Multi Tasking Staff (Helpers) vide
orders dated 23.09.2013. Their appointment as Helpers was stated to have been
made under the All India Co-ordinated Research Project (AICRP) on RES at the
College of Agricultural Engineering and Post Harvest Technology, Ranipool, Sikkim.
They were put on the pay-scale of (cid:128). 5,200-20,200 with Grade Pay of (cid:128). 1,800.
However, their appointment orders contained Condition No.3 which read thus:
"3. The appointment is till the continuation of the project by ICAR and co-terminus
with the project and he will have no claim for permanent absorption /appointment in
the university."

The Central Agricultural University ... vs Shri Gopal Bhandari on 30 January, 2023
It is the case of the University that the Project Coordinator (AICRP) on Renewable Resources of
Energy for Agriculture and Agro-based Industries, ICAR/CIAE/Bhopal, intimated it by letter dated
01.01.2015 that the ICAR had decided to close the Centre of the AICRP on RES located at Gangtok
with effect from 01.04.2015. In consequence thereof, the University issued orders dated 16.03.2015
to both the respondents, quoting the aforestated Condition No. 3 in their appointment orders, and
informed them that their services were no longer required and would stand terminated with effect
from 31.03.2015. It is against these orders that the respondents approached the Tribunal. [4] As
already stated supra, the University and its officials did not even choose to contest the case before
the Tribunal by filing a reply. Thereupon, the Tribunal noted the contents of the Advertisement
dated 15.06.2012 and the fact that the respondents were placed on probation for a period of 2 years
from the date of their joining and inferred that their appointment was in the nature of a Page 3
regular appointment. Opining thus, the Tribunal set aside the termination orders dated 16.03.2015
and granted them relief.
[5] Mr. H. Maipaksana, learned counsel for the respondents, contended before this Court that others
who had been selected and appointed pursuant to the Advertisement dated 15.06.2012 were
retained in service even though they were less meritorious than his clients. This Court accordingly
directed the University to produce the merit list of the candidates who appeared pursuant to the
Advertisement dated 15.06.2012. With great reluctance and after a number of adjournments, the
University finally produced the said merit list. Perusal thereof reflects that 501 applications were
received against the 6 posts of Multi Tasking Staff notified vide the Advertisement dated 15.06.2012.
After shortlisting by the duly constituted Screening Committee, interview calls were issued to 90
candidates and 81 (ST-14, OBC-27 and Gen-40) candidates appeared for the interviews on
08.05.2013 before the Selection Committee. Based on the academic records, relevant work
experience, skill test and performance in the interview, the Committee recommended 6 candidates
for appointment to the 6 notified posts of Multi Tasking Staff: Sonam Bhutia (41.90 Marks) was
appointed against the ST vacancy, while Gopal Bhandari (45.89 Marks) and Pawan Chettri (44.07),
the respondents herein, were appointed against the OBC vacancies. Sushanta Parida, Deepa
Pradhan and Anupama Chettri, with 49.51, 48.46 and 46.61 Marks respectively, were appointed
against the three general category vacancies. The merit list placed before this Court further reflects
that one Neeraj Kumar, who secured 41.88 marks, was included in the 3rd waiting list. Surprisingly,
the Selection Committee made no such recommendation, but the words - 'WLT' were noted against
the name of Neeraj Kumar.
Page 4 [6] Significantly, when Pawan Chettri, respondent No.2 herein, submitted an application to
the University under the Right to Information Act, 2005, with regard to the list of 17 candidates who
were selected against the Advertisement dated 15.06.2012, a tabular statement of 17 candidates was
furnished by the University, under its letter dated 01.07.2015. Perusal thereof reflects that, out of
the 17 candidates who were appointed against the said Advertisement, only Gopal Bandhari and
Pawan Chettri, the respondents herein, were terminated from service and all the others, including
Neeraj Kumar who was a waitlisted candidate, are being continued. Orders dated 23.09.2013 were
issued by the Central Agricultural University, Manipur, transferring Sandeep Kumar Banya,
Workshop Mate, and Sarina Thapa, Helper, from All India Coordinated Research Project on RES,
College of Agricultural Engineering and Post Harvest Technology, Ranipool, to the said College with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85245292/ 3

immediate effect. Both these persons were not even shown as wait-listed candidates in the merit list
and had, in fact, secured far lesser marks than the respondents (Sandeep Kumar Banya - 41.21
Marks; Sarina Thapa - 37.09 Marks) but they were continued in service. [7] It is therefore clear that
other employees who were appointed against the same time-bound scheme were transferred to
regular posts in the College but only the respondents were targeted for termination from service on
the ground that their appointment was contiguous with the scheme, as per Condition No. 3 in their
appointment orders.
[8] No doubt, the orders of appointment dated 23.09.2013 issued by the University to the others
who were selected against the Advertisement dated 15.06.2012 merely mentioned that their
appointment was temporary and could Page 5 be terminated by giving three months' notice without
referring to the appointment being contiguous with the scheme, as was mentioned in the case of the
respondents, but that by itself did not justify the University adopting a different stand against them.
Crucial to note, there was no mention of any time bound scheme in the Advertisement dated
15.06.2012 at all and the respondents were amongst the candidates directly selected by the Selection
Committee against the 6 notified posts. There is no explanation from the University as to why they
are subjected to contiguity with a time bound scheme when others who were waitlisted and
appointed thereafter, with far lesser marks, were subjected to favourable treatment by continuing
them in service in the College even after the winding up of the time bound scheme. This patent
discrimination clearly shows how the University is bestowing favours to candidates of its liking
despite their lower placement in the merit ranking and smacks of blatant arbitrariness. [9] In these
circumstances, we find no reason whatsoever to interfere with the order dated 13.05.2016 passed by
the Central Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, in O.A. No. 040/00155/2015 and the
consequential direction issued to the University and its officials to reinstate the respondents in
service with all consequential benefits.
W.P. (C) No. 765 of 2016 is accordingly dismissed.
Interim order dated 07.10.2016 shall stand vacated.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
