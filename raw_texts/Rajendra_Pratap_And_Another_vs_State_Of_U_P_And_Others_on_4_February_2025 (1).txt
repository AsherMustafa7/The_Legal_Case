Inter College Narhi, District Ballia was made in collusion with alleged accused persons sand some
payments have been made to persons accordingly. An inquiry was conducted regarding
irregularities conducted in appointments in said college vide Government Order dated 23.08.1994
and this fact came into light by inquiry carried out by CBCID that Sri Mangala Prasad Singh stopped
teaching work in the said college since January 1999 and remained absent for so many days, and
consequently he was removed from service by management of the college and payment of his salary
was stopped, even his salary bill were not produced. Said Mangala Singh working hand in glove with

for payment, which was submitted before the then District Inspector of Schools Smt. Ahmadi
Usman on which an order was passed by said District Inspector of Schools on 28.04.1999. On

14. FIR in the case was lodged vide Case Crime No.309 of 2003, under Sections 409, 419, 420,467,
468, 471, 201 and 120-B I.P.C. Police Station Kotwali, District Ballia against Khaderoo Ram,
Inspector CBCID against applicant Ram Pratap who was then District Inspector of Schools (in short
DIOS) in District Ballia and Dilip Kumar Pandey who was posted as Accounts Officer in district
together with other named accused persons under Sections 409, 419, 420,467, 468, 471, 201 and
120-B I.P.C. by the Investigating Officer after concluding the investigation with prayer to prosecute
them.
15. He next submitted that a bare perusal of the FIR in this case demonstrates that a letter was sent
to the State Government by the then SHO, P.S. Kotwali District Ballia in relation to the irregularity
in appointment made by aforesaid persons and consequently the State Government formed a
committee for the investigation and referred the matter for investigation. The Investigating Officer
during preliminary inquiry recorded the statement of some persons and submitted report and

affidavit, the other aspects of the case as he did not consider the fact that some payment of salary to
Mangala Singh and other assistant teachers had already been made under the directions of higher
authorities, and further initially payment has been made by earlier DIOS in the year 1995. As such
the ignorance of facts itself vitiate the entire proceedings against the applicants. The Investigating
Officer without considering the material facts filed chargesheet against the applicants together with
other accused persons, whereas the applicants had no concern with the appointment of said
teachers. The main allegation in the chargesheet are with regard to illegal appointment and payment
of salaries to the teachers. It is relevant to point out here that illegality in appointment and payment

b. Reference may be made to proceeding initiated by the teachers and employees of Narheji Inter
College Narhi, District Ballia where Surendra Nath Singh has been appointed as assistant teacher by
filing a writ petition before this Hon'ble Court vide writ petition No.18277 of 1996, which was filed
by certain staff of teachers, in that writ petition this Hon'ble Court directed to pay the salary to
teachers and other employees in accordance with law.
d. The Director of Education after issuing the notices to the Management, Principal as well as to the
teachers passed a detailed order on 05.08.1996, in which it has been held that in the institution
there are only 26 sanctioned posts and the teachers and employees working against the said
sanctioned posts are entitled to their salary. A copy of order dated 05.08.1996 of the Director of
Education is being filed herewith and marked as Annexure No.4 to the affidavit. The Director of
Education has referred the order of Hon'ble High Court passed on 24.05.19996 in Writ Petition
No.18277 of 1996 (U.P. Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh,Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia
through the Mangala Prasad Singh, Assistant Teacher and another Vs. State of U.P. through
Secretary Education and others) d. In contempt proceedings arising out for non compliance of the
order passed in Writ Petition No.18277 of 1996, in which this Hon'ble Court was pleased to pass a
detailed order and directed the State Government to form a high level committee, into the illegality
on appointment of teachers and employees in said college. This Hon'ble Court vide order dated
19.09.1996 further directed the State Government to fix responsibility regarding illegal appointment
of the teachers and employees of the institution initially. As per the direction of this Hon'ble court
dated 19.09.1996 the high level committed was formed consisting of Additional Director of
Education, Joint Secretary Education Department and Chief Accounts Officer etc. The high level
committed passed a detailed order after looking into the entire record of the institution as well as
sanctioned strength of post vide its order dated 08.07.1997. That in the order dated 08.07.1997 the
high level committee held that the appointment of Mangala Prasad Singh is against the sanctioned
post. The high level committed has further fixed responsibility on several persons. The name of the
applicant did not find place in that list. The copy of report of high level committee dated 08.07.1997
is annexed as Annexure No.5 to the affidavit.
e. The authority to sanction the posts and to make appointment is the Director of Education and
DIOS under the provisions of law. The appointment of Sri Surendra Nath Singh has been verified by
the Director of Education who was one of the members of the high level committee and the
appointment has been approved by the then DIOS. The investigation conducted by CBCID was not
fair on account of the fact that appointment of those teachers held valid by education department
and this fact was not looked into by the Investigating Officer. The observation of Investigating
Agency held that 116 posts in the institution is the result of malafide exercise with intention to
facilitated the management to get illegal payments from the State fund.
f. The appointment of Sri Mangala Singh was made against the sanctioned posts approved by the
DIOS and held valid by Director of Education as well as High Level Committee and the appointment
has been approved by then DIOS. The CBCID had no authority or jurisdiction to look into the
validity of appointment of Assistant teacher, to which the education department has not challenged
in any court of law to quash the same.

Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
g. He next submitted that there is no evidence against the applicants, what so ever to justify the fact
that they have discharges their duties in collusion of other officials and disobeyed the order of their
higher authorities, hence, the impugned chargesheet submitted by the investigating officer deserves
to be set-aside qua applicants.
h. That it is submitted that the charges of C.B.CID who proceeded with the investigation, was not
fair, on account of the fact that the appointment of those teachers has been held valid by the
Education Department, and this fact was not carefully looked into by the Investigating Agency. They
have clearly overlooked the decision of the High Level Committee and they further observed that the
appointment of teachers, which has already been held legal, as illegal, the motive of the
Investigating Agency is very much clear that the Investigation was done only to facilitate the
Manager of the Committee of Management of the College to get the illegal Payment from the State
Fund. Admittedly in the Institution as held by the Director of Education, as High Level Committee,
that there are only 126 sanctioned post, whereas the Investigating Agency has formulated 116 posts
in the Institution. On the basis of which they arrived at the collusion that in the Institution there are
116 posts, has not been disclosed. The power of creation of post vested with the Director of
Education and the Director of Education disclosed in its decision that in the Institution there are
only 126 posts sanctioned.
I. That the observations of the Investigating Agency holding there were 116 posts in the Institution is
the result of their malafide exercise with intention to facilitate the Management to get illegal
payment from the State Fund.
j. The ingredients to charges levelled against the applicants Under Sections 409, 419, 420,467, 468,
471, 201 and 120-B I.P.C. are not applicable in relation to the applicants, three is no evidence that
they have committed any criminal beach of trust cheating by false impersonation, cheating,
disappearance of evidence or forgery as a public servant, the payment has been made to said teacher
Surendra Nath Singh under the direction of higher authorities. There is no material to suggest that
the applicants have fabricated any documents nor there is any finding that direction of the Director
of Education for payment of salary to Surendra Nath Singh is forged. In so far as the payment of
salary to Sri Mangala Singh and Surendra Nath Singh are concerned, the salaries has been paid to
them pursuant to direction of Director of Education. Since the payment has been made under the
permission of superior authorities against the sanctioned post, as such, no illegality was committed
by the applicants in making the payment to Sri Mangala Singh and Surendra Nath Singh. The State
Government had issued direction for payment of salary to these teachers pursuant to order of this
Hon'ble Court, as such in making the payment of salary for compliance of order of this Hon'ble
Court no offence has been committed by the applicants.
k. That the applicant No.1 has joined the post of District Inspector of Schools, Ballia in the January
2002 and he remained in District Ballia till December 2002, whereas the applicant No.2 had joined
at District Ballia as Accounts Officer in the Nov. 2002 and he remained at Ballia till June 2003.
l. That so far as the payment of Sri Mangala Singh and Surendra Nath Singh are concerned,
thesalary has been released pursuant to the direction of the State Government as well as Director of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114427324/ 6
Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
Education. Since the payment has been made under the permission of the Superior Authority
against the sanctioned post, as such, no illegality was committed by the applicants in making the
payment of salary Sri Mangala Singh Sri Surendra Nath Singh.
m. That it is further noteworthy to state here that the State Government has issued a direction for
the payment of these two teachers in compliance with the order of this Hon'ble Court, as such, in
making the payment of salary in compliance of the order of Hon'ble Court is not offence in any
manner under the provisions of law, therefore, submission of the charge-sheet against the
applicants on account of payment of salary of these Assistant Teachers, whose payment has been
released in compliance of the order of this Hon'ble Court and direction of the Higher Authority is
illegal, and bad in law.
18. With above submissions, leaned counsel prayed for quashing the proceedings initiated against
the applicants by the court below in criminal case arisen out of investigation in the Case Crime No.
309 of 2003, Under Sections 409, 419, 420,467, 468, 471, 201 and 120-B I.P.C. Police Station
Kotwali, District Ballia before the criminal court concerned.
19. Per contra learned A.G.A. pressed the grounds taken in counter affidavit submitted that the
present applicant No.1 was working as DIOS Ballia and applicant No.2 was working as Account
Officer at the relevant point of time, and the alleged offences are made out against them. During the
course of investigation this fact came into picture that one person namely Mangala Singh, an alleged
assistant teacher in Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia was removed from the service after
due process of inquiry on the ground of misconduct as he ceased teaching work since 1999 and his
payment of salary by by the school was stopped. This person Mangala Singh prepared forged
documents with regard to his service book in conspiracy with the officials and employees of
education department and had got his bill of arrear forwarded to the superior authorities for arrear
of payment and also obtained promotion scale. He also submitted that it is well settled principle of
law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as by this Hon'ble Court in various judgments that
jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly in rarest of rare cases and after
meticulous of evidence collected during course of investigation, the grounds taken in the present
application are matter of trial. As such, the relief sought by the present applicants is misconceived
and devoid of merit. The evidence of resent in the case diary depicts the guilt of the present
applicant for said charges.
20. He further submitted that Sri Mangala Prasad Singh had produced fake documents for payment
of his salary before the then DIOS Smt. Ahmadi Usman, on which she passed an order to stop
payment of salary to Mangala Prasad Singh on 28.04.1999 and this fact surfaced that pursuant to
illegal order passed by Smt. Ahmadi Usman no salary be released to Sri Mangala Singh under
Section 3(3) of Payment of Salaries Act, and a copy of this order was issued to DIOS, Ballia, despite
the order of Deputy Director, Joint Director of Education, then DIOS Ballia Sri Ashok Kumar Singh
who remained posted from 22.02.1999 to August 2000 released Rs.13,848/-Rakesh Kumar Pandey
who served during January 2001 to November 2001 released Rs.1,28,185/- and Sri Rajendra Pratap
who as posted during January to December 2002 released Rs.1,25,870/- as arrears of salary to Sri
Mangala Prasad Singh in this way Rs.3,92,503/- was released by different DIOS including applicant

Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
No.1 Sri Mangana Singh in illegal manner.
21. Having considered the above submissions made at Bar at length on perusal of record it appear
that the applicants have filed a copy of order dated 23.08.1998 passed by this Hon'ble Court as
Annexure No.7 to the affidavit, wherein this Court passed the following order:-
"If the petitioners are in service and teachers in the school, in that event, the salary of
the petitioners be paid within three months and arrears of salary be paid within four
months from the date of production of a certified copy of this order, if the
appointment is accordance with law.
With this observation the petitioner id disposed of finally."
22. The above order of Hon'ble Court has been mentioned in Government Order
No.625/15-12-2002-1601(116) dated 03.04.2002 through letter issued by the Special Secretary Uttar
Pradesh Shashan to Director of Education (Intermediate) U.P. Lucknow on subject regarding
payment of salary in Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia in compliance of order of Hon'ble
High Court. In the said letter director of education is asked to ensure payment of salary to
petitioners in pursuance of order dated 23.01.1998 was passed by this Hon'ble Court. The petitioner
No.1 acting as District Inspector of Schools, Ballia vide letter dated 06.05.2002, wherein order of
this Hon'ble Court dated 23.01.1998 passed in Writ Petition No.1253 of 1998 Shiv Kumar Sharma
and others Vs. State of U.P. and Government letter dated 625/15-12-2002-1601(116) dated
03.04.2002 and letter of Deputy Director of Education dated 10.04.2002 has been deferred, has
directed the Principal/Manager of Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia to produce salary bill
of 37 employees which include 25 assistant teachers, 2 lecturers and 10 class III and Class IV
employees.
23. In FIR itself it is stated that applicant No.1 Rajednra Pratap was posted as District Inspector of
Schools in District Ballia during the period January 2002 to December 2002 and prior to release of
salary by orders of Rajendra Pratap to Mangala Singh, the earlier District Inspector of Schools Sri
Shiv Kumar Singh, Sri Rakesh Kumar Pandey also made payment of salary to Mangala Singh, but
earlier District Inspector of Schools has not been made accused in the case.
24. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramveer Upadhyay and another Vs. State of U.P. and another in
Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No.2953 of 2022 observed as under:-
"26. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C provides:− "482. Saving of inherent powers of High
Court.--Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of
the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order
under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to
secure the ends of justice."
27. Even though, the inherent power of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., to interfere
with criminal proceedings is wide, such power has to be exercised with circumspection, in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114427324/ 8
Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
exceptional cases. Jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C is not to be exercised for the asking.
37. In State of Haryana and Ors. v. Bhajan Lal and Ors. 1992 Supll (1) SCC 335 this Court held:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cogizable offence, justifying an investigation
by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a
Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
11 (2021) 5 SCC 524 121992 Suppl (1) SCC 335 (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the
FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission
of any offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non−cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the
Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. (7)
Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is
maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.
103. We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding
should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114427324/ 9
Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
that the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness
or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or
inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or
caprice."
25. After considering the submissions of learned counsel for the parties and meticulous examination
of material on record and taking into consideration the totality of the facts and circumstances of the
case this Court is of the opinion that the applicants who were posted as DIOS and Accounts Officer
respectively in district Ballia made payment of salary to assistant teacher Surendra Nath Singh,
purportedly acting in compliance of order dated 23.01.1998 passed by this Court, Government
Order No. 625/15-12-2002-1601(116) letter dated 03.04.2002 and letter of Deputy Director,
Director of Education U.P., Lucknow dated 10.04.2002 and prior to their posting in said districts
payments of the salary were also by the predecessors to said assistant teachers including Mangala
Singh and one Surendra Nath Singh. The ingredients of the offence as alleged against the
applicants/petitioners are not made out in their case. There is no allegation against them they had
