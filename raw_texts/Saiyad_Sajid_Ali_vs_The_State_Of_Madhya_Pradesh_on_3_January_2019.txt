THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
W.P. No. 29297/2018
(Saiyad Sajid Ali Vs. The State of M.P.)
Gwalior, Dated 3/1/19
Shri M.S. Jadon, Advocate for the petitioner.
Shri Abhishek Mishra, Govt. Advocate for the
respondent/State.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has prayed for the following reliefs:-
7.1 To issue directions to the respondents No. 2 and 4 to countersign the petitioner
permit (Annexure P/2) subject to payment of tax as per rule, permitting petitioner to
ply his vehicle in the portion of Maharashtra and the said vehicle be not stopped on
the ground of non-countersigning the permit by the State of Maharashtra.
7.2 The respondent No.1 and 3 may kindly be directed to ensure the implementation
of the agreement strictly with mutual consultation to the respondents No. 2 and 4.
7.3 Any other writ, order or direction as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit in the facts
and circumstances of the case may kindly be passed, in the interest of justice.
The grievance of the petitioner is that STA Gwalior has issued temporary permit in favour of the
petitioner vide Annexure P/2 valid from 16/11/18 to 31/1/19 for the bus bearing registration
No.MP48P7111 having capacity of 55+2 for inter-state route from Hosangabad to Segaon one return
trip daily, awaiting counter signature on the said permit by the STA State of Maharashtra for which
letter dated 16/11/18 has been sent by the Secretary of STA Gwalior vide Annexure P/3. Petitioner
has also submitted an application under the prescribed form under Rule 80 of Motor Vehicle Act
Anneuxre P/4 for issuance of temporary permit by STA Maharashtra State, Mumbai. Petitioner had
filed writ petition No. 18191/18 before this court in which by order dated 20/8/18 the permission
was granted to ply the vehicle as per the terms and THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
(Saiyad Sajid Ali Vs. The State of M.P.) conditions of the permit with further direction to the
respondents not to stop the vehicle of the petitioner on the ground of non countersignature over the
temporary permit granted to the petitioner (Annexure P/5). Petitioner has thus again approached
this court due to failure of the competent authority at Maharashtra to counter-sign the temporary
permit for the same inter-state route.
Learned counsel for the petitioner raising the plea of parity submits that another petition i.e. W.P.
No. 25228/18 (Mrs. Sapna Ranglani Vs. State of M.P.) attended with similar circumstances has been

Saiyad Sajid Ali vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 January, 2019
disposed of on 2/11/18 in respect of similar inter-state route between Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra with directions.
Learned counsel for the State does not dispute passing of the order dated 2/11/18 in W.P. No.
25228/18 and the website of the High Court also indicates that the order dated 2/11/18 passed in
W.P. No. 25228/18 continues to hold the field till date.
In view of above and consensus between the parties, this petition stands disposed of in the same
light of order dated 2/11/18 passed in W.P. No. 25228/18 by this court. For ready reference and
convenience, the relevant portion of the said order dated 2/11/18 is reproduced below which shall
apply to the present case mutatis mutandis :-
Considering the submissions, it is apparent that the said interim order passed by the
Apex Court itself is given effect to by the respondents in respect of State of U.P. only
and they are regularly giving permits (although temporary permits only) and
counter-signing the permits between the State of Maharastra and M.P. therefore, on
the basis of their own submissions, respondents cannot restrain the petitioner in any
manner for seeking relief of counter-signature from the State of Maharastra.
From perusal of fact situation as well as petition memo, it appears that as per
reciprocal agreement dated 01-03-2007 executed THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH (Saiyad Sajid Ali Vs. The State of M.P.) between the State of Madhya
Pradesh and Maharashtra, it is apparent that both the States would respect reciprocal
agreement/temporary permit given for plying vehicles between two States. Here, in
the present case, State of Madhya Pradesh and its appropriate authority (State
Transport Authority) has issued temporary permit on 14/11/18 vide permit
No.349/STA/18 for plying the vehicle No. MP48P7111 of the petitioner for the period
from 16/11/18 to 31/1/19 from Hoshangabad to Segaon. In absence of counter
signature from the State of Maharashtra petitioner is finding hard to ply vehicle
between said destinations. Considering the fact situation, it further appears that it is
procedural formality which has to be performed by State of Maharashtra, if petitioner
comply all other terms and conditions as contained into reciprocal agreement as well
as in granting temporary permit. Therefore, instead of pending the petition, this
Court deems fit to dispose of this petition with the direction to State of Maharashtra
to consider the case of petitioner as per terms and conditions of reciprocal agreement
dated 01-03-2007 and if petitioner fulfills all the condition then counter signature be
made immediately within 7 days from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order
so that petitioner if fulfills all the conditions may ply the vehicle between two
destinations as referred above and her right to pursue business/occupation as
enshrined under Article 19 of Constitution of India would not be hindered in any
manner.
As an interim arrangement, petitioner shall be allowed to ply her vehicle in
accordance with the terms and conditions of permit and the said vehicle shall not be

stopped on the ground of non counter signature of State of Maharashtra over the
temporary permit granted to the petitioner.
At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner also raised the point that STA is not
granting permanent permit and only adopting adhoc measure of temporary permits
which causes inconvenience and uncertainty to the bus operator.
Since this is a matter to be decided by the STA and its members, but it is certainly
expected from the STA that the decision regarding issuance of permanent permit
would be sorted out by them in a pro-active manner on positive and affirmative note
so that the meetings for grant of permanent permit may not defer and meetings may
take place as per their schedule.
With the aforesaid directions, petition stands disposed of.
