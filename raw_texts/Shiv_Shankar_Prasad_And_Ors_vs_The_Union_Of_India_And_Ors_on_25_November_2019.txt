The driver, Noticee No.1 has made his voluntary statement recorded on 4.12.2016 under Section 107
of the Customs Act, 1962 stating that he is the driver of the said vehicle and Sri Manoj Sah (Noticee
No.3) who is petitioner no.3 in the present case, approached him asking to carry some kabars from
his kabar shop to Sitamarhi with Rs. 1500/- as freight charge. The said Noticee No.1 agreed and gave
him key of said vehicle for loading kabar. The Noticee No.1 returned back after taking lunch and
moved with loaded vehicle. The officer of the LCS Bhithamore intercepted the said vehicle along
with the said goods.
In the interrogation, he has accepted that the vehicle was given to Sri Manoj Sah on his request for
loading the said goods from kabar shop belonging to him situated at Bhithamore. He was paid Rs.
1500/- as freight of the said goods for carrying up to Sitamarhi. At the loading point, he has stated

Nepal into India. The zinc Ingot was of different shape and size but he did not disclose the
destination where to deliver the material and further he has filed application on 7.12.2016 claiming

(vii) Seized goods is to be further used to manufacturing of Gas Regulator and belt

Patna High Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019
(viii) He has purchased the seized goods from different local cyclewala and thelawala after paying
Rs. 70 to 80 per kg, but he did not know the details of above sellers.
(ix) Such type of manufacture activities is to be carried out at Sursand, Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur
but he did not know name and details of manufacturing/conversion unit of Zinc ingot.
(x) He admitted no fabrication unit of Zinc
Ingot from Kabar of Battery surrounding of
Bhithamore and Nawahi."
In the statement, he has stated that he has purchased the Kabar from the cyclewala or thelawala, has
no permanent kabar shop, when the kabar accumulated in huge quantity, he used to sold the same
to outsider customer. He has mentioned that the goods are of Indian origin having purchased from
unknown person but, failed to place document in support of the noticee. He has accepted that he
knows the driver, the petitioner no.1 (Noticee No.2) and petitioner no.3 Manoj Sah (Noticee No.3).
He has taken a stand that the material was to be delivered at Muzaffarpur and freight was netogiated
with Noticee No.1 at Rs. 1500/-. The seized goods was to be used for manufacturing of Gas
Regulator and belt buckles. He has admitted such activities are carried out at Sursand, Sitamarhi
and Muzaffarpur but he did not give the name and details of the manufacturer or conversion units of
zinc ingots. The Noticee No.3 (petitioner No.3) has appeared and said that he has Patna High Court
CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 no relation with the Noticee No.1 (petitioner no.2) but, he is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20225365/ 4
Shiv Shankar Prasad And Ors vs The Union Of India And Ors on 25 November, 2019
a neighbor. The seized goods has been converted from old battery and he knows the petitioner no.1
(Noticee No.2) from childhood and accepted that two cases under the customs case have already
been registered.
Again the statement of driver was recorded, he has re- stated the same that the goods belonged to
Manoj Sah and who loaded the goods on his truck, the Noticee No.2 claiming to be his goods, Manoj
Sah has said that it does not belong to him having no connection with any of the aforesaid two
persons and, ultimately, after discussion, has arrived to a conclusion that under the goods were of
Nepal origin, were imported illegally into India from Nepal without any valid document, contravene
the provision of Section 7, 11, 46 and 47 of the Customs Act, 1962 read with Section 3(2) of the
Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 and liable for confiscation. Ultimately, the
final order for confiscation has been passed with respect to the vehicle which was released on
provisional basis, has been given the benefit under Section 125 of the Customs Act that he may
deposit a cost of the vehicle and get release of the same, as the petitioner no.2 has already deposited
Rs. 50,000/-, the same has been directed to be appropriated against the redemption fine and also
imposed penalty Patna High Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 of Rs. 10,000/- to the
petitioner no.1 and Rs. 5,000/- penalty has been imposed on petitioner no.3 under Section 112 of
the Custom Act.
The point has been raised by the petitioner that before seizure, the authority was to form an opinion
that he has a reasonable belief that the goods are liable for confiscation under the Act. The
pre-condition before seizure, the authority was required to form this opinion as they have failed to
form an opinion of reasonable belief of the goods of third country is required seizure, the seizure
itself is bad and leads to wrong confiscation of the goods and the entire confiscation proceeding is
vitiated and, as such, the order passed against the petitioners is liable to be quashed. It has further
been submitted that in the order, there is no mention that it is the prohibited goods, could not have
been brought from Nepal and, as such, the order itself is bad on this ground. It has again been stated
that the material which was seized does not tally with the report furnished after the chemical
analysis, inasmuch as, the seizure was made of the goods but, the seizure memo or any order of
seizure was not served to the owner of the goods nor the copy of the Panch, recording the
proceeding of search, was served and, as such, the search and seizure has been conducted without
following the due procedure established by law. Patna High Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018
dt.25-11-2019 Thus, the entire process is non-est in the eye of law. It has been said that in term of
Section 123 of the Customs Act, 1962, the burden of proof lies to the Custom Department to show
the material seized is of Nepal origin but, wrongly the burden has been shifted upon the petitioners
to prove that the goods were not brought from Nepal but, the same are of Indian territory. At the
last, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that they were/are obliged to release the goods in
terms of Section 125 of the Customs Act. So, the impugned order is liable to be interfered with by
this Court.
Per contra, learned counsel for the Custom Department submits that the goods were seized in
presence of the driver as well as in presence of the two persons (witnesses), seizure memo was
prepared properly, inasmuch as, there is a dispute of ownership of the property seized and the
statement does not reflect that the seizure memo bearing signature of the panches was not handed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20225365/ 5
Shiv Shankar Prasad And Ors vs The Union Of India And Ors on 25 November, 2019
over to the driver at the relevant time as the petitioner nos. 1 & 3 were not present. Further, forming
an opinion that the material seized is of third country is based upon the information received, that
led to interception of driver who made a statement that the seized Zinc has been smuggled from
Nepal territory. It has further been submitted that looking to the facts and circumstances, Patna
High Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 the Custom Officer has rightly formed an opinion
or reason to believe that the goods were of Nepal origin as per Section 123 of the Customs Act, the
burden lies with the petitioners to show that it is a rightful material and not a material imported
from the third country as the material seized from the driver who himself has made a statement that
its origin is Nepal. In such circumstances, the claim of the petitioners that wrongly proceeding was
initiated is completely misconceived and mis-construed, liable to be rejected.
Before discussing this issue, it is proper to quote Section 110 and 123 of the Customs Act,1962 which
reads as follows:-
"110. Seizure of goods, documents and things.--
(1) If the proper officer has reason to believe that any goods are liable to confiscation
under this Act, he may seize such goods:
Provided that where it is not practicable to seize any such goods, the proper officer
may serve on the owner of the goods an order that he shall not remove, part with, or
otherwise deal with the goods except with the previous permission of such officer.
[(1A) The Central Government may, having regard to the perishable or hazardous
nature of any goods, depreciation in the value of the goods with the passage of time,
constraints of storage space for the goods or any other relevant considerations, by
notification in the Official Gazette, specify the goods or class of goods which shall, as
soon as may be after its seizure under sub-section (1), be disposed of by the proper
officer in such manner as the Central Government may, from Patna High Court
CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 time to time, determine after following the
procedure hereinafter specified.
(1-B) Where any goods, being goods specified under sub- section (1A), have been
seized by a proper officer under sub- section (1), he shall prepare an inventory of such
goods containing such details relating to their description, quality, quantity, mark,
numbers, country of origin and other particulars as the proper officer may consider
relevant to the identity of the goods in any proceeding under this Act and shall make
an application to a Magistrate for the purpose of--
(a) certifying the correctness of the inventory so prepared; or
(b) taking, in the presence of the Magistrate, photographs of such goods, and
certifying such photographs as true; or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20225365/ 6
Shiv Shankar Prasad And Ors vs The Union Of India And Ors on 25 November, 2019
(c) allowing to draw representative samples of such goods, in the presence of the
Magistrate, and certifying the correctness of any list of samples so drawn.
(1-C) Where an application is made under sub-section (1B), the Magistrate shall, as soon as may be,
allow the application.] (2) Where any goods are seized under sub-section (1) and no notice in respect
thereof is given under clause (a) of section 124 within six months of the seizure of the goods, the
goods shall be returned to the person from whose possession they were seized:
Provided that the aforesaid period of six months may, on sufficient cause being
shown, be extended by the 2[Commissioner of Customs] for a period not exceeding
six months.
(3) The proper officer may seize any documents or things which, in his opinion, will
be useful for, or relevant to, any proceeding under this Act.
Patna High Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 (4) The person from whose custody any
documents are seized under sub-section (3) shall be entitled to make copies thereof or take extract
therefrom in the presence of a officer of customs."
"[110-A. Provisional release of goods, documents and things seized pending
adjudication. - Any goods, documents or things seized under section 110, may,
pending, the order of the [adjudicating authority], be released to the owner on taking
a bond from him in the proper form with such security and conditions as the
[adjudicating authority] may require.]"
"123. Burden of proof in certain cases.- [(1) Where any goods to which this section
applies are seized under this Act in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled
goods, the burden of proving that they are not smuggled goods shall be--
(a) in a case where such seizure is made from the possession of any person,--
(i) on the person from whose possession the goods were seized; and
(ii) if any person, other than the person from whose possession the goods were
seized, claims to be the owner thereof, also on such other person;
(b) in any other case, on the person, if any, who claims to be the owner of the goods
so seized.] (2) This section shall apply to gold [and manufactures thereof] watches,
and any other class of goods which the Central Government may by notification in
the Official Gazette, specify."
Section 110 speaks that if the officer has reason to believe that any goods are liable to confiscation
under this Act, he may seize such goods and Section 123 provides that (1) where any Patna High
Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 goods to which this section applies are seized under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20225365/ 7
Shiv Shankar Prasad And Ors vs The Union Of India And Ors on 25 November, 2019
this Act in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods, the burden of proving that they are
not smuggled goods shall be (a) in a case where such seizure is made from the possession of any
person (i) on the person from whose possession the goods were seized; and
(ii) if any person, other than the person from whose possession the goods were seized, claims to be
the owner thereof, also on such other person; (b) in any other case, on the person, if any, who claims
to be the owner of the goods so seized. (2) this section shall apply to gold and manufactures thereof,
watches, and any other class of goods which the Central Government may by notification in the
Official Gazette specify.
Thus, Section 123 of the Customs Act does not apply to the matter as the material seized is not any
of the item mentioned under Section 123 of the Customs Act but, it is the common law that if the
goods has been seized on reasonable belief that it is a smuggled goods from third country then, in
that circumstances, the person from whose possession the seizure has been made, he has to show
that the goods, which has been seized, does not fall in the mischief of the Customs Act or is not of a
third country material.
In the present case, the driver in a specific term has stated that the goods were loaded by Manoj Sah
and he has stated Patna High Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 that it is likely the goods
has come from Nepal. In such circumstances, the submission of the petitioner that it is not from
Nepal territory, unless it is shown by valid document or material from the person they have
purchased, in such circumstances, in view of the statement of the driver, rightly the confiscation has
been made and the order has been passed holding that the material is from Nepal origin and, in the
present case, the driver has stated that the materials are of Manoj Sah, the petitioner no.3 whereas
the petitioner no.1 Shiv Shankar Prasad (Noticee No.2) is claiming to be the owner of the goods. So,
it is an unverified material as to who is the owner of the property. The vehicle has already been
released and Rs. 50,000/- has been forfeited, treated to be the value of the vehicle.
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that they ought to have given the benefit of Section 125
of the Customs Act. When the ownership of the property is in dispute, the proper course for the
petitioner no.1, who is claiming to be the owner of the property, is to file proper application under
Section 125 of the Customs Act before the authority of proper jurisdiction who will take a decision in
accordance with law.
In that view of the matter, this Court does not find that the petitioners have made out a case for
interference with the Patna High Court CWJC No.13536 of 2018 dt.25-11-2019 impugned order
passed by the Assistant Commissioner, Customs Division, Muzaffarpur Camp at Bodh Gaya.
Before parting with the judgment, this Court is of the view that if any of the petitioners file an
application under Section 125 of the Customs Act, 1962, the Authority concerned will consider the
case on merit and will take a decision in accordance with law.
With the aforementioned observation, this writ application is dismissed.
