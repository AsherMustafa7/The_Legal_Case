W.P. (Crl) No. 45 of 2022 Page 1
ORDER (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] The petitioner assails the order dated 02.09.2022 of the Special Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, whereby he was subjected to preventive detention
in exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. He seeks a consequential writ of
habeas corpus to set him at liberty forthwith. [2] Heard Mr. L. Seityandra, learned
counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned Government Advocate, for
respondents No. 1, 2 & 3; and Mr. Boboy Potsangbam, learned CGSC, appearing for
respondent No. 4. [3] The primary ground of attack urged by Mr. L. Seityandra,
learned counsel, is that the petitioner's representation to the Central Government has
not been disposed of till date. The petitioner's representation against his detention is
dated 04.10.2022 and was addressed to respondent Nos. 2 & 4 herein. As per the
affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, this representation was rejected by the State Government, vide order dated
11.11.2022, based on the comments received from the Police Department on
24.10.2022. The report of the Advisory Board was received by the State Government
on 15.11.2022 and thereupon, the detention order was confirmed on
02.12.2022. The affidavit is however silent as to when the petitioner's representation was forwarded
to respondent No. 4.
[4] Perusal of the file of the detaining authority placed before the Court by Mr. Athouba Khaidem,
learned Government Advocate, reflects as follows:
W.P. (Crl) No. 45 of 2022 Page 2 The petitioner's representation dated 04.10.2022 was forwarded to
the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, by the Inspector General of Prisons,
Manipur, on 07.10.2022 and it was received on the very same day. Para-wise comments were
solicited by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, from the Director General of
Police, Manipur, under letter dated 20.10.2022. There is no explanation forthcoming either from the
file or the Note- file therein as to why action was not taken in this regard for nearly two weeks, as the
representation dated 04.10.2022 was received on 07.10.2022 itself. Further, the said representation
was forwarded to respondent No. 4 by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, only
on 20.10.2022. Again, there is no explanation forthcoming for the delay in this dispatch. The
Superintendent of Police, Thoubal District, furnished his para-wise comments on the representation
under his letter dated 24.10.2022 addressed to the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur. However, it was only on 11.11.2022 that the representation was rejected by the State
Government and the same was informed to the petitioner under a letter of the same date addressed

Md. Nawaz Khan (27 Yrs) vs Special Secretary (Home) on 20 January, 2023
by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur. Para-wise comments on the petitioner's
representation were forwarded to respondent No. 4 on 09.11.2022. Respondent No. 4 is yet to pass
an order on the petitioner's representation as on date. The aforestated facts demonstrate
unexplained periods of delay on the part of both the State Government as well as the Central
Government.
[5] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme
Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to
indifference or any other lapse, such delay would adversely affect further detention of the prisoner.
W.P. (Crl) No. 45 of 2022 Page 3 According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned
to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the
delay is very short, as even longer delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration
or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that
case was a mere 5 days. [6] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur
[AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground
that there was unexplained delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by
the detenu. [7] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and
others [(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the
Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government
denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the delay by the State
Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and
guarantees granted to a detenu. [8] Though it is laudable that the Government of Manipur is waging
a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug manufacture,
trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its responsibility to
ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the Constitutional and
statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite this Court stating to
this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to compliance with the
prescribed norms.
W.P. (Crl) No. 45 of 2022 Page 4
[9] The unexplained lethargy on the part of the State authorities in
dealing with the detenu's representation clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on
their part, which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The
same would also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order.
Further, the complete failure of the Central Government, viz., respondent No.4, in acting upon the
representation sounds a death knell for the impugned detention order.
[10] The order of detention dated 02.09.2022 issued by the Special Secretary (Home), Government
of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand
set aside. The petitioner, Md. Nawaz Khan, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa,
shall be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly required in connection
with any other case.

Md. Nawaz Khan (27 Yrs) vs Special Secretary (Home) on 20 January, 2023
WP (Cril.) No. 45 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs. A copy of this order shall be sent to the
Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information and necessary further action in the
context of educating the detaining authorities in the State of Manipur as to what are the procedural
norms that they need to adhere to while exercising power and jurisdiction under preventive
detention laws.
