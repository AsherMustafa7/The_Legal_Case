reserving Judgment & Order :: 21.02.2023 Date of Judgment & Order :: 14.03.2023 JUDGMENT
AND ORDER (CAV) This contempt case has been filed by the petitioners to punish the respondents
for their wilful disobedience of the order dated 17.12.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No.1019 of 2019.
Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) Page |3
2. The petitioners have filed W.P.(C) No.1019 of 2019 against the State, represented by its Additional
Chief Secretary (TA & Hills), Government of Manipur; the Secretary/Commissioner (Finance),
Government of Manipur and the Chief Executive Officer, Tamenglong Autonomous District Council,
Tamenglong District for issuance of writ of mandamus directing the said authorities to pay salaries
to the petitioners since 2011. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned
Government Advocate for the respondents, on 17.12.2019, this Court passed the following order:
"Heard Mr. D.Julius Riamei, learned counsel for the petitioner as well as Mrs.
Sundari, learned G.A. for the respondent Nos.1 & 2.
The 6 (six) petitioners were appointed as Primary School Teacher under Rule 45 of
the Manipur (Hills) District Council Rule, 1972 pursuant to the recommendation of
the Department Promotion Committee. Thereafter, they were posted at different
Primary Schools under the Tamenglong Autonomous District Council, Manipur.
The grievance of the petitioners before this Court is that they have not been paid their
salaries since, 2011 upto date on the ground that their names have not been included
in Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) Page |4 the
Manipur Government Employee Lists (MGEL/CPIS).

Kh. Roushan Chaudhury vs Contempt Case (C) No.114 Of 2020 (Ref:- ... on 14 March, 2023
The petitioners, therefore, made separate representation all dated 11.1.2019 before
the Chief Executive Officer, Tamenglong Autonomous District Council/respondent
No.3 for redressal of their grievances. The aid representations are yet to be
considered by the respondent No.3.
Accordingly, writ petition is disposed of by directing the respondent No.3 to consider
the separate representations made by the petitioner all dated 11.11.2019 within a
period of 6 (six) months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order of this Court.
Writ petition is accordingly, disposed of.
Furnish a copy of this Order to the learned counsel for both the parties."
3. Alleging that the order dated 17.12.2019 passed by this Court has not been complied with, the
petitioners have filed this contempt petition contending that after passing the order in the writ
petition, the petitioners issued a legal notice dated 18.12.2019 communicating the order dated
17.12.2019 to the third respondent. However, the third respondent has willfully and deliberately in
disobedience of the order failed to comply the said Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C)
No. 1019 of 2019) Page |5 order and the representation dated 11.11.2019 has not yet been considered
till date.
4. Mr. D. Julius Riamei, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that originally the
contempt case was filed against the first respondent and pending contempt case, the first
respondent was transferred and in his place, the second respondent came and after his transfer, the
third respondent held the post of the Chief Executive Officer of Tamenglong Autonomous District
Council. Hence, all three respondents have been shown as contemnors in this case. Since the
respondents failed to obey the order of this Court dated 17.12.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No.1019 of
2019, they should be punished under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
5. Opposing the prayer, Mr. KR Pamei, the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that vide
order dated 2.9.2020, the first respondent was given additional charge to act as in-charge Chief
Executive Officer for Autonomous District Council, Tamenglong District and, thereafter, he was
transferred to Chingai as SDO/BDO. He would submit that after passing of the order in the writ
petition, the tenure of the Autonomous District Council pertaining to the whole State of Manipur
comes to an end and no fresh election for electing the members of the Contempt Case (C) No.114 of
2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) Page |6 Autonomous District Council had been held till date.
In the meanwhile, on 17.5.2021, the Additional Chief Secretary (TA & Hills), after the expiry of the
tenure of the Autonomous District Council was pleased to appoint the Chairman of the Autonomous
District Council as the Caretaker Chairman and as per the order dated 17.5.2021, the Caretaker
Chairman was not allowed to exercise any financial powers except to look after the normal routine
duties of the Councils.
6. The learned counsel further submitted that in pursuance of the cabinet decision dated 21.7.2022,
the Special Secretary (TA & Hills), vide order dated 4.8.2022, cancelled the order dated 17.5.2021
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86378210/ 3
Kh. Roushan Chaudhury vs Contempt Case (C) No.114 Of 2020 (Ref:- ... on 14 March, 2023
and Caretaker Chairman system was discontinued. Since there was no Chairman pertaining to the
Autonomous District Council for the State of Manipur, no administrative decision could be taken till
date. The tenure of the Autonomous District Council, Manipur had come to an end and till date no
fresh election had been held for electing the new members of the Council. Thus, the first respondent
had not deliberately and intentionally disobeyed the order of this Court or failed to consider the
representation of the petitioners.
7. The learned counsel urged that the Chairman of the Autonomous District Council, Tamenglong is
the competent Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) Page |7 person for
taking appropriate decision pertaining the representation of the petitioners and the first respondent
has no power for taking administrative decision pertaining to the representation of the petitioner
and the non-consideration of the representation of the petitioners is on account of the end of the
tenure of the elected members of the Council and in addition that as per the order of the State
Authority, no administrative decision pertaining financial matters can be taken by the Caretaker
Chairman.
8. The learned counsel for the respondents further submitted that after transfer of the first
respondent, the second respondent was officiating as the Chief Executive Officer of Tamenglong
District and the second respondent was also transferred and in his place, the third respondent was
posted. The learned counsel would submit that pending contempt case, the third respondent was
transferred to the post of Chief Executive Officer, Tamenglong District on 27.7.2022 and, therefore,
the third respondent is not held responsible for the non-compliance of the order of this Court. Thus,
a prayer has been made to drop the contempt case against the respondents.
9. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) Page |8
10. The order of this Court passed in the writ petition is to consider the representation of the
petitioners dated 11.11.2019 by the third respondent within a period of six months from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order. When the contempt case was originally filed, the first respondent was
holding the post of the Chief Executive Officer, Tamenglong Autonomous District Council. After the
transfer of the first respondent and taking into consideration that the second respondent was
transferred in the place of the first respondent, the second respondent was impleaded. Since
subsequently, the third respondent was transferred to the post of the Chief Executive Officer,
Tamenglong District Council, the third respondent was impleaded as respondent for proper
adjudication of the contempt case.
11. It is not the case of the first respondent that he was not aware of the order dated 17.12.2019
passed in W.P.(C) No.1019 of 2019 by this Court. According to the first respondent, he was holding
the post of the Chief Executive Officer, Autonomous District Council as additional charge with effect
from 2.9.2020. It is also not the case of the respondents that the post of the Chief Executive Officer
for Autonomous District Council, Tamenglong District was not existed between 17.12.2019 and
Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) Page |9 01.09.2020. The order
dated 17.12.2019 was communicated to the Chief Executive Officer, ADC, Tamenglong by way of a

Kh. Roushan Chaudhury vs Contempt Case (C) No.114 Of 2020 (Ref:- ... on 14 March, 2023
legal notice dated 19.12.2019. Therefore, it cannot be contended that the first respondent has no
knowledge about the passing of the order in the writ petition.
12. It appears that while the first respondent was officiating as the Chief Executive Officer for
Autonomous District Council, Tamenglong District, he was transferred to Chingai as SDO vide order
dated 29.9.2021. Though at the time of passing the order in the writ petition, the first respondent
was not holding the post of the Chief Executive Officer, at the time of filing the contempt case during
December, 2020, the first respondent alone was holding the post and he only received the notice in
the contempt case.
13. Pausing for a minute, this Court's direction in the writ petition is to consider the representation
of the petitioners within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The
order was passed on 17.12.2019 and six months period expired during May, 2020. Though the first
respondent took additional charge only on 2.9.2020, when he received the notice in the contempt
case, he should show his attention in considering the representation of the petitioners. The first
Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) P a g e | 10 respondent himself
stated that after passing the order in the writ petition, the tenure of the Autonomous District
Counsel comes to an end. In fact, in paragraph 5 of the affidavit-in-opposition filed, the first
respondent has stated that vide order dated 17.5.2021 passed by the Additional Chief Secretary (TA
& Hills), Government of Manipur after the expiry of the tenure of the ADC, the Government was
pleased to appoint the Chairman of the ADC as Caretaker Chairman.
14. As stated supra, the first respondent was transferred vide order dated 29.9.2021 to Chingai as
SDO and on the date of passing order i.e. on 17.5.2021, the first respondent was holding the post of
the Chief Executive Officer of the ADC, Tamenglong. As admitted by the respondents, the tenure of
the Autonomous District Council comes to an end only during May, 2021. By that time, the Chief
Executive Officer for Autonomous District Council ought to have considered the representation of
the petitioners. However, the said authority has failed to do so.
15. Coming to the order dated 17.12.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No.1029 of 2019, it is seen that the same
has been passed by this Court after hearing the respective counsel. No appeal has been preferred by
the respondents therein and they Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019)
P a g e | 11 allowed the order dated 17.12.2019 to attain finality. As stated supra, the order dated
17.12.2019 directs the third respondent therein i.e. the Chief Executive Officer to consider the
representation of the petitioners dated 11.11.2019 within a period of six months from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order.
16. When the petitioners allege that the order dated 17.12.2019 has not been complied with and
come forward in filing the contempt case, it is the duty of the Court dealing with the contempt
jurisdiction to look into whether the authority against whom the direction was granted has
disobeyed the order or not.
17. In a contempt jurisdiction, the Court will not travel beyond the original order and direction;
neither would it be permissible for the Court to issue any supplementary or incidental directions,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86378210/ 5
Kh. Roushan Chaudhury vs Contempt Case (C) No.114 Of 2020 (Ref:- ... on 14 March, 2023
which are not to be found in the original order. The Court is only concerned with the wilful or
deliberate non-compliance of the directions issued in the original order.
18. In Prithawi Nath Ram v. State of Jharkhand and others, (2004) 7 SCC 261, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has laid down that the Court exercising the contempt jurisdiction is primarily concerned with
the contemptuous act only and the Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of
2019) P a g e | 12 Contempt Court cannot take up upon itself and decide the original proceedings in
a manner as if it was exercising the inherent powers. The following observation was made in the said
judgment:
"5. While dealing with an application for contempt, the court is really concerned with
the question whether the earlier decision which has received its finality had been
complied with or not. It would not be permissible for a court to examine the
correctness of the earlier decision which had not been assailed and to take a view
different than what was taken in the earlier decision.
A similar view was taken in K.G.Derasari v. Union of India (2001) 10 SCC 496 : 2002
SCC (L&S) 756. The court exercising contempt jurisdiction is primarily concerned
with the question of contumacious conduct of the party who is alleged to have
committed default in complying with the directions in the judgment or order. If there
was no ambiguity or indefiniteness in the order, it is for the party concerned to
approach the higher court if according to him the same is not legally tenable. Such a
question has necessarily to be agitated before the higher court. The court exercising
contempt jurisdiction cannot take upon itself Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020
(Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) P a g e | 13 power to decide the original proceedings
in a manner not dealt with by the court passing the judgment or order. Though
strong reliance was placed by learned counsel for the State of Bihar on a three-Judge
Bench decision in Niaz Mohd. v. State of Haryana (1994) 6 SCC 332 we find that the
same has no application to the facts of the present case. In that case the question
arose about the impossibility to obey the order. If that was the stand of the State, the
least it could have done was to assail correctness of the judgment before the higher
court. The State took diametrically opposite stands before this Court. One was that
there was no specific direction to do anything in particular and, second was what was
required to be done has been done. If what was to be done has been done, it cannot
certainly be said that there was impossibility to carry out the orders. In any event, the
High Court has not recorded a finding that the direction given earlier was impossible
to be carried out or that the direction given has been complied with."
19. In a recent decision in the case of Nalini Sunitha Devi v. Mangsatabam Harekrishna and another,
2022 SCC OnLine Mani 364, this Court held as under:
Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) P a g e | 14 "9. The
Court exercising contempt jurisdiction is primarily concerned with the question of
contumacious conduct of the party who is alleged to have committed default in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86378210/ 6
Kh. Roushan Chaudhury vs Contempt Case (C) No.114 Of 2020 (Ref:- ... on 14 March, 2023
complying with the directions in the judgment and order. If there was no ambiguity
or indefiniteness in the order, it is for the party concerned to approach the higher
Court if according to him the same is not legally tenable. Such a question has
necessarily to be agitated before the higher Court. The Court exercising contempt
jurisdiction cannot take upon itself power to decide the original proceedings in a
manner not dealt with by the Court passing the judgment or order. Right or wrong
the order has to be obeyed. Flouting an order of the Court would render the party
liable for contempt. While dealing with an application for contempt, the Court cannot
traverse beyond the order, non-compliance of which is alleged. In other words, it
cannot say what should not have been done or what should have been done. It cannot
traverse beyond the order. It cannot test the correctness or otherwise of the order or
give additional directions or delete any direction. That would be exercising review
jurisdiction while dealing with petition for initiating of contempt Contempt Case (C)
No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) P a g e | 15 proceedings. The same
would be impermissible and indefensible."
20. At the cost of repetition, this Court clarify that though various arguments were advanced with
regard to the merits of the matter by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents, this Court
cannot go into those aspects, inasmuch as, this Court is exercising only the limited jurisdiction of
contempt.
21. Insofar as the present case is concerned, though at the relevant date of passing the order dated
17.12.2019 in the writ petition, the first respondent was not holding the post of the Chief Executive
Officer of the Autonomous District Council, Tamenglong and having taken over the additional
charge to act as in-charge Chief Executive Officer vide order dated 2.9.2020 and continued till the
alleged expiry of the tenure of the Autonomous District Council i.e. 17.5.2021, the first respondent
ought to have considered and disposed of the representation of the petitioners dated 11.11.2019 as
per the direction of this Court. Since pending contempt petition, the first respondent was
transferred and the respondents 2 and 3 succeeded the post of the Chief Executive Officer of the
Autonomous District Council, Tamenglong, this Court is of the view that all three respondents
Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) P a g e | 16 are held responsible
for non-compliance of the order of this Court dated 17.12.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No.1019 of 2019.
22. This Court is of the view that it is the bounden duty of the officials to comply the order of this
Court passed in the writ petition. If the officials failed to comply the order of this Court, they will
have to face the contempt proceedings. In the instant case, despite direction of this Court dated
17.12.2019, the respondents have failed to comply with the order till date. No proper explanation is
forthcoming from the side of the respondents regarding the solution to comply with the order dated
17.12.2019. The excuse offered by the respondents in not complying with the order passed in the writ
petition is not convincing. Therefore, when glaring disobedience has been proved from the narration
of facts indicated infra, there is no question of discharging the respondents from this contempt
proceedings. Right or wrong the order of this Court has to be obeyed by the respondents when the
said order attained finality.

Kh. Roushan Chaudhury vs Contempt Case (C) No.114 Of 2020 (Ref:- ... on 14 March, 2023
23. Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the respondents have willfully and
deliberately disobeyed the order of this Court dated 17.12.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No.1019 of 2019.
This Court has no hesitation to hold that the respondents are guilty of having committed contempt
of order of Contempt Case (C) No.114 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 1019 of 2019) P a g e | 17 this Court.
Hence, the respondents shall remain present before this Court on 27.03.2023 for imposing
punishment and would be heard on the quantum of punishment on the said date.
