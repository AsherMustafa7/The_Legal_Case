3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned FIR is lodged on false allegations,
and no offences are made out against the petitioners. He further submits that the alleged offences
are punishable under 7 years or less than 7 years and therefore, the police authorities are bound to
follow the procedure laid down under Section 41-A Cr.P.C. (now Sections 35 and 35 (3) of B.N.S.S.,
2023).
4. Hon?ble Supreme Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273 has laid
down detailed guidelines for arresting a person, which are being reproduced herein below:-
"Our endeavour in this judgment is to ensure that police officers do not arrest
accused unnecessarily and Magistrate do not authorize detention casually and
mechanically. In order to ensure what we have observed above, we give the following
direction:
All the State Governments to instruct its police officers not to automatically arrest
when a case under Section 498-A of the IPC is registered but to satisfy themselves
about the necessity for arrest under the parameters laid down above flowing from
Section 41 Cr.P.C.;
All police officers be provided with a check list containing specified sub- clauses
under Section 41(1)(b)(ii);
The police officer shall forward the check list duly filed and furnish the reasons and
materials which necessitated the arrest, while forwarding/producing the accused
before the Magistrate for further detention;
The Magistrate while authorizing detention of the accused shall peruse the report
furnished by the police officer in terms aforesaid and only after recording its
satisfaction, the Magistrate will authorize detention;
The decision not to arrest an accused, be forwarded to the Magistrate within two
weeks from the date of the institution of the case with a copy to the Magistrate which
may be extended by the Superintendent of police of the district for the reasons to be
recorded in writing;
Notice of appearance in terms of Section 41A of Cr.PC be served on the accused
within two weeks from the date of institution of the case, which may be extended by
the Superintendent of Police of the District for the reasons to be recorded in writing;
Failure to comply with the directions aforesaid shall apart from rendering the police
officers concerned liable for departmental action, he shall also be liable to be
punished for contempt of court to be instituted before High Court having territorial
jurisdiction.

Authorizing detention without recording reasons as aforesaid by the judicial
Magistrate concerned shall be liable for departmental action by the appropriate High
Court.
We hasten to add that the directions aforesaid shall not only apply to the cases under
Section 498-A of the I.P.C. or Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, the case in
hand, but also such cases where offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term
which may be less than seven years or which may extend to seven years; whether with
or without fine."
5. The similar view is also reiterated by Hon?ble Apex Court in recent judgment in the case of Md.
Asfak Alam Vs. the State of Jharkhand and another passed in Criminal Appeal No.(S) 2207 of 2023
decided on 31.07.2023, which also reiterated the guidelines laid down in the case of Arnesh Kumar
(supra).
6. We have occasion to peruse the FIR, which prima facie discloses cognizable offence and therefore,
in view of law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal
and others, 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335, M/s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of
Maharashtra, AIR 2021 SC 1918 and in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.3262/2021 (Leelavati Devi
@ Leelawati & another vs. the State of Uttar Pradesh) decided on 07.10.2021, the prayer made to
quash the FIR at this stage cannot be entertained.
7. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the law laid down in the
case of Arnesh Kumar (supra) and Md. Asfak Alam (supra), the investigating officer may proceed in
accordance with law but certainly provide notice to the petitioners, as provided under Sections 41
and 41(A) of Cr.P.C. (now Sections 35 and 35(3) of B.N.S.S., 2023) and summon the petitioners in
the instant matter. The petitioners are obliged to render their fullest cooperation in the ongoing
investigation.
8. It is further clarified that in case the investigating officer finds credible material and evidence
during investigation against the petitioners, then in that eventuality the investigating officer after
recording its reasons may effect the arrest of the petitioners but certainly adhering the detailed
guidelines as provided in the case of Arnesh Kumar (supra) and MD. Asfak Alam (supra). It is also
expected that the investigating officer must proceed with an endeavour to finalise the investigation
within a period of 60 days from today and submit its reports under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. (now
Section 193 (3) of B.N.S.S., 2023) in the court of jurisdictional Magistrate.
9. With the aforesaid observations, the instant writ petition stands disposed of.
Order Date :- 3.3.2025 RKP .
