just and necessary to issue the following directions:-
( i ) All the advocates throughout the State of Madhya Pradesh are hereby directed to
attend to their court work forthwith. They shall represent their clients in the
respective cases before the respective courts forthwith;
(ii) If any lawyer deliberately avoids to attend the court, it shall be presumed that
there is disobedience of this order and he will be faced with serious consequences
including initiation of proceedings for contempt of court under the Contempt of
Courts Act;

(iii) If any lawyer prevents any other lawyer from attending the court work, the same
would be considered as disobedience of these directions and he will be faced with
serious consequences including initiation of proceedings under the Contempt of
Courts Act;
(iv) Each of the judicial officers are directed to submit a report as to which lawyer has
deliberately abstained from attending the court;
( v ) The judicial officers shall also mention the names of advocates who have prevented other
advocates from entering the court premises or from conducting their cases in the court;
(vi) Such advocates shall be dealt with seriously which may even include proceedings under the
Contempt of Courts Act as well as being debarred from practice."
Division Bench had issued directions to Advocates to attend the Court work forthwith and to
represent their clients in their respective cases. If abstention from work is deliberate then Advocate
will have to face serious consequences including initiation of contempt petition.
In view of same, as Advocate for the petitioner is not appearing in the case, Registry is directed to
issue show cause notice to counsel for petitioner(s), whose name appears in the Vakalatnama that
why Contempt Proceedings may not be initiated against him/her/them for deliberate violation of
order dated 24.3.2023 passed in W.P No.7295/2023.
Notices shall not be issued to Government Advocates appearing for State since they remained
present in Court and complied with directions passed in WP No.7295/2023.
List the matter after four weeks.
