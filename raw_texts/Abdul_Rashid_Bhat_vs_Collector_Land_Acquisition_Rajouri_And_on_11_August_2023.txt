Abdul Rashid Bhat vs Collector Land Acquisition Rajouri And ... on 11 August, 2023
Acquisition of Immoveable Property Act, 1968 addressed against an award dated 07.05.2011 passed
on file no. 08/Arbitration by the Court of learned Principal District Judge, Rajouri acting as an
arbitrator under section 8 in the case.
Other matters tagged with MA no. 266/2011 are also the appeals arising out of the Jammu and
Kashmir Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immoveable Property Act, 1968 addressed against the
awards though passed on different files by the Court of learned Principal District Judge, Rajouri as
an arbitrator concerning the acquisition of land for the Union of India and the compensation
assessed therefor to be payable to the land owners and that was the reason for tagging all the files
together for the purpose of adjudication.
During the examination of each and every file, this court came across with the fact that there is an
apparent deficiency of court fees attending the majority of the matters as a result whereof the very
final adjudication being intended to be accorded to the said appeals is rendered unwarranted till the
issue of payment of requisite court fees is first dealt with and it is in this context that this court is
constrained to deal with each and every case individually for the purpose of passing of an order to
the said effect.
In the present appeal-MA no. 266/2011 filed on 20.05.2011 by the sole appellant-Abdul Rashid Bhat
challenge is being thrown to an award dated 07.05.2011 on file no. 08/Arbitration titled „Abdul
Rashid Bhat Vs. Collector Land Acquisition, Rajouri and others(cid:129) by 3 MA no. 266/2011 a/w
connected matters.
the learned Principal District Judge, Rajouri as being an arbitrator in terms whereof compensation
of an amount of Rs. 4 lacs per kanal with respect to the appellant's land of 36.05 kanals has come to
be awarded as against the originally recommended compensation of an amount of Rs. 2 lacs per
kanal offered vide communication no. 7426/268/Req/992-95/LH dated 23.07.2002 by the
Principal Secretary to Government, Home Department, J&K. The appellant-Abdul Rashid Bhat,
through the medium of the present appeal-MA no. 266/2011, is seeking enhancement of
compensation from Rs. 4 lacs per kanal to an extent of Rs. 20 lacs per kanal.
Jammu and Kashmir Court Fees Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD) in terms of its section 8 mandates court
fees on memorandum of appeal against an order relating to compensation. Said section 8 of the
Jammu and Kashmir Court Fees Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD) reads as under:
"8. Fee on memorandum of appeal against order relating to compensation.
The amount of fee payable under this Act on a memorandum of appeal against an
order relating to compensation under any Act for the time being in force for the
acquisition of land for public purposes shall be computed according to the difference
between the amount awarded and the amount claimed by the appellant."

Abdul Rashid Bhat vs Collector Land Acquisition Rajouri And ... on 11 August, 2023
Apparently, this Section 8 is applicable with respect to an appeal filed under Section 10 of the
Jammu and Kashmir Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immoveable Property Act, 1968.
Section 4 of the Court Fees Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD) provides that no document admissible to
payment of court fees be filed, exhibited or recorded in or shall be received or furnished by the High
Court in any case coming before it in exercise of its varied jurisdiction which includes an exercise of
its power as a court of appeal from the courts subject to its superintendence.
Now, if the present appeal is to be admissible to court fees at the first instance under section 8 of the
Court Fees Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD) and then to what amount of court fees the appeal is to be valued
for the purpose of payment of court fees is a question to be addressed at the first instance before
coming to the final judgment making.
This Court reckons that this issue cannot be deferred to be decided along with final adjudication of
the appeal as that would be doing violation to mandate of section 4 of the Jammu and Kashmir
Court Fees Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD).
This aspect has come to fore in view of the fact that the respondent no. 2 herein i.e., Union of India
has also come in an appeal- CIMA no. 349/2011 to question the very same award being aggrieved of
an enhancement from Rs. 2 lacs per kanal to Rs. 4 lacs per kanal with respect to the land of the
appellant measuring 36.5 kanals.
5 MA no. 266/2011 a/w connected matters.
In its said appeal-CIMA no. 349/2011, the respondent herein i.e., Union of India has come forward
with payment of court fees of Rs. 63,600 + (plus). The payment of the court fees in the said appeal is
obviously by reference to the mandate of Section 8 of the Court Fees Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD). So the
situation in hand is that against the same award/judgment, one party has paid no court fees on its
memo of appeal whereas other party has paid full court fees on its memo of appeal.
Accordingly, post this appeal-MA no. 266/2011 on 25.09.2023 for hearing on this aspect for
adjudication of court fees issue before proceeding with the judgment making in the main case.
Since the instant appeal is born out of the same award as such, the adjudication of the said appeal
which is otherwise bearing the requisite court fees is deferred for the time being till sorting out the
issue in an appeal-MA no. 266/2011.
List the instant appeal along with MA no. 266/2011. This appeal got tagged with MA no. 266/2011 in
view of the fact that the matter is arising out of an award passed on file no. 14/Arbitration Act dated
18.07.2013 by the learned Principal District Judge, Rajouri acting as an arbitrator under Section 8 of
the Jammu 6 MA no. 266/2011 a/w connected matters.

Abdul Rashid Bhat vs Collector Land Acquisition Rajouri And ... on 11 August, 2023
Rs. 2 lacs per kanal to Rs. 4 lacs per kanal leaving the appellant-Union of India aggrieved by the said
enhancement.
In maintaining the present appeal, the appellant-Union of India has paid the requisite court fees
purportedly payable in the matter by reference to Section 8 of the Jammu and Kashmir Court Fees
Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD).
Since in the lead case MA no. 266/2011, the issue of payment of the requisite court fees has cropped
up as such the judgment making in the same has been deferred as such the present case, in the
fitness of situation, is also deferred.
Let this case be listed along with MA no. 266/2011 read with CIMA no. 349/2011.
In the present appeal-MA no. 368/2017 filed on 29.07.2015 by the appellants i.e., Farooq Ahmad

42/Arbitration titled „Farooq Ahmed and ors. Vs. State of J&K and anr(cid:129) by the learned Principal
District Judge, Rajouri as an arbitrator in terms whereof compensation of an amount of Rs. 4 lacs
per kanal with respect to the appellants' respective share in the land under khasra no. 17 (15.5
kanals) situated in village Dhanidhar, tehsil and district 7 MA no. 266/2011 a/w connected matters.
Rajouri has come to be awarded as against the originally recommended compensation of an amount
of Rs. 2 lacs per kanal offered vide communication no. 7426/268/Req/992-95/LH dated
23.07.2002 by the Principal Secretary to Government, Home Department, J&K. During the currency
of the present appeal, both the appellants came to expire, resulting in bringing on record their
respective legal representatives so as to have the title of the present appeal getting changed from
„Farooq Ahmed Mr and anr vs. State of J&K & anr(cid:129) to „Masrat Jabeen and ors. Vs. State of J&K &
anr(cid:129) Through the medium of the present appeal-MA no. 368/2017, the appellants are seeking
enhancement of compensation from Rs. 4 lacs to an extent of Rs. 20 lacs per kanal.
Jammu and Kashmir Court Fees Act, Svt. 1977 (1920 AD) in terms of its section 8 mandates court
fees on a memorandum of appeal against an order relating to compensation. Said section 8 reads as
under:
"8. Fee on memorandum of appeal against order relating to compensation.
