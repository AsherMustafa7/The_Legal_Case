ORDER
22.05.2023.
1. In this appeal filed by the Commissioner of Central GST and Central Excise (J&K), Jammu under
Section 35-G of the Central Excise Act, 1944 [The Act], the appellant has called in question order
dated 06.03.2018 passed by CESTAT at Chandigarh in appeal No. E/972/2008. The appeal is
delayed by 1488 days. The explanation tendered is that the decision to file the appeal was taken only
after the law was reiterated and settled by the Supreme Court in the case titled M/s Unicorn
Industries Vs. U.O.I. and Ors (2020) 3 SCC 492.
2. Be that as it may, the similar explanation tendered by the appellant has not been accepted by this
Court in CEA No. 10/2020 which stands dismissed by the Division Bench of this Court being barred
by limitation.
3. Learned counsel for the appellant fairly submits that the case in hand is identical to the case that
was setup for seeking condonation of delay in CEA No. 10/2020 and that there is no additional or
fresh ground pleaded to seek a condonation of huge delay of 1488 days.
