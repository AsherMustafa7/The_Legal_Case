B E FO R E HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SIDDHARTH MRIDUL HON'BLE MRS.
JUSTICE GOLMEI GAIPHULSHILLU 29.02.2024 (CJ) The present writ appeals have been
instituted on behalf of the State of Manipur and other official parties assailing the judgment and
order dated 18.04.2023 passed by the Ld. Single Judge in connected writ petitions being W.P.(C)
No. 205 of 2023, W.P.(C) No. 239 of 2023 and W.P.(C) No. 266 of 2023.
At the outset, it would be relevant to observe that the above said connected writ petitions, inter-alia,
prayed for a direction, to allow original writ petitioners, who were elected as representatives at the
5th General Panchayat election for Gram Panchayats as well as the Zilla Parishads, to continue in
office beyond the period of 5 (five) years; as stipulated by law; and till the time the State Election
Commission notified the election for the 6th General Panchayat election for Gram Panchayats and
to the Zilla Parishads.
At this juncture, it is also pertinent to observe that the original writ petitioners have since instituted

State Of Manipur & 7 Ors vs Pheiroijam Heramani & 6 Ors on 29 February, 2024
a writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 140 of 2024 (Pherioijam Heramani Singh & 11 Ors. Vs. State of
Manipur & 9 Ors.), inter-alia, seeking quashing of Section 109 of the Manipur Panchayati Raj Act,
1994 ("hereinafter referred to as the Act"), as being ultra vires the Constitution.
In view of the foregoing, it is axiomatic that the issues that arise for consideration; both in the writ
appeal instituted on behalf of the State of Manipur and the writ petition instituted on behalf of the
original writ petitioners; overlap and are interconnected.
Issue notice.
Md. Murtaza Ahmed, learned counsel led by Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior advocate accepts notice
on behalf of all the respondents; prays for and is granted 4 (four) weeks' time to file counter
affidavit, after providing an advance copy thereof to the learned counsel for the appellants, who may
file affidavit in rejoinder thereto, if any, within 2 (two) weeks thereafter.
The State of Manipur seeks an interim direction, staying the operation of the impugned judgment
and order dated 18.04.2023. It is observed that at this stage, the writ appellant is particularly
aggrieved by the direction issued by the Ld. Single Judge in Paragraphs No. 32 and 37 of the
common impugned judgment and order dated 18.04.2023, whereby they were directed to allow the
hitherto elected representatives of the Gram Panchayats and Zilla Parishads, to continue to function
in their respective posts, till the State Election Commission issues the election notification for the
6th General Panchayat election of Gram Panchayats as well as the Zilla Parishads.
It is undisputed before us that the original writ petitioners were duly elected as members of the
Gram Panchayats and Zilla Parishads, as the case may be, in the elections conducted in the year
2017 and assumed their respective office commencing from 26.10.2017 to 29.10.2017, for the
stipulated period of 5 (five) years.
It is further an admitted position that the process to hold election for the 6th General Panchayat
election for Gram Panchayats as well as election to the Zilla Parishads, in terms of the provision of
the Manipur Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) was initiated by the State
Election Commission on 04.04.2023 and the final electoral roll was notified on 27.04.2023 which
was published in local daily (The Sangai Express) on 28.04.2023. We, however, hasten to add that
the election process has been put on hold by the Governor of Manipur vide order dated 10.05.2023
'due to present unrest in the State'.
Having heard Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General, Manipur appearing on behalf of the State
of Manipur and other official appellants as well as Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior counsel
appearing on behalf of the then elected representatives (original writ petitioners) at length; in view
of the clear and unequivocal mandate of Article 243E of the Constitution of India read in
conjunction with the provision of Section 109 of the Manipur Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, we are prima
facie of the view that it would be just and necessary to stay the operation of the offending direction
issued by the Ld. Single Judge in the common impugned judgment and order dated 18.04.2023,
inasmuch as, it commands the official respondents to permit the elected representatives of the Gram

State Of Manipur & 7 Ors vs Pheiroijam Heramani & 6 Ors on 29 February, 2024
Panchayat and Zilla Parishads to function in their respective posts, beyond the period expressly
mandated by law; till the next date of hearing.
We, also prima facie, disagree with the reliance placed by Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior counsel,
appearing on behalf of the elected representatives, on the amended Section 22 of the Act; in view of
the evident sine qua non provided therein that, the provision of the same are attracted only in the
event of the provided for situation arising 'immediately after the establishment of the said Gram
Panchayat'.
However, in order to obviate a situation, where the Gram Panchayat and Zilla Parishads cannot
function in accordance with law; at the request of the learned Advocate General; we grant liberty to
the State of Manipur to appoint an Administrative Committee for each Gram Panchayats and Zilla
Parishads in accordance with law and the provision of the Act, afresh. [Reference: (1975) 3 SCC 765
(Madeva Upendra Sinai & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors.) Para No. 39 & 40].
List on 15.04.2024.
Copy of this order be furnished to both learned counsel for the parties.
