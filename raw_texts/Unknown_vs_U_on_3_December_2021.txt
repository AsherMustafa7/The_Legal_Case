repeatedly and also demanded Rs.10 lakhs from him and also threatened him that he would be fixed
in a POCSO case. When it was known to his parents, they rushed to the scene of occurrence and that
they were also assaulted by the accused. Based on the complaint https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
given by Rajkumar, a case in Crime No.206 of 2020 was registered by the respondent for the
offences punishable under Section 294(b), 323, 324 and 506(ii) of I.P.C. Read with 3(1) (r) , 3(1)(s)
and 3(2)(vs) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 on 07.10.2021. The appellants were

defacto complainant in order to take vengeance against the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
appellants, had given a false complaint as if the appellants abused him, assaulted him by calling his
caste name and threatened to falsely implicate him under POCSO Act. The complaint had been
given only on preemption. He would further submit that the respondent registered a case in crime
No. 206 of 2021 and without conducting proper enquiry had arrested the appellants on the same
day. He would further submit that the appellants are languishing in jail from 07.10.2021. The
appellants are prepared to abide by any stringent condition imposed by this Court and he would
seek for bail.
4.Mr.S.S.Sugendran, learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondents 1 and 2 would
submit that the appellants have abused the defacto complainant by calling his caste name and
assaulted him and when it was questioned by the parents of the defacto complainant, the accused
have also assaulted them. He would further submit that the investigation is pending. However, he
would submit that the defacto complainant has been arrested in a case registered by All Women
Police Station, Denkanikottai in Crime No.18 of 2021 for the offences under the POCSO Act.

5. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the appellants would submit that the first appellant had
moved the second application for bail before the Krishnagiri Court and bail has been granted to him
and thereby he is not pressing this appeal in respect of the first appellant. He has also made an
endorsement to that effect. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed as not pressed against the first
appellant.
6. Heard the learned counsels and perused the materials on record.
7. Though notice has been served on the third respondent and his name printed in the cause list,
there is no representation for the third respondent.
8.Taking into consideration of the facts and the submissions made and that the case of the defacto
complainant is only counter blast, the criminal appeal is allowed. The order passed in CMP No.1995
of 2021 on the file of the Principal Sessions Judge (for SC/ST Act), Krishnagiri is set aside.
