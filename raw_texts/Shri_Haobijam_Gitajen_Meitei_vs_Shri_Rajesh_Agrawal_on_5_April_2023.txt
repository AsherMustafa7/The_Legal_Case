MC(W.A.) No.41 of 2023 Page 3
It is stated that the delay so caused is unintentional and if not condoned, there will be loss and
injury to the applicant and prayed that the same may be condoned.
[2] The Respondent No.1 filed detailed reply to the application for condonation of delay. It is stated
that the delay of 37 days in preferring the Writ Appeal has not been properly explained by the
applicant/appellant.
In Para 4 of the counter affidavit, it is stated as follows:-
4. That, it is a settled position of law that while dealing with the matter under a
Limitation Act every day's explanation for such delay is inevitable. Above being the
position, the present Miscellaneous application seeking for 37 days of delay in
preferring the accompanying Writ Appeal without satisfying explanation of causing
such delay cannot be entertained. The applicant has approached the Court in a very
casual manner without giving even the explanation of the intervening periods of the
events, and as such the present application is misconceived and same has been filed
in such a casual manner that the same deserves to be rejected with heavy cost.
It is stated that, there has been unexplained gap of 3 days starting from 12/11/2022 till 14/11/2022
and further the applicant also failed to explain the delay caused with effect from 16.12.2022 till
29.12.2022 in filing of the application and since the applicant is not able to properly explain the
delay, it is prayed that the application may be dismissed with heavy cost.

[3] The Respondent No.2 has also filed reply to the application for
condonation of delay. It is stated that the Writ Appeal itself is not maintainable as the
appellant/applicant is aggrieved by an order passed in Contempt proceeding and the applicant
ought to have filed a Contempt Appeal and hence, the present application may be dismissed on this
ground of maintainability. It is also stated that the present applicant has no locus to file the
contempt petition as well as the present appeal as he himself was participating in the said election

by being a proposer of a candidate apart from being a voter enrolled in the said notify voter list. He
further stated that the applicant is a chronic litigants and he has filed multiple writ petitions relating
to the administration of the MPP and was acting as the General Secretary even after the Election
Commission of India clarified that there was no office bearers of MPP which was legally not
recognised by the ECI. Therefore, he prays that the application be dismissed as a threshold.
[3] Mr. S. Rupachandra, learned senior counsel for the applicant submits that there is no inordinate
delay. The delay as pointed out by the respondents has been properly explained in the application.
There is some confusion due to typographical mistake.
[4] Mr. A. Jagjit, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 says that there is no explanation for the
period between 15.12.2022 to 30.12.2022 as given in Para 2 of the application. Hence, the
application may be rejected on this ground.
MC(W.A.) No.41 of 2023 Page 5
[5] Mr. S. Rupachandra, learned senior counsel for the
applicant/appellant submits that due to typographical mistake in the application, the time period
from 01.12.2022 to 15.12.2022 should be between 01.12.2022 to 30.12.2022 and the same may be
construed liberally in the interest of justice and prays that the delay in filing the accompanying Writ
Appeal may be condoned.
[6] Mr. S. Biswajit, learned senior counsel for Respondent No.2 says that the Writ Appeal has been
filed against the closer of the Contempt and the same is not maintainable in the present form and
the application for condoning delay in connection with non-maintainable appeal ought to be thrown
at the threshold.
[7] Heard the learned counsels for the parties and considered the rival submissions and materials on
record.
The applicant has explained the time taken in filing the accompanying Writ Appeal and it is also
clarified that there was a typographical mistake in the application and the date 15.12.2022 is to be
read as 30.12.2022.
[8] The ground of non-maintainability of the Writ Appeal can be considered at the time of
admission of the Writ Appeal and in the present application, the Court is to consider the explanation
given by the applicant/appellant.
MC(W.A.) No.41 of 2023 Page 6 We do not find inordinate and unexplained delay on the part of the
applicant in preferring the Writ Appeal and the delay of 37 days in filing the accompanying Writ
Appeal is condoned and the application is allowed.
It is clarified that the respondents may raise the plea of maintainability of the Writ Appeal while
considering the admission of the Writ Appeal.
