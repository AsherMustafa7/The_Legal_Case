CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD
CAV JUDGMENT
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 1
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Date : 30 -04-2019
Petitioner is one of the bidders.
2. This writ application is seeking to challenge the
decision of the respondent no.1 to 3 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
employer' or 'the respondent no.1 Company') whereby the
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
2/91
respondent no.1 Company has extended the prescribed date and
time for submission of bids as mentioned in the Invitation for
Bidders (in short 'IFB'). The application goes on to say that if the
respondent no.4 could not submit its bids by prescribed time in the
IFB read with clause 6.1 of the Instruction to Bidders ('ITB') and
the time lapsed, the respondent nos.1 Company could not have
extended the time and the extension is nothing but a favour shown
to accommodate the respondent no.4. The legality and validity of
Amendment No. '24' and Amendment No. '25' as contained in
Annexure- '5' and '6' respectively to the writ application have
been questioned even before opening of the technical bid.
3. Learned senior counsel for the parties have argued the
matter at length and this Court acknowledges their assistance
rendered to this Court.
Brief facts of the case
4. The respondent no.1 is a wholly owned subsidiary of
SJVN Ltd. which in turn is a joint venture of the Government of
India and Government of Himachal Pradesh. The respondent no.1-
Company came out with an Invitation for Bid (IFB)
No.STPL/BTPP/P&C/EPC-01/2018-878 dated 22.08.2018 for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 2
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) Package for
Buxar Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW). Initially as per the bid
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
3/91
documents the date fixed for submission/uploading the bid
documents was 10.10.2018 at 14.00 Hrs.(2.00 PM). The bid
document, the relevant part of which has been brought on record
with the supplementary affidavit of the petitioner as Annexure-11,
would show that it is contained in seven volumes. Volume-I deals
with Conditions of Contract (Commercial and General). Volume-I
consists of six Sections. Section I is called Invitation for Bids
(IFB), Section II is the Instructions to Bidders (ITB), Section III is
the Bid Data Sheet (BDS), Section IV lays down the General
Conditions of Contract (GCC), Section V provides Special
Conditions of Contract (SCC) and Section VI prescribes the Forms
and Procedures (FP).
5. In terms of Clause 6.1 of the ITB, respondent no.1-
Company amended the original date of submission of bid on
various occasions. It is an admitted position that all those
amendments prior to impugned amendments were effected before
expiry of the time prescribed in the original bid document as also
before expiry of time fixed in the subsequent amendments. It is
also an admitted position that so far Annexure- '5' and '6' which
are the two amendments under challenge by which the time for
submission of bid on 05.03.2019 at 13.00 Hrs. was extended to
17.00 Hrs. (IST) on 05.03.2019 and then the date and time for

Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
4/91
submission of the bids were further extended from 05.03.2019 to
08.03.2019
at 13.00 Hrs. (IST). These extensions were done after expiry of prescribed time i.e. 05.03.2019 at
13.00 Hrs.
6. The petitioner had raised its objection to the extension of time after expiry of the last amended
time. Annexure-8 series are copies of the letters written by the petitioner to respondent
no.1-Company raising it's protest on the ground that any extension of time after closure of scheduled
bids time violates the tender norms and is against the tender provisions specified in Clause 16.4 of
the ITB.
7. It is also on record that pursuant to the extension of time the Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited, a
Public Sector Undertaking (respondent no.4) has submitted its bids. The participation of
respondent no.4 in the given manner is not acceptable to the petitioner, hence the present writ
application.
8. In order to appreciate the rival submissions, this Court, while hearing the writ application on
02.04.2019, thought it just and proper to implead the service provider in the case i.e. M/s
E-Procurement Technologies Limited as party respondent no.5. The background in which the
respondent no.5 was added and a report was called for would be duly reflected in the order dated
02.04.2019 which I quote hereunder for a ready reference:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 "This Court has benefit of
hearing Mr.Amrendra Saran, learned Senior Advocate and Mr. S.B.Upadhayay the
another learned Senior Advocate in this case. Mr. P.K.Shahi, the learned Senior
Advocate has also addressed this Court and has taken-up certain issues on behalf of
respondent no.4. The matter has been heard at length.
Apart from his contention that the employer in this case, i.e. respondent nos.1 to 3
would have no power to extend the time for submission of bid after expiry of the
prescribed time by way of amendment, Mr.Amrendra Saran, learned Senior Advocate
representing the petitioner has also submitted to this Court that what has been stated
in amendment 24 and amendment 25 as contained in Annexure '5' and '6'
respectively to the writ application that the extension is being granted because the
bidders were facing some technical issues are not correct and it was only to favour the
respondent no.4, this Court thinks it just and proper as also in tune with some of the
judicial pronouncements cited at the Bar to find out the correct position with regard
to the technical issues prevailing at the relevant time i.e., on 05.03.2019 before 01:00
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 4
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
P.M. which was the time prescribed for uploading the tendered documents.
It is the contention of Mr. Shahi, learned Senior Advocate representing respondent no.4 that in fact
the respondent no.4 had registered itself well within the time prescribed in the tender document but
was facing certain technical glitches in uploading the documents since 04th March itself which were
brought to the notice of the service provider. Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 This Court has also been informed by Mr. S.B.Upadhayay, learned Senior Advocate
representing respondent nos.1 to 3 that in fact on 04th March, 2019 the petitioner had also
requested respondent nos.1 to 3 to extend the time for submission of the bid for a period of two
weeks because they were unable to upload the documents immediately after noticing the
amendment effected on 1st March, 2019. It is also contended on behalf of respondent nos.1 to 3 that
infact after extension of time the petitioner had visited at least 11 times on the portal and thereby the
petitioner had utilized the opportunity granted to all the intending bidders including the petitioner
by virtue of the extension of time for submission of bids. Mr. Upadhyay has also relied upon the
Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2012) 8 SCC 216 (Paragraph 24), (2000) 2
SCC 617, (2016) 16 SCC 818 and (2014) 3 SCC 760 (Paragraph 8 to 12).
Mr. Sahi, learned Senior counsel, has, at this stage, placed before this Court a Division Judgment of
the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Larsen and Turbo Hydrocarbon Engineering Limited vs.
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and Another to submit that the Judgment would cover the
issues raised in the present writ application. Mr. Amrendra Saran, learned Senior Advocate has with
all humility to the submissions made by his learned colleague submits that the petitioner does not
admit the submission of Mr. Upadhyay, learned Senior counsel for the respondent nos.1 to 3
regarding the 'visiting' of portal by the petitioner Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 during extended time because the fact is that at any point of time any of its officer had
altered any of the contents of the tendered document. Learned Senior Counsel submits that the
word 'visiting' has to be understood in the context in which it has been provided and unless it is
found that the petitioner has altered any of the terms and conditions of the tender document it
cannot be allowed to be argued that the petitioner has utilized the extension of time for submission
of the bid. It is submitted that on the very next day the petitioner had protested the extension of
time granted by respondent nos.1 to 3.
In course of argument, various submissions have been made by the learned Senior Counsel for the
parties. While, it is the submission of Mr.Saran, learned Senior Counsel that there are possibilities
of interfering with the information furnished by the petitioner in its financial bid and the
respondents may come to know about the price disclosed in the financial bid, it is the submission of
Mr.Upadhyay and Mr.Sahi, learned Senior Advocates at the Bar that the 'E-Portal' is security
compliant. Reference has also been made to certain frequently asked questions to show that the
documents uploaded on the web-site are in encrypted form and unless those are de-crypted and
made in readable form after opening of the technical bid, nobody can read it and come to know
about its contents thereof. It is also pointed out that the moment anybody would open the bid
document of the petitioner, the system will automatically generate an information which will first go
to the petitioner showing that his bid Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
document has been seen by somebody. There is no such allegation in the writ petition according to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 5
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
learned Senior Advocate for the respondents. Mr. Saran, learned Senior Advocate has in course of
argument relied upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in case of G.K. Transport
Company vs. Western Coalfield Limited to submit that there was an identical Clause in the bid
document in the said case whereunder the employer could have modified the bid document by
issuing addenda before the deadline of the submission of the bid but when the employer extended
the time after the deadline for submission of bids the Hon'ble Bombay High Court did not approve
the same. The learned Senior Counsel has also relied upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Maharashtra Housing Development Authority vs. Shapoorji Pallonji & Company
Private Limited and Ors. reported in 2018 (3) SCC Page 13 to submit that in the said case the time
for submission of bid was extended by the employer which was permitted by the Hon'ble High Court
but when the Judgment of the Hon'ble High Court was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court the Hon'ble Supreme Court after obtaining a report from the service provider i.e. NIC found
that there was no technical glitch in the system and for that reason the Hon'ble Supreme Court took
a view that in absence of any technical glitch in the system if the time was extended by the employer
contrary to the terms and conditions of the tender then such extension cannot be approved and
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 the Judgment of the Hon'ble High Court
was set- aside.
After going through the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Maharashtra
Housing Development Authority (Supra), this Court is of the considered opinion that in order to
take a view on the correctness of the reasons provided in the amendment as contained in Annexure
'5' and '6' to the writ application it would be appropriate to call upon the service provider in this case
i.e. M/s E- Procurement Technologies Limited, B-704-705, Wall Street II, Opp. Orient Club, Nr.
Gujarat College, Ahmedabad-380006 to be added as party respondent no.5 in course of the day.
Let the service provider submit a report to this Court within one week from today as to the
prevailing technical conditions on 05.03.2019 before 01:00 P.M. The service provider must inform
as to whether the reasons shown by respondent nos. 1 to 3 for extension of time by way of
amendment 24 and amendment 25 are based on any such technical glitch found on the portal of the
employer provided by the service provider. The report shall be submitted in a sealed cover.
Mr. Saran, learned Senior Advocate submits that any report submitted by the service provider be
kept open to such submissions which may be made by the parties.
This Court leaves it open for the parties to take all such pleas which may be available to them in
respect of the report submitted by the service provider. Mr. Saran has also submitted that even if
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 the report supports the reasons shown in
Annexure '5' and '6' the submission of the petitioner remains that in no case the employer could
have extended the time for submission of the bid.
Further submission of the parties shall be heard on next date.
Let a certified copy of this order be served upon the service provider by respondent nos.1 to 3 by day
after tomorrow.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 6
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
The Registry shall issue "Dasti Notice" to respondent no.5 requisites for which shall be filed by the
learned counsel for the respondent nos.1 to 3 by tomorrow and the "Dasti Notice" shall be made
available to the learned Advocate representing the respondent nos. 1 to 3, his junior colleague or the
registered clerk by tomorrow evening.
As prayed, list this case under the same heading on 15th April, 2019 at the top."
9. Pursuant to the aforesaid order, the respondent no.5 sent a report enclosed with their affidavit,
but then because nobody was appearing on behalf of the respondent no.5, this Court passed order
dated 15.04.2019 directing the respondent no.5 to send a competent officer to explain the matter in
course of hearing. Pursuant to the said order one Mr. Tejas Parikh who is also deponent of the
affidavit of respondent no.5 and is a senior manager in the company appeared and assisted this
Court in understanding some of the technical issues.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 Submissions on behalf of the petitioner
10. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel representing the petitioner has went on elaborating
the submissions earlier made by Mr. Amrendra Sharan learned senior counsel. Mr. Kumar has
emphatically submitted that the respondent no.1- Company could not have extended the deadline
for submission of the bids.
11. Learned senior counsel has put emphasis on the words 'extension' and 'deadline'. It is his
submission that the word 'extension' presupposes existence of something. In this case since the
prescribed time of 13.00 Hrs. on 05.03.2019 had expired and the deadline was crossed, thereafter
the employer i.e. the respondent no.1-Company could not have extended the time by issuing
Amendment '24' dated 05.03.2019 at 13.54.33 Hrs. and the subsequent amendment extending the
date and time to 08.03.2019 at 13.00 Hrs. (IST). According to learned senior counsel it would
amount to committing violence with the terms and conditions of the tender document and shall take
away the sanctity of tender. He has heavily relied upon the conditions prescribed in the IFB under
clause 4.0, one of which is prescribing the time and date for opening of Techno-commercial Bids.
Relying upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Provash Chandra Patna High
Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 Dalui and another Vs. Biswanath Banerjee reported in
(1989) 1 SCC 487 it is submitted that in the said case the Hon'ble Supreme Court had considered
and held that the word 'extension' means to enlarge, expand, lengthen, prolong, to carry out further
than its original limit. Thus, extension ordinarily implies the continued existence of something to be
extended.
12. He has referred Clause 4.2.1 of the IFB which prescribes the registration for E-tendering and
method of applying. Learned senior counsel has pointed out from the relevant conditions under the
heading Contact Details that the vendors were given the name and mobile numer of the officials who
could have been contacted in case of any assistance required with respect to accessing of
e-Tendering portal and bid submission, but at the same time there was also a clear caution provided
in the IFB saying that all the bidders should get themselves registered well in advance and no extra
time will be considered for the delay in online vendor registration. The conditions further prescribes
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 7
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
that in case the bidders wait till the last moment for registration/uploading of bids, and if any
technical problem is encountered at that time and the closing time may elapse, respondent
no.1-Company shall not be responsible in any manner for such delay and any other reason thereof.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
13. Learned senior counsel has further pointed out from IFB (running page 92 of the brief) that the
respondent no.1- Company may modify/amend the tender document and extend the last date of
submission/opening of the bid at any time before the submission of the bids. It is thus his
submission that after expiry of the time at 13.00 Hrs. the impugned amendments could not have
been brought.
14. Thereafter, learned senior counsel has taken this Court through the various clauses of the ITB. It
is submitted that Clause 5.1 which prescribes the manner in which a prospective bidder may look for
a clarification to the bidding documents, is to be read with Clause 6 of the ITB. Clauses 6.1, 6.2 and
6.3, according to learned senior counsel for the petitioner are prescribing procedures in the matter
of issuance of any addendum/amendment and communication thereof through the portal of
respondent no.1-Company and the service provider for viewing by the bidders. Under Clause 6.2 the
bidders were advised to regularly check e-tender portal regarding posting of amendments if any.
Much emphasis has been given on Clause 6.3 and 16 of the ITB. It is submitted that Clause 6.3 is to
read with Clause 16 with special emphasis that Clause 16.0 has its heading "Deadline for Submission
of Bids". Learned senior counsel Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 submits
that Clause 16.2 talks of extension of deadline for submission of bids by amending the bidding
documents in accordance with ITB Sub-Clause 6.3, meaning thereby that the deadline for
submission of the bids could be extended only when an amendment is brought any time prior to the
deadline for submission of the bids. Reference has also been made to Clause 16.4 of the ITB to
submit that Clause 16.4 clearly prohibits online submission of bid after expiry of submission time
and in such a case the uploaded online bid on the portal shall be considered as non-responsive and
shall not be processed further.
15. It is further submitted that according to Clause 16.1 of ITB Techno-Commercial bids must be
submitted online no later than the time and date stated in the Bid Data Sheets. It is not in dispute
that in terms of the tender conditions, in case of any conflict between the conditions prescribed in
the ITB and the Bid Data Sheet, it is the Bid Data Sheets which is to be given effect to. Learned
senior counsel thus submits that when the submission is that when the bids column in the Bid Data
Sheets (BDS) clearly provides the deadline for bid submission date and time as stated in the IFB,
there cannot be any argument that the date and time prescribed in the 'IFB' may be changed after
expiry of time. Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
16. Learned senior counsel has argued that the sanctity of the tender document is of paramount
importance and the same should not be allowed to be tinkered with as has been done in the present
with sole intention to help the respondent no.4.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 8
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
17. Learned senior counsel has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Ramana Dayaram Shetty Vs. International Airport Authority of India and others reported in
(1979) 3 SCC 489 to submit that every word of a tender document should be given its meaning and
the entire tender document has to be read together so that no condition stipulated is rendered
otiose.
18. Learned senior counsel has further relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Nabha Power Limited (NPL) Vs. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and
another reported in (2018) 11 SCC 508 to submit that the principle of business efficacy should be
applied while interpreting the relevant clauses of the tender documents. He has also relied upon
G.K. Transport Company Vs. Western Coalfield Ltd. (2014) SCC Online Bom. 1030 and Maharashtra
Housing Development Authority Vs. Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Pvt. Ltd. (2018) 3 SCC 13 (para
9)=AIR 2018 SC 945 to submit Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 that the
technical glitches in the system of R-4 cannot be a ground to extend the deadline.
19. Learned senior counsel has also relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in
the case of Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Private Limited Vs. Union of India and Anr. decided on
15th November, 2018 in which relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Maharashtra Housing Development Authority (supra) the Hon'ble Division Bench of the
Karnataka High Court held that the propositions laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court would
cover the said case and since the appellant in the said case had not submitted a valid bid by clicking
the "freeze button" at 13.45 hrs on 02.04.2018, no grounds for interference was made out. The
Hon'ble Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court took note of the scope of judicial review under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India as enumerated in the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Tata Cellular Limited Vs. Union of India (AIR 1996 SC 11) and Sterling
Computers Vs. M& N Publications Limited and others (AIR 1996 SC 51).
20. A number of judgments on the scope of judicial review have been cited which this Court would
discuss in the later part of it's judgment.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
21. Learned senior counsel further submits that now from the report of the service provider, it is
evident that there was no technical glitch on the portal of the respondent no.1-Company before 1.00
PM on 05.03.2019, the technical issues which have been made ground for amendments '24' and '25'
is a mere pretext and it was only with intention to help respondent no.4.
22. To buttress his points, learned senior counsel submits that no public interest may be found in
the impugned action of the respondent no.1 and only because project in question is of worth Rs. 10
thousand crore does not mean that in the name of public interest the respondents may be allowed to
play a trick by violating the tender conditions. Learned senior counsel has gone on to argue that it
may be a case of collusion between the respondent no.1 and the respondent no.4 and that nobody
knows what are the reasons behind it.

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
23. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Maharashtra Housing
Development Authority (supra), learned senior counsel submits that in the said case the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court had issued directions in favour of the first respondent giving him a second
opportunity to submit his bid accepting the case of the petitioner that he had faced technical glitch
in submission of bid one time. The Hon'ble Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 Supreme Court called for a report from the NIC after framing two issues. The first issue
was whether the bid document uploaded by the first respondent can be retrieved or is irretrievably
lost. The NIC filed its affidavit in which it was stated that bid documents cannot be retrieved at this
time as the bid opening event has already been concluded. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the
Hon'ble Bombay High Court was not justified in giving second opportunity to the first respondent
because the documents are not retrievable and apart from that lack of any timely response of the
first respondent when the system had failed to generate an acknowledgment of the bid documents,
in absence of any glitch in the technology would strongly indicate that the bid submitted by the first
respondent was not a valid bid. It is submitted that this case would cover the case of the petitioner
as in this case also the respondent no.5 had failed to upload the bid and they could not press the
submission button within time.
24. Learned senior counsel has further argued on the strength of the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Reliance Energy Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Maharashtra State Road Development
Corporation Ltd. And Ors. reported in (2007) 8 SCC 1 that by the impugned amendments the
respondents have altered the level playing field which has caused prejudice to the Patna High Court
CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 petitioner inasmuch as the petitioner has been made to wait
for finalization of tender.
25. Learned senior counsel has also referred the guidelines of the CVC and various paragraphs of the
writ application alleging that the petitioner has pleaded malice in law if not in fact. It is submitted
that no transparency has been maintained in the matter of extension of time and it is evident from
the report of respondent no.5 that there was no technical glitch at the portal of SJVN.
26. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner has also submitted that the sanctity of the tender
conditions must be maintained and the negligent approach on the part of the respondent no.4 in not
submitting the tender within the time prescribed is liable to be deprecated. He has relied upon a
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sorath Builders Vs. Shreejikrupa Buildcon
Limited and Anr. reported in (2009) 11 SCC 9 in which after referring to the earlier judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of W.B. SEB Vs. Patel Engineering Company Ltd. (2001) 2 SCC
451 their Lordships held that it is equally in public interest to adhere to the rules and conditions
subject to which bids are invited. Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
Submission of Respondent no.1 Company
27. Mr. S.B. Upadhayay, learned senior counsel representing the respondent nos.1 Company
submits at the outset that it is nowhere the case of the respondent no.1 Company that there was any
technical glitch on it's portal. He has taken this Court through Annexure- '5' and '6' to the writ
application to submit that in these two Annexures the respondent no.1-Company has only referred

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Portal. It is submitted that from the report of the respondent no. '5' it is evident that the technical
issues were in fact being faced by the respondent no.4, the respondent no.4 had registered itself well
in time on 4th March, 2019 itself and had also uploaded all the documents before 13.00 hrs. on
05.03.2019 but when the respondent no.4 did not find the submission button and was facing
technical issues, he contacted the respondent no.5 i.e. the service provider and the service provider
tried to resolve the difficulties being faced by the respondent no.4. It however could not become
possible before 13.00 hrs. therefore, the respondent no.4 contacted the respondent no.1-Company
for extension of time. It is submitted that it is also not in dispute that on 04.03.2019 the petitioner
had also Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 submitted a request with the
respondent no.1-Company to extend the time for submission of the bids.
28. Learned senior counsel has brought on record Annexure-R-4/5 which is a copy of the request
made by the respondent no.4 to respondent no.1-Company at 12.59 PM i.e. one minute before final
time for submission of the bid. It is stated in Annexure-R-4/5 that "there was a system problem due
to which we are not able to submit bid though we have uploaded all the documents". At 1.10 PM on
05.03.2019 again a communication was received from respondent no.4 enclosing the upload status
report. It was informed that "despite continuous interaction with your ABCPROCURE team for
more than a hour prior to closing time of bid submission, bid could not be submitted though it has
been fully uploaded". At 1.54.33 hrs. on 05.03.2019 the extension of time was notified by respondent
no.1-Company till 17.00 Hrs (IST) and thereafter at 16.43.03 hrs. (IST) on 05.03.2019 itself the
respondent no.4 was able to submit the bid successfully.
29. The respondent no.1-Company has also brought on record a true copy of the log-sheet/event
management list appearing on the portal SJVN.ABCPROCURE.COM which shows that the
respondent no.4 was successful in final submission of bid on 05.03.2019 at 16.43.03 hrs. (IST).
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
30. Learned senior counsel submits that the respondent no.1 engaged M/se-Procurement
Technologies Ltd. as a service provider for e-tendering and invited online bids on International
Competitive Bidding from eligible bidders in single stage two part (i.e. part 1: techno-commercial
bid and part 2 price bid) for EPC Package for Buxar Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW) at Chausa.
The project is to be completed with an investment of approximately Rs.10,439.0 crore including
interest during construction of Rs.1146.50 crore and financing charges of Rs.36.50 crore at January
2018 place level. The project is to be completed within a period of 52 months for first unit of 660
MW. As per the extant instructions of the Ministry of Power and CVC regarding e-tendering the bids
were required to be routed through E-Procurement Technologies Ltd., a service provider accredited
by the Central Vigilance Commission.
31. It is the submission of Mr. Upadhayay, learned senior counsel that ITB read with BDS
empowers, in the given circumstances, the respondent Company to extend the deadline for
submission of bids as envisaged in Clause 6.3 and 16.2 of the ITB. He has defended the extension of
time vide Amendment '24' and Amendment '25' issued on 05.03.2019 in the given facts and
circumstances of the case. It is submitted that the attempt of the Patna High Court CWJC No.4681
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 11
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 petitioner is to avoid fair competition by larger participation of intending
bidders which is one of the requirement of the CVC guidelines.
32. Learned senior counsel submits that the respondent no.1-Company seriously contests the
allegations of discrimination or any oblique motive in extending the timeline for submission of the
bids. It is submitted that the allegations of there being any oblique motive is totally unfounded and
there is no reason to consider the same. Learned senior counsel submits that action of respondent
no.1-Company were actuated with bonafide reasons. It is also pointed out that during the extended
period of time the petitioner had also revisited its bid on at least 11 occasions, therefore the
petitioner had also utilized the extended time to revisit its tender. It is submitted that only because
the petitioner did not carry any change in the uploaded tender would not mean that the petitioner
had not utilized the extended period for revisiting their tender conditions.
33. Learned senior counsel further submits that there is no requirement in the CVC guidelines that
timeline for submission of the bids before the opening time cannot be extended. It is his submission
that the respondent no.1-Company has given the level playing field to all the prospective tenderers
by notifying the Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 extension to all the
bidders sufficiently in advance in order to enable them to purchase tender document and submit
their respective bids. The opportunity was provided to all including the petitioner and it was not
confined to one bidder.
34. Learned senior counsel further submits that the petitioner is unable to show that any prejudice
has been caused to him only because the time for submission of bid has been extended. As regards
the apprehension of the petitioner that the price bid was likely to be seen and known since there was
no protective password it is stated in the counter affidavit that there is full proof E-tendering
mechanism which makes it impossible to know the particulars of any bid submitted in advance
before the date of its opening arrives. In this particular project, according to the respondent
no.1-Company, there were two stages of opening the bids, the first was techno-commercial bid and
only after the techno-commercial bid is opened, evaluated and after evaluation found responsive,
then there is a provision for opening of their price bid. In this regard Clause 19 of the ITB provides
for opening and evaluation of the bids. Learned senior counsel has pointed out from clauses 4.4 and
4.5 that the e-procurement system is based on PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) technology for
encryption and cyber security. Any interference with the bid already submitted Patna High Court
CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 would be known immediately to both the bidders and the
service provider if at all any such incident takes place. In the instant case no such incident takes
place and therefore the apprehension has got no basis.
35. Learned senior counsel further submits that even though the amendment '24' and '25' do not
mention the word 'public interest', it is always for the Court sitting under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India to look into the public interest element present in the decision making process
of respondent no.1 Company. Learned senior counsel has relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Air India Ltd. (supra) to submit that in the matter of award of contract,
the Court has limited scope of judicial scrutiny and it is only when the decision making process is
found vitiated by malafide, unreasonableness and arbitrariness, the same may be interfered with by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 12
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
way of judicial review. It is submitted that in the case of Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa, reported
in (2007) 14 SCC 517 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down the importance of public interest in
commercial contracts and held that the government must have a free hand in setting the terms of
the tender and it is as a necessary concomitant for administrative body in an administrative sphere.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
36. Mr. Upadhayay, learned senior counsel has submitted that the time was extended before
opening time of bids without committing any violence to the terms of the tender. Referring to a
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Michigan Rubber (India) Limited Vs. State of
Karnataka and others reported in (2012) 8 SCC 216, learned senior counsel submits that the learned
counsel for the petitioner has not placed paragraph 24 of the judgment wherein the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has opined that a court before interfering in tender or contractual matters in
exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India should pose to itself two
questions namely;
(i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is mala fide or intended to favour
someone; or whether the process adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and irrational that the
court can say that the decision is such that no responsible authority acting reasonably and in
accordance with relevant law could have reached? and
(ii) Whether the public interest is affected?
37. Thus, learned senior counsel submits that it is open to the court exercising power of judicial
review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to consider the issue of public interest before
interfering with the decision taken by the employer. Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019
38. Learned senior counsel for the respondent no.1- Company has drawn the attention of this Court
towards the facts of the case of Nabha Power Limited (supra) and submits that it is only when in the
facts of the case five conditions test set out in B.P. Refinery (Westernport) proprietary Ltd. V. Shire
of Hastings 1977 UKPC 13: (1977) 180 CLR 266 (Aus) are fully satisfied that the implied conditions
are to be read in to contract. Learned senior counsel has drawn the attention of this Court towards
paragraph 72 of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Nabha Power Ltd. (supra) to submit that
the Hon'ble Apex Court has extended the word of caution by saying that it should certainly not be an
endeavour of commercial courts to look to implied terms of contract. Normally a contract should be
read as it reads as per its express terms. The implied terms is a concept, which is necessitated only
when the Penta test comes into play.
39. Learned senior counsel has tried to distinguish the case of Nabha Power Ltd. Saying that in the
said case a dispute with regard to deductions of certain amount from the amount due and payable
under the invoices to the appellant led to a cause for the appellant to raise a dispute. In the present
case, it is pointed out that till date no contract has been concluded between the petitioner and the
respondent no.1-Company and merely by participating in Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019
dt. 30-04-2019 the tender, the petitioner has not acquired any vested right to challenge the decision
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 13
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
of the respondent no.1-Company to extend the deadline for submission of bid. It is submitted that
the litigation brought by the petitioner is only against the public interest as it is delaying the
decision making process.
40. Learned senior counsel has also relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Caretel Infotech Ltd. Vs. HPCL and others reported in 2019 SCC Online SC 494. The
attention of this Court has been drawn towards the views of the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the
court should not endeavour to give their own interpretation to contracts, more specifically tender
terms, at the behest of a third party competing for the tender, rather than what is propounded by a
party framing the tender.
41. Learned senior counsel submits that the essentiality of a condition in the tender document be left
to the wisdom of the employer and it cannot be allowed to be questioned by way of a writ petition.
On these grounds, Mr. Upadhayay, learned senior counsel submits that the writ application is fit to
be dismissed as no case for interference with the action of the respondent no.1- Company is made
out in the facts of the present case. Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
Submissions on behalf of R-4
42. Mr. Parag P. Tripathi, learned senior counsel representing the respondent no.4 has picked-up
from where Mr. S.B. Upadhyay, learned senior counsel left. Learned senior counsel submits that
Clause 6.1 and 16 of the ITB are to be interpreted by giving full effect to each and every word
contained therein. It is submitted that the ratio of the judgment of Ramanna Dayaram Shetty
(supra) which has been cited on behalf of the petitioner would rather help respondent no.4. In his
submissions a careful reading of the clause 6.1 of the ITB would go long way to show that clause 6.1
envisages a situation where prior to deadline for submission of the bid, the employer may, for any
reason, whether at its own initiative or in response to a clarification requested by a prospective
bidder, amend the bid documents. Then Clause 6.3, according to learned senior counsel is providing
the procedure to be followed once the employer takes decision in terms of clause 6.1 to amend the
bidding documents. It is submitted that clause 6.3 has purposely not incorporated the words 'At any
time prior to the deadline for submission of Bid' as occurring in clause 6.1. According to him clause
6.3 in the first part talks of a wide discretion on the part of the employer to extend the deadline for
submission of bids in accordance with clause 16 and in order to Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of
2019 dt. 30-04-2019 give a level playing field to all the bidders such extension is to be notified on
the portal where all prospective bidders may see the extended time.
43. Learned senior counsel further submits that clause 16.1 Part I (Techno-Commercial) provides
that the bids must be submitted online no later than the time and date stated in the Bid Data Sheets.
Further clause 16.2 confers wide powers upon the employer to extend the deadline by amending the
bid documents in accordance with clause 6.3. Clause 16.2 nowhere restricts the power of the
employer in the matter of extension of deadline. There is nothing like clause 6.1. It is submitted that
had it been intention of the employer not to provide for any opportunity to extend the deadline for
submission of the bids after expiry of the deadline, there was no reason as to why clause 16.2 of the
ITB would not prescribe clearly the words 'At any time prior to the deadline'. It is submitted that
clause 16.2 confers a discretion on the employer to extend the deadline for submission of the bids by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 14
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
amending the bid documents in accordance with the ITB sub- clause 6.3 and in such case all rights
and obligations of employer and bidders will thereafter be subject to the deadline as extended. It is
submitted that in clause 6.3 and 16 leave no scope to entertain any doubt that there are no fetters on
Employer's discretion to Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 extend the
deadline after expiry of time notified for submission of bid, i.e. 05.03.2019, 13.00 hrs. It is further
stand of the R-4 that the petitioner is unnecessarily referring to clause 6.1 which does not deal with
question of extension of time for submission of bid, rather it deals with Amendment and Addendum
to the bidding documents whereas clause 6.3 and 16 specifically deal with time for submission of
bid.
44. Learned senior counsel has further submitted that the emphasis of learned senior counsel
representing the petitioner saying that in the counter affidavit the respondent no.1-Company has
made a vague statement in paragraph 2.6 that the primary reason for 24th and 25th amendment
was the technical glitches/issues being faced by the certain bidders but who were those certain
bidders have not been disclosed, has no significance in the context of the present case. It is
submitted that the Court sitting under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is not going to be a
fact finding court and unless malafide writs large in the decision making process of respondent
no.1-Company no interference would be required.
45. Referring to the logs/audit trail report brought on record with the affidavit of respondent no.5
learned senior counsel submits that the affidavit has clearly disclosed that the service Patna High
Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 provider was contacted at Shimla location to resolve
the intermittent problem faced by the respondent no.4 and that the identified person of the service
provider, provided remote access support and tried to resolve the issues faced by the respondent
no.4 but could not resolve the issues till 1.00 PM. Learned senior counsel submits that it is evident
from the affidavit of respondent no.5 that the bidders were free to contact the service provider for
guidance or system requirement or any other service, in this case the petitioner was facing technical
glitch and as such well before expiry of deadline, the respondent no.4 had been seeking help of
respondent no.5 because after uploading the tender documents the respondent no.4 was unable to
find the final submission tab. It is submitted that from the logbook enclosed as Annexure-3 to the
affidavit of respondent no.5 it would appear that the respondent no.4 had uploaded its tender
documents. The respondent no.5 was giving remote access to the system of respondent no.4 is also
evident from the affidavit of respondent no.5 as the respondent no.5 has stated that he tried to
resolve the issue but could not resolve till 1.00 PM. It is submitted that the dispute as to where the
glitch was located is wholly irrelevant to the dispute and indeed can never be a subject matter of writ
jurisdiction. To that extent, learned senior counsel submits that whether the technical glitch Patna
High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 was in the system of respondent no.4 or on the
portal of the respondent no.1-Company, the report of the respondent no.5 cannot be taken as a
conclusive proof of the fact and if such serious issue of dispute is ventured into for adjudication, the
writ court would not be an appropriate forum for the same.
46. Learned senior counsel has relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble supreme Court in the case of
Central Coalfields Limited and Anr. Vs. SLL-SML reported in (2016) 8 SCC 622. It is submitted that
in the said case the Hon'ble Apex Court reiterated that the rule of interpretation applicable alike to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 15
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
documents as to statutes that save for compelling necessity, the Court should not be prompt to
ascribe superfluity to the language of a document and should be rather at the outset inclined to
suppose every word intended to have some effect or be of some use. It is pointed out that in the said
case the CCL being the employer had taken a decision by adhering to the terms and conditions of
NIT. The Hon'ble Apex Court while referring to Poddar Steel Coporation Vs. Ganesh Engineering
Works reported in (1991) 3 SCC 273 to advance the theory of essential and non-essential or
ancilliary or subsidiary terms of an NIT, held that whether a term of NIT is essential or not is a
decision taken by the employer which should be respected. The Hon'ble Apex Court Patna High
Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 has further went on to say that even if the term is
essential, the employer has the inherent authority to deviate from it provided the deviation is made
applicable to all bidders and potential bidders.
47. Learned senior counsel representing the respondent no.4 submits that in a project of Rs.10000
crore of rupees the entire attempt of the petitioner who is only a tenderer at this stage is to throttle
the competition which is otherwise in public interest. Referring to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of State of Jharkhand and others Vs. CWE- Soma Consortium reported in (2016)
14 SCC 172 learned senior counsel submits that the Hon'ble Apex Court has held in the said case that
in case of a tender, there is no obligation on the part of the person issuing tender notice to accept
any of the tenders or even the lowest tender. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that so long as the bid has
not been accepted, the highest bidder acquires no vested right to have the auction concluded in his
favour. Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Laxmikant V. Satyawan reported in
(1196) 4 SCC 208, Rajasthan Housing Board Vs. G.S. Investments reported in (2007) 1 SCC 477 and
U.P. Awas Evam Vikash Parishad Vs. OM Prakash Sharma reported in (2013) 5 SCC 182 have been
referred to.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
48. Learned senior counsel has further relied upon the recent judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of Caretel Infotech Ltd. (supra) and observations of the Apex Court in paragraph '38' has
been read out.
49. In his attempt to bring home the points canvassed on behalf of the respondent no.4, learned
senior counsel has also submitted that so far as the CVC guidelines are concerned, the Division
Bench of the Hon'ble Allahabad High Court has in the case of ABB ABL Limited and others Vs.
National Thermal Power Corporation Limited and others held in paragraph 17 that guidelines issued
by the CVC does not have any statutory force. It is submitted that in the case of Raunaq
International Ltd. Vs. IVR Construction Ltd. And others reported in (1999) 1 SCC 492 the Hon'ble
Apex Court has reiterated the principles governing the process of judicial review and held that the
writ court would not be justified in interfering with the commercial transactions in which the State
is one of the parties except where there is substantial public interest involves and in cases where
proceeding is malafide.
50. Learned senior counsel has submitted that in Tata Cellular Vs. Union of India reported in (1994)
6 SCC 651 in paragraph 94 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has emphasized need to Patna High Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 16
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 find a right balance between the administrative discretion to
decide the matters on the one hand and need to remedy any unfairness on the other. It is submitted
that one of the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case is that the government
must have freedom of contract and the decision of the government must not only be tested by
application of wednesburry principle of reasonableness including its other facts but must be free
from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by malafide. The wednesburry principle has been
laid down in the case of Associated Provincial Picture House Ltd. Vs. Wednesburry Corporation
reported in (1948) 1 KB 223= (1947) 2 ALL ER 680(CA). It is submitted that the facts of the present
case would reveal that it cannot be said to be case of wednesburry unreasonableness or perversity.
The essentiality of condition must be in the hand of the employer and to power to deviate even from
essential condition is inherent in the employer.
51. Learned senior counsel has distinguished the present case from all those cases cited on behalf of
the petitioner by taking this Court through the facts of those cases vis-a-vis the facts of the present
case. It is submitted that in all those cases the unsuccessful bidders had approached the Court when
they failed to submit their bid within the time prescribed by the employer and were Patna High
Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 contesting for second opportunity on the ground of
technical glitches but the employer were not ready to accept the case of unsuccessful bidder. In some
of the cases the unsuccessful bidders moved the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to
challenge rejection of their bids on various grounds. Learned senior counsel submits that reliance
placed by the petitioner on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Maharashtra
Housing Development Authority (supra) is misplaced inasmuch as it would appear that in the said
case the High Court of Bombay had not accepted the case of the NIC that the absence of
acknowledgment of the submission of the bid by the first respondent-writ petitioner was on account
of its omission to press the "freeze button" and as there was no technical glitch in the system the
first respondent-writ petitioner was not entitled to any consideration of its otherwise defect.
Learned senior counsel submits that in all those cases the employer was contesting the issues with
the unsuccessful bidders whereas in the present case the employer has come forward to say that it
has extended the deadline for submission of bid in accordance with the tender conditions by
exercising its discretion and hence issues which had fallen for consideration before the Bombay
High Court and the Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 Hon'ble Supreme
Court are not similar much less identical in the facts of this case.
52. Learned senior counsel further submits that in the case of G.K. Transport Company Ltd. (supra)
again there was no condition prescribed in the tender document like the present case. The tender
document in the said case was not prescribing that in case of any conflict between the ITB and Bid
Data Sheet it is the Bid Data Sheet which will prevail.
53. Learned senior counsel has also distinguished the present case with that of Division Bench
judgment of the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) by referring to the facts of the case and submits that again in the said case it was not the fact
that the employer had extended the time for submission of bid rather the employer in the said case
was contesting the issues with the appellant that the Hon'ble Karnatka High Court did not think it
just and proper to give second opportunity to the appellant.

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
54. In the aforesaid background, learned senior counsel submits that it would only be in public
interest to upheld the decision of the respondent no.1-Company as it would enhance the
competitiveness in the commercial transactions. Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 Consideration
55. After hearing learned senior counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records, it appears to
this Court that at the first instance the issue which arises for consideration is with regard to a legal
interpretation to Clause '6' and '16' including their sub- clauses in the ITB read with the conditions
under the IFB and BDS. Clause '6' and '16' of the ITB are thus quoted hereunder for a ready
reference:-
"6.0 Amendment/Addendum to Bidding Documents 6.1 At any time prior to the
deadline for submission of Bid, the Employer may, for any reason, whether at its own
initiative, or in response to a clarification requested by a prospective Bidder, amend
the bidding documents. 6.2 Any Addendum/Amendment thus issued shall be part of
the Bid Documents pursuant to Sub-clause 4.1 and shall be communicated only
through the portal https://sjvn.abcprocure.com, www.eprocure.gov.in &
www.sjvn.nic.in for viewing by the bidders. The amendments to the Bid Documents
will be binding on the bidders and the notification of the amendment through portal,
shall be deemed to be construed that such amendment(s) to the Bid Documents have
been taken into account by the Bidder in its bid. Bidders are also advised to regularly
check e-tender portal regarding posting of amendments if any.
6.3 In order to afford prospective Bidders reasonable time in which to take the
amendment into account in preparing their bid, the Employer may, at its discretion,
extend the deadline for the submission of bids, in accordance with Clause 16 and
notify on portal Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
https://sjvn.abcprocure.com, www.eprocure.gov.in & www.sjvn.nic.in where all
prospective bidders may see the extended deadline.
............................................................................. 16.0 Deadline for Submission of Bids
16.1 Part-I (Techno-Commercial) Bids must be submitted online no later than the
time and date stated in the Bid Data Sheets.
Original Bid Security, Integrity Pact/Deed of Joint Undertaking/Power of Attorney
and all other documents as mentioned at clause 8.1.1 shall be submitted in physical
form before stipulated bid submission time at the address specified in BDS. Employer
shall not be liable for loss/non-receipt/late receipt of above documents in postal
transit.
16.2 The Employer may, at its discretion, extend this deadline for submission of bids
by amending the bidding documents in accordance with ITB Sub-Clause 6.3, in which
case all rights and obligations of Employer and Bidders will thereafter be subject to
the deadline as extended.

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
16.3 Complete Bids must be uploaded at the portal and hard copies of the documents
mentioned in Clause 8 & Clause 15.1 of ITB must be received by the Employer at the
address as specified in IFB/ITB/BDS no later than the time and date stipulated in the
Bid Data. In the event of the specified date for the submission of bids being declared
a holiday for the Employer, the hard copy of the documents will be received up to the
specified time on the next working day. However, the date and time for online
submission of the bids shall continue to be the date and time specified in the Bid Data
or any amendment for the same.
Employer shall not be liable for loss/non-receipt/late receipt of above documents in
postal transit."
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
56. As noted above it is the contention of Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel representing the
petitioner that the deadline for submission of the bids could not have been extended after 13.00 hrs
(IST) on 05.03.2019 because the aforesaid clauses of the ITB did not permit the employer to bring
an amendment after expiry of the deadline, Mr. S.B. Upadhayay and Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned
senior counsel have argued that the employer had a discretion in terms of clause 16.2 read with
clause 6.3 to extend the time after expiry of the deadline.
A glance over the case-laws
57. The parties here to have referred and relied upon a large number of judgments of the Hon'ble
Apex Court, therefore this Court thinks it just and proper to discuss those judgments in order to find
out their applicability in the facts of the present case. Legal Interpretation of Tender Conditions
58. Both the parties have relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra). In the said case, the Hon'ble Apex Court was considering
paragraph 1 of the notice inviting tenders wherein the respondent no.1 had stipulated condition of
eligibility by providing that a person submitting a tender must be a "registered IInd Class hotelier
having at least 5 years' experience". The Hon'ble Apex Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 Court found that this was a condition of eligibility to be satisfied by every person
submitting a tender and if in case of any person, this condition was not satisfied, his tender was
ineligible for being considered. The Hon'ble Apex Court, therefore, held that the respondent no.1
being a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution or in any event a public authority,
not entitled to depart from it at its own sweet will without rational justification. In the said case, the
respondent no.4 had experience of catering only in canteens and did not have 5 years' experience of
running a IInd Class hotel or restaurant and hence they did not satisfy the condition of eligibility,
yet his tender was accepted. This was found to be in violation of the standard or norm of eligibility
set up by respondent no.1 and the action of respondent no.1 in accepting the tender of respondents 4
was held invalid. The Hon'ble Apex Court while dealing with the condition prescribed in the tender,
in paragraph 7 of the judgment held as under:-

"........It is a well settled rule of interpretation applicable alike to documents as to
statutes that, save for compelling necessity, the Court should not be prompt to
ascribe superfluity to the language of a document and should be rather at the outset
inclined to suppose every word intended to have some effect or be of some use. To
reject words as insensible should be the last report of judicial interpretation for it is
an elementary rule based on common sense that no author of a formal document
intended to be acted upon by the others should be Patna High Court CWJC No.4681
of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 presumed to use words without a meaning. The court must,
as far as possible, avoid a construction which would render the words used by the
author of the document meaningless and futile or reduce to silence any part of the
document and make it altogether inapplicable.........".
Principle of 'Business Efficacy'
59. The legal principles for interpretation of a commercial contract came to be considered recently
in the case of Nabha Power Ltd. (NPL) (supra). In the said case, the Punjab State Electricity Board
(PSEB) conducted an international competitive bidding for selection of developer through tariff
based bidding process for procurement of power on long-term basis from a power station to be set
up at village-Nalash, Rajpura in the district of Patiala. The bidding documents were issued, certain
queries and clarifications were raised by the prospective bidders. There was a specific query as to
whether the coal to be supplied would be washed coal or unwashed coal, it was clarified that
washing of coal was to be arranged by the successful bidder. On the question of the costs associated
with fuel supply, transportation and unloading being pass through, it was clarified that tarrif
payment will be in accordance with Schedule VII of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). M/s L&T
Power Development Ltd.was declared as the successful bidder. The power purchase agreement
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 was entered into between PSEB and NPL.
The NPL was incorporated as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for implementation of the project and
the successful bidder was to acquire 100% shareholding of NPL and enter into a 25 year power
purchase agreement with PSEB. Accordingly, the contractual obligation began. Certain disputes
arose when certain deductions were made from the amount due and payable under the invoices. The
Hon'ble Apex Court was called upon to interpret the terms of the contract between the parties. The
appellant in the case also invoked the principle of "business efficacy" and the maxim reddendo
singula singulis for interpreting the terms of the 'PPA' and the energy charges formula as set out at
Article 1.2.3 of Schedule 7 of PPA. The Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment in the case of Nabha
Power Limited (NPL) (supra) went through the developments of law on the principle of business
efficacy to the transactions and after referring to Moorcock, Shirlaw Vs. Southern Foundaries,
Reigate Vs. Union Manufacturing Company, Liverpool City Council Vs. Irwin, Young & Marten Ltd.
V. McManus Childs Ltd., Collins V. Hopkins, Readhead s. Midland Railway Co. and Hancock Vs.
B.W. Brazier (Anerley) Ltd., recorded in paragraph 43, 44, 46, 47 and 48 as under:-

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
On the implication of the terms of contraction five conditions were laid down and a
reference was, once again, made to the The Moorcock3, Reigate vs. Union
Manufacturing Co. (Ramsbottom) Ltd.5 and Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries (1926)
Ltd.4 in the following terms:
"40. Their Lordships do not think it necessary to review exhaustively the authorities
on the implication of a term in a contract which the parties have not thought fit to
express. In their view, for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may
overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be
necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if
the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that "it goes without
saying"; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any
express term of the contract.
41. Their Lordships venture to cite only three passages
- albeit they are familiar to every student of this branch of the law. In The Moorcock3
(19) Bowen LJ said: (Pdp.68) '...I believe if one were to take all the cases, and they are
many, of implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be found that in all of them
the law is raising an implication from the presumed intention of the parties with the
object of giving to the transaction such efficacy as both parties must have intended
that at all events it should have. In business transactions such as this, what the law
desires to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction
as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are business men.. . .' 26

presumed intention of the parties that the primary condition must be satisfied that
the term sought to be implied must be reasonable and equitable. It is not to be
imputed to a party that he is assenting to an unexpressed term which will operate
unreasonably and inequitably against himself.
In Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co. (Ramsbottom) Ltd.5, Scrutton, LJ said:
(Kbp.605) 5 (1918) 1 KB 592 (CA) '...A term can only be implied if it is necessary in
the business sense to give efficacy to the contract i.e., if it is such a term that it can
confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated some one had
said to the parties, "What will happen in such a case?", they would both have replied:
"Of course, so and so will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too clear."
'In Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd4., MacKinnon LJ said: (Kbp.227) "....Prima facie that
which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it
goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander
were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him
with a common, "Oh, of course.!"'"

44. The next development, was in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. vs. West

98(HL) Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 explanation of
reasons with some general remarks about the principles which contractual
documents are nowadays construed - common sense principles by which any serious
utterance would be interpreted in ordinary life. Almost all the old intellectual baggage
of "legal"
interpretation was observed to have been discarded, and the principles summarized as follows:
(WLR pp.912 H- 913F) "(1) Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document
would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably
have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.
(2) The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the "matrix of fact," but this
phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the background may include. Subject to
the requirement that it should have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to
be mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the
language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.
(3) The law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the parties and
their declarations of subjective intent. They are admissible only in an action for rectification. The
law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal
interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of
this exception are in some respects unclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them.
(4) The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is
not the same thing as the meaning of its words.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 The meaning of words is a matter of
dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words
against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background
may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which
are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must,
for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax: see Mannai Investments Co. Ltd. v.
Eagle Star Life Assurance Co. Ltd.28 (1997) AC (5) The "rule" that words should be given their
"natural and ordinary meaning" reflects the common sense proposition that we do not easily accept
that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other hand, if
one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with
the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they
plainly could not have had. Lord Diplock made this point more vigorously when he said in Antaios
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 22
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Compania Naviera S.A. v. Salen Rederierna A.B.29 (AC.p201):
'.....if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is
going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must be made to
yield to business commonsense.'"
46. There were, once again, parallel developments in India during this period in
various High Courts but the views of this Court can be found expression in
Dhanrajamal Gobindram vs. Shamji Kalidas and Co.33 (AIR pp.1291-92, para 19):
"19. ....Commercial documents are sometimes expressed in language which does not,
on its face, bear a clear meaning. The effort of Courts is to give a meaning, if possible.
This was laid down by Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 the
House of Lords in Hillas & Co. v. Arcos Ltd.34 and the observations of Lord Wright
have become classic, and have been quoted with approval both by the Judicial
Committee and the House of Lords ever since. The latest case of the House of Lords is
Adamastos Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co. Ltd.35 There, the clause
was "This bill of lading", whereas the document to which it referred was a
charter-party. Viscount Simonds summarised at ACp. 158 all the rules applicable to
construction of commercial documents, and laid down that effort should always be
made to construe commercial agreements broadly and one must not be astute to find
defects in them, or reject them as meaningless."
47. In The Union of India vs. D.N. Revri & Co.36 P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was), speaking for the
Bench of two Judges said in para 7 as under:
(SCCp.151) "7. It must be remembered that a contract is a commercial document
between the parties and it must be interpreted in such a manner as to give efficacy to
the contract rather than to invalidate it. It would not be right while interpreting a
contract, entered into between two lay parties, to apply strict rules of construction
which are ordinarily applicable to a conveyance and other formal documents. The
meaning of such a contract must be gathered by adopting a common sense approach
and it must not be allowed to be thwarted by a narrow, pedantic and legalistic
interpretation....."
48. Lastly in Satya Jain vs. Anis Ahmed Rushdie , Ranjan Gogoi, J., elucidated the well established
principles of the classic test of business efficacy to Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 achieve the result of consequences intended by the parties acting as prudent
businessmen. It was opined as under: (SCC pp.143-44, paras 33-35) "33. The principle of business
efficacy is normally invoked to read a term in an agreement or contract so as to achieve the result or
the consequence intended by the parties acting as prudent businessmen. Business efficacy means
the power to produce intended results. The classic test of business efficacy was proposed by Bowen,
L.J. in Moorcock3 . This test requires that a term can only be implied if it is necessary to give
business efficacy to the contract to avoid such a failure of consideration that the parties cannot as
reasonable businessmen have intended. But only the most limited term should then be implied--the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 23
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
bare minimum to achieve this goal. If the contract makes business sense without the term, the
courts will not imply the same. The following passage from the opinion of Bowen, L.J. in Moorcock3
sums up the position (PD p. 68) "... In business transactions such as this, what the law desires to
effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been
intended at all events by both parties who are businessmen; not to impose on one side all the perils
of the transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure, but to make each party
promise in law as much, at all events, as it must have been in the contemplation of both parties that
he should be responsible for in respect of those perils or chances."
34. Though in an entirely different context, this Court in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
Manubhai Dharmasinhbhai Gajera38 had considered the circumstances when reading an
unexpressed term in an agreement would be justified on the basis that such a term was always and
obviously intended by and Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 between the
parties thereto. Certain observations in this regard expressed by courts in some foreign jurisdictions
were noticed by this Court in para 51 of the Report. As the same may have application to the present
case it would be useful to notice the said observations: (SCC p. 434) "51. ... '... "Prima facie that
which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it
goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander,
were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him
with a common "Oh, of course!'"
Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd.4, KB p.227 *** '... An expressed term can
be implied if and only if the court finds that the parties must have intended that term
to form part of their contract: it is not enough for the court to find that such a term
would have been adopted by the parties as reasonable men if it had been suggested to
them: it must have been a term that went without saying, a term necessary to give
business efficacy to the contract, a term which, although tacit, formed part of the
contract which the parties made for themselves." Trollope and Colls Ltd. v. North
West Metropolitan Regl. Hospital Board31 WLR p. 609C-D :ALL ER p. 268 a-b).'"
(emphasis in original)
35. The business efficacy test, therefore, should be applied only in cases where the term that is
sought to be read as implied is such which could have been clearly intended by the parties at the
time of making of the agreement....."
60. After referring to the aforesaid judicial pronouncements ultimately in paragraph 72 of the
judgment in Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 Nabha Power Limited (NPL),
the Hon'ble Apex Court put a word of caution as under:-
"72. We may, however, in the end, extend a word of caution. It should certainly not be
an endeavour of commercial courts to look to implied terms of contract. In the
current day and age, making of contracts is a matter of high technical expertise with
legal brains from all sides involved in the process of drafting a contract. It is even
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 24
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
preceded by opportunities of seeking clarifications and doubts so that the parties
know what they are getting into. Thus, normally a contract should be read as it reads,
as per its express terms. The implied terms is a concept, which is necessitated only
when the Penta-test referred to aforesaid comes into play. There has to be a strict
necessity for it. In the present case, we have really only read the contract in the
manner it reads. We have not really read into it any 'implied term' but from the
collection of clauses, come to a conclusion as to what the contract says. The formula
for energy charges, to our mind, was quite clear. We have only expounded it in
accordance to its natural grammatical contour, keeping in mind the nature of the
contract."
61. Keeping in mind the aforesaid principles of interpretation of the contract document/tender
conditions when this Court goes through the relevant stipulations present in the IFB, it is found that
the bidders were requested to get themselves Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 registered well in advance, they were informed that no extra time will be considered for
the delay in online vendor registration, if any. There is no dispute that the respondent no.4 in this
case had got itself registered online well before the deadline for submission of the bids. The further
stipulation provides that "....In case bidders wait till the last moment for registration/uploading of
Bids, and if any technical problem is encountered at that time and the closing time may elapse,
SJVN Thermal (P) Ltd. shall not be responsible in any manner for such delay/or any other reason
thereof." Thus, by providing the aforesaid stipulations, the respondent no.1 had made it clear that it
would not be responsible for the technical issues which may be encountered by the prospective
bidder at the last moments.
62. By yet another stipulation in the IFB, the respondent no.1 provided that "At any time before the
submission of Bids, SJVN Thermal (P) Ltd. may modify/amend the Tender document and extend
the last date of submission/opening of the Bid and any other key dates by issuing a
corrigendum/addendum and such corrigendum/addendum to this notice as well as to the Tender
document shall be available only on following websites:
A) www.sjvn.nic.in B) www.eprocure.gov.in C) https://sjvn.abcprocure.com Patna
High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
63. As such the bidders were advised to visit the above websites regularly before deadline for
submission of bid. The aforesaid condition stipulated in the clause 4.2.1 of the IFB is to be read
along with clause 5.1. According to clause 5.1 of the ITB a prospective bidder requiring any
clarification to the bidding documents may notify the employer through e-mail or in writing by post
at the address indicated in clause 14 of Section-I (IFB), Volume I and the employer had to respond
to such requests through the portal by clarifying the same in the pre-bid meeting.
64. Clause 6.1 is the enabling provision wherein at any time prior to the deadline for submission of
the bid, the employer may amend the bid documents. It is this cluster of words 'at any time prior to
the deadline for submission of the bid' (emphasis supplied) which has been read again and again in
course of argument on behalf of the petitioner to contend that any amendment of the bid documents
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 25
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
could have taken place only prior to the deadline for submission of the bids. Clause 6.2 provides the
manner in which addendum/amendment in the bid document shall be communicated for viewing
by the bidders. It also provides that any addendum/amendment thus issued shall be part of the Bid
Documents pursuant to Sub-clause 4.1. Thus clause 6.2 takes care of communication of
amendment/addendum if any Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 brought in
terms of clause 6.1. So far as clause 6.3 is concerned, it provides that in order to afford prospective
Bidders reasonable time in which to take the amendment into account in preparing their bid, the
Employer may, at its discretion, extend the deadline for the submission of bids, in accordance with
Clause 16 and notify on portal where all prospective bidders may see the extended deadline . Here it
is important to note that clause 16.1 talks of submission of bid online no later than the date and time
fixed in the bid data sheet (BDS). Thus clause 6.3 assumes it's importance keeping in clause 16.1,
16.2 and 16.3.
65. Now a question arises as to why after providing for the powers on the employer to bring any
amendment/addendum to the bidding documents at any time prior to the deadline for submission
of the bids and then after conferring discretion to extend the deadline for submission of the bids, the
employer (respondent no.1) provided clause 16 (deadline for submission of the bids) and once again
incorporated clause 16.2 saying that the employer may, at its discretion, extend this deadline for
submission of the bids by amending the bid documents in accordance with the ITB sub-clause 6.3.
To understand this, it would be necessary to go through clause 16.1 which says that Part-I
(Techno-Commercial) Bids must be submitted online no Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019
dt. 30-04-2019 later than the time and date stated in the Bid Data Sheets. It may be seen that in the
'IFB' the employer has provided the date and time for submission of the bid but under clause 16.1 of
the ITB it is provided that the deadline for submission of the online bids of part I will be no later
than the time and date stated in the Bid Data Sheets, thus, it appears to this Court that it is the time
and date in the bid data sheet which would be the deadline for submission of the bids and clause
16.2 confers power upon the employer to extend the deadline for submission of the bids by
amending the bidding documents which includes the bid data sheets. Section III of the tender
document is the Bid Data Sheets and the opening lines of the Bid Data Sheets read as under:-
"The following bid specific data for the Plant & Equipment to be procured shall
amend and/or supplement the provisions in the Instructions to Bidders (ITB).
Whenever there is a conflict, the provisions herein shall prevail over those in the
ITB." (underline is mine)
66. Part 'D' of the Bid Data Sheets deals with the submission of the bids. The deadline for
submission of the bids with reference to clause 16.1 of the ITB is provided in the table under the
heading submission for bid as under:-
"Date and time as stated in IFB/subsequent communication issued by Employer, if any". (underline
is mine) Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
67. Clause 6.3 of the ITB also refers clause '16' and it provides in it's second part that the employer
may, at its discretion, extend the deadline for submission of the bids, in accordance with clause 16
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 26
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
and notify on portal where all prospective bidders may see the extended deadline. Clause 6.3 instead
of talking of 6.1, talks of clause 16 which in turn talks of deadline provided in the Bid Data Sheets.
This Court has already held hereinabove that Clause 16.2 confers power upon the employer to
extend the deadline for submission of the bids as envisaged under the 16.1 (Bid Data Sheets). This
Court is willing to agree with the submissions of learned senior counsel for the respondents that
Clause 16.2 has consciously not incorporated the words "at any time prior to the deadline for
submission of the bids" as occurring under clause 6.1 of the ITB. If it would have been the intention
of the employer to prohibit the employer from extending the deadline for submission of the bids
after expiry of time, there was no reason as to why the embargo created under Clause 6.1 of the ITB
could not have been incorporated and reiterated in Clause 16.2. Clause 16.2 only refers to Clause 6.3
when it says that the employer, may at its discretion, extend this deadline for submission of the bids
by amending bidding documents in accordance with ITB sub-clause 6.3, in which case all rights and
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 obligations of employer and bidders will
thereafter be subject to the deadline as extended.
68. To me it appears that the reference of Clause 6.3 has been purposely made to ensure that the
extension of deadline for submission of bid be notified in the same manner so as to confer equal
opportunity to all the bidders and to maintain level playing field. Clause 16.2 thus wipe out any
chance of unreasonableness in the decision making process. Again clause 16.3 reiterates that
complete bids must be uploaded at the portal no later than time and date stipulated in the bid data
sheets. The Bids Data Sheets nowhere prescribes a condition that the subsequent communication
issued by the employer, if any must be before expiry of the first deadline. Even if it is assumed for a
moment that there is any conflict in clause 6.1 and the bid data sheets with reference to clause 16.1,
it is the bid data sheets which will prevail.
69. In the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra) the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that word used
in the documents are not superfluous or redundant and those must be given some meaning and
weightage. Following the ratio of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Ramana
Dayaram Shetty (supra), this Court would come to a conclusion that in fact clause 16.1 read with
opening words of the Bid Data Sheets saying that in Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 case of conflict between the provisions of the ITB and the Bid Data sheets it is the
provision of the Bid Data Sheets shall prevail, confers a wide power on the employer to come out
with subsequent communication with regard to the deadline for submission of the bid. The word
'subsequent' has been used under the heading 'deadline for bid submission', thus intention of the
employer is very clear, the employer has got power to come out with subsequent communication.
The full meaning of the word 'subsequent' is to be given and that would lead to a conclusion that the
deadline for bid submission may be amended by a subsequent communication issued by the
employer after expiry of the deadline. It would be naturally before opening of the bids if any already
submitted. This Court agrees with the submission of the respondents that clause 6.1 has purposely
not been taken care of in clause 16.2 of the ITB and the reference of clause 6.3 is only with regard to
the procedures to be followed when the employer in its discretion decides to extend the deadline for
submission of the bids by way of a subsequent communication as envisaged in the Bid Data Sheets.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 27
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
70. Once by way of a subsequent communication issued by the employer a fresh deadline for
submission of bid is communicated, the earlier deadline gets extended as it gets a new Patna High
Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 lease of life. The contention of the learned senior
counsel for the petitioner that the word 'extension' presupposes/implies a continued existence of
something to be extended seems not in the context of the tender document in this case. Reliance
placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Provas Chandra Dalui (supra) is
in the context of a lease deed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph 14 of its judgment in the
case of Provas Chandra Dalui (supra) held as under:-
"14. It is pertinent to note that the word used is 'extension' and not 'renewal'. To
extend means to enlarge, expand, lengthen, prolong, to carry out further than its
original limit. Extension, according to Black's Law Dictionary, means enlargement of
the main body;
addition of something smaller than that to which it is attached; to lengthen or
prolong. Thus extension ordinarily implies the continued existence of something to
be extended. The distinction between 'extension' and 'renewal' is chiefly that in the
case of renewal, a new lease is required, while in the case of extension the same lease
continues in force during additional period by the performance of the stipulated act.
In other words, the word 'extension' when used in its proper and usual sense in
connection with a lease means a prolongation of the lease. Construction of this
stipulation in the lease in the above manner will also be Patna High Court CWJC
No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 consistent when the lease is taken as a whole. The
purposes of the lease were not expected to last for only 10 years and as Mr. A.K.Sen
rightly pointed out the schedule specifically mentioned the lease as "for a stipulated
period of 20 years". As these words are very clear, there is very little for the court to
do about it."
71. The Hon'ble Apex Court has in the case of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And Anr. Vs. N.R.
Vairamani & Others reported in (2004) 8 SCC 579 held that the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court
be not cited like Euclid's theorems. Their Lordships held that a slightest of change in the facts of the
case would make a sea difference in the judgment. Paragraph '9' of the judgment in the case of
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (supra) is quoted hereunder for a ready reference:-
"9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the
factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is
placed. Observations of courts are neither to be read as Euclid's theorems nor as
provisions of a statute and that too taken out of their context. These observations
must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of
courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions
of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions
but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes,
they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not
to be interpreted as statues. In London Graving Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
2019 dt. 30-04-2019 Dock Co. Ltd. V. Horton2 (AC at P.761) Lord MacDermott
observed:(All ER p.14 C-D) "The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by
treating the ipsissima verba of Willes, J., as though they were part of an Act of
Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is not to
detract from the great weight to be given to the langauge actually used by that most
distinguished judge,..."
72. Keeping in mind the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforementioned case of
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (supra) when this Court looks into a judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Provas Chandra Dalui (supra), it is found that in the said case the
appellants claimed that they had exercised their option of extension of a lease deed at the expiry of
10 years for a period of 5 years i.e. from April 1, 1956 to March 31, 1961 on increased rental of Rs.250
per month and then for the second term of 5 years from April 1, 1961 to March 31, 1966 at the
increased rental of Rs.300 per month. During the lease, on March 31, 1959 the instant second
respondent by a registered instrument transferred the land to the first respondent who thereby
became the landlord. The first respondent instituted a Title Suit No.56 of 1966 on the allegation
against the appellants that the appellants failed to exercise the option of extension for one year at an
enhanced rent of Rs.500 and also failed to give peaceful and vacant possession of the land. The
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 defence of the appellants was that they did
not exercise option of renewal after the expiry of the original term of 10 years as they became thika
tenants from February 28, 1949 i.e. on the date of commencement of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy
Act, 1949 as admitted by the plaintiff's predecessor in interest. The second respondent in
Miscellaneous Execution Case No.126 of 1953 (Thika) before the Controller under the Calcutta Thika
Tenancy Act, 1949. In the facts of the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court framed two questions to
be the decided in the case namely whether the appellants acquired the status of thika tenants in
respect of the lease and whether there was estoppel, waiver, acquiescence or res judicata on the part
of the respondents as in earlier proceedings they treated the appellants as thika tenants before the
Controller.
73. In paragraph 10 of the judgment in the case of Provas Chandra Dalui (supra), the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held as under:-
'10. 'Ex praecedentibus et consequentibus optima fit interpretatio.' The best
interpretation is made from the context. Every contract is to be construed with
reference to its object and the whole of its terms. The whole context must be
considered to ascertain the intention of the parties. It is an accepted principle of
construction that the sense and meaning of the parties in any particular part of
instrument may be collected 'ex antecedentibus et consequentibus,' every part of it
may be brought into action in order to collect from the whole one uniform and Patna
High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 consistent sense, if that is
possible. As Lord Davey said ini N.E. Railway Co. v. Hastings1 (1900 AC 260, 267):
..... the deed must be read as a whole in order to ascertain the true meaning of its
several clauses, and ..... the words of each clause should be so interpreted as to bring
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 29
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
them into harmony with the other provisions of the deed it that interpretation does
no violence to the meaning of which they are naturally susceptible.....
In construing a contract the court must look at the words used in the contract unless
they are such that one may suspect that they do not convey the intention correctly. If
the words are clear, there is very little the court can do about it. In the construction of
a written instrument it is legitimate in order to ascertain the true meaning of the
words used and if that be doubtful it is legitimate to have regard to the circumstances
surrounding their creation and the subject matter to which it was designed and they
should apply.
74. On going through the aforesaid judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is crystal clear that
every document is to be construed with reference to its object and whole of its terms, this view is
also in consonance with the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramana
Dayaram Shetty (supra). In the facts of the case before the Hon'ble Apex Court in Provas Chandra
Dalui (supra) what has been observed by Their Lordships in paragraph '14' is all about the original
meaning of the word 'extension'. In the present case we are concerned with a legal interpretation of
the terms and conditions of the tender document with reference to the various stipulations present
including the Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 clauses of the bid data sheet
which specifically refers to subsequent communication by the employer.
75. It is not in dispute that the petitioner has chosen to participate in the tender knowing fully well
the stipulations present in the bid data sheet. Thus, in the opinion of this Court, the meaning of the
word 'extension' in the context of the present case has to be understood by reading together the
word 'subsequent communication by the employer' as occurring in the 'BDS'.
76. By way of subsequent communication if the employer has provided for a power to extend the
deadline for submission of bids by amending the bid documents the word 'extension' must be
interpreted harmoniously to give effect to all other clauses. I therefore with due respect do not agree
with the submission of learned Senior counsel for the petitioner.
77. This Court also finds no reason to look to any implied terms of the contract on the principle of
"business efficacy". The Hon'ble Supreme Court has in the case of Nabha Power Limited (supra)
extended the word of caution in paragraph 72 and this Court would follow the same. In the facts of
the present case, this Court would have no hesitation in saying that the Court is not really required
to read any "implied term" as the express terms of the tender document which have been referred
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 hereinabove would lead this Court to
conclude that the employer in the present case was acting well within the conditions present in
tender documents in exercising its power to extend the deadline for submission of the bids by
issuing a subsequent communication. The 'Penta Test' is not satisfied in this case.
78. A submission has been made before this Court that the extension of deadline for submission of
the bids was done with an oblique motive to favour the respondent no.4. In the opinion of this
Court, save and except the bald statements of the petitioner, there is no material available on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 30
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
record to even prima-facie demonstrate that the extension of deadline was done with any oblique
motive. In course of argument, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has gone on to submit as to
who knows what transpired between two managing directors of the two public sector undertakings,
in the opinion of this Court, these are mere suspicion raised by the petitioner which cannot take
place of proof. Petitioner is not able to make out a case of prejudice to the petitioner.
Scope of Judicial Review
79. Now, coming to the submissions on the scope of judicial review in the matters relating to award
of tender. A large number of judgments have been cited at the bar. The scope of Patna High Court
CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 judicial review has been discussed and principles laid down
by the Hon'ble Apex Court have settled the propositions of law as to the conditions which would be
required to be satisfied for the purpose of interference with the decision in the matter of award of
tenders by a Court sitting under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in contractual matters.
80. In the case of Tata Cellular Vs. Union of India reported in (1994) 6 SCC 651 in paragraph 94 the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has emphasized need to find a right balance between the administrative
discretion to decide the matters on the one hand and need to remedy any unfairness on the other.
81. In the case of Raunaq International Ltd. Vs. I.V.R. Construction Ltd. And Others reported in
(1999) 1 SCC 492, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering the impugned order of the Hon'ble
High Court of Bombay by which the High Court had stayed the operation of the letter of intent dated
20.07.1998 issued to M/s Raunaq International Ltd. In the said case the Board of Directors of
Maharashtra State Electricity Board considered the offer of M/s Raunaq International Ltd. Which
was not meeting the qualifying requirements but it was reported that the company had done CW
piping for 210 MW units. The qualifying requirements of bidder was that the bidder should have
designed, Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 fabricated/manufactured,
supplied, erected and successfully commissioned large diameter piping system comprising the
supply of MS pipes not less than 2000 mm diameter and laid/buried for a minimum total length of
3 kms in a thermal power station and the same should be in successful operation for the past two
years. When the bid of M/s Raunaq International Ltd. was accepted and tender was awarded to
them, the another bidder M/s I.V.R. Construction Ltd. Challenged the decision of the Court.
82. The Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the challenge made to the interim order staying the
award of tender to M/s Raunaq International Ltd. and found that relaxation of criteria would have
been required in respect of M/s I.V. R. Construction Ltd. also and in view of the fact that the offer of
M/s Raunaq International Ltd. was the lowest, if the Board had accepted the offer of M/s Raunaq
International Ltd. after weighing their requirements against the qualifications of the two competing
bidders, the High Court could not have intervened and stayed the operation of the award of contract
to M/s Raunaq International Ltd. The Hon'ble Supreme Court also noted that no mala fides have
been alleged against any member of the Board of Directors and there was no allegation of any
collateral motive for awarding Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 the contract
to M/s Raunaq International Ltd. Having said so in paragraph 9 and 10 their Lordships held as
under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 31
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
"9. The award of a contract, whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the
State, is essentially a commercial transaction. In arriving at a commercial decision
considerations which are of paramount importance are commercial considerations.
These would be :
(1) The price at which the other side is willing to do the work;
(2) Whether the goods or services offered are of the requisite specifications;
(3) Whether the person tendering has the ability to deliver the goods or services as
per specifications. When large works contracts involving engagement of substantial
manpower or requiring specific skills are to be offered, the financial ability of the
tenderer to fulfil the requirements of the job is also important;
(4) the ability of the tenderer to deliver goods or services or to do the work of the
requisite standard and quality; (5) past experience of the tenderer, and whether he
has successfully completed similar work earlier; (6) time which will be taken to
deliver the goods or services; and often (7) the ability of the tenderer to take follow up
action, rectify defects or to give post contract services.
Even when the State or a public body enters into a commercial transaction, considerations which
would prevail in its decision to award the contract to a given party would be the same. However,
because the State or a public body or an agency of the State enters into such a contract, there could
be, in a given case, an element of public law or public interest involved even in such a commercial
transaction.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
10. What are these elements of public interest ? (1) Public money would be expended for the
purposes of the contract; (2) The goods or services which are being commissioned could be for a
public purpose, such as, construction of roads, public buildings, power plants or other public
utilities. (3) The public would be directly interested in the timely fulfilment of the contract so that
the services become available to the public expeditiously. (4) The public would also be interested in
the quality of the work undertaken or goods supplied by the tenderer. Poor quality of work or goods
can lead to tremendous public hardship and substantial financial outlay either in correcting
mistakes or in rectifying defects or even at times in re- doing the entire work - thus involving larger
outlays or public money and delaying the availability of services, facilities or goods. e.g. A delay in
commissioning a power project, as in the present case, could lead to power shortages, retardation of
industrial development, hardship to the general public and substantial cost escalation."
83. In the case of Air India Ltd. Vs. Cochin International Airport Ltd. And Others reported in (2000)
2 SCC 617 while relying upon the judgment in the case of Tata Cellular (supra) and M/s Raunaq
International Ltd. (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering the challenge to the
judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench of Kerala High Court arising out of a dispute raised by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 32
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Cambatta Aviation Ltd. against the action of Cochin International Airport Ltd. (in short 'CIAL') in
the matter of award of contract for ground-handling services at the new Cochin Airport at
Nedumbassery to AIR India Ltd. The Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
learned single Judge had dismissed the writ application finding no arbitrariness or illegality in the
award of contract but the Hon'ble Division Bench held that the action was violative of the principles
of natural justice, arbitrary and illegal. The allegation was that 'CIAL' had not acted fairly and
impartially as it had carried on negotiations with Air India behind the back of Cambatta and no
opportunity was given to Cambatta to give a better offer. In the said case in paragraph '7' their
Lordships held as under:-
"7. The law relating to award of a contract by the State, its corporations and bodies
acting as instrumentalities and agencies of the Government has been settled by the
decision of this Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority
of India1, Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd.) v. Union of India2, ; CCCE v.
Dunlop India Ltd3, Tata Cellular v. Union of India4, ;. Ramniklal N. Bhutta v. State
of Maharashtra5, and Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R. Construction Ltd.6, . The
award of a contract, whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the State, is
essentially a commercial transaction. In arriving at a commercial decision
considerations which are of paramount are commercial considerations. The State can
choose its own method to arrive at a decision. It can fix its own terms of invitation to
tender and that is not open to judicial scrutiny. It can enter 1 (1979) 3 SCC 489 2
(1981) 1 SCC 568 3(1985) 1 SCC 260:1985 SCC (Tax)75 4 (1994) 6 SCC 651 5 (1997) 1
SCC 134 6 (1999) 1 SCC 492 Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
into negotiations before finally deciding to accept one of the offers made to it. Price
need not always be the sole criterion for awarding a contract. It is free to grant any
relaxation, for bona fide reasons, if the tender conditions permit such a relaxation. It
may not accept the offer even though it happens to be the highest or the lowest. But
the State, its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies are bound to adhere to the
norms, standards and procedures laid down by them and cannot depart from them
arbitrarily. Though that decision is not amenable to judicial review, the Court can
examine the decision making process and interfere if it is found vitiated by mala
fides, unreasonableness and arbitrariness. The State, its corporations,
instrumentalities and agencies have the public duty to be fair to all concerned. Even
when some defect is found in the decision making process the Court must exercise its
discretionary power under Article 226 with great caution and should exercise it only
in furtherance of public interest and not merely on the making out of a legal point.
The Court should always keep the larger public interest in mind in order to decide
whether its intervention is called for or not. Only when it comes to a conclusion that
overwhelming public interest requires interference, the Court should intervene."
84. In the case of Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd. Vs. State of Karntaka and others reported in (2012)
8 SCC 216, the Hon'ble Supreme Court once again considered the nature and scope of judicial
review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the said case the pre-qualification criteria
incorporated in Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 the tender floated by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 33
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation was sought to be challenged by filing a writ
application, the said criteria was withdrawn by the Corporation and thereafter a modified
pre-qualification criteria was issued vide subsequent tender. Being aggrieved by the new
pre-qualification criteria the appellant preferred a writ petition before the Hon'ble High Court which
was dismissed by the learned Single Judge and when the matter went to the Hon'ble Division Bench
of the High Court, the Division Bench also dismissed the same. In the Special Leave to Appeal before
the Hon'ble Supreme Court it was submitted that the pre-qualification criteria as specified in
Conditions 2(a) and 2(b) [amended conditions 4(a) and 4(b)] of the tender in question is
unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory and opposed to public interest in general and these
conditions were incorporated to exclude the appellant Company and other similarly situated
companies from the tender process on wholly extraneous grounds. The appellant Company also
contended that it was successfully selected in previous three contracts and had supplied their
products to the Corporation without any complaint at any point of time.
85. After referring to the aforementioned judgments in the case of Tata Cellular (supra) and M/s
Raunaq International Ltd. (supra), their Lordships referred the judgment of the Hon'ble Patna High
Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Vs.
International Trading Company reported in (2003) 5 SCC 437. Paragraph 13 of the judgment in the
case of Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd. (supra) reads as under:-
13.In Union of India & Anr. vs. International Trading Co. & Anr.6, this Court, in
similar circumstances, held as under: (SCC pp.445 and 447, paras 15-16 and 22-23)
"15. While the discretion to change the policy in exercise of the executive power,
when not trammelled by any statute or rule is wide enough, what is imperative and
implicit in terms of Article 14 is that a change in policy must be made fairly and
should not give the impression that it was so done arbitrarily or by any ulterior
criteria.
The wide sweep of Article 14 and the requirement of every State action qualifying for its validity on
this touchstone irrespective of the field of activity of the State is an accepted tenet. The basic
requirement of Article 14 is fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in essence and
substance is the heartbeat of fair play. Actions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review only
to the extent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason, not whimsically for any ulterior
purpose. The meaning and true import and concept of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than
precisely defined. A question whether the impugned action is arbitrary or not is to be ultimately
answered on the facts and circumstances of a given case. A basic and obvious test to apply in such
cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if
so, does it really satisfy the test of reasonableness.
16. Where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in adopting
the procedure, the deviation to act in a different manner which does not disclose any discernible
principle which is reasonable itself shall be labelled as arbitrary. Every State action must be
informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary.

22. If the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be legitimate to take into
consideration the 6 (2003) 5 SCC 437 Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
national priorities and adopt trade policies. As noted above, the ultimate test is whether on the
touchstone of reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed.
23. Reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the
standpoint of interests of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of persons
upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract consideration. A restriction cannot
be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case, it operates harshly. In determining
whether there is any unfairness involved; the nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the
underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be
remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing condition at the relevant time,
enter into judicial verdict. The reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined
with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question. Canalisation of a
particular business in favour of even a specified individual is reasonable where the interests of the
country are concerned or where the business affects the economy of the country."
86. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner as well as learned senior counsel for the respondents
have relied upon these judgments by reading certain paragraphs in their own manner. While it is the
contention of Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner that if the State or its
instrumentalities acted unfairly and unreasonably, the action of the State are amenable to the
judicial review, learned senior counsel for the Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 respondents submit that it is only when the arbitrariness in the decision making
process is hit by the wednesbury principle of unreasonableness or perversity that the court should
interfere with the decision of the State. The attention of this Court has been drawn towards the
observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Jagdish Mandal Vs. State of Orissa
reported in (2007) 14 SCC 517 (para 22) wherein their Lordships have recorded inter-alia as under:-
"22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended to prevent arbitrariness,
irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and malafides. Its purpose is to check whether
choice or decision is made 'lawfully' and not to check whether choice or decision is
'sound'. When the power of judicial review is invoked in matters relating to tenders or
award of contracts, certain special features should be borne in mind. A contract is a
commercial transaction. Evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are essentially
commercial functions. Principles of equity and natural justice stay at a distance. If the
decision relating to award of contract is bona fide and is in public interest, courts will
not, in exercise of power of judicial review, interfere even if a procedural aberration
or error in assessment or prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial
review will not be permitted to be invoked to protect private interest at the cost of
public interest, or to decide contractual disputes. The tenderer or contractor with a
grievance can always seek damages in a civil court. Attempts by unsuccessful
tenderers with imaginary grievances, wounded pride and business rivalry, to make
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 35
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
mountains out of molehills of some technical/procedural violation or some prejudice
to self, and persuade courts to interfere by exercising power of judicial review, should
be resisted. Such interferences, either interim or final, may hold up public works for
years, or delay relief and succour to Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 thousands and millions and may increase the project cost manifold.
Therefore, a court before interfering in tender or contractual matters in exercise of
power of judicial review, should pose to itself the following questions :
i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is mala fide or
intended to favour someone.
OR Whether the process adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and irrational that the court can
say : 'the decision is such that no responsible authority acting reasonably and in accordance with
relevant law could have reached.'
ii) Whether public interest is affected.
If the answers are in the negative, there should be no interference under Article 226. Cases involving
black- listing or imposition of penal consequences on a tenderer/contractor or distribution of state
largesse (allotment of sites/shops, grant of licences, dealerships and franchises) stand on a different
footing as they may require a higher degree of fairness in action."
87. In the case of Maa Binda Express Carrier & Another Vs. North-East Frontier Railway and Others
reported in (2014) 3 SCC 760 again the scope of judicial review in the matter relating to award of
contract between the State and its instrumentalities came to be considered. In the said case, a notice
inviting tender was issued by the Divisional Commercial Manager, Tinsukia inviting tenders for
grant of three years lease of 23 tonnes of space in VPH (Parcel Van) on Train No.15960/15959
Kamrup Express. The appellant responded to the tender notice and offered a sum of Rs.1,46,872 per
trip for the proposed lease. The tender Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
process was however discharged by the railway administration on account of technical and
administrative reasons. The appellant contested the same contending that he was the highest
bidder. It was contended on behalf of the Railways that the appellant had not acquired vested right
for allotment of the contract in its favour merely because its bid was found to be the highest and that
the the power to cancel/withdraw the tender notice had been specifically reserved by the railway
administration in it's favour.
88. After relying upon the aforementioned judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and referring to
the settled legal propositions from the judgment in the case of Meerut Development Authority Vs.
Association of Management Studies reported in (2009) 6 SCC 171, their Lordships held that "
in the matter of award of contracts the government and its agencies have to act
reasonably and fairly at all points of time. To that extent the tenderer has an
enforceable right in the court which is competent to examine whether the aggrieved
party has been treated unfairly or discriminated against to the detriment of public
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 36
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
interest...." (underline is mine). It was thereafter held that decision to cancel the
tender process was in no way discriminatory or mala fide. On the contrary, if a
contract had been awarded despite the deficiencies in the tender process serious
questions touching the Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
legality and propriety affecting the validity of the tender process would have arisen.
By cancelling the tender process the competent authority had not violated any
fundamental right of the appellant.
89. In the case of Central Coalfields Limited and Another Vs. SLL-SML (Joint Venture Consortium)
and Others reported in (2016) 8 SCC 622 the appellant was aggrieved by the judgment and order of
the Hon'ble Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court whereby the rejection of the bid of the first
respondent SLL-SML by Central Coalfields was set aside. A dispute in the said case arose when first
respondent was found non-responsive because they had submitted a bank guarantee not in the
prescribed proforma but in another format in respect of some other contract provided in the general
terms and conditions. The CCL being the employer did not agree to deviate from the terms of the
tender document in which under clause 3 the heading "Deposit of EMD" it was clearly provided that
the earnest money can be deposited in the form of demand draft or can also be deposited in the form
of irrevocable bank guarantee (BG) from any scheduled bank in the format given in the bid
document. Since the format given in the bid document was different from the one in which the bank
guarantee was submitted by the first respondent, the CCL refused to deviate from the tender
conditions. The first Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 respondent
submitted that CLL should deviate from its conditions, but Hon'ble Supreme Court relied on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of G.J. Fernandez. Vs. State of Karnataka
reported in (1990) 2 SCC 488 in which their Lordships reaffirmed the principles laid down in
Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra). Paragraph '38' of the judgment in Central Coalfields Ltd. reads as
under:-
"38. In G.J. Fernandez v. State of Karnataka 6 both the principles laid down in
Ramana Dayaram Shetty 5 were reaffirmed. It was reaffirmed that the party issuing
the tender (the employer) "has the right to punctiliously and rigidly" enforce the
terms of the tender. If a party approaches a court for an order restraining the
employer from strict enforcement of the terms of the tender, the court would decline
to do so. It was also reaffirmed that the employer could deviate from the terms and
conditions of the tender if the "changes affected all intending applicants alike and
were not objectionable". Therefore, deviation from the terms and conditions is
permissible so long as the level playing field is maintained and it does not result in
any arbitrariness or discrimination in Ramana Dayaram Shetty5 sense."
90. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Central Coalfields Ltd. (supra) then referred the judgment in the
case of Poddar Steel Corpration V. Ganesh Engineering Works reported in (1991) 3 SCC 273 arising
out of the judgment of the Hon'ble Allahabad High Court wherein the concept of "Essential Term"
5 (1979) 3 SCC 489 6 (1900) 2 SCC 488 Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 was introduced and the Hon'ble High Court held that clause in NIT

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
relating to deposit of earnest money was an essential term thereof and could not be
deviated from, but in appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, though the Hon'ble
Supreme Court accepted the theory of essential and non-essential or ancillary or
subsidiary terms of an NIT but held that cheque of Union Bank of India issued by
Poddar Steel (though a deviation from the terms of the NIT) was sufficient for
meeting the conditions of NIT. It was also held that the employer could waive the
"technical literal compliance" of the earnest money clause of NIT "specially when it
was in its interest not to reject the said bid which was the highest."
In paragraph 42 of the judgment in Central Coalfields Ltd. however, the Hon'ble Apex Court
observed as under:-
"Unfortunately, this Court in Poddar Steel 3 did not at all advert to the
privilege-of-participation principle laid down in Ramana Dayaram Shetty5 and
accepted in G.J. Fernandez6. In other words, this Court did not consider whether, as
a result of the deviation, others could also have become eligible to participate in the
bidding process. This principle was ignored in Poddar Steel.3"
91. The Hon'ble Apex Court thereafter referred the accepted principle of the inherent authority of an
employer to 6 (1900) 2 SCC 488 3 (1991) 3 SCC 273 Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt.
30-04-2019 deviate from the terms and conditions of an NIT and reintroducing the
privilege-of-participation principle and the level playing field concept in the decision making
process in respect of a commercial contract, it was held that "....If an administrative decision, such
as a deviation in the terms of the NIT is not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, mala fide or biased,
the courts will not judicially review the decision taken..." (underline is mine).
92. In paragraph '48' of the judgment in Central Coalfields Ltd. (supra), their Lordships held as
under:-
"48. Therefore, whether a term of NIT is essential or not is a decision taken by the
employer which should be respected. Even if the term is essential, the employer has
the inherent authority to deviate from it provided the deviation is made applicable to
all bidders and potential bidders as held in Ramana Dayaram Shetty5. However, if
the term is held by the employer to be ancillary or subsidiary, even that decision
should be respected. The lawfulness of that decision can be questioned on very
limited grounds, as mentioned in the various decisions discussed above, but the
soundness of the decision cannot be questioned, otherwise this Court would be taking
over the function of the tender issuing authority, which it cannot."
93. In the case of State of Jharkhand and others Vs. CWE-Soma Consortium reported in (2016) 14
SCC 172 when the tender committee found that out of three bidders who had participated in the
tender process only the respondent was Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
responsive and the other two bidders were unresponsive, the Tender Committee took a decision to
cancel the tender and go for retender to make the tender process more competitive. The decision of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 38
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
the tender committee was challenged. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition holding
the action of the appellants as arbitrary and against public interest. The Division Bench concurred
with the conclusion of the learned Single Judge. In appeal before the Supreme Court it was
contended placing reliance upon Rajasthan Housing Board Vs. G.S. Investments (2007) 1 SCC 477
and U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Om Prakash Sharma (2013) 5 SCC 182 that so long as the bid
has not been accepted, the highest bidder acquired no vested right to have the auction confirmed in
his favour (emphasis supplied). Having noticed the facts of the case in paragraph '13' of the
judgment their Lordships held as under:-
"13. In case of a tender, there is no obligation on the part of the person issuing tender
notice to accept any of the tenders or even the lowest tender. After a tender is called
for and on seeing the rates or the status of the contractors who have given tenders
that there is no competition, the person issuing tender may decide not to enter into
any contract and thereby cancel the tender. It is well-settled that so long as the bid
has not been accepted, the highest bidder acquires no vested right to have the auction
concluded in his favour (vide Laxmikant and Ors. v. Satyawan 5; Rajasthan Housing
Board v. G.S. Investments 3 and U.P. Avas Evam Vikash Parishad and Ors. v. Om
Prakash Sharma 4."
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
94. In the case of Reliance Energy Ltd. (supra) their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
discussed the 'legal certainty' principle which is an important aspect of the rule of law and held in
paragraph '36' as under:-
"36. We find merit in this civil appeal. Standards applied by courts in judicial review
must be justified by constitutional principles which govern the proper exercise of
public power in a democracy. Article 14 of the Constitution embodies the principle of
"non-discrimination". However, it is not a free- standing provision. It has to be read
in conjunction with rights conferred by other articles like Article 21 of the
Constitution. The said Article 21 refers to "right to life". In includes "opportunity". In
our view, as held in the latest judgment of the Constitution Bench of nine-Judges in
the case of I.R. Coelho vs. State of Tamil Nadu3, Article 21/14 is the heart of the
chapter on fundamental rights. It covers various aspects of life. "Level playing field"
is an important concept while construing Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. It is this
doctrine which is invoked by REL/HDEC in the present case. When Article 19(1)(g)
confers fundamental right to carry on business to a company, it is entitled to invoke
the said doctrine of "level playing field". We may clarify that this doctrine is, however,
subject to public interest. In the world of globalization, competition is an 5 (1996) 4
SCC 208 3 (2007) 1 SCC 477 4 (2013) 5 SCC 182: (2013) 2 SCC (Civ)737 Patna High
Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 important factor to be kept in mind.
The doctrine of "level playing field" is an important doctrine which is embodied in
Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. This is because the said doctrine provides space
within which equally-placed competitors are allowed to bid so as to subserve the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173032908/ 39
Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
larger public interest. "Globalization", in essence, is liberalization of trade. Today
India has dismantled licence-raj. The economic reforms introduced after 1992 have
brought in the concept of "globalization". Decisions or acts which results in unequal
and discriminatory treatment, would violate the doctrine of "level playing field"
embodied in Article 19(1)(g). Time has come, therefore, to say that Article 14 which
refers to the principle of "equality" should not be read as a stand alone item but it
should be read in conjunction with Article 21 which embodies several aspects of life.
There is one more aspect which needs to be mentioned in the matter of
implementation of the aforestated doctrine of "level playing field". According to Lord
Goldsmith - commitment to "rule of law" is the heart of parliamentary democracy.
One of the important elements of the "rule of law" is legal certainty. Article 14 applies
to government policies and if the policy or act of the government, even in contractual
matters, fails to satisfy the test of "reasonableness", then such an act or decision
would be unconstitutional."
95. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner while placing reliance upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Maharashtra Housing Development Authority (supra)
emphatically contended before this Court that in the said case the Hon'ble Supreme Court found
from the report of the NIC Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 that there was
no technical glitch, the Hon'ble Apex Court refused to grant a second opportunity to the bidder (the
first respondent) and judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court was set aside.
96. Contesting the said submissions of learned senior counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Parag P.
Tripathi, learned senior counsel for the respondent no.4 has strongly contended that a bare perusal
of the facts of the present case would show that it has a totally different situation inasmuch as it is
evident from the report of the R-5 that the R-4 was in touch with R-5 from a prior time before the
deadline of submission of the bid. It is not a case like Shapoorji Pallonji (the first respondent in the
said case) where the bidder was found to be negligent and had failed to press "freeze button." It is a
case where the R-4 had gone in the hand of the R-5 by giving remote access of its system to R-5 even
before deadline of submission of bid, but because of the technical glitch the process could not be
completed even though the entire tender documents had already been uploaded. He has also
submitted that there was a technical glitch is evident from the report of the R-5 though it says that
the technical glitch was in the system of R-4 but it would be a disputed question of facts to say as to
where the technical glitches existed at the relevant time and this Court sitting under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India need not go into Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019
those disputed question of facts which would require taking of evidence.
97. The reliance placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in G.K. Transport
Company Vs. Western Coalfield Ltd. (2014) SCC Online Bom.1030 on behalf of the petitioner has
also been contested by pointing out that in the said case there was no clause in the tender document
for extending the deadline after expiry of the deadline for submission of the bids, whereas in the
present case there was an express clause in the ITB read with BDS wherein the deadline for
submission of the bids could have been extended by a subsequent communication.

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
98. To this Court it appears that the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shapoorji Pallonji
(supra) and that of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in G.K. Transport (supra) are well
distinguishable and the Court accepts the submissions of learned senior counsel for the respondents
that in both the cases not only the facts were different but were also a contest between the employer
on the one hand and the bidder who had failed to submit the bid on time on the other hand. In this
case the employer is contesting with the petitioner who is challenging the entry of R- 4 after
extension of time.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 Epilogue
99. In the earlier part of it's judgment this Court has come to a conclusion that the employer had a
discretion available to extend the deadline for submission of the bids by a subsequent
communication. Now going through the aforesaid judicial pronouncements on the scope of judicial
review and by putting two questions which have been pointed out in the case of Jagdish Mandal
(supra) to itself when this Court tests the contentions on behalf of the petitioner, it would come to a
conclusion that the decision to extend the deadline for submission of the bid after expiry of 13.00
hrs on 05.03.2019 would not attract the principle of wednesbury unreasonableness and perversity.
In no way it affects the sanctity of tender. This Court also finds that no discrimination has been
made and the decision of the employer does not violate the doctrine of "level playing field". It is
found that the employer had notified the extension of time and date in accordance with the mode of
communication to all the bidders as per tender document. It is not the case of the petitioner that the
decision to extend the deadline was notified only to the respondent no.4. The level playing field was
thus maintained. The petitioner has also visited his tenders during the extended period and even
though no changes were incorporated in the tenders by the Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of
2019 dt. 30-04-2019 petitioner during the extended period, the petitioner had repeatedly assured
itself with the correctness of its tender by visiting on the portal at least on 11 occasions. This has
given the level playing field to all the bidders or prospective bidders.
100. So far as the issues raised with regard to the technical glitches are concerned, this Court is also
satisfied on perusal of Annexure- '5' and '6' to the writ application that they refer to technical issues
being faced by the bidders in submission/uploading of bid on SJVN e-tender portal. Annexure-5 and
6 cannot be interpreted to read as if they say that the technical issues were with the SJVN's e-tender
portal. Since this Court has taken a view that the employer had power to extend the deadline for
submission of the bid after expiry of the period in the facts of the present case, this Court need not
go into making an inquiry as to where exactly the technical glitches were existing before 13.00 Hrs
(IST) on 05.03.2019.
101. The another issue which this Court considers is as to whether or not the decision to extend the
deadline for submission of the bid is in public interest. The Court is of the considered opinion that
public interest would be served only if larger participation is allowed in the matter of public tenders
floated by the government and its instrumentalities. The Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019
dt. 30-04-2019 competitiveness of the bidders would be in public interest and any attempt to scuttle
and throttle the competition at the outset would go against the public interest.

Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs Sjvn Thermal (P) Ltd. And Ors on 30 April, 2019
102. This Court would also strengthen it's view to approve the decision making of the respondent
no.1 Company by relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Caretel
Infotech Ltd. (supra). In paragraph 40 of the said judgment their Lordships after referring to Afcons
Infrastructure Limited Vs. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited (2016) 16 SCC 818 reiterated
that the author of the document is the best person to understand and appreciate its requirements. I
would agree with the submission of learned senior counsel for the respondents that at this stage
petitioner is a mere tenderer, has acquired no vested right except that his bid is to be considered and
the attempt made by the petitioner to challenge the decision of respondent no.1-Company to extend
the deadline for submission of the bid is nothing but an attempt to throttle the competition and the
action of the petitioner in litigating the matter at this stage is nothing but is clearly contrary to the
observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph '38' in the case of Caretel Infotech Ltd.
(supra) which reads as under:-
"38. We consider it appropriate to make certain observations in the context of the
nature of dispute which is before us. Normally parties would be governed by their
Patna High Court CWJC No.4681 of 2019 dt. 30-04-2019 contracts and the tender
terms, and really no writ would be maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India. In view of Government and Public Sector Enterprises venturing into
economic activities, this Court found it appropriate to build in certain checks and
balances of fairness in procedure. It is this approach which has given rise to scrutiny
of tenders in writ proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It,
however, appears that the window has been opened too wide as almost every small or
big tender is now sought to be challenged in writ proceedings almost as a matter of
routine. This in turn, affects the efficacy of commercial activities of the public sectors,
which may be in competition with the private sector. This could hardly have been the
objective in mind. An unnecessary, close scrutiny of minute details, contrary to the
view of the tendering authority, makes awarding of contracts by Government and
Public Sectors a cumbersome exercise, with long drawn out litigation at the
threshold. The private sector is competing often in the same field. Promptness and
efficiency levels in private contracts, thus, often tend to make the tenders of the
public sector a non-competitive exercise. This works to a great disadvantage to the
Government and the Public Sector."
103. For the aforementioned reasons, this Court finds no merit in the writ application. It is
dismissed accordingly. There would however be no orders as to costs.
