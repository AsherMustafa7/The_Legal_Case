Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
[2] The instant writ petition has been instituted on behalf of Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi under Article
226/227 of the Constitution of India with the following prayer :
"Issuance of a writ of certiorari or a writ in nature of certiorari or an appropriate
writ/direction(s)/order(s) to set aside and quash -
(a) the final order dated 27.04.2023 in Original Application No. 042/00207/2021
passed by the Hon'ble Central Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench;
(b) the Office Order bearing F. No. 07- 23/2021/NVS/ESTT-II (ATD - 20 - 21)/7083
dated 10.05.2023 issued by the Deputy Commissioner (Pers.), Navodaya Vidyalaya
Samiti, Ministry of Education, Government of India."
[3] The factual prism, as put forth by the petitioner are that the petitioner herein was the respondent
no.4 in O.A. No. 042/00207/2021 and the present respondent no.4 is the petitioner in the said O.A.
The Hon'ble CAT, Guwahati Bench, vide impugned final order dated 27.04.2023 in O.A. No.
042/00207/2021 disposed the said O.A. by allowing the said O.A. in an illegal and perverse manner
in favour of private respondent No. 4, with a direction to the respondent No. 2 and 3 to consider the
case of the private respondent No. 4 for transfer to JNV Bishnupur (Manipur) under the eligible
condition of Transfer Conditions of 2021 as well as on the security principles of Transfer Conditions
of 2012 , without considering at all the pleadings and submissions of the present petitioner as well
as the official respondents as pleaded in their written statements and arguments addressed on the
said grounds. Consequently, the impugned office order dated 10.05.2023 has been issued by official
respondent stated to be in compliance of the said W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 2 illegal and
perverse impugned order dated 27.04.2023. Accordingly, the present writ petition is filed on the
grounds submitted below with a prayer for passing interim stay of the said two impugned orders in
the interest of justice.
[4] The grounds taken herein by the petitioner are:
(a) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking in the
malafide conduct of the respondent No. 4 in suppressing facts and concealing
material facts and documents since the filing of an earlier Original Application
bearing O.A. No. 042/00163/2021 before CAT, Guwahati on 15.07.2021 to challenge
only the proposed transfer list dated 22.06.2021 (Round 2) of ATD 2020-2021 by
deliberately concealing the already published final transfer list dated 01.07.2021
when the said O.A. No. 163 of 2021 was filed on 15.07.2021 solely to mispresent
before the Hon'ble Tribunal to obtain an order of stay of the transfer process relating
to the present petitioner and which would have been rejected at the threshold, in the
event the final transfer list was disclosed with honesty, as mandated in law.
(b) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking the
pleadings of the petitioner that without serving copy of the said O.A. No. 163 of 2021
to the present petitioner or without issuing Court notice or giving opportunity of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 2
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
being heard, a so called innocuous order dated 16.07.2021 was passed by Hon'ble
CAT, Guwahati without going in to the merits of the said case to dispose the pending
representation dated 06.07.2021 submitted by respondent No. 4. In the said order
dated 16.07.2021, the Commissioner, NVS was directed to take a decision within 4
(four) months in respect of the said representation dated 06.07.2021 by passing a
speaking order and till such time, the case of the petitioner and respondent No. 4 was
directed not to be given effect to by making an W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 3 illegal
and perverse observation till such so far the case of the respondent No. 4 shall not be
given effect to.
(c) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking the
pleadings on record in the present subject O.A. No. 042/00207/2021 that the present
petitioner had challenged the said illegal and perverse Hon'ble CAT, Guwahati Bench
final order dated 16.07.2021 by filing W.P.(C) No. 496 of 2021 before this High Court,
wherein an interim order dated 12.08.2021 was passed by this High Court in W.P.(C)
No. 496 of 2021 inter alia as under :
"There shall accordingly be interim suspension of the order dated 16.07.2021 passed
in Original Application No. 042/00163/2021 till the next date of hearing. Post on
28.09.2021."
Further, it is the case of the petitioner that consequently, the Hon'ble CAT, Guwahati
Bench order dated 16.07.2021 was rendered ineffective and non-operational since
12.08.2021 and the said suspension of the Hon'ble Tribunal order continued till
14.12.2021, when a final Court order dated 14.12.2021 was passed by this High Court
with the observation that the Commissioner, NVS having now passed a speaking
order dated 16.08.2021 disposing of the representation dated 06.07.2021 submitted
by the respondent No. 4 in favour of the present petitioner, the said petition was
closed in favour of the present petitioner.
The Ld. Tribunal has totally overlooked this legal plea and also the submission of the
petitioner that the Commissioner, NVS was also legally bound to ensure that the
petitioner was allowed to join her new posting at JNV, Bishnupur consequent upon
her selection as on 12.08.2021, when this High Court had vacated the stay order of
the CAT, Guwahati. However for unknown reason, the same was not done till
14.12.2021, in an illegal and perverse manner.
W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 4
(d) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally
overlooking the admitted fact on record of the present O.A. No. 042/00207/2021
that this application also only filed seeking "to set aside and quash the proposed
transfer list" and not the subsequent final transfer list.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 3
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
The said application also prayed for setting aside and quashing the impugned
rejection order No. F.No. 7-23/2021- NVS(Estt-II)/8455, dated 16.08.2021 without
pleading how the said order is bad in law being issued based on subsequent transfer
guidelines, 2021.
With further prayer for directing the official respondents to consider the respondent
No. 4 case strictly basing on the guidelines issued by NVS in Clause No. 9(1)(C) of
Transfer Policy, 2012 is also bad in law as the said Transfer Policy, 2012 has already
been subsequently superseded, modified and eclipsed by the Transfer Policy, 2021
and in respect of how Transfer Policy, 2021 has been violated has not been pleaded at
all in the preset O.A. by respondent No. 4.
(e) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally erroneously allowing the
prayer made in the said O.A. No. 042/00207/2021 without considering any of the
pleadings and submissions made by official respondent NVS nor by the present
petitioner, while passing the illegal and perverse order dated 27.04.2023.
(f) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in failing to correctly appreciate
the respondent No. 4 has chosen to solely rely upon Clause No. 9(1)(C) of the
Transfer Policy, 2012 while the impugned order at Para No. 6 mentions "As per
Transfer Policy, 2021, the applicant, Smt. Khoibam Jerina has already done three
years in her current posting and thus falls in the category of eligible.
W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 5 It is further asserted that the respondent No. 4 in the
O.A. has not at all referred/not disclosed about the existence of Transfer Policy, 2021
to claim the relief in the said O.A. No. 207 of 2021. Apparently, respondent No. 4 has
only relied upon Transfer Policy, 2012 and which Transfer Policy, 2012 has in fact
been already modified and superseded. The Hon'ble Tribunal has erroneously relied
upon both the Hon'ble Tribunal is totally contrary to settled law of land and is illegal
and perverse, per se and not sustainable in law.
(g) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking and not
even making an attempt to appreciate that in the introduction of Transfer Policy,
2021, it itself mentions that the transfer system in NVS is governed by a well defined
"Transfer Policy" and subsequent guidelines/clarifications which were issued from
time to time with a view to facilitate the employees avail transfer with utmost
transparency and accuracy.
Apparently, the respondent No. 4 had simply chosen to ignore all the subsequent
guidelines/clarifications which were issued from time to time by NVS, while malafidely seeking to
rely solely upon an already modified Transfer Policy, 2021. On the contrary, the respondent No. 4
was required to explain how the subsequent Transfer Policy and Guidelines of NVS, modifying the
earlier Transfer Policies were not applicable to respondent No. 4 and more particularly, the reason
furnished by Commissioner, NVS while passing the speaking order dated 16.08.2021, relying upon
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 4
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
the subsequently modified Transfer Policy, 2021. The Hon'ble Tribunal has illegally chosen to totally
ignore this legal submission despite being vehemently raised by the petitioner and official
respondents, while considering the said O.A. W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 6
(h) Further, it is asserted that the Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally failing to
consider and correctly appreciate that the Transfer Policy, 2021 which the Hon'ble Tribunal relies in
the impugned order has not been challenged before any High Court or any competent authority of
law.
It is submitted that the applicability of the said Transfer Policy, 2021 and more particularly, the
concept and Policy named NVS inter alia "Purpose of avoiding inter-region H/VH/SH cumulation"
as mentioned in 4(1)(ii) if one H/VH/SH person is not eligible at his present station, his eligibility
shall be counted on the basis of one immediate previous station (if it is an H/VH/SH station of the
present region), ought to have been selectively overlooked by the Hon'ble Tribubnal as done by the
Hon'ble Tribunal to pass the impugned illegal and perverse order.
(i) It is also further asserted that the Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in failing to
correctly appreciate that it is totally impermissible in law for the Hon'ble Tribunal to rely upon Para
No. 4(1)(i) of the Transfer Policy, 2021 in favour of the respondent No. 4, while seeking to totally
ignore the same Para No. 4 (1) but Para No. 4(1)(ii), which is totally in favour of the petitioner, a
transfer policy framed by NVS specifically to avoid inter region H/VH/SH cumulation.
This plea before the Hon'ble Tribunal by the petitioner is not at all disputable, as the existence and
the provision of the said Transfer Policy, 2021 has not been mentioned by the respondent No. 4 in a
malafide manner in the said O.A. No. 207 of 2021 nor pleaded nor said provision challenged in the
said O.A.
(j) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking the counter affidavit filed
by the official respondents No. 2 & 3 (NVS) in opposition to O.A. No. 207 of W.P.(C) No. 489 of
2023 Page 7 2021 that the concept and policy of counting eligibility in H/VH/SH station on the
basis of one immediate previous station has been framed and adopted by NVS to ensure that a
person does not continue remain posted from one H/VH/SH station of a region to another
H/VH/SH of another region within a short period.
(k) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking and failing to give any
finding that the automated system which had counted the previous stay of petitioner at JNV,
Thoubal (Manipur/Hard and Difficult Station) where petitioner had stayed from 16.07.2007 to
03.09.2018 before her present stay at JNV, Ukhrul w.e.f. 04.09.2018 to cut off date 31.07.2021 had
legally followed the applicable transfer policy as mentioned in Para No. 4(1)(ii).
The impugned order of the Hon'ble Tribunal has not given any finding regarding the legality or
illegality of said automated system as the said Para No. 4(1)(ii) nor automated system has been
mentioned in the pleading of the O.A. nor challenged before the Hon'ble Tribunal. Hence, the
Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in facts and in law in totally ignoring this aspect while illegally
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 5
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
determining eligibility solely based upon Transfer Policy, 2021 by ignoring all the other relevant
transfer policies and guidelines of NVS and more particularly said Para No. 4 (1)(ii) of the same
Transfer Policy, 2021.
(l) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking and ignoring the issue of
H/VH/SH station and eligibility / provision for transfer of employees into and out of hard & difficult
(hard/very hard/semi hard) stations as mentioned in the Transfer Policy, 2021. It is totally
erroneous for Hon'ble Tribunal to embark upon determining eligibility for transfer of employee of
NVS by ignoring all the relevant W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 8 provision of the said Transfer
Policy, 2021 duly framed by the competent authority, i.e. NVS for its employees.
(m) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in failing to correctly consider ad appreciate
that once Transfer Policy, 2012 has already been modified and superseded by subsequent transfer
policies, the issue of seniority or date of joining service does not arise, as transfer is not promotion
where seniority issue is involved. Transfer is governed in the present case by relevant transfer
policies and hence, the Hon'ble Tribunal by relying upon seniority and ignoring the relevant Para
No. 4(1)(ii) of the said Transfer Policy, 2021 has committed gross error and perversity of law in
passing the impugned order, under challenge.
(n) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in illegality setting aside the speaking order
dated 16.08.2021 by competent authority of law, without assigning a singular reason about how the
said automated system can be said to be arbitrary, illegal or erroneous as the automated system
simply followed the relevant provision of Para No. 4(1)(ii) of the Transfer Policy, 2021 and hence
CAT order also suffers from perversity in law, on this score also.
(o) The Hon'ble Tribunal has erred in law and facts in totally overlooking the admitted that on the
basis of the said automated system relying upon the applicability of Para No. 4(1)(ii) of Transfer
Policy, 2021 may persons have already availed the benefit. Hence, it would result in treating equal as
unequal and discriminating against the petitioner, in the event a similarly situated employee and
discriminating against the petitioner is not made to avail the same benefit, based on result of said
automated system in all fairness and equity, as the petitioner was already entitled to join JNV,
Bishnupur the W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 9 day, when the petitioner obtained this High Court's
stay order dated 12.08.2021 passed in W.P.(C) No. 496 of 2021.
(p) The subsequent order bearing F.No. 07-
23/2021/NVS/ESTT-II(ATD 20-21)/7083, dated 10.05.2023
issued by the Deputy Commissioner (Pers.), Navodalaya Vidyalaya Samiti, Ministry of Education,
Government of India is also illegal and liable to be set aside being issued in consequence of an illegal
and perverse order dated 27.04.2023 passed in Original Application No. 042/00207/2021 by the
Hon'ble Central Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench.
[5] The case of the respondents are as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 6
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
The Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti is an autonomous organization of Ministry of Education
Department of School Education and Literacy, Government of India, having its present
headquarters at Noida (UP) and registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. Navodaya
Vidyalaya Samiti runs, manages and controls the functioning of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (in
short JNVs) all over India, through its eight Regional Offices.
JNVs are fully residential co-educational schools set with the objective of providing modern quality
education to talented children, predominantly from rural areas. Students, teachers and staff live in
the same campus. Most of the JNVs are set up in rural areas, far away from district headquarters.
Teachers and staff are expected to exhibit exemplary moral character before the students. Strict
disciplinary measures are being followed to ensure high moral standard among teachers and staff.
Before the lower Court, the applicant has impleaded Union of India, represented by Secretary,
Government of India, Ministry of HRD (now Ministry of Education), Department of Education, New
Delhi as party respondent No. 1 who is the proforma party. None of the orders/action of the OP No.
1 has been challenged herein and the specific prayer made by the applicant is related to the affairs of
the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti at its Headquarters, Sector - 62 Noida. Hence, the OP No. 1 has no
role to play in W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 10 the instant matter and no specific reply in the
subject matter of dispute is needed from the OP No. 1 in the facts and circumstances of the case. It
would be pertinent to mention here that NVS at initial stage of OA has taken the objection, however,
Hon'ble Tribunal did not take up the request of NVS for deletion the name of UOI/R-1. Hence,
before the Hon'ble High Court at initial stage the applicant is requesting the same. This Court may
be pleased to accede the same in the interest of justice and fair play as the R-1 has no role in the
matter and no order passed by R-1 is challenged by the applicant.
Annual Transfer Drive 2021 was effected in accordance with the provisions of transfer policy 2012 as
well as transfer guidelines issued vide Samiti's letter dated 22.12.2015. It was well informed to all
concerned in the said letter dated 22.12.2015 that the request transfer will be effected in certain
order or priorities by adhering to the provisions of transfer policy and instructions of Government of
India. The deponent at this stage humbly begs to extract the relevant clauses of the transfer
guidelines issued vide letter dated 22.12.2015:
".............. In order to maximize the request transfer in the year 2016 onwards the
transfer will be effected in the following order of priorities:
(a) Transfer of differently abled employees to their choice place.
(b) Transfer of employees who are suffering from serious ailments/disease including
their spouse and children as mentioned in Transfer Policy.
(c) Transfer of employees completing mandatory tenure at very hard, hard and NER
region.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 7
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
(d) Transfer of husband/wife to one station from unification with spouse or nearby
station."
It was, further, made clear that in the said letter dated 22.12.2015 that the transfer of (i) employees
suffering from serious ailment/disease including their spouse and children as mentioned in Transfer
Policy (iii) transfer of husband/wife to one station for unification with spouse or nearby station will
not be covered under transfer counts keeping in view the Government of India orders in their
favour.
It is imperative to mention herein that transfer of employees of JNVs is made through Automated
Transfer Portal. Further, the deponent W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 11 humbly begs to state that
such Automated Transfer Portal operates in accordance with the provisions of the Transfer Policy
dated 04.04.2012 as well as the guidelines issued from time to time. In the interest of mass of the
employees, who had served more than mandatory period at Hard/Very Hard station in a row in
current spell, however could not get the transfer either out from hard station or desired station
within hard stations as per provisions of Transfer Policy, it was approved by the competent
authority to lay down interpretation vis-à-vis clause of policy determining the tenure of employee
for acquiring eligibility for seeking transfer in the ATD 2020-21.
1. Hard Station employee (Cumulative Eligibility/Station Seniority):
As the employee working on the hard station has got provision for taking advantage
of cumulated period of hard stations served in a row in current spell the provision of
deciding eligibility of the Hard stationed employee shall be applicable exactly similar
to the principle adopted in "Admin Cumulative Provision". Accordingly, the tenure of
Ms. Aribam Sobita Devi was counted her stay at present station and preceding station
at JNV, Thoubal (Manipur) [Hard & Difficult Station] adhering to the provision II
mentioned hereunder:
I. If a H/VH/SH person is eligible at its present Hard/Very Hard/Semi Hard Station,
his eligibility shall be counted on the basis of present station itself. In such case no
cumulation of previous station will be required for deciding eligibility/station
seniority. II. If a H/VH/SH person is not eligible at his present station, his eligibility
shall be counted on the basis of one immediate previous station (if it is an H/VH/SH
station of the present region).
III. If a H/VH/SH person is neither eligible at his present station nor at his
immediate previous H/VH/SH station of counted by cumulating the period of
W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 12 present and previous station (if it is a H/VH/SH
station of the same region) with lower priority. In such case only one previous station
shall be considered for calculation of the cumulative period. IV. This provision shall
stand applicable for transfer of employees from hard station to outside as well as
transfer within hard stations.

Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
V. The cutoff date set for the purpose of counting of stay at hard station was
31.07.2021. Smt. Khoibam Jerina was posted at JNV, Chandel, Manipur on
31.07.2021 she had duly completed the period of 3 years. As such, the automated
portal worked out the total number of days of stay of Smt. Khoibam Jerina at JNV,
Chandel counting her stay from 13.07.2017 to 31.07.2021 at JNV, Chandel which
came to 1480 days. On the other hand, the petitioner was posted at JNV, Ukhrul,
Manipur on 04.09.2018 and hence, as on cut off date 31.07.2021, she had not
completed the mandatory period of 3 years at JNV, Ukhrul. Accordingly, her tenure
was counted as per the clause (ii) of guidelines which stipulates that if an H/VH/SH
person is not eligible at his present station, his eligibility shall be counted on the basis
of one immediate previous station (if it is an H/VH/SH station of the present region
at par with the provision mentioned in the Admin Cumulative Transfer Provision
vide which Commission, NVS had taken the interpretation to safeguard the interest
of employees to extend the benefit of cumulative tenure at preceding station in
exercise the power conferred under Clause of 10 of Transfer Policy, 2021 and the
W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 13 automated system count her cumulative stay
counting her stay at the present station i.e. JNV, Ukhrul and previous station at JNV,
Thoubal, Manipur (Hard & Difficult Station) where the petitioner stayed from
16.07.2007 to 03.09.2008 and therefore, the automated portal worked out total
number of days of stay of the petitioner in hard and difficult station which came out
to 4068 days as per the laid down provision of Admin Cumulative Provision as well
as guidelines on the subject issue.
The respondents at this stage state that Smt. Khoibam Jerina filed the O.A. No. 042/00207/2021
challenging the proposed transfer list (round 2) ATD 2020-21 on the ground that the respondent
No. 4 (Ms. Sobita Devi) is junior to the applicant, Smt. Khoibam Jerina Devi. Further, prayer was
made seeking for a direction to the respondent authorities to consider the case of the applicant (Ms.
Kh. Jerina Devi) to transfer to JNV, Bishnupur as per Clause 9(1)(c) of the Transfer Guidelines, 2012
before considering the case of the respondent No. 4 claiming that she is senior in the station
seniority than Ms. Aribam Sobita Devi. In fact the transfer of Ms. Aribam Sobita Devi was
considered by NVS under Admin Cumulative Provisions & Guidelines through the process of
automation during the transfer drive of 2020 - 21 strictly as per the provision of Transfer Policy. In
the submission of the answering respondents, the prayer made by Ms. Kh. Jerina claiming the
transfer to JNV, Bishnupur being the station senior by filing the O.A. No. 042/00207/2021 was
nothing but false and misleading in view of the fact that the representation submitted by the
applicant Ms. Kh. Jerina was considered in the light of the transfer guidelines and regulations
regarding count of cumulative eligibility/station seniority of employee served at Hard/Very Hard
Station and disposed of vide speaking & reasoned order dated 16.08.2021 pursuant to the order of
Hon'ble CAT dated 16.07.2021 passed in earlier O.A. No. 163/2021 filed by Ms. Kh. Jerina before the
Hon'ble CAT Guwahati Bench, Guwahati. As such, while disposing of the W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023
Page 14 representation submitted by the applicant, the answering respondents found that the
applicant is not eligible to be transferred to JNV, Bishnupur rejecting the claim of the applicant
being devoid of any merit in the light of the provisions of the transfer policy.

Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
In the light of the records of the case as well as in terms of the order dated 16.07.2021 passed by the
Hon'ble Tribunal in O.A. no. 163/2021, the respondent further states that considering all the
relevant factors, the computer system found the petitioner senior than Smt. Kh. Jerina respondent
No. 4 after counting the stay of petitioner in the immediate previous station and consequently,
allotted JNV, Bishnupur to her.
As to the statements made in the writ petition, the respondent has no comments to offer. However
the deponent does not admit anything which is contrary to and inconsistent with the records of the
instant case.
With regard to the statements made, the respondent states that the office order bearing No. F.No.
07-23/2021/NVS/Estt-II(ATD-20-
21)/7083 dated 10.05.2023 transferring Smt. Kh. Jerina, TGT (Hindi), Jawahar Navodaya
Vidyalaya, Chandel (Manipur) to JNV, Bishnupur (Manipur) was issued in compliance with the
order dated 27.04.2023 passed by the Hon'ble CAT Guwahati Bench, Guwahati in O.A. No.
207/2021 titled Smt. Kh. Jerina Vs. UOI &Ors. The operative part of the order dated 27.04.2023
passed by the Hon'ble CAT, Guwahati Bench is reproduced as under:
"6. We are of the considered view that Commissioner, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti has
erred in arriving at the above conclusion by ruling in favour of respondent No. 4,
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi and caused discrimination and prejudice to the applicant,
Smt. Kh. Jerina, by rejecting her claim. As per the Transfer Policy, 2021, the
applicant Smt. Kh. Jerina has already done three years in her current posting and
thus falls in the category of 'eligible' as per 4(1)(i) above. Respondent No. 4 Smt.
Aribam Sobita Devi has not done three years in her current posting and thus falls in
the category of "not eligible"
as per 4(1)(ii).
7. This Tribunal is of the view that once the applicant (Ms. Jerina) has been fund to be eligible, she
deserves to get priority and precedence over respondent No. 4 who prima facie is "not eligible"
and but made "eligible" cannot be compared with "not eligible" and W.P.(C) No. 489
of 2023 Page 15 thus the order of Commissioner, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti is bad in
law and deserves to be set aside and quashed.
8. Accordingly, we set aside and quash the impugned No. 7- 23/2021-NVS(Estt-II)/8455, dated
16.08.2021 (Annexure - A/2) and direct the respondent No. 2 and 3 to consider the case of the
applicant for transfer to JNV, Bishnupur (Manipur) under the "eligible" category of Transfer
Conditions of 2021 as well as on the "seniority" principles of Transfer Conditions of 2012 (The
applicant having joined Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti as TGT-Hindi on 14.07.2006 vis-à-vis Smt.
Aribam Sobita Devi who joined Navodaya Vidyalaya Samit on 16.07.2007).

9. With the above observation and directions the instant O.A. is allowed with no order as to costs."
The respondents state that in compliance of the order of Hon'ble CAT, Guwahati Bench, Guwahati,
NVS issued the office order dated 10.05.2023 transferring Smt. Kh. Jerina, TGT (Hindi) at JNV,
Bishnupur considering the fact that the transfer is related to long back of ATD 2020-21 and due to
which no one can be posted to JNV, Bishnupur which adversely hampered the academics of the
students of JNV, Bishnupur. Accordingly, to avoid the unnecessary further litigation in the
compelling situation, Samiti transferred Smt. Kh. Jerina to JNV, Bishnupur. Smt. Kh. Jerina, TGT
(Hindi) had already joined to the post of TGT-Hindi at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Bishnupur
(Manipur) on 23.05.2023 and as of now there is no vacancy of TGT-Hindi in JNV, Bishnupur
(Manipur).
The respondents state that two posts of TGT - Hindi are sanctioned and two teachers are already
working against the sanctioned posts of TGT-Hindi resulting into no vacancy of TGT-Hindi in JNV,
Chandel (Manipur).
In view the aforementioned submissions and in the facts and circumstances of the case, the
respondents state that the impugned office order dated 10.05.2023 transferring Smt. Kh. Jerina,
TGT-Hindi to JNV, Bishnupur (Manipur) was issued as per the direction of Hon'ble CAT, Guwahati
Bench, Guwahati passed in its order dated 27.04.2023 passed in O.A. No. 042/00207/2021. As
such, the petitioner is not entitled to any relief/s as prayed for in the writ petition and the instant
writ petition W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 16 deserves to be dismissed. In view of the said
submissions made hereinabove, this Court may be pleased to dismiss the present petition.
The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the present respondent No. 4 filed O.A. No.
042/00163/2021 before CAT, Guwahati challenging the proposed transfer list dated 22.06.2021
(Round 2) of ATD 2020-21 by deliberately concealing the already published final transfer list dated
01.07.2021 by misrepresenting facts.
However, this submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is not sustainable, as on perusal
of the both transfer lists, the present respondent No. 4 was found aggrieved/affected by both the
proposed transfer list as well as the final transfer list.
Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the said O.A. No. 163 of 2021 was
disposed of without issuing notice or giving opportunity of being heard to the present petitioner.
However, on perusal of the said order of the Ld. Tribunal, it was found that the Ld. Tribunal has
given just a direction to the authority to dispose of the representation filed by the present
respondent No. 4 within 4 (four) months nothing else without going into merit of the case.
Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that against the said Hon'ble CAT's order,
the present petitioner filed the writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 496 of 2021 and this Hon'ble High
Court passed favourable order in favour of the present petitioner. We extract the operative portion
of this Hon'ble Court's order and the same is reproduced herein below:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 11
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
"[4] Mr. T. Momo, learned counsel, would state that the only grievance of the writ
petitioner was that the Tribunal, without putting her on notice, had directed that her
case should not be given effect to, while disposing of OA No. 042/00163/2021. He
would state that she no longer has any grievance in the light of the disposal of the
representation dated 06.07.2021 by the competent authority in her favour, by the
order dated 16.08.2021. He would further state that as the validity of the said order is
presently under consideration before the Tribunal in the new OA filed by respondent
No. 4, herein, the cause in this writ petition no longer survives.
W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 17 As the grievance of the writ petitioner was on
limited to the direction of the Tribunal that her case should not be considered as she
had no grievance whatsoever with the direction to dispose of the representation dated
06.07.2021 made by respondent No. 4 herein, the validity of such disposal is not in
question before this Court. It is for the Tribunal to verify the validity of the order
dated 16.08.2021 passed in exercise of such disposal in the pending O.A. Further, as
the disposal of the representation was made by the competent authority pursuant to
the direction of the Tribunal, in ignorance of the interim suspension granted by this
Court, which was altogether on a different ground, the Commissioner, Navodaya
Vidyalaya Samity, Uttar Pradesh, is at liberty to lift the interim suspension of his
earlier order dated 16.08.2021 so that its validity can be examined by the Tribunal.
The writ petition is disposed of with the above observation.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs."
However, on perusal of the above reproduced operative portion of this Hon'ble Court's order, we
find no favourable order in favour of the petitioner. But, instead, this Hon'ble Court rather has given
liberty to the CAT to examine and dispose of the case of the parties which was filed by the present
respondent No. 4.
It was, further, submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the plea of respondent No. 4
was basing on the guidelines issued by NVS in Clause No. 9(1)(c) of the Transfer Policy, 2012 which
is bad in law as the said Transfer Policy, 2012 has already been superseded/modified and eclipsed
by the Transfer Policy, 2021.
Further, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents No. 2 & 3 submitted that as the
respondent No. 1 has no role to play in the instant matter, no specific reply in the subject matter is
needed in the facts and circumstances of the case and as such, requested this Court to delete the
name of the respondent No. 1. Accordingly, the prayer for deleting the name of respondent No. 1 is
allowed. The Registry is directed to delete the name of respondent No. 1 in the cause title.
At the outset, we extract relevant portion of both guidelines.
W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 18 "9.1 Method for Request Transfer basing on Transfer count
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 12
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
(c) In case of a tie in two or more employees of the same gender an employee with an earlier date of
joining in present post in present station shall be accommodated and in case, if the date of joining in
present post in present station also coincides then the older employee shall be first accommodated".
Relevant portion of 2021 Transfer Guidelines as follows:
"4.6 (i) Benefit of Cumulative tenure for eligibility to employees working in hard and
difficult station: If an employee has successfully worked in different Jawarhar
Navodaya Vidyalaya in Very Hard/Hard/Semi Hard Stations of a region in a row in
the current spell, the tenure of immediate previous station shall be used as a
cumulative factor to determine his/her eligibility (for transfer) from present station.
The governing provisions of cumulative tenure shall further be as under:
i. If an employee serving at present hard station, is eligible by virtue of his tenure at
present station, the provisions of cumulative tenure count shall not be extended to
him.
ii. If an employee serving at present hard and difficult station, is not eligible by virtue
of his tenure at present hard station, his tenure of service at immediate previous hard
station (of the same region) shall be the deciding factor of his eligibility. If he is
eligible to seek request transfer due to stay at his immediate previous station, he shall
be considered eligible to seek transfer due to stay at his immediate previous station
only subject to lower hard station's category (between present and immediate
previous station).
iii. If an employee serving at hard and difficult station, is neither eligible by virtue of
his tenure at present hard station nor his tenure at previous hard station (of the same
region), his tenure of eligibility shall be decided by cumulating the tenure of present
hard station and immediate previous hard station of the same region, restricting the
eligibility to lower hard station's category (between present and immediate previous
station).
iv. It is to clarify that such provision of cumulative tenure of hard station shall be
region specific and shall not be applicable for two different hard stations of different
regions.
v. By mentioning hard station, it implies for very hard, hard and semi hard stations
interchangeably among such stations".
[6] On perusal of both guidelines, we found both the guidelines are in favour of the present
respondent No. 4, because the fact W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 19 remains that the present
respondent No. 4 joined service on 14.07.2006, the petitioner joined service on 16.07.2007 and the
petitioner joined her present posting i.e. JNV, Ukhrul on 04.09.2018 and the respondent No. 4
joined her present place of posting (before her transfer to JNV, Bishnupur) on 13.07.2017.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 13
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
Accordingly, the present respondent is eligible for transfer to JNV, Bishnupur straight away by
applying the relevant guidelines i.e. Transfer Guidelines, 2012 and also that the respondent No. 4
will also be the eligible candidate for transfer by applying clause (i) of the Transfer Guidelines, 2021.
In short, the respondent No. 4 is senior to the present petitioner and the respondent No. 4 has
already completed 3 years at her present place of posting i.e. JNV, Chandel as required under both
guidelines.
On the other hand, the present petitioner was junior to the respondent No. 4 and was not yet
completed 3 year at her place of posting i.e. JNV, Ukhrul and thus, respondent No. 4 falls in the
category of "Eligible" as per part (i) of 4.6(i) above. As such, the respondent No. 4 is eligible for
consideration of transfer to JNV, Bishnupur over the present petitioner under the above 2 (two)
transfer guidelines. Accordingly, the authority should give priority to the respondent No. 4 over the
petitioner.
It is also fact that both the present respondent No. 4 as well as the petitioner filed their respective
request letters for transferring them to the JNV, Bishnupur, as per the guidelines of the transfer
policy of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (Transfer Guidelines of employees of NVS). Guideline No. 2 of
the Transfer Policy of the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti for transfer of employees of NVS is reproduced
herein below:
"2. GUIDING/BASIC PRINCIPLES
(a) An employee on initial posting after recruitment/promotion will not be
considered for request transfer before he completes the prescribed mandatory
tenure/normal tenure at his initial place of posting.
(b) Transfer/posting to a choice place/desired station shall not be claimed as a matter
of right. Some crucial determinants for such transfer are as under:
i) Availability of a clear-cut vacancy.
ii) Domain expertise of an employee.
iii) Performance of an employee against tangible
parameters wherever possible for example, CBSE W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 20
results, APAR Grading in the last five years or such other parameters as may be
prescribed from time to time for different posts.
iv) Factors such as; due for retirement, medical problems faced by an employee or
family members, spouse working at a station etc.
v) Redeployment of surplus staff in excess of sanctioned strength at a location to
other location against sanctioned vacancies."
The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that in compliance of the Ld. CAT Guwahati
Bench's order, the NVS had already issued office order dated 10.05.2023 transferring the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 14
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
respondent No. 4 at JNV, Bishnupur considering the fact that the transfer was related to long back
ATD 2020-21 and due to which, no one can be posted to JNV, Bishnupur which adversely hampered
the academy of JNV, Bishnupur. Accordingly, to avoid the compelling, the Navodaya Vidyalaya
Samiti transferred the respondent No. 4 to JNV, Bishnupur and accordingly, respondent No. 4 had
already joined JNV, Bishnupur on 23.05.2023, and as of now, there is no vacancy in JNV,
Bishnupur.
On careful conspectus of the final transfer list, we are convinced and satisfied that the authority
prepared the said proposed list as well as the final list by applying clause (ii) of 4.6 (i) of the Transfer
Guidelines, 2021. However, the authority should apply this only when there is only 1(one) candidate
asking for transfer and posting. However, in the instant case, 2(two) candidates from the same
region were applying for transfer in the same place of posting i.e. JNV, Bishnupur.
As such, we are of the considered view that the authority erred in issuing the said proposed list as
well as the final list and issuance of the rejection order No. F.No. 7-23/2021-NVS issued by the
Commissioner, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti. The authority should consider the case of the present
respondent No. 4 at the first instance, as she is eligible for transfer to JNV, Bishnupur by applying
column No. (i) of 4.6(i) of the Transfer Guidelines, 2021 at the first instance. However, the authority
issued the said order in favour of the petitioner by applying (ii) of 4.6(i). The authority W.P.(C) No.
489 of 2023 Page 21 should give priority to the respondent No. 4, as the present respondent No. 4
deserves to get priority and precedence over the present petitioner.
[7] In the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the authority violates the mandatory statutory
rules and acted malafide.
[8] On perusal of the Ld. CAT's order, we find that the Ld. CAT, Guwahati Bench considered the
pleas put forth by the parties in totality while passing the order.
[9] In our view, the Deputy Commissioner (Pers.), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, Ministry of
Education, Government of India rightly issued the order bearing F. No.
07-23/2021/NVS/ESTT-II(ATD 20-21)/7083, dated 10.05.2023.
[10] The learned counsel for the petitioner, in support of his case in the matter of limitation of
power of the Court to interfere with the transfer and posting of the employees of the State, relied
upon the following the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgments.
1. "Shilpi Bose (Mrs.) &Ors. v. State of Bihar -1991 Supp. (2) SCC 659"
But, here the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that - "3. If the competent authority issued
transfer orders with a view to accommodate a public servant to avoid hardship, the
same cannot and should not be interfered by the court merely because the transfer
orders were passed on the request of the employees concerned. The respondents have
continued to be posted at their respective places for the last several years, they have
no vested right to remain posted at one place. Since they hold transferable posts they
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 15
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
are liable to be transferred from one place to the other. The transfer orders had been
issued by the competent authority which did not violate any mandatory rule,
therefore the High Court had no jurisdiction to interfere with the transfer orders.
4. The courts should not interfere with a transfer order which is made in public
interest and for administrative reasons unless the transfer orders are made in
violation of any mandatory statutory rule or on the ground of mala fide. A
government servant holding a transferable post has no vested W.P.(C) No. 489 of
2023 Page 22 right to remain posted at one place or the other, he is liable to be
transferred from one place to the other. Transfer orders issued by the competent
authority do not violate any of his legal rights. Even if a transfer order is passed in
violation of executive instructions or orders, the courts ordinarily should not
interfere with the order; instead affected party should approach the higher
authorities in the department. If the courts continue to interfere with day-to-day
transfer orders issued by the government and its subordinate authorities, there will
be complete chaos in the administration which would not be conducive to public
interest. The High Court overlooked these aspects in interfering with the transfer
orders."
2. "Rajendra Singh and Ors v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.- (2009) 15 SCC 178"
But, here the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that - "8. A government servant has no
vested right to remain posted at a place of his choice nor can he insist that he must be
posted at one place or the other. He is liable to be transferred in the administrative
exigencies from one place to the other. Transfer of an employee is not only an
incident inherent in the terms of appointment but also implicit as an essential
condition of service in the absence of any specific indication to the contrary. No
Government can function if the government servant insists that once appointed or
posted in a particular place or position, he should continue in such place or position
as long as he desires (see State of U.P. v. Gobardhan Lal', SCC p. 406, para 7).
9. The courts are always reluctant in interfering with the transfer of an employee
unless such transfer is vitiated by violation of some statutory provisions or suffers
from mala fides. In Shilpi Bose v. State of Bihar this Court held: (SCC p. 661, para 4)
'4. In our opinion, the courts should not interfere with a transfer order which is made
in public interest and for administrative reasons unless the transfer orders are made
in violation of any mandatory statutory rule or on the ground of mala fide. A
government servant holding a transferable post has no vested right to remain posted
at one place or the other, he is liable to be transferred from one place to the other.
Transfer orders issued by the competent authority do not violate any of his legal
rights. Even if a transfer order is passed in violation of executive instructions or
orders, the courts ordinarily should not interfere with the order and instead affected
party should approach the higher authorities in the department. If the courts
continue to interfere with day-to-day transfer orders issued by the government and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 16
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
its subordinate authorities, there will be complete chaos in the W.P.(C) No. 489 of
2023 Page 23 administration which would not be conducive to public interest. The
High Court overlooked these aspects in interfering with the transfer orders.'
10. In N.K. Singh v. Union of India' this Court reiterated that:
(SCC p. 103. para 6) a 6. ... the scope of judicial review in matters of transfer of a
government servant to an equivalent post without any adverse consequence on the
service or career prospects is very limited being confined only to the grounds of mala
fides and violation of any specific provision...."
3. "Union of India v. S.L. Abbas - (1993) 4 SCC 357"
But, here the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that - "6. An order of transfer is an
incident of Government Service. Fundamental Rule 11 says that "the whole time of a
Government servant is at the disposal of the Government which pays him and he may
be employed in any manner required by proper authority. Fundamental Rule 15 says
that "the President may transfer a government servant from one post to another".
That the respondent is liable to transfer anywhere in India is not in dispute. It is not
the case of the respondent that order of his transfer is vitiated by mala fides on the
part of the authority making the order,- though the Tribunal does say so merely
because certain guidelines issued by the Central Government are not followed, with
which finding we shall deal later. The respondent attributed "mischief" to his
immediate superior who had nothing to do with his transfer. All he says is that he
should not be transferred because his wife is working at Shillong, his children are
studying there and also because his health had suffered a set-back some time ago. He
relies upon certain executive instructions issued by the Government in that behalf.
Those instructions are in the nature of guidelines. They do not have statutory force.
7. Who should be transferred where, is a matter for the appropriate authority to
decide. Unless the order of transfer is vitiated by malafide or is made in violation of
any statutory provisions, the Court cannot interfere with it. While ordering the
transfer, there is no doubt, the authority must keep in mind the guidelines issued by
the Government on the subject. Similarly, if a person makes any representation with
respect to his transfer, the appropriate authority must consider the same having
regard to the exigencies of administration. The guidelines say that as far as possible,
husband and wife must be posted at the same place. The said guideline however does
not confer upon the government employee a legally enforceable right.
8. The jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal is akin to the jurisdiction of
the High Court under Article 226 of W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 24 the
constitution of India in service matters. This is evident from a perusal of Article
323-A of the constitution. The constraints and norms which the High Court observes
while exercising the said jurisdiction apply equally to the Tribunal created under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67836898/ 17
Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
Article 323-A. (We find it all the more surprising that the learned Single Member who
passed the impugned order is a former Judge of the High Court and is thus aware of
the norms and constraints of the writ jurisdiction.) The Administrative Tribunal is
not an Appellate Authority sitting in judgment over the orders of transfer. It cannot
substitute its own judgment for that of the authority competent to transfer. In this
case the Tribunal has clearly exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with the order of
transfer. The order of the Tribunal reads as if it were sitting in appeal over the order
of transfer made by the Senior Administrative Officer (competent authority)."
4. "Shayara Bano v. UOI" (the Triple Talaq Case) But, here the Supreme Court ruled that -
The practice of instantaneous triple talaq (Talaq-ul- biddat) was unlawful. The Bench noted that the
equality of status was a manifestation of the fundamental right to equality protected by Article 14 of
the Constitution.
The equality of status of present Petitioner qua the other employees of Official Respondents who
have obtained the benefit of Automated Transfer Portal and which is unchallenged nor interfered by
any Court of Law and even in the impugned order of CAT, is to be protected in favour of the
Petitioner.
5. "U.P. Power Corpn. Ltd. vs. Ayodhya Prasad Mishra - (2008) 10 SCC 139"
But, here the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that - "36. It is well settled that Article 14
is designed to prevent discrimination. It seeks to prohibit a person or class of persons
from being singled out from others similarly situated or circumstanced for the
purpose of being specially subjected to discrimination by hostile legislation. It,
however, does not prohibit classification, if such classification is based on legal and
relevant considerations.
37. Every classification, to be legal, valid and permissible, must fulfil the twin- test,
namely,
(i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which
distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the
group; and W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 25
(ii) such differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved
by the statute or legislation in question.
38. In the present case, the sole criterion for promotion of an Executive Engineer to
the post of Superintending Engineer is 'merit'. The Regulations, therefore,
contemplate preparation of different select lists and allotment of marks".

Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi vs Union Of India on 29 February, 2024
[11] On a careful conspectus of the legal spectrum, we are of the considered view that the
aforementioned decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court do not help the case of the petitioner,
rather it goes against the petitioner. We are convinced here that the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid
down the principle of law that the transfer and posting of a public servant should not be interfered
with by the Court, which is made in public interest and for administrative reasons. We also mindful
of the principle of law that the principle of transfer and posting of the public servant should not be
affected by violation of any mandatory statutory rule or on the ground of the malafide.
However, in the present case as discussed above, the authority of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti
committed violation of mandatory statutory rule as set out in the Transfer Policy and committed
malafide.
[12] The operative portion of the order dated 27.04.2023 passed by the Ld. CAT, Guwahati Bench,
impugned herein, reads as follows:
"6. We are of the considered view that Commissioner, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti has erred in
arriving at the above conclusion by ruling in favour of respondent No. 4, Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi
and caused discrimination and prejudice to the applicant, Smt. Kh. Jerina, by rejecting her claim. As
per the Transfer Policy, 2021, the applicant Smt. Kh. Jerina has already done three years in her
current posting and thus falls in the category of 'eligible' as per 4(1)(i) above. Respondent No. 4 Smt.
Aribam Sobita Devi has not done three years in her current posting and thus falls in the category of
"not eligible"
as per 4(1)(ii).
7. This Tribunal is of the view that once the applicant (Ms. Jerina) has been fund to be eligible, she
deserves to get priority and precedence over respondent No. 4 who prima facie is "not eligible"
and but made "eligible" cannot be compared with "not eligible" and thus the order of
Commissioner, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti is bad in law and deserves to be set aside
and quashed.
W.P.(C) No. 489 of 2023 Page 26
8. Accordingly, we set aside and quash the impugned No. 7-
23/2021-NVS(Estt-II)/8455, dated 16.08.2021 (Annexure - A/2) and direct the
respondent No. 2 and 3 to consider the case of the applicant for transfer to JNV,
Bishnupur (Manipur) under the "eligible"
category of Transfer Conditions of 2021 as well as on the "seniority" principles of Transfer
Conditions of 2012 (The applicant having joined Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti as TGT-Hindi on
14.07.2006 vis-à-vis Smt. Aribam Sobita Devi who joined Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti on
