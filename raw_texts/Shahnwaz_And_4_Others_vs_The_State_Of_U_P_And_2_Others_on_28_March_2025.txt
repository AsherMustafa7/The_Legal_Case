1. Lawyers are abstaining from judicial work. We have carefully perused the record.
2. Although, the prayer made in this writ petition is to quash the FIR dated 02.03.2025 registered as
Case Crime No.0159 of 2025, under Sections 191(2), 110, 131, 115(2) and 352 B.N.S.2023, Police
Station-Pipraich, District-Gorakhpur but on perusal of record it reflects that the offences,
complained of, are punishable only up to seven years and therefore, before effecting the arrest of the
petitioners, specific provisions contained in Section 41(1)(b) and Section 41-A of Cr.P.C./Section

Shahnwaz And 4 Others vs The State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 28 March, 2025
35(3) to 35(7) of Bhartiya Nagrika Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 be strictly complied with in view of law
laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in several judgments.
3. We have perused the FIR, which prima facie discloses cognizable offences against the petitioners
and therefore, the prayer made to quash the FIR cannot be entertained in view of law laid down by
Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases of State of Telangana Vs. Habib Abdullah Jellani reported in (2017)
2 SCC 779 and Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others reported in
(2021) SCC Online SC 315 and as such, we are of the view that no interference is warranted.
4. However, considering the fact that all the offences, complained of, in the impugned FIR, are
punishable with a term up to seven years, therefore, in case of effecting the arrest of the petitioners
in pursuance of the impugned FIR, it is directed that the respondents authorities shall ensure that
the specific provisions contained in Section 41(1)(b) and Section 41-A of CrPC/ Section 35(3) to
35(7) of Bhartiya Nagrika Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 and the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar reported in (2014) 8 SCC 273 as well as the directions
issued in judgement and order dated 28.01.2021 of this Court passed in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition
No. 17732 of 2020 (Vimal Kumar and 3 Others Vs. State of U.P. and 3 Others) reported in 2021 (2)
ACR 1147, be strictly complied with.
5. With the aforesaid observations, the instant writ petition stands disposed of.
