ORDER
(Reserved on : 02.04.2025) (Pronounced on : 28.04.2025) Per: Hon'ble Shri Justice Vivek Jain,
Judge By way of batch of these petitions, challenge is made to the advertisement Annexure P-6
issued for recruitment of various posts under Group 5 for which Joint Recruitment Test is
advertised to be conducted by M.P. Employees Selection Board. Along with the advertisement,
which is Annexure P-6 to W.P. No.7425/2024, challenge is also made to the amendment made to
the Recruitment Rules by the State Government vide amendment Notification dated 02.02.2019,
whereby the State Government has amended M.P. Public Health and Family Welfare Department
Non-Ministerial (Related to Directorate of Health Services) Class - III Service Recruitment Rules,
1989 ("Rules 1989" for short) and for the purpose of recruitment of Auxiliary Nursing Midwife
('ANM' for short) also named as Female Multipurpose Health Worker ("FHW" for short),
amendments are made in the matter of eligibility qualifications for recruitment of regular post of
ANM/FHW. Since the issues are same and similar in all these petitions, therefore, all are being
decided by this common judgment.
2. By the aforesaid amendment Notification, the following entries have been substituted in place of
the earlier entry. The impugned qualifications which are now inserted for recruitment on the said
post are as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 65
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
"1 Must have passed Higher Secondary Examination/12th Class Examination in 10+2
Education System (with Biology, Chemistry and Physics).
2. Must have passed 2 years Training Course of Female Multipurpose Health
Worker/Auxiliary Nursing Midwife Training Centers run by the Government of
Madhya Pradesh only.
3. Must have valid Registration of Madhya Pradesh Nurses Registration Council,
Bhopal."
3. By the aforesaid amendment Notification, the State Government has substituted the earlier
requirements for the said post, which were as under:-
"1. Should have passed 10th Class Examination in 10+2 Education System.
Candidates having passed 10th class Examination with Mathematics, Science and
Biology shall be preferred.
2. Should have passed 18 months training course of Female Health Worker
3. Registration of Female Health Worker."
4. The arguments on behalf of the petitioners were led by Shri K.C. Ghildiyal, learned Senior
Advocate. Shri Ghildiyal has vehemently argued that the impugned amendment Notification dated
02.02.2019 changes the conditions of eligibility laid down for appointment to the post of
ANM/FHW. It is contended that the requirements are effectively put to change in the matter of
three different issues.
5. Firstly, in place of Class 10thExamination as qualifying examination along with requisite training
of ANM, now the qualification of Class 12th with Biology as one of the subjects has been
incorporated and it is specifically led down that the subjects in Class 12th Examination should be
Biology, Chemistry and Physics. It is argued that firstly, earlier requirement to take admission in
ANM was Class 10th pass till the year 2012 and even thereafter, as per the Notification issued by
Indian Nursing Council, the requirement is Class 12th pass to take admission in ANM course and
that Class 12th Examination can be acquired from any group of subjects and there is no requirement
led down by Indian Nursing Council that the Class 12th Examination prior to taking admission in
ANM course should be with Biology group of subjects. Therefore, it is argued that the respondent -
State would not have incorporated any condition for appointment as ANM/FHW, which is contrary
to the requirement laid down by Indian Nursing Council to take admission in ANM course and that
the State Government should recognize qualification of Class 12th obtained from any group of
subjects, even if at all the requirement of Class-XII examination is to be upheld as one of the
essential qualifications.
6. In the second issue of challenge, the requirement of acquiring ANM course of two years duration
is also put to challenge by way of these petitions. It is argued that for a long time, i.e. till the Session
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 66
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
2014-15 even Government Training Institutions in the State of Madhya Pradesh have been
imparting ANM Training with 18 months duration and therefore, majority of candidates who have
appeared in the selection test have acquired ANM training of 18 months duration. It is argued that
by the impugned notification the candidates who have earlier obtained ANM training of 18 months
duration have been declared to be disqualified, which cannot be done because it would amount to
retrospective operation of the rules.
7. The third issue of grievance of the petitioners in the impugned amendment Notification is the
requirement to have required ANM training only from Government Institutes and disentitling all
candidates, who have acquired such qualification from private colleges/institutions. It is alleged to
be unconstitutional and amounting to create class within class
8. To elaborate, it is the case of the petitioners that the three requirements substituted by the
amendment Notification of 02.02.2019 are unconstitutional and amount to creating class within
class. It is further the argument of the petitioners that the said requirements have been put into
place for the first time by Notification dated 02.02.2019 and therefore, firstly the said requirements
are unconstitutional and secondly, even if the said requirements are held to be legal and valid, then
the candidates, who have already obtained qualifications when the qualifications were recognized as
valid qualifications by the State Government, then for those candidates, who have already obtained
qualifications as per the un- amended rules should be treated to have obtained requisite
qualification even after the date of from which the amended rules have been notified and enforced.
9. It is also argued that so far as the requirement of obtaining Class 12th Examination with Biology
as one of the subjects is concerned, the said requirement is not even there in the
Notification/instructions issued by Indian Nursing Council ('INC' for short). It is further argued that
INC has been set up by Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947 and as per Section 16 of the Act of 1947,
INC is having power to make regulations. The INC has made regulations and put into place the
modified requirements for taking admission in ANM course and by the same instructions dated
03.01.2012, the INC has laid down that ANM course would be of two years duration. It is contended
that the INC has merely upgraded the educational requirement for taking admission in ANM course
from Class 10th to Class 12th from the Session 2012-13 and even as per the modified instructions of
INC dated 03.01.2012, the requirement is to simply obtain Class 12th and not to obtain Class 12th
from any particular group of subjects, and therefore, the requirement on Biology Group in excessive
legislation by way of delegated legislation. Therefore, it is argued that the impugned amendment
Notification dated 02.02.2019 is unconstitutional and ultravires the provisions of Section 16 of Act
of 1947 in requiring Class 12th Examination to be obtained with Biology Group of subjects, because
even the INC has not laid down any such requirements to take admission in ANM course. It is also
argued that all those candidates who have taken admission in ANM course were under legitimate
expectation that they are undergoing a legal and valid ANM qualification and now all of a sudden
the State Government cannot put into place a different qualification which is different from the one
as laid down by INC.
10. It is further argued that even the requirement of Class 12th should be stressed only from the date
of amending Notification, i.e. 02.02.2019 and all those candidates, who have obtained ANM
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 67
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
qualification as per the old parameters laid down by the INC, i.e. after acquiring Class 10th
qualification, those who have obtained earlier qualification should be recognized for the purpose of
the recruitment in question and to that extent the amendment Notification should be either be read
down, if not declared unconstitutional and ultra vires. It is further argued that no law can have
retrospective operation and if the amendment Notification dated 02.02.2019 is read even for those
candidates who have acquired qualification prior to 02.02.2019 which were then valid, then it would
amount to giving retrospective effect to the amendment, which is not permissible as per law.
11. It is further argued that though the INC has raised the course duration from 18 months to 24
months from the Session 2012-13, but various Nursing Institutions including Government
Institutions continued to run 18 months long courses upto the Secession 2014-15 and even
thereafter for which the students were not at fault. It is argued that for the first time by amendment
Notification dated 02.02.2019, the State Government has amended the Rules requiring 24
months/two years ANM course as requisite length of course. Therefore, all those candidates who
have acquired ANM qualification of 18 months duration for the purpose of recruitment in question,
the amendment dated 02.02.2019 should be read down to that extent.
12. So far as the question of the candidates declared eligible only if they have acquired qualification
from Government Institution is concerned, it is contended that the aforesaid requirement is
absolutely unconstitutional and has no basis in law. Once a candidate has acquired ANM
qualification from an Institute recognized by the State Government, then the State Government
cannot say at the time of granting employment that it will not employ the candidates passed out
from those institutions, which though were established by private societies, but are having
recognition from the statutory bodies like INC, M.P. State Nursing Council as well as the State
Government of Madhya Pradesh. Therefore, this distinction being made at the point of granting
employment amounts to unreasonable discrimination and inequality being created which is
contrary to the constitutional objectives enshrined under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of
India. Therefore, the requirement of completing degree only from Government institutions deserves
to be set aside and the impugned Notification dated 02.02.2019 to that effect is absolutely
unconstitutional.
13. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners also relied on various judgments to buttress his
submissions.
14. Per contra,learned counsel for the State has vehemently defended the impugned Notification and
it is submitted that so far as the issue of candidates acquiring Class 12th qualification with Biology
Group is concerned, the Indian Nursing Counsel had issued instructions in the matter of requisite
qualifications for taking admission in ANM course vide letter dated 03.01.2012 and these guidelines
were effective from the Session 2012-13. It is argued that the INC has clearly laid down that the
candidates need to have Class 12th Examination passed before taking admission in ANM course and
the petitioners cannot seek any relaxation from the requirement set up by the INC, though the State
being employer can always require even higher benchmark.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 68
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
15. So far as the requirement of Biology as one of the subjects in Class 12th is concerned, it is
vehemently argued by learned counsel for the State that the ANMsin Department of Public Health in
the State of Madhya Pradesh are required to work in Primary, Community Health Centers spread
over all the areas of the State as well as District Hospitals, wherein critical patients have to be
treated and managed including high risk pregnancies, infants and other emergencies, which have to
be handled by the Nursing Staff working in such regular hospitals and health centers being run by
Department of Public Health of the State Government. It is argued that all the emergency cases
come to the Government Hospitals and therefore, the Government thought it fit that the
requirement of Biology as one of the subject in Class 12th, it would give a better human resource to
the State Government looking to the nature of work in the Government run hospitals.
16. It is further argued by the State that it is the matter of policy, which is in the exclusive domain of
the executive and looking to the requirements of its hospitals, the concerned Department of Public
Health of the State has taken a conscious decision to require only those Nurses as ANMs, who have
passed Class 12th Examination with Biology as one of the subjects, because of the sensitive nature of
work they have to handle in Government Hospitals so that they can be better equipped ANMs in
Government Hospitals. It is argued that it was realized by the State Government that with passage of
time the nature of services discharged by ANMs have undergone a sea change and therefore, the
Government thought it proper to recruit only those ANMs, who have passed Class 12th Examination
with Biology as one of the subjects. Therefore, there is nothing arbitrary or irrational in the said
decision and it is having nexus with the objective to be achieved.
17. So far as the issue of 24 months ANM training is concerned, it was argued by the learned counsel
for the State that the said training period has been put into place by the INC vide its letter dated
03.01.2012 and now the present recruitment has been initiated in the year 2023. Even 11 years after
the INC has modified the criteria of ANM course, the petitioners who have acquired 18 months ANM
course cannot insist upon the State to recruit them, even though they may be working in other
hospitals or departments and may have acquired experience during this period, but since the INC
itself has amended the requirement on 03.01.2012 effective from Session 2012-13, therefore, the
State Government did the right thing by amending to bring the rules in line with the directives of the
INC and there is nothing arbitrary and irrational in that.
18. So far as the argument of the petitioners that those who have already acquired 18 months ANM
training while such training was the requisite length as per INC guidelines, it is argued that once a
recruitment is being initiated in the year 2023, then the amendment Notification of the year 2019
would apply and there is nothing wrong in the action of the State and bringing the rules in line with
the INC guide lines. It is argued that the State can lay down more stringent parameters for
employment, then what has been laid down by the INC, but the petitioners cannot force the State to
even go below the benchmark laid down by the INC and therefore, the contention of the petitioners
is stated to be misplaced and meritless.
19. So far as the contention made by the petitioners that only the candidates who have passed ANM
course from Government Institution is concerned, it is argued by learned counsel for the State that
the State is running its Nursing Colleges/Institutions, which are associated to Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 69
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
Hospitals and the Nurses/ANMs passing out from those colleges are better trained and better
equipped. It is further argued that there is a set up procedure for admission to those Nursing
Colleges run by the State and before being admitted in those colleges, they have to go through a
stringent admission process, which is carried out by the State Government and ANM training
selection test is taken by the State Government either itself or through M.P. Professional
Examination Board. It is further argued that the State has been carrying out ANM admission test
from time to time and in those admission tests the State Government has given promise to the
candidates that they would be required to compulsory serve the State Government for a period of
three years after completing the course and have to execute bond with the State Government to that
effect. It is further argued that the State has been giving a promise to such admitted students in
Government Nursing Colleges that they would be given appointment in Government
Hospitals/Health Centers upon completing the course. Various rule books/prospectus of admission
tests conducted for admission in Government Institutions have been placed on record to submit that
the admissions are given in Government Colleges/Institutions with twin conditions, firstly there is a
promise to the students that they would be given appointment in Government Hospitals/Health
Centers and secondly that the students have to execute bond of serving Government Hospitals for
three years.
20. It is further argued by learned counsel for the State that a legitimate expectation is therefore,
created in favour of the students, who are passing out from Government Colleges and to fulfill this
legitimate expectation and promise given by the State this provision has been carved out, apart from
and without prejudice to the other ground that the candidates who are admitted in Government
Institutions come from a stringent selection process conducted on competitive basis and they are
the bests of the students, who succeed to get admission in Government Colleges. It is further
submitted that though now direct appointments to candidates passing out from Government
Colleges cannot be given in view of the M.P. Junior Service (Joint Qualifying) Examination Rules,
2013 being put into place, wherein the post of ANM/FHW is one of the posts for which recruitment
test is to be conducted by M.P. Professional Examination Board. Therefore, as now the selection is
not automatic and has to be through competitive process, therefore, for the purpose of appointment
this provision has been engrafted in the rules that only those candidates would be eligible, who have
passed out from Government Colleges and the competition would be only from amongst the
candidates, who have passed out from Government Colleges.
21. On these grounds and assertions so also on the assertion that parameters of recruitment and
appointment being in the domain of executive and further that the employer is always having
competence to lay down the requisite parameters, therefore, no interference taking made in such
policy decision and furthermore whatever distinctions are made, they are with some lawful objective
to be achieved and having nexus with that lawful objective and therefore, should not be interfered by
this Court as any reasonable classification having nexus with objective to be achieved is always valid
in law.
22. Heard learned counsel for the rival parties at length.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 70
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
23. The impugned recruitment notice issued in the year 2023 for appointment on the post of
ANM/FHW is for hospitals/health centers run by the Public Health Department of the State as well
as by Kamla Nehru Hospital run under the aegis of Bhopal Gas Relief and Rehabilitation so also
under Employees State Insurance Services. Some analogies were tried to be drawn by learned
counsel for the petitioners with the requirements as laid down by Employees State Insurance
Corporation and Kamla Nehru Hospital for same posts, however, the said analogy cannot be made
the basis for examining the validity of the impugned amendment notification dated 02.02.2019
because the impugned notification is issued by Department of Public Health and Family Welfare of
State of Madhya Pradesh which runs regular hospitals and health centers in the State which deal
with critical patients, high risk pregnancies, premature deliveries etc. The said department having
laid down its own requirements could validly do so in view of its organizational requirements and
requirements of its own hospitals and the requirements put in place by other autonomous bodies or
corporations though may be under the fold of the State being its instrumentalities, but that cannot
be made the touchstone of examining the validity of the rules framed by the Public Health
Department of the State Government running regular hospitals dealing with emergencies and
critical patients. Therefore, we proceed to examine the validity of the amendment notification dated
02.02.2019 on its own merits from the anvil of settled parameters to test the validity of rules framed
by the employer on the settled principles on which judicial review of such rules can be made.
24. So far as the requirement of Class-12th with Biology as one of the subjects is concerned, this
issue can be dissected into two sub-groups. Firstly that whether Class-10th or Class-12th should be
recognized and secondly whether Class-10th with Biology can be stressed upon by the State
Government by amending the Rules of 1989 vide notification dated 02.02.2019 and laying down a
parameter which is higher than the parameter laid down by the INC for admission to ANM course.
25. So far as the requirement of Class-12th as such is concerned, it is not in dispute that Class-10th
was the requisite parameter for taking admission in ANM course that was laid down by INC up to
the Session 2011-12 but from the Session 2012-13 vide guidelines dated 03.01.2012, Class-12th is the
requisite qualification to take admission in ANM course. Therefore, the requirement put in place by
amendment notification dated 02.02.2019 by framing the parameters in tune with the admission
guidelines for ANM course laid down by the INC cannot be faulted with and no error is found in that
from any angle. Neither it can be said to be discriminatory, nor arbitrary nor violating any provision
of Constitution nor it can be said to be violative of any other enactment. Therefore, the requirement
so far as having passed Class-12th is not erroneous from any angle and is therefore upheld because
any ANM qualification obtained by a candidate after session 2012-13 onwards and not having
Class-XII qualification, would be a case of illegal admission having been taken in the course.
26. So far as the sub-issue of this issue that whether the State could have stressed on Class-12th to
have been passed from Biology, Physics and Chemistry is concerned, it is challenged by the writ
petitioners on the ground that once the INC has laid down requisite benchmark for taking admission
i.e. to have passed Class- 12th irrespective of the subject group, then the State Government could not
have laid down any different parameter for the same. Analogy was drawn from the regulations
framed by National Council for Teachers Education ("NCTE" for short) which are held to be binding
in the matter of appointment of teachers and it has been held by various Courts including this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 71
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
that NCTE regulations in the matter of laying down qualifications for teachers are binding on State
Government.
27. However, the position of NCTE is entirely different because the NCTE has been specifically given
the power and authority to lay down the minimum standards of education of school teachers by
Section 12A of NCTE Act 1993. Furthermore, it is the "Academic Authority" in terms of Section 23 of
the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (for short 'RTE Act of 2009') and
has the jurisdiction to lay down the minimum qualifications for appointment as a teacher.
Therefore, the jurisdiction enjoyed by NCTE cannot be equated with the jurisdiction exercised by
Indian Nursing Council which has only the power to make regulations as per Section 16 of Indian
Nursing Council Act 1947.
28. The issue of regulations framed by Indian Nursing Council being binding on the State was
considered recently by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Suman Devi v. State of
Uttarakhand reported in(2021) 6 SCC 163. In the aforesaid case the Supreme Court was considering
the similar provisions carved out by the State of Uttarakhand in requiring Class-12th to have been
acquired with Biology as one of the subjects for the purpose of recruitments of ANMs in the Health
Department of the State. The Supreme Court considered the amendment made by the INC in the
guidelines for admission to ANM course which were made applicable from July, 2012. However, it is
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case that for the purpose of recruitment to civil
posts or services within the State, the State has the competence to prescribe the eligibility conditions
and that there is nothing in the Indian Nursing Council Act 1947 (for short, "INC Act") which binds
the State to accept the qualifications laid down by the INC or restricts the State from prescribing
additional qualifications or experience for employment within the State which is in the exclusive
domain of the State. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the INC does not have the competence to
prescribe the conditions for employment in any given State and that the scheme of INC Act does not
give any such jurisdiction to the INC. By considering the scheme of INC Act threadbare, it was held
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that it is within the competence of the State to lay down its eligibility
conditions for appointment to posts. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:-
"26. From the above factual narration, it is evident that in the present case, before the
formation of the State of Uttarakhand, rules which governed recruitment and other
conditions of service in relation to health workers and ANMs had been framed by the
erstwhile State of U.P. Those rules were amended in 1998; the result of the
amendment to the existing rules was that minimum qualifications of intermediate or
equivalent (10+2 from a recognised board) in the science stream were essential for
recruitment and appointment to the cadre of Female Health Workers and ANMs.
Every candidate of course should have completed the ANM course with the
mandatory training; nevertheless, the educational qualification of having completed
intermediate, in science, was essential. This Court finds no merit in the submission of
the appellants that the requirement of an intermediate in science stream did not
exist, since the adaptation order under the Reorganisation Act omitted to mention
the rules framed by the erstwhile State of U.P. Sections 87 and 88 of the
Reorganisation Act read as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 72
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
"87. Power to adapt laws.--For the purpose of facilitating the application in relation
to the State of U.P. or Uttaranchal of any law made before the appointed day, the
appropriate Government may, before the expiration of two years from that day, by
order, make such adaptations and modifications of the law, whether by way of repeal
or amendment, as may be necessary or expedient, and thereupon every such law shall
have effect subject to the adaptations and modifications so made until altered,
repealed or amended by a competent legislature or other competent authority.
Explanation.--In this section, the expression "appropriate Government" means as
respects any law relating to a matter enumerated in the Union List, the Central
Government, and as respects any other law in its application to a State, the State
Government.
88. Power to construe laws.--Notwithstanding that no provision or insufficient
provision has been made under Section 87 for the adaptation of a law made before
the appointed day, any court, tribunal or authority, required or empowered to
enforce such law may, for the purpose of facilitating its application in relation to the
State of U.P. or Uttaranchal, construe the law in such manner, without affecting the
substance, as may be necessary or proper in regard to the matter before the court,
tribunal or authority."
27. By virtue of Section 28 of the Reorganisation Act [ "28. Jurisdiction of Uttaranchal High
Court.--The High Court of Uttaranchal shall have, in respect of any part of the territories included in
the State of Uttaranchal, all such jurisdiction, powers and authority as, under the law in force
immediately before the appointed day, are exercisable in respect of that part of the said territories
by the High Court of Allahabad."] , the newly established Uttarakhand High Court had the
jurisdiction, powers and authority in respect of the law in force, immediately before the appointed
day, which was exercisable by the Allahabad High Court.
28. A comprehensive reading of the provisions of the Reorganisation Act would show that the laws
in force in the erstwhile State of U.P. continued to remain operative upon the creation of the new
State of Uttarakhand. Section 87 only had the effect of obliging the State and the courts to thereafter
enforce the existing laws, to the extent they were modified within a period of 2 years from the date of
commencement of the Reorganisation Act. If the appellants are correct, the mere omission of a law
or regulation in the adaptation order, would have the disastrous effect of creating a vacuum in
regard to existing laws that are not specifically mentioned. In other words, the power to adapt only
meant that such laws which required some modifications or adaptations, could be so modified or
adapted within the period defined i.e. 2 years. In the absence of any such exercise of adaptation or
modification, all the laws, rules, regulations and statutory orders that were in force in the State of
U.P. applied without any change.
29. This Court holds to be unmerited, the arguments of the appellant that the State was bound by
the criteria specified in the advertisement issued by it in March 2016, even though Clause 7 of that
notification clearly specified that the recruitments for ANMs would be in accordance with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 73
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
statutory rules. The omission to mention the relevant qualifications (i.e. intermediate or equivalent
qualification with the science stream) did not relieve the State from its obligation to follow existing
rules. It has not been disputed that the 1997 Rules, after amendment in 1998, mandated that
candidates desirous of being recruited as ANM or Health Workers had to possess educational
qualifications including Intermediate pass (or its equivalent) with the science stream, apart from the
necessary ANM certificate course. That condition remained unchanged even after the creation of the
State of Uttarakhand. It was only in 2016, after the advertisement for the recruitment concerned
was published, that the rules were changed; the changed new rules relieved the requirement of
having to qualify the Intermediate level with science subjects, for the period 2010-2013 and
thereafter, after July 2016. For all other periods, the basic educational qualification of intermediate
or equivalent pass with a mandatory science stream qualification, remained an essential condition.
Therefore, the argument that the State was bound by the standards it specified (in the advertisement
which had omitted any mention as to the educational qualification of intermediate with science) did
not relieve the State from the obligation of enforcing statutory rules. It is too late in the day to assert
that any kind of estoppel can operate against the State to compel it to give effect to a promise
contrary to law or prevailing rules that have statutory force. All arguments to this effect on the part
of the appellants are therefore rejected. Furthermore, it is useful to recollect that the eligibility of a
candidate or applicant for a public post or service, is to be adjudged as on the last date of receipt of
applications for such post or service, in terms of the relevant advertisement, and the prevailing
service rules. This position is recognised by settled authority; in Ashok Kumar Sharma v. Chander
Shekhar [Ashok Kumar Sharma v. Chander Shekhar, (1997) 4 SCC 18 :
1997 SCC (L&S) 913] a three-Judge Bench of this Court ruled, in this context that :
(SCC pp. 21-22, para 6) "6. ... The proposition that where applications are called for
prescribing a particular date as the last date for filing the applications, the eligibility
of the candidates shall have to be judged with reference to that date and that date
alone, is a well-
established one. A person who acquires the prescribed qualification subsequent to such prescribed
date cannot be considered at all. An advertisement or notification issued/published calling for
applications constitutes a representation to the public and the authority issuing it is bound by such
representation. It cannot act contrary to it."
29. In view of the above we do not find any illegality in the action of the State in prescribing
Class-12th to be passed with Biology as one of the subjects alongwith Physics and Chemistry as it is
within the competence of the State to lay down its own eligibility condition and the jurisdiction
which is given to the INC as per the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947 is only to prescribe the
standards of examination to be satisfied to secure qualifications recognized under the said Act, to
prescribe the curriculum for the training of nurses etc., to establish a uniform standard of training
for nurses, midwives etc. The said Act does not vest any competence in the INC to lay down
qualifications binding the employer to adhere to those qualifications. The scheme of INC Act 1947 is
different from the scheme of NCTE Act, 1993 wherein specific powers have been vested in the NCTE
as per Section 12-A of the NCTE Act and under RTE Act, 2009.

30. The interference by the Constitutional Courts in policy matters of the Government, are very well
defined and the limits of judicial review have been clearly delineated. In the case of State of Punjab
v. Ram Lubhaya Bagga, (1998) 4 SCC 117, the Supreme Court held as under :-
"25. Now we revert to the last submission, whether the new State policy is justified in
not reimbursing an employee, his full medical expenses incurred on such treatment,
if incurred in any hospital in India not being a government hospital in Punjab.
Question is whether the new policy which is restricted by the financial constraints of
the State to the rates in AIIMS would be in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution
of India. So far as questioning the validity of governmental policy is concerned in our
view it is not normally within the domain of any court, to weigh the pros and cons of
the policy or to scrutinize it and test the degree of its beneficial or equitable
disposition for the purpose of varying, modifying or annulling it, based on howsoever
sound and good reasoning, except where it is 26 arbitrary or violative of any
constitutional, statutory or any other provision of law. When Government forms its
policy, it is based on a number of circumstances on facts, law including constraints
based on its resources. It is also based on expert opinion. It would be dangerous if
court is asked to test the utility, beneficial effect of the policy or its appraisal based on
facts set out on affidavits. The court would dissuade itself from entering into this
realm which belongs to the executive. It is within this matrix that it is to be seen
whether the new policy violates Article 21 when it restricts reimbursement on
account of its financial constraints."
31. In the case of Directorate of Film Festivals v. Gaurav Ashwin Jain, (2007) 4 SCC 737, it was held
as under:-
"16. The scope of judicial review of governmental policy is now well defined. Courts
do not and cannot act as Appellate Authorities examining the correctness, suitability
and appropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to the executive on matters of
policy which the executive is entitled to formulate. The scope of judicial review when
examining a policy of the Government is to check whether it violates the fundamental
rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to
any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary. Courts cannot interfere with policy
either on the ground that it is erroneous or on the ground that a better, fairer or wiser
alternative is available. Legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the
policy, is the subject of judicial review (vide Asif Hameed v. State of J&K [1989 Supp
(2) SCC 364] , Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Union of India [(1990) 3 SCC 223] , Khoday
Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka [(1996) 10 SCC 304] , BALCO Employees'
Union v. Union of India [(2002) 2 SCC 333] , State of Orissa v. Gopinath Dash
[(2005) 13 SCC 495 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1225] and Akhil Bharat Goseva Sangh (3) v.
State of A.P. [(2006) 4 SCC 162] )"
32. Therefore, this Court upholds as constitutional and valid, the requirement put in place by the
State Government for a candidate to have acquired Class-12th examination from Biology, Physics
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 75
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
and Chemistry as subjects before being considered eligible to be appointed as ANM/FHW under the
State. This Court does not find anything illegal in the justification placed before this Court by the
State that the health centers and hospitals run by Public Health Department deal with emergencies,
high risk pregnancies, premature births requiring critical care etc. for which the ANMs having
background in Biology and other science subjects would be better equipped. Therefore, we do not
find anything ultra-vires the Constititional provisions, or manifestly arbitrary or disproportionate,
in the impugned requirement set in place by the amending notification.
33. Coming to the second issue of ANMs having acquired 24 months training is concerned, it is no
longer in dispute that the INC issued revised guidelines effective from Session 2012-13 by which the
ANM training was enhanced to 24 months. Any college running 18 months ANM course after the
Session 2012-13 has not given valid ANM degree/certificate because no admissions from the
Sessions 2012-13 could be given for 18 months ANM training course. If some illegality has been
perpetuated by the colleges even though they may be Government run colleges in running 18
months ANM course even for the Sessions 2012-13 and onwards, this Court cannot give a stamp of
approval to said illegality and therefore, nothing wrong has been done by the State Government in
amending Rules of 1989 by amendment notification dated 02.02.2019 and putting into place the
requirement of 24 months ANM training as being the requisite eligibility conditions for being
appointed as ANM within the State. The challenge made to the said requirement is also rejected as
the State cannot recognize any qualification as valid qualification which is not the valid ANM course
as per INC guidelines. A course which is not a valid ANM course as per INC guidelines cannot be
recognized by the State as recognized or acceptable for the purpose of giving employment under the
State and therefore, the requirement of having completed 24 months ANM training course is upheld
and challenge made to the same is discarded.
34. So far as the challenge made to the requirement of ANM course having been passed out from
Government institutions only is concerned, it was vehemently argued before this Court that such
requirement is illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional because once a valid degree / certificate is
obtained by the candidates, the State Government cannot distinguish between two sets of certificate
holders i.e. Government college pass-outs and private college pass-outs.
35. Similar provision was made in earlier recruitment of 2017 initiated by the Public Health
Department. The matter travelled to this Court and Single Bench upheld the requirement of
advertisement that only Government institutions students would be eligible for appointment as
ANM. However, in WA No.291/2017 (Gwalior) Radha Purvani Vs. State of M.P. and Ors., vide order
dated 30.06.2017, the Division Bench struck down the said requirement being illegal and also on the
ground that said requirement is not there in the concerned recruitment rules and therefore, could
not have been inserted in the advertisement. However, later on RP No. 755/2018 filed for recalling
the said order was allowed and the said order was recalled, resultingly the writ appeal was restored.
Thereafter the State Government itself modified the requirements and permitted even private
college/institution students and therefore, the appellant lost interest in prosecuting the appeal and
the writ appeal was dismissed for non-compliance of preemptory order and was never restored
thereafter.

Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
36. Vide notification dated 02.02.2019, amendment in the Rules has been carried out inserting the
said requirement and now the said amendment is under challenge before this Court.
37. The learned counsel for the State, as already noted above, has argued that the State Government
has been carrying out a common admission test for admissions in Government institutions running
ANM courses and the said institutions are associated to Government hospitals and therefore, the
students of Government institutions have better training and are better equipped because they have
already got training and have firsthand experience of the work culture and requirements in
Government hospitals which the students of private colleges may not have. It is further brought on
record by the State that since a common admission test is carried out by the State on competitive
basis, therefore, the State is getting better talent or to say the best talent for its colleges which the
private colleges may not be having though they may be having the requisite recognitions and
permissions of the State Government and the Statutory authorities.
38. It is further brought on record by the State that while carrying out admission test for admission
to Government colleges, State has been requiring the students to execute three years bond with the
Government for serving the Government hospitals and also giving a promise to the students that
they would be appointed in Government hospitals upon completion of course. Various
advertisements have been placed on record by the State counsel which are part of written
submissions filed by the State in WP No. 4732/2024.
39. It has been brought on record by the State that since the year 2013 as there is a requirement to
carry out competitive recruitment test on various posts under the State, therefore the State is under
the obligation to conduct a competitive recruitment test and cannot simply give appointment to
Government college students as ANMs in Government hospitals. Therefore, to honour the promise
given to the students, the State has carved out a provision that only Government college students
would be eligible to participate in the recruitment process. Thus, the State has justified the said
requirement from two angles. Firstly, the promise given by the State to the students of Government
colleges /institutions and secondly the students of Government being admitted by competitive
examinations and having first-hand experience of working of Government hospitals by studying in
colleges / institutions associated to Government hospitals, preference to them has been defended.
40. The employer can always look towards such devices as may be required to get best talent for its
establishments. The Government is running hospitals and health centers and if to get best talent it
has stressed on the candidates to have passed out from a particular class of colleges in which
admissions are given on the basis of competitive examinations with stringent standard of
examination, the same cannot be said to be something which is totally arbitrary or irrational.
Though it is true that private colleges have the requisite permissions and affiliations from statutory
bodies and the State Government, but once a college attracts the best of talent by having stringent
requirement of admission to that college, and that if the State has formulated or devised a system or
scheme to appoint those students who belonged to the best of talents and have passed out from
Government colleges, it cannot be said that it is something arbitrary or irrational. The Government
is not giving appointments as ANM/FHW to Government college students without any competitive
examination. Even those pass outs have to appear in the recruitment test which is notified and is in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 77
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
challenge before us. The system put in place by the State Government can be equated with the
system of medical colleges being run by Armed Forces and the students passing out from those
medical colleges being given direct appointments in the hospitals run by the Armed Forces or the
students passing out from the Engineering Colleges run by Railways like Indian Railways Institute
of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Jamalpur admitted through Special Class Railway
Apprentice (SCRA) Examination, being given appointment in the Railways. If the students having
passed out from colleges associated with Government hospitals are being given appointment to the
exclusion of others,only in Government hospitals, in the opinion of this Court it seems to be
something which is having nexus with objective to be achieved. In the case of State of J&K Vs.
Triloki Nath Khosa, reported in 1974 (1) SCC 19, the Constitution Bench of Supreme Court has held
that a discrimination can be valid and a classification can be a valid classification and would not be
unconstitutional if it has some nexus with objective to be achieved. The Constitutional Bench held as
under:-
"32. Judicial scrutiny can therefore extend only to the consideration whether the
classification rests on a reasonable basis and whether it bears nexus with the object in
view. It cannot extend to embarking upon a nice or mathematical evaluation of the
basis of classification, for were such an inquiry permisible it would be open to the
Courts to substitute their own judgment for that of the legislature or the Rule-
making authority on the need to classify or the desirability of achieving a particular
object."
41. A recent seven judges Constitutional Bench in the case of State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh,
(2025) 1 SCC 1, recently affirmed the view taken inT.N. Khosa (supra) with approval and held as
under :-
"88. In Asstt. Station Masters' Assn. [All India Station Masters' & Asstt. Station
Masters' Assn. v. Railways, 1959 SCC OnLine SC 83 :
AIR 1960 SC 384] and Mohd. Shujat Ali [Mohd. Shujat Ali v. Union of India, (1975) 3
SCC 76 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 454] , this Court did not specifically answer the question of
whether there could be sub- classification within an integrated class. That issue arose
for adjudication before this Court in State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa [State of J&K
v. Triloki Nath Khosa, (1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49] . The rules provided that
only Assistant Engineers who possessed a degree or certain other qualifications were
entitled to promotion to the post of Divisional Engineer. However, the pool of
Assistant Engineers consisted of both degree and diploma holding graduates. The
diploma-holders among them challenged the constitutionality of the rule on the
ground that it classified within the class of "Assistant Engineers" based on their
educational qualification, and such a classification within a class was violative of
Article 14. It was argued that if persons recruited from different sources are
integrated into one class, they cannot thereafter be classified to permit preferential
treatment in favour of some of them. This Court upheld the validity of the rule
holding that the classification based on educational qualifications, for the purpose of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 78
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
promotions is not unreasonable. Y.V. Chandrachud, J. (as he then was), writing for
the Bench held that the classification had a reasonable nexus with the objective of
promotions, which was to achieve administrative efficiency in engineering services.
89. It was also submitted that if persons recruited from different sources are integrated into one
class, no further classification can be made within that class. In this case, the direct recruits to the
post of Assistant Engineer were required to hold a degree in civil engineering. However, the
promotees were drawn from the service which was open to both degree and diploma-holders (the
latter did not require a civil engineering degree). Thus, it was argued that a classification based on
educational qualifications is a classification which is based on the source of service. This Court held
that though persons were appointed from various sources such as promotion and direct recruitment,
they came to be integrated into a common class of Assistant Engineers [State of J&K v. Triloki Nath
Khosa, (1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49, (Y.V. Chandrachud, J., SCC p. 40, para 50):"50. We are
therefore of the opinion that though persons appointed directly and by promotion were integrated
into a common class of Assistant Engineers, they could, for purposes of promotion to the cadre of
Executive Engineers, be classified on the basis of educational qualifications. The Rule providing that
graduates shall be eligible for such promotion to the exclusion of diploma-holders does not violate
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution and must be upheld."] . However, despite this integration into
a class, they could be validly classified based on educational qualifications because it was not a
classification based on the source of service.
90. In this context, this Court cautioned that the judgment ought not to be interpreted as a
justification for minute and microcosmic classifications and that the theory of classification could
not be evolved through "imperceptible extensions", diluting the very substance of the equality
guarantee. [Triloki Nath Khosa case, (1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49, (Y.V. Chandrachud, J.,
SCC p. 40, para 51):"51. But we hope that this judgment will not be construed as a charter for
making minute and microcosmic classifications. Excellence is, or ought to be, the goal of all good
governments and excellence and equality are not friendly bed- fellows. A pragmatic approach has
therefore to be adopted in order to harmonise the requirements of public services with the
aspirations of public servants. But let us not evolve, through imperceptible extensions, a theory of
classification which may subvert, perhaps submerge, the precious guarantee of equality. The
eminent spirit of an ideal society is equality and so we must not be left to ask in wonderment : What
after all is the operational residue of equality and equal opportunity?"] Distinguishing the judgment
in Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India [Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India, 1967 SCC OnLine SC
70 : AIR 1967 SC 1889 : (1968) 1 SCR 185] , this Court observed in Triloki Nath [State of J&K v.
Triloki Nath Khosa, (1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49] that the issue in the former was whether
the yardstick for integration (that is, the source of recruitment) could be used as a yardstick for
further integration, which was not the issue in Triloki Nath [State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa,
(1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49] . Thus, Triloki Nath [State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa,
(1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49] is the leading judgment for the proposition that an integrated
class can be further classified if there is intelligible differentia and if the yardstick used has a nexus
to the object of the provision. [ See, State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas, (1976) 2 SCC 310 :
1976 SCC (L&S) 227 (Mathew, J., SCC para 83)]
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 79
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
91. It is not a given that appointees of different sources form an integrated class merely upon their
appointment to one post. Even upon integration, the groups retain their separate identity for other
purposes. In Katyani Dayal v. Union of India [Katyani Dayal v. Union of India, (1980) 3 SCC 245 :
1980 SCC (L&S) 380] , this Court held that the Assistant Officers of the Railways recruited through a
competitive examination and those recruited on the recommendation of the Union Public Service
Commission do not form an integrated homogeneous class because the objects of recruitment, the
tenure and even the appointing authority are different. In A.S. Iyer v. V. Balasubramanyam [A.S.
Iyer v. V. Balasubramanyam, (1980) 1 SCC 634 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 145] , a Constitution Bench of this
Court upheld Survey of promotion rules that reserved 50% more posts for engineers drawn from the
military than for civilian engineers. Krishna Iyer, J., writing for the Bench, observed that the army
engineers never merged into the Survey of India service, along with their civilian counterparts.
92. The judgment of this Court in D.S. Nakara v. Union of India [D.S. Nakara v. Union of India,
(1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145] has dwelt on the issue of sub-classification.
In Nakara [D.S. Nakara case, (1983) 1 SCC 305, para 48 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145] , a scheme which
divided pensioners into two groups based on the date of retirement, to provide pension was
challenged. A Constitution Bench held that pensioners formed a class. Notably, this Court, similar to
Triloki Nath [State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa, (1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49] , did not hold
that sub-classification is impermissible merely because the pensioners constitute a class in
themselves. As opposed to the inherent impermissibility of sub-classification, the particular basis of
classification in that case, namely, the date of retirement, was found to be arbitrary considering the
objective of granting pensions. It was held that if this basis of classification was accepted as valid, it
would create an artificial distinction between two persons who retired within forty-eight hours of
each other. Writing for the Bench, D.A. Desai, J. held that this Court while deciding if
sub-classification is permissible must determine if the class is homogeneous for the purpose of the
law. [D.S. Nakara case, (1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145 (Desai, J., SCC pp. 330-31, para
42):"If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for the purpose of pension
benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a homogeneous class to be divided by
arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of revision and would such classification
be founded on some rational principle?"]
93.Nakara [D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, (1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145] goes a step
further than Triloki Nath [State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa, (1974) 1 SCC 19 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 49]
to state that the scope of sub-classification does not hinge on the yardstick which is used to integrate
groups into a class but on the issue of whether the class is homogeneous or integrated for the
specific objective of the law. When a law integrates a class, such as diploma and degree-holders, it
integrates the class for the purpose of that specific law and not for all purposes. Thus, a class which
is not similarly situated for the purpose of the law can be further classified. The test that the Court
must follow to determine the validity of the sub-classification of a class is as follows:
(a) Whether the class is "homogeneous" or "similarly situated" for the purpose of the
specific law;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 80
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
(b) If the answer to (a) above is in the affirmative, the class cannot be sub-classified;
(c) If the answer to (a) above is in the negative, the class can be sub-classified upon
the fulfilment of the following standard:
(i) There must be a yardstick (or intelligible differentia) further classifying the class;
and
(ii) The yardstick must have a rational nexus with the object of the statute."
42. It is not the case that the State Government has disqualified that all candidates who have passed
out from private colleges would not be eligible for any employment in the State. The State has
restricted employment only within its fold and the students passing out from private nursing
institutions can seek appointment at any other institution or hospital elsewhere in the State but
which is not being run by the State Government. Looking to the nature of duties which ANMs in
Government hospitals like District Hospitals, Community Health Centers, Primary Health Centers
etc., are required to discharge and assist the Doctors dealing with high risk pregnancies and child
births, the said requirement being put in place by the State cannot be said to be something which is
arbitrary, irrational or unconstitutional attracting the wrath of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the
Constitution of India. Therefore, even this requirement is held to be valid, proper and constitutional.
43. Now coming to the question whether the amendment notification has to be read down to include
those who have already acquired qualification prior to amendment notification dated 02.02.2019.
Now we will deal with that aspect. It was argued that even if we uphold the constitutionality of
impugned notification dated 02.02.2019 then it must be read down in the manner that those who
have obtained the qualification prior to issuance of notification should be held qualified. It was
argued that the amendment notification cannot be said to have any retrospective effect and if the
qualifications obtained prior in time are also held invalid then it would amount to be a retrospective
operation of the amendment though it is not made retrospective by the rule making authority.
44. However, this contention was vehemently opposed by learned counsel for the State on the
ground that upto the recruitment carried out in the year 2020 the State has been permitting the
candidates who have obtained qualifications which were earlier valid as per the old guidelines of the
Indian Nursing Council and therefore, now the amendment notification would apply to all future
recruitments even though the qualifications may have been obtained prior in time as per old criteria.
Similar controversy arose when the UGC amended its regulations in the year 2009 and the
exemption from qualifying National Eligibility Test ('NET' for short) was not given to Ph.D. holders
prior to 2009 and was available only to those Ph.D. holders who acquired Ph.D. in accordance with
the 2009 Regulations. Various High Courts interpreted the said regulations differently and some of
the High Courts including this High Court interpreted that those who have already acquired Ph.D.
prior to 2009 are also to be held entitled to exemption from NET examination. However, the matter
ultimately reached the Supreme Court and in the case of P. Suseela v. University Grants
Commission, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 129 it was held that legitimate expectation must yield to
larger public interest. Conflicting judgments of various High Courts were taken into consideration
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 81
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
and it was held that no exemption can be claimed from NET examination by those candidates who
acquired Ph.D. prior to 2009 Regulations and whose Ph.D. is not in accordance with the 2009
Regulations of UGC.
45. To get over the aforesaid judgment in the case of P. Suseela (supra) the UGC brought out
amendment regulations in the year 2016 and the matter was then considered by the Supreme Court
in the case of University of Kerala v. Merlin J.N., reported in (2022) 9 SCC 389 and held that 2016
amendment regulations would have retrospective effect because it is clarificatory in nature and its
objective is to validate the appointments made prior to judgment in the case of P. Suseela (supra).
However, the dispute which arose in the matter of Ph.D. for recruitment of Lecturers in the colleges
was whether pre-2009 Ph.D. holders can claim exemption from NET or not. In the said case even
the old Ph.D. holders could always acquire NET qualification and compete for Lecturership in
colleges. Therefore, old Ph.D. holders still had an option to upgrade their qualification and get the
qualification of NET and then compete for Lecturership. Analogy from that dispute could be drawn
by the State if any bridge course was being run by INC for those students who have passed out ANM
with 18 months course or have got admission in ANM training course with Class-Xth examination.
No bridge course has been setup by the INC till date and therefore, those who have acquired ANM
training of 18 months are disqualified and will always remain disqualified for all times to come
because there is no option for them to now acquire a second ANM certificate with 24 months
training. So far as the issue of having passed Class-12th with Biology is concerned, for those students
who are taking admission in ANM course after 2019 would be having a clear understanding that
they would not be eligible for Government employment. However, those who already took
admission prior to 2019 before the amendment notification came into being, did not have any idea
that they would not be disqualified for Government employment and a disqualification being placed
by the State Government later in time, when it will operate against the pre-2019 admitted students,
would effectively make the notification retrospective. Though it was argued by the State that
appointment or employment is not a vested right and no retrospectivity can be alleged unless a
vested right is taken away. We are alive of this legal position but we are also aware of the position
that though employment is not a vested right but consideration for employment is a vested right and
that right of consideration cannot be taken away by framing a disqualification clause later in point of
time and applying the disqualification clause for those who have already passed out prior in time
and have no option to upgrade themselves. The same would hold true even for the candidates having
passed Class-12th with non-Biology subjects prior to 02.02.2019 because such a requirement was
not there prior to 02.02.2019.
46. Here the doctrine of legitimate expectation can be pressed into service because those students
who have already taken admission as per the old rules and guidelines can be said to be under a
legitimate expectation that they would be considered for employment under the State.
47. If the Rule is read down in the manner suggested by the petitioners, public interest would not be
suffered because the old pass out candidates would have acquired experience by now by working in
private hospitals and many of them are working on contract basis in Government hospitals and have
been gaining experience in the Government hospitals itself. A similar issue came up before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of OCI Card holders who were subjected to withdrawal of certain
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 82
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
privileges, and the Supreme Court while holding that such withdrawal would be applicable only to
prospective holders of OCI cards, in the case of Anushka Rengunthwar v. Union of India, (2023) 11
SCC 209 held as under :-
"52. However, what is necessary to be taken note is that the right which was bestowed
through the Notification dated 11-4-2005 and 5-1-2009 insofar as the educational
parity, including in the matter of appearing for the All India Pre-Medical Test or such
other tests to make them eligible for admission has been completely altered. Though
the notification ex facie may not specify retrospective application, the effect of
superseding the earlier notifications and the proviso introduced to clause 4(ii) would
make the impugned Notification dated 4-3-2021 "retroactive" insofar as taking away
the assured right based on which the petitioners and similarly placed persons have
altered their position and have adjusted the life's trajectory with the hope of
furthering their career in professional education.
53. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners would in that context contend that
since sub-section (2) to Section 7-B of the 1955 Act does not exclude the right under
Article 14 of the Constitution, it is available to be invoked and such discrimination
contemplated in the notification to exclude the OCI card-holders should be struck
down. Article 14 of the Constitution can be invoked and contend discrimination only
when persons similarly placed are treated differently and in that view the OCI
card-holders being a class by themselves cannot claim parity with the Indian citizens,
except for making an attempt to save the limited statutory right bestowed. To that
extent certainly the fairness in the procedure adopted has a nexus with the object for
which change is made and the application of mind by Respondent 1, before issuing
the impugned notification requires examination.
54. As noted, the right of the OCI cardholders is a midway right in the absence of dual
citizenship. When a statutory right was conferred and such right is being withdrawn
through a notification, the process for withdrawal is required to demonstrate that the
action taken is reasonable and has nexus to the purpose. It should not be arbitrary,
without basis and exercise of such power cannot be exercised unmindful of
consequences merely because it is a sovereign power. To examine this aspect, in
addition to the contentions urged by the learned Additional Solicitor General we have
also taken note of the objection statement filed with the writ petition.
55. Though detailed contentions are urged with regard to the status of a citizen and
the sovereign power of the State, as already noted, in these petitions the sovereign
power has not been questioned but the manner in which it is exercised in the present
circumstance is objected. The contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General
is that the intention from the beginning was to grant parity to the OCI cardholders
only with NRIs. On that aspect as already noted above we have seen the nature of the
benefit that had been extended to the petitioners and the similarly placed petitioners
under the notifications of the year 2005, 2007 and 2009. The further contention
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 83
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
insofar as equating the OCI cardholders to compete only for the seats which are
reserved for NRIs and to exclude the OCI cardholders for admission against any seat
reserved exclusively for the Indian citizens, across the board, even to the persons who
were bestowed the right earlier, it is stated that the rationale is to protect the rights of
the Indian citizens in such matters where State may give preference to its citizens
vis-à-vis foreigners holding OCI cards. It is further averred in the counter that
number of seats available for medical and engineering courses in India are very
limited and that it does not fully cater to the requirement of even the Indian citizens.
It is therefore contended that the right to admission to such seats should primarily be
available to the Indian citizens instead of foreigners, including OCI cardholders.
56. Except for the bare statement in the objection statement, there is no material with
regard to the actual exercise undertaken to arrive at a conclusion that the
participation of OCI cardholders in the selection process has denied the opportunity
of professional education to the Indian citizens. There are no details made available
about the consideration made as to, over the years how many OCI cardholders have
succeeded in getting a seat after competing in the selection process by which there
was denial of seats to Indian citizens though they were similar merit-wise. ...
***
62. Therefore it is evident that the object of providing the right in the year 2005 for
issue of OCI cards was in response to the demand for dual citizenship and as such, as
an alternative to dual citizenship which was not recognised, the OCI card benefit was
extended. If in that light, the details of the first petitioner taken note hereinabove is
analysed in that context, though the option of getting Petitioner 1 registered as a
citizen under Section 4 of the 1955 Act by seeking citizenship by descent soon after
her birth or even by registration of the citizenship as provided under Section 5 of the
1955 Act, was available in the instant facts to her parents, when immediately after the
birth of Petitioner 1 the provision for issue of OCI cards was statutorily recognised
and under the notification the right to education was also provided, the need for
parents of Petitioner 1 to make a choice to acquire the citizenship by descent or to
renounce the citizenship of the foreign country and seek registration of the
Citizenship of India did not arise to be made, since as an alternative to dual
citizenship the benefit had been granted and was available to Petitioner 1 and the
entire future was planned on that basis and that situation continued till the year
2021.
63. Further, as on the year 2021 when the impugned notification was issued
Petitioner 1 was just about 18 years i.e. full age and even if at that stage, the petitioner
was to renounce and seek citizenship of India as provided under Section 5(1)(f)(g),
the duration for such process would disentitle her the benefit of the entire education
course from pre-school stage pursued by her in India and the benefit for appearing
for the Pre-Medical Test which was available to her will be erased in one stroke.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 84
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
Neither would she get any special benefit in the country where she was born.
Therefore in that circumstance when there was an assurance from a sovereign State
to persons like that of Petitioner 1 in view of the right provided through the
notification issued under Section 7-B(1) of the 1955 Act and all "things were done" by
such Overseas Citizens of India to take benefit of it and when it was the stage of
maturing into the benefit of competing for the seat, all "such things done" should not
have been undone and nullified with the issue of the impugned notification by
superseding the earlier notifications so as to take away even the benefit that was held
out to them.
64. Therefore, on the face of it the impugned notification not saving such accrued
rights would indicate non-application of mind and arbitrariness in the action.
Further in such circumstance when the stated object was to make available more
seats for the Indian citizens and it is demonstrated that seats have remained vacant,
the object for which such notification was issued even without saving the rights and
excluding the petitioners and similarly placed OCI cardholders with the other
students is to be classified as one without nexus to the object. As taken note earlier
during the course this order, the right which was granted to the OCI cardholders in
parity with the NRIs was to appear for the Pre-Medical Entrance Test along with all
other similar candidates i.e. the Indian citizens. In a situation where it has been
demonstrated that Petitioner 1 being born in the year 2003, has been residing in
India since 2006 and has received her education in India, such student who has
pursued her education by having the same "advantages" and "disadvantages" like that
of any other students who is a citizen of India, the participation in the Pre- Medical
Entrance Test or such other Entrance Examination would be on an even keel and
there is no greater advantage to Petitioner 1 merely because she was born in
California, USA. Therefore, the right which had been conferred and existed had not
affected Indian citizens so as to abruptly deny all such rights. The right was only to
compete. It could have been regulated for the future, if it is the policy of the
Sovereign State. No thought having gone into all these aspects is crystal clear from
the manner in which it has been done.
65. In the above circumstance, keeping in view, the object with which the Act, 1955
was amended so as to provide the benefit to Overseas Citizen of India and in that
context when rights were given to the OCI cardholders through the notifications
issued from time to time, based on which the OCI cardholders had adopted to the
same and had done things so as to position themselves for the future, the right which
had accrued in such process could not have been taken away in the present manner,
which would act as a "retroactive" notification. Therefore, though the notification ex
facie does not specify retrospective operation, since it retroactively destroys the rights
which were available, it is to be ensured that such of those beneficiaries of the right
should not be affected by such notification. Though the rule against retrospective
construction is not applicable to statutes merely because a part of the requisite for its
action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing, in the instant case the rights
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 85
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
were conferred under the notification and such rights are being affected by
subsequent notification, which is detrimental and the same should be avoided to that
extent and be allowed to operate without such retroactivity.
66. We note that it is not retrospective inasmuch as it does not affect the OCI
cardholders who have participated in the selection process, have secured a seat and
are either undergoing or completed the MBBS course or such other professional
course. However, it will act as retroactive action to deny the right to persons who had
such right which is not sustainable to that extent. The goal post is shifted when the
game is about to be over. Hence we are of the view that the retroactive operation
resulting in retrospective consequences should be set aside and such adverse
consequences is to be avoided.
67. Therefore in the factual background of the issue involved, to sum up, it will have
to be held that though the impugned Notification dated 4-3-2021 is based on a policy
and in the exercise of the statutory power of a Sovereign State, the provisions as
contained therein shall apply prospectively only to persons who are born in a foreign
country subsequent to 4-3-2021 i.e. the date of the notification and who seek for a
registration as OCI cardholder from that date since at that juncture the parents would
have a choice to either seek for citizenship by descent or to continue as a foreigner in
the background of the subsisting policy of the Sovereign State.
68. In light of the above, it is held that Respondent 1 in furtherance of the policy of
the Sovereign State has the power to pass appropriate notifications as contemplated
under Section 7-B(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, to confer or alter the rights as
provided for therein. However, when a conferred right is withdrawn, modified or
altered, the process leading thereto should demonstrate application of mind, nexus to
the object of such withdrawal or modification and any such decision should be free of
arbitrariness. In that background, the impugned Notification dated 4-3-2021 though
competent under Section 7-B(1) of Act, 1955 suffers from the vice of non-application
of mind and despite being prospective, is in fact "retroactive" taking away the rights
which were conferred also as a matter of policy of the Sovereign State.
69. Hence, the notification being sustainable prospectively, we hereby declare that
the impugned portion of the notification which provides for supersession of the
notifications dated 11-4-2005, 5-1- 2007 and 5-1-2009 and the clause 4(ii), its
proviso and Explanation (1) thereto shall operate prospectively in respect of OCI
cardholders who have secured the same subsequent to 4-3-2021.
70. We further hold that the petitioners in all these cases and all other similarly
placed OCI cardholders will be entitled to the rights and privileges which had been
conferred on them earlier to the Notification dated 4-3-2021 and could be availed by
them notwithstanding the exclusion carved out in the Notification dated 4-3-2021.
The participation of the petitioners and similarly placed OCI cardholders in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 86
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
selection process and the subsequent action based on the interim orders passed
herein or elsewhere shall stand regularised."
(Emphasis supplied)
48. The said judgment was cited with approval in Pallavi v. Union of India, (2023) 18 SCC 478, in
the following manner :-
"19. It is evident that the ruling held that Notification (dated 4-3- 2021) operated
arbitrarily because firstly it indicated non-
application of mind in not saving accrued rights. The application of proviso to Clause 4(ii) of the
Notification of 4-3-2021 was held to have no nexus with the objects sought to be achieved. The Court
also held that those who are born prior to 2005 and residing in India had received their education in
India and had pursued by having some advantages and disadvantages like other children who are
citizens of India, and could not be denied their right to participate in NEET examinations or such
similar examinations. It was also held that no additional advantage was granted to such class of
people merely because they were born abroad and importantly, the Court took note of the
amendment which introduced concession to OCI cardholders.
20. Therefore, the Court concluded that when the right conferred was withdrawn and altered, in the
process leading to such change, should demonstrate application of mind, nexus to the object of such
withdrawal or modification and any such decision had to be free of arbitrariness. In the light of this
conclusion, the Court held that the notification saved from the vice of non-application of mind and
was in fact retroactive. It was in these circumstances that the Court held that only those persons who
obtained OCI cards after 4-3-2021 were rendered ineligible in terms of the notification.
21. In the present case, although the OCI card relied upon by the petitioner on 4-8-2022, the fact
that she was in fact issued the OCI registration card first, on 2-11-2015. In such circumstances, the
petitioner's eligibility to claim the benefit of OCI cardholder in terms of the ruling in Anushka
[Anushka Rengunthwar v. Union of India, (2023) 11 SCC 209] is undeniable. The rejection of her
candidature at this stage i.e. on 19-6-2023 is not supportable in law. She is consequently directed to
be considered in remaining counselling rounds by AIIMS and all participating institutions for PG
Medical seats. It is clarified that the consideration would be regarding seats that are unfilled on the
date of this judgment whether reserved for SC/ST/OBC or other categories and such as specially
earmarked for Bhutanese candidates, etc. if they can be filled by other candidates, like her.
Furthermore, this facility should be open to the petitioner as well as other candidates based upon
the available records of those issued OCI cards prior to 4-3-2021 and who can participate in such
counselling having regard to their performance in the NEET test, and their ranking."
49. It is also relevant to note here that even the NCTE which has been coming out with repeated
amendment regulations in the matter of teachers' qualification from time to time has recognized the
position that those who have obtained qualifications prior to amendment in regulations cannot be
held to be disqualified and therefore, in the revised regulations of NCTE, provision is made that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 87
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
those who have obtained qualifications prior to a particular date i.e. at the time of enforcement of
some prior regulations having different requisite qualifications shall be treated to have been
possessing requisite qualification. The purpose is only to keep the candidates who took admission in
the courses which were valid at a particular point of time to be kept eligible for consideration to be
employed and to avoid retrospective operation of such requirements.
50. Drawing analogy with what is the situation in teachers recruitment, after the Notification dated
31.03.2010, the NCTE initially came out with notification dated 23.08.2010 laying down the
minimum qualifications for appointment as Teachers. In the said Notification dated 23.08.2023, the
qualifications for appointment of Teachers were laid down. However, it did not lay down any
qualification for Teachers to teach Classes 9th to 12th. Thereafter, the NCTE issued Notification
dated 29.07.2011 amending the Notification dated 23.08.2010. By this amendment dated
29.07.2011 qualifications were not laid down for Teachers to teach Classes 9th to 12th. Thereafter,
the NCTE framed Regulations in 2014 notified on 12.11.2014 known as NCTE (Determination of
Minimum Qualifications for persons to be recruited as Education Teachers and Physical Education
Teachers in Pre-Primary, Primary, Upper Primary, Secondary, Senior Secondary or Intermediate
Schools or Colleges) Regulations, 2014.
51. These regulations were framed after insertion of Section 12-A in NCTE Act, 1993. For the first
time, the NCTE laid down qualifications for Secondary Classes (Classes 9th and 10th) and Senior
Secondary (Classes 11th and 12th) and these regulations contained the qualification of
Graduates/PG Degree with at least 50% marks with B.Ed. or its equivalent. 45% marks are required
at Graduation/PG level with B.Ed. for Teachers, who had acquired qualifications in accordance with
the earlier Regulations, 2002 and 2007 notified on 13.11.2022 and 10.12.2007 respectively.
52. For Classes 11th and 12th qualification of PG Degree with 50% marks and B.Ed. Degree is laid
down, but again there is a relaxation for those candidates, who have acquired qualifications earlier
when the earlier regulations were in force, i.e. Regulations of 2002 and 2007.
53. Therefore, while upholding the validity of the notification dated 02.2.2019, we hold that the said
notification dated 02.02.2019 has to be read down to avoid retroactivity, so as not to operate against
those candidates who had obtained the qualifications prior to the date of notification or prior to the
rules being amended or guidelines being issued by the INC. Therefore, while rejecting the challenge
to the notification dated 02.02.2019 and holding the same to be constitutionally valid and intra
vires, we issue following directions:-
(a) The candidates having obtained admission in ANM course/training after passing
Class-10th qualification and admitted prior to Session 2012-13 in ANM course would
be eligible to apply for the selection test. However, those candidates who have been
admitted in any college from the Session 2012-13 and thereafter would not be
deemed eligible if they have obtained admission in ANM course with Class-
10thqualification.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156309192/ 88
Ranjna Hansraj vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 April, 2025
(b) Those candidates who have acquired ANM training and were admitted prior to
Session 2012-2013 and have completed ANM training of 18 months would be held
eligible to apply in the selection test, however, those candidates who have been
admitted in any college from the Session 2012-13 and thereafter would not be
deemed eligible if they have obtained 18 months ANM training in place of 24 months.
(c) So far as the requirement of having passed Class-12th with Physics, Chemistry and
Biology and having passed out from Govt. of M.P. run college is concerned, all those
candidates who have been admitted in any nursing institution upto the Session
2018-19 would be entitled for the selection in question even if they have obtained
Class-12th qualification from subjects other than Physics, Chemistry and Biology and
have taken admission in a college not run by the Govt. of M.P. However for the
students admitted in the Session 2019-20 onwards the said dis-
qualifications would apply to them with full force.
54. In view of the aforesaid, these petitions are disposed of.
