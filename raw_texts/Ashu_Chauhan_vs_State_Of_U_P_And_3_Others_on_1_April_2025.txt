4. It transpires from record that after the statement of accused-applicant was recorded in terms of
Section 313 Cr.P.C., an application dated 22.01.2025 (purported to under Section 315 Cr.P.C.) was
filed on behalf of accused-applicant with the prayer that certain witnesses are sought to be adduced
on his behalf in proof of his innocence. It was thus prayed by means of this application that the
witnesses mentioned in the application be summoned for doing justice to the accused-applicant.
Aforementioned application was opposed by the prosecution. However, Court below, upon
evaluation and examination of the prayer made in above-mentioned application in the light of the
facts and circumstances on the record and also the attending circumstances, came to the conclusion
that the said application is liable to be partly allowed. It, accordingly, vide order dated 22.01.2025,
partly allowed the said application.
5. Thus feeling aggrieved by above order dated 22.011.2025, in so far as, it negates the prayer made
by the applicant in the application dated 22.01.2025, accused-applicant has now approached this
Court by means of present application under Section 528 BNSS.
6. Mr. R.P. Dwivedi, the learned counsel for accused-applicant contends that the order impugned in
this application is manifestly illegal and in excess of jurisdiction. As such, the same is liable to be set
aside by this Court. Court, while exercising jurisdiction in terms of Section 315 Cr.P.C. cannot sit in
appeal over the merits or demerits of the documentary evidence or the oral evidence sought to get

summoned by an accused in support of his innocence. On the above conspectus, he, therefore,
contends that Court below has erred in law in partly rejecting the application aforementioned filed
by accused-applicant.
7. In furtherance of aforesaid submission, the learned counsel for applicant has then taken the Court
to the document occurring at page 128 of the paper book, which is the photo copy of the extract of
the birth and death register and with reference to above, he submits that date of birth of the
prosecutrix recorded in aforesaid register is 10.10.2005. He has then taken the Court to the
document occurring at page 124 of the paper book, to show that the record, which is received from
the hospital is destroyed after expiry of a period of 7 years. Since the prosecutrix was born out of a
cesarean operation conducted upon her mother, therefore, the relevancy of the statement of the
Doctor i.e. Dr. Neelam Singh, who had operated the mother of the prosecutrix, becomes relevant.
However, Court below without considering the aforesaid aspect of the matter has negated the prayer
of accused-applicant to summon Dr. Neelam Singh, which is wholly illegal. It is thus urged by the
learned counsel for applicant that the present application is liable to be allowed.
8. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. representing State-opposite party-1 and Mr. P.K. Singh, the learned
counsel representing first informant-opposite party-2 have vehemently opposed the present
application. They submit that the birth and death register is a public document. The procedure for
proving a public document is to file the certified copy of the extract or copy of said document and
further produce the witness from the office from where the said document was issued. In case, the
said burden is discharged by applicant then the burden shall shift upon the prosecution to dislodge
the entry occurring in the birth and death register. In view of above, there is no relevancy of the
statement of Doctor, who had conducted cesarean operation upon the mother of prosecutrix. On the
above premise, they, therefore, submit that no illegality or infirmity has been committed by Court
below in passing the order impugned.
9. Having heard Mr. R.P. Dwivedi, the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for
State-opposite party-1, Mr. P.K. Singh, the learned counsel representing first informant-opposite
party-2 and upon perusal of record, this Court finds that in view of the law laid down by Apex Court
in the case of Jarnail Singh Vs. State of Haryana, (2013) 7 SCC 263, the age of the victim has to be
determined with reference to the provisions contained in Section 94 of the Juvenile Justice (Care
and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Therefore, while deciding the age of the prosecutrix in the
light of aforementioned provisions, the Court shall also be guided by the principles relating to proof
of public documents as provided in Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act. As such, it is the entry
occurring in the birth and death register, which alone is required to be proved and and not the fact
that PW-1 is the mother of the prosecutrix. In view of above, this Court does not find any infirmity to
the order impugned.
10. As a result, the present application fails and is liable to be dismissed.
11. It is, accordingly, dismissed.
