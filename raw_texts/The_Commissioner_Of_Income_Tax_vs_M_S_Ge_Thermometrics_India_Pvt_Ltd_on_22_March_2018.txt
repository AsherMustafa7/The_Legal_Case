THIS ITA IS FILED U/S.260A OF I.T. ACT, 1961,
PRAYING THAT THIS HON'BLE COURT MAY BE PLEASED TO:
(i) FORMULATE THE SUBSTANTIAL QUESTIONS OF LAW
STATED THEREIN; (ii) ALLOW THE APPEAL AND SET ASIDE
THE ORDERS PASSED BY THE ITAT, BANGALORE, IN ITA
NO.97/BANG/2008, DATED 08-4-2009 AND CONFIRM THE
ORDER PASSED BY THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF
INCOME TAX, CIRCLE-11(3), BANGALORE.
THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR HEARING THIS DAY,
B.S.PATIL J, DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:-
JUDGMENT
1. This appeal is filed by the Revenue under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short 'the
Act') aggrieved by order passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in I.T.A.No. 97(Bang)/2008
dated 08.04.2009.
2. Issue raised before the Tribunal was; whether the assessee was entitled to the benefit of deduction
under Section 10B of the Act. The Tribunal has found that the assessee's claim for such deduction
was well founded as the provisions contained under Section 10B(9) were no more in existence in the
statute book and therefore, if deduction had been claimed for the assessment year 2005- 06 the
assessee was entitled for the same.
3. It is contended for the revenue that Tribunal committed an error in holding that in view of
omission of sub-section 9 of Section 10B of the Act with effect from 01.04.2004, it had to be
construed that the said section never existed in the statute book, and therefore, benefit claimed by
the assessee under Section 10B should be allowed.
4. During the course of arguments, learned counsel for both parties bring to our notice the judgment
of this Court rendered in I.T.A.NO.876/2008 C/W I.T.A.NO.877/2008 ON 25.11.2014 in the case of
COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX AND ANOTHER vs. M/S. GE THERMOMETRICS INDIA (P)
LIMITED and submit that this Court having considered a similar question has in similar
circumstances, affirmed the order passed by the Tribunal.
5. Perusal of the aforesaid judgment makes it clear that this Court, after considering the substantial
question of law raised with regard to the correctness of the view taken by the Tribunal to the effect
that in view of the omission of sub-Section (9) in Section 10B with effect from 01.04.2004 should it
be understood that the said section never existed in the statute book and therefore, the benefit
claimed by the assessee under Section 10B should be allowed, has held in paragraph 8 after referring
to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of KOLHAPUR CANESUGAR WORKS LTD., vs.
UNION OF INDIA - AIR 2000 SC 811 as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146837596/ 2
The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S Ge Thermometrics India Pvt.Ltd., on 22 March, 2018
"Admittedly, in the instant case, there is no saving clause or provision introduced by
way of an amendment while omitting sub-section (9) of Section 10B. Therefore, once
the aforesaid section is omitted from the statute book, the result is it had never been
passed and be considered as a law that never exists and therefore, when the
assessment orders were passed in 2006, the Assessing Officer was not justified in
taking note of a provision which was not in the statute book and denying benefit to
the assessee. The whole object of such omission is to extend the benefit under Section
10B of the Act irrespective of the fact whether during the period to which they are
entitled to the benefit, the ownership continues with the original assessee or it is
transferred to another person. Benefit is to the undertaking and not to the person
who is running the business. We do not see any merit in these appeals. The
substantial question of law is answered in favour of the assessee and against the
revenue. Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed".
6. As the aforesaid judgment is applicable in all force to the facts and circumstances of the present
case, following the said judgment, this appeal is also dismissed.
