BEFORE
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.V. MURALIDARAN

(CAV)
[1] Heard Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel for the

respondents/contemnors.
[2] This contempt case has been filed by the petitioner alleging
non-compliance of the order dated 28.10.2021 passed in W.P.(C) No.761 of 2021.
[3] By the order dated 28.10.2021, this Court passed the following order in the writ petition:
"4. Therefore, without going into the merits and demerits of the petitioner's case, I
am inclined to pass the following orders:-

(a) This writ petition is disposed.

Ch. Nalini Sunita Devi vs Shri Mangsatabam Harekrishna on 17 August, 2022
(b) The petitioner is directed to send the representation to
both the respondents within a period of 2 (two) weeks from the date of receipt of copy
of this order.
(c) On receipt of the said representation within the stipulated period of time fixed by
this Court, the respondent Nos.1 and 2 are directed to consider and pass appropriate
speaking order by giving personal opportunity to the petitioner within a period of 3
(three) months thereafter.
5. With the above observations and directions, this writ petition is disposed of."
[4] During the course arguments, the learned Government Advocate, by placing reliance upon the
order dated 25.4.2002 passed by the Director of Education (S), submitted that the order of this
Court dated 28.10.2021 has been duly complied with and therefore, the contempt petition may be
closed.
[5] Alleging non-compliance of the order of this Court dated 28.10.2021, the learned senior counsel
for the petitioner submitted that the order dated 25.4.2002 is not in tune with the prayer made by
the petitioner in the writ petition as well as the representation made by the petitioner Contempt case
No.38 of 2022 Page 3 pursuant to the direction of this Court dated 28.10.2021. thus, the
respondents disobeyed the order of this Court. Thus, they are to be punished under the Contempt of
Courts Act, 1971.
[6] As stated supra, by the order dated 28.10.2021, this Court directed the petitioner to submit a
representation to the respondents within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of
the order. Accordingly, the petitioner has also submitted his representation on 10.11.2021. The
petitioner also sent a legal notice dated 19.11.2021 praying the same relief as prayed in the
representation dated 10.11.2021. Upon receipt of the representation as well as the legal notice dated
19.11.2021 and pending contempt case, the Director of Education (S) has passed an order dated
25.04.2022. In paragraph 6, it has been stated as under:
"6. In view of the facts and circumstances stated above, it has been arrived to the
conclusion as ordered herein that the prayer of the Petitioner for payment of
pensionary benefits and other retiral benefits has already been considered as
necessary pension papers/relevant documents in respect of the petitioner has already
been submitted to the Under Secretary 9Pension Cell), Government of Manipur vide
letter Contempt case No.38 of 2022 Page 4 No.2/181/2009-ED(S/V) Pension dated
the 28th March, 2002."
[7] If the petitioner has any grievance over the aforesaid order dated 25.04.2022, he has to challenge
the same in the manner known to law and cannot contend that the respondent authorities have
wilfully disobeyed the order of this Court dated 28.10.2021. [8] It is settled law that a Court
exercising contempt jurisdiction cannot enlarge the scope of the relief claimed and the direction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179345424/ 3
Ch. Nalini Sunita Devi vs Shri Mangsatabam Harekrishna on 17 August, 2022
given in the main proceedings. As stated supra, though the prayer in the writ petition is to direct the
respondent authorities to release/pay/payment of the pensionary benefits and other entitled retiral
benefits of the petitioner without causing any undue delay, while hearing the writ petition, the
learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that before approaching this Court, the
petitioner has not submitted any representation and therefore, it is suffice if the Court direct the
petitioner to submit a representation and upon receipt of the same, direct the respondents to
consider the same and pass orders. It appears that the aforesaid direction has been duly complied
with by issuing the order dated 25.4.2022 pending contempt case. The Contempt case No.38 of
2022 Page 5 correctness of the order dated 25.04.2022 cannot be gone into in this contempt
petition.
[9] The Court exercising contempt jurisdiction is primarily concerned with the question of
contumacious conduct of the party who is alleged to have committed default in complying with the
directions in the judgment and order. If there was no ambiguity or indefiniteness in the order, it is
for the party concerned to approach the higher Court if according to him the same is not legally
tenable. Such a question has necessarily to be agitated before the higher Court. The Court exercising
contempt jurisdiction cannot take upon itself power to decide the original proceedings in a manner
not dealt with by the Court passing the judgment or order. Right or wrong the order has to be
obeyed. Flouting an order of the Court would render the party liable for contempt. While dealing
with an application for contempt, the Court cannot traverse beyond the order, non-compliance of
which is alleged. In other words, it cannot say what should not have been done or what should have
been done. It cannot traverse beyond the order. It cannot test the correctness or otherwise of the
order or give additional directions or delete any direction. That would be exercising review
Contempt case No.38 of 2022 Page 6 jurisdiction while dealing with petition for initiating of
contempt proceedings. The same would be impermissible and indefensible.
[10] In the light of the aforesaid, this Court is of the view that pending contempt petition due
compliance of the order dated 28.10.2021 passed in the W.P.No.(C) No.761 of 2021 has been made
and this Court cannot enlarge the scope exercising contempt jurisdiction.
[11] In the result,
(a) the contempt case is closed by giving liberty to the
petitioner to challenge the order dated 25.04.2022 in the manner known to law if the petitioner is
aggrieved.
(b) No costs.
