indicated from 01.01.2020 to 31.12.2023, but the FIR has been lodged on 07.11.2024 without

exploitation, rape, unnatural rape, relating to monetary transaction as well as exerting force for
conversion. There is one more allegation which has been levelled against the applicant that the
present applicant has concealed his religion and introduced himself as Hindu, but as soon as the
prosecutrix came to know about his religion, he forced her to convert. So as to explain the delay in
lodging the FIR, the prosecution story says that the prosecutrix was under the captivity of the
present applicant and he did not permit her to go anywhere without the company of another
co-accused, Nadiya.

anticipatory bail application was rejected vide order dated 18.01.2021 (Annexure No. 4), therefore,

the applicant, when such joint anticipatory bail application was filed in the month of January 2021.
6. The present applicant and the prosecutrix both are married persons. The relation of the
prosecutrix with her husband, namely, Rakesh Bhardwaj was not cordial therefore, she lodged an
FIR against her husband and her husband filed anticipatory bail application before the court of
Sessions, At Dindoshi (Borivali Division), Goregaon, Mumbai and he has been granted anticipatory
bail vide order dated 21.07.2022 (Annexure No. 9). Thereafter, the prosecutrix filed a First

Further, he shall abide by all terms and condition of the bail order.
9. Sri Arun Verma learned AGA has opposed the aforesaid bail application by submitting that
serious charges have been levelled against the present applicant and the prosecution is having
material/evidence to establish that the present applicant has committed the aforesaid offence,
though he tried to explain the delay but could not explain properly. Further, only on the basis of
delay in lodging FIR, the present applicant may not be absolved from the charges. Sri Verma has
also submitted that the present applicant is a resident of Mumbai, so if he is released on bail, there is
likelihood of him not cooperating in the trial proceedings properly, therefore, this aspect may also
be considered.
10. Sri Manish Vaish learned counsel for the informant has also opposed the aforesaid bail
application by submitting that since the present applicant was threatening the prosecutrix for dire
consequences, if she lodges FIR against him, therefore, she could not lodge FIR promptly. He has
also submitted that all the allegations which has been levelled in the FIR are absolutely true and the
present applicant has committed all the offence for which the FIR has been lodged and chargesheet
has been filed.
11. On being confronted as to why the FIR has been lodged at Lucknow when the prosecutrix lodged
FIR against her husband on 26.08.2022, Sri Manish Vaish has submitted that at that point of time,
the prosecutrix was forced by the applicant to lodge FIR only against her husband and not against
the applicant and under threat of life, she could not lodge FIR against the present applicant at that
point of time, though the circumstances are now beyond the control, therefore, she lodged the FIR
on 07.11.2024.
12. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the material available on
record, without entering into the merits of the issue, considering the fact that there is inordinate
delay in lodging the FIR, one joint anticipatory bail application was filed by the present applicant
and the prosecutrix at Mumbai, she lodged one FIR against her husband at Lucknow in the year
2022, but no FIR has been lodged against the present applicant, though the alleged incident in
question had already taken place from 01.01.2020, the charge-sheet has been filed and undertaking
of the applicant that he shall cooperate in the trial proceedings and shall not misuse the liberty of
bail, I find it appropriate to release the applicant on bail.
13. The bail application is allowed.
14. Let the applicant-Isaa Mohammad Hussain Diwan, be released on bail in the aforesaid case
