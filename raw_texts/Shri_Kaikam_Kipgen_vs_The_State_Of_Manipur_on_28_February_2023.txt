detention. It is stated that the detenu was not produced before the State

[4] The detenu submitted 2 (two) representations all dated
02.09.2022 through the Superintendent of Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa to the
Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur and to the State Advisory
Board for revoking the detention order dated 02.09.2022. It is stated that he

representation and forward the same to the Chief Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, as well as the Deputy Secretary (PIT-ND & PS),
Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Government of India, New Delhi
for their considerations. It is stated that the detenu has no information
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 3
whether the said representation was forwarded to the Chief Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur and to the Deputy Secretary (PIT-ND & PS),
Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Government of India. It is stated
that till date, the representations were kept pending and not disposed of and
thus violated the provisions of Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India. It is
stated that the ground of detention relied in the 2nd detention order was the
same which was relied in the earlier detention order dated 02.09.2022. It is
stated that the respondent No. 1 violated Section 9(f) of the Act inasmuch as
he failed to make the confirmation order even after the lapsed of about 13
weeks. The detention order was challenged on the following grounds:
(a) The impugned detention order dated 02.09.2022 and
16.12.2022 were passed mechanically and without
application of judicious mind;
(b) There was no cogent materials to show that the detenu was
involved in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances;
(c) The respondent No. 2 failed to comply Section 3(2) and
Section 9(b) of PIT-ND & PS Act and the respondent No. 1
failed to comply Section 9(f) of PIT-ND & PS Act;
(d) The respondent Nos. 1, 2 & 3 failed to consider and dispose
of the representations dated 10.10.2022;
(e) There is no inordinate delay on the part of the respondent
No. 2 while forwarding the representation to the respondent
Nos. 1 & 3;
(f) The allegations made in the detention order are vague and
not sufficient enough to warrant preventive detention.
[6] The respondent No. 2 has filed counter affidavit on behalf of the
State Government. It is stated that the 1st detention order dated 02.09.2022
was revoked by order dated 15.12.2022 and as per record, the process for

WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 4
revocation was started on 07.12.2022, by then, stipulated timeline of 5 weeks
as provided under Section 9 (b). It is stated that the revocation order was
done on technical ground after seeking advice of the Ld. Advocate General,
Manipur and obtaining due approval by the then detaining authority as
corrective measure. Since, no reference was made within 5 weeks as provided
under Section 9(b) of PIT-ND & PS Act to the Advisory Board. The 1st
detention order was revoked and the 2nd detention order dated 16.12.2022
was passed. It is stated that Section 12(2) of PIT-ND & PS Act provide
revocation of the detention order under Section 12(1) does not bar detention
of the same person. It is stated that the detention orders dated 02.09.2022
and 16.12.2022 are independent and the second detention order is not
consequential order to the first. It is also stated that the detenu is a hardened
drug peddler who buys, transports, stores and sells onward opium and is a
member of dedicated drug trafficker network across the state. At the time of
detention, there was possibility of him release on bail. It is also stated that the
representation dated 10.10.2022 submitted by the detenu was received on
12.10.2022 and para-wise comment was sought from DGP vide letter dated
19.10.2022 and the para-wise comment was received on 07.12.2022, by then,
the whole process for revocation. Para-wise comment was not received till
07.12.2022 when the process of revocation of the 1st detention order dated
02.09.2022 was started. As para-wise comment from the police was not
received, the representation dated 10.10.2022 could not be disposed of by
then. Further, representation was not referred to the Government of India and
the representation dated 10.10.2022 was not forwarded to the Government of
India. It is stated that that on 06.12.2022, the accused could not be released
from jail even after granting of default bail as no revocation order was
received from the Government for his detention. It is stated that the detenu
was not released from jail as revocation order dated 15.12.2022 was received
on 17.12.2022 and the detention order under NIT-ND & PS was also received
on the same day. The 2nd detention order dated 16.12.2022 was also received
on the same day. It is stated that there is no need for confirmation of the
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 5
revoked 1st detention order dated 02.09.2022. It is stated that the
representation with respect to the 1st detention order dated 02.09.2022 does
not survive as the same was revoked. It is stated in para 11 of the reply filed
by the State Government that the detenu filed the 2nd representation dated
30.12.2022 against the detention order dated 16.12.2022 forwarded by the
Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, vide letter dated 02.01.2023, the

also within the stipulated 5 weeks' as provided under Section 9(b) of PIT-ND
& PS Act. It is stated that there is no violation of Section 3(2) and 9(b) of PIT-
ND & PS Act. It is stated that the writ petition may be dismissed being devoid
of merit. The Central Government did not file any reply as the representation
was not forwarded to it.
[8] Heard Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.
Th. Vashum, learned PP for the State respondent Nos. 1 & 2 and Mr. Boboy
Potsangbam, learned CGC for the respondent No. 3, Union of India.
[9] Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the petitioner, draws the
attention of this Court that the 1st detention order dated 02.09.2022 was valid
only for 3 months until further orders as there was no order extending the
same. The 1st detention order expired on 01.12.2022 vide order dated
15.12.2022 passed by the Commissioner (Home), Government of Manipur and
it was revoked after 13 days' of its lapse. He submits that the revocation order
is illegal and any revocation of a lapsed order has no meanig. He refers to the
provision of Section 11 of the PIT-ND & PS Act where maximum period of
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 6
detention is one year. However, the detaining authority may revoke or
modified the detention within the validity. He further submits that the 1st
detention order is illegal and without considering the relevant materials. The
revocation order dated 15.12.2022 was also illegal as the same was done
after 13 days of lapse of the 1st detention order and hence, the detaining
authority cannot exercise the power confer under Section 12 of the PIT-ND &
PS Act for revocation of lapsed order. It is further submitted that the 2 nd
detention order dated 16.12.2022 is also illegal because there is no new facts
and it was issued on the same ground as the 1st detention order.
Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel, relies on the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. Paul
Manickam and Anr. reported in (2003) 8 SCC 342, at para 16 where it
was held that meticulous compliance of the procedural safeguard provided in
a preventive detention, however, technical, is mandatory. It is reproduced
herein below:
"16. In a case of preventive detention no offence is
proved, nor is any charge formulated and the justification
of such detention is suspicion or reasonability and there is
no criminal conviction which can only be warranted by
legal evidence. Preventive justice requires an action
to be taken to prevent apprehended objectionable
activities. (See R. v. Halliday and Kubic Darusz v.
Union of India). But at the same time, a person's
greatest of human freedoms i.e. personal liberty is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22066412/ 5
Shri Kaikam Kipgen vs The State Of Manipur on 28 February, 2023
deprived, and, therefore, the laws of preventive
detention are strictly construed, and a meticulous
compliance with the procedural safeguard,
however technical, is mandatory. The compulsions of
the primordial need to maintain order in society, without
which enjoyment of all rights, including the right of
personal liberty would lose all their meanings, are the
true justifications for the laws of preventive detention.
This jurisdiction has been described as a "jurisdiction of
suspicion", and the compulsions to preserve the values of
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 7
freedom of a democratic society and social order
sometimes merit the curtailment of the individual liberty.
(See Ayya v. State of U.P.). To lose our country by a
scrupulous adherence to the written law, said Thomas
Jefferson, would be to lose the law, absurdly sacrificing
the end to the means. No law is an end in itself and the
curtailment of liberty for reasons of the State's security
and national economic discipline as a necessary evil has
to be administered under strict constitutional restrictions.
No carte blanche is given to any organ of the State to be
the sole arbiter in such matters."
Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel, also refers to another
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of Abdul Basit Alias
Raju & Ors. v. Mohd. Abdul Kadir Chaudhary & Anr. reported in (2014)
10 SCC 754 at para 25 where it was held that what cannot be done
directly, cannot be done indirectly. He also refers to another judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Banka Sneha Shella v. State of
Telangana & Ors. reported in (2021) 9 SCC 415, at para 20, 21, 23, 24,
26 and 30 where it was held that the Hon'ble Supreme court has laid down
the principle while interpreting the law of preventive detention and it
requires strict construction as it affects the right and liberty of a person who
has been detained without any fair trial. It was also held that preventive
detention is an exception to general law and taking recourse to the
provisions of preventive detention is contrary to the constitution guaranteed
enshrined under Article 19 and 21 of the Constitution and sufficient
grounds have to be made out by detaining authorities to invoke such
provisions. The same has to be resorted if the detenu cannot be effectively
dealt with by normal criminal procedure.
Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel, submits that there was
an illegal detention from 02.12.2022 to 15.12.2022 of the detenu after the
lapsed of the 1st detention order till the 2nd detention order was made and
as such, he prayed for awarding adequate compensation to the detenu for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22066412/ 6
Shri Kaikam Kipgen vs The State Of Manipur on 28 February, 2023
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 8
his illegal detention for the period from 02.12.2022 to 15.12.2022 even
though the petitioner has not made any specific prayer. He submits that
this prayer can be considered and moulded by this Court with respect to
prayers (ii) & (iii) of the writ petition where the petitioner prayed for passing
any other necessary order in the facts and circumstances of the case and
for award of the cost of petition. It is prayed that the 1st detention order
dated 02.09.2022 passed by the Special Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur and the 2nd detention order dated 16.12.2022 be set aside as
there were no materials to detain the detenu under preventive detention
and the representations have not been disposed of by the State and
Central Authorities on time.
[10] Mr. Th. Vashum, learned PP for the State respondents,
submits that the 1st detention order was made on the basis of police report
and it was valid only for 3 months until further orders as there was technical
defect of not forwarding the detention order to the State Advisory Board.
The State Authority after taking opinion of the Ld. Advocate General and in
exercise of power under Section 11 & 12 of PIT-ND & PS Act revoked the
1st detention order on 15.12.2022 and issued another 2 nd detention order
dated 16.12.2022 as the case of the detenu would be not able to be dealt
with by normal criminal procedure. He stated that the 2nd detention order
dated 16.12.2022 is valid as such order can be passed under Section 12(2)
of PIT-ND & PS Act. He also refers to the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. Paul Manickam and Anr.
reported in (2003) 8 SCC 342, at para 7, where it was that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court had explained the object beyond the preventive detention and
he points out that preventive detention resorted to when the executive is
convinced on the materials available and placed before it that such detention
is necessary in order to prevent the person detained from acting in a matter
prejudicial to certain objects which are specified by law. The action of the
executive in detaining a person being only precautionary, the matter has
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 9
necessarily to be left to the discretion of the executive authority. He submits
that when the 1st detention order is revoked, the representation against it
does not survive and there is no need for formal order of disposal or
confirmation of the same. It is stated that the 2nd representation dated
30.12.2022 against the 2nd detention order dated 16.12.2022 was duly
disposed of on 13.01.2023. Hence, there is no delay on the part of the State
Government. He prays that the writ petition may be dismissed as being devoid
of merit.
[11] Mr. Boboy Potsangbam, learned CGC for the Central
Government, submits that the representations were not forwarded to the
Central Government by the State Authority and the same cannot be
processed. However, the Union of India has not filed any counter affidavit and
the learned CGC has no specific instruction in this regard.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22066412/ 7
Shri Kaikam Kipgen vs The State Of Manipur on 28 February, 2023
[12] The 1st detention order dated 02.09.2022 was valid only for 3
months and on its expiry, there was no order for extension of the same nor
no confirmation order was issued prior to 02.12.2022. However, vide order
dated 15.12.2022, the State Government revoked the detention order without
assigning any specific reason and the 2nd detention order dated 16.12.2022
was issued. But in the counter affidavit filed by the State Authority, it is stated
that the 1st detention order was revoked due to technicalities. From the period
02.12.2022 to 15.12.2022, there was no order from the State Authority to
keep the detenu under detention. So, in another word, the detenu was under
illegal detention for the period from 02.12.2022 to 15.12.2022 and the State
Authority has not given any justification in this regard. It is the specific case of
the detenu that he was under illegal detention for 13 days.
[13] In the case of Ujjal Mandal v. State of W.B. reported in
(1972) 1 SCC 456, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the detention order
is valid only for three months as mandated under Article 22(4) of the
Constitution and unless it is confirmed before the expiry of three months,
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 10
further detention would be without any authority of law. The relevant paras.
are reproduced below:
"8. Article 22(4) of the Constitution has specified the maximum
limit of initial detention, and detention for a longer period than
three months can only be made on the basis of the report of the
Board. The Act authorises a possible detention of more than
three months. It is because the appropriate Government wants
to detain a person for more than three months that the matter is
referred to the Board and it is only when the Board makes its
report that the appropriate Government can fix the period of
detention under sub-section (1) of Section 12. So, when the
Government receives the report of the Board stating that there
is sufficient cause for detention of a person, if the Government
wants to detain him for a period beyond three months, it has to
pass an order or make a decision under Section 12(1) to confirm
the order of detention. The confirmation of the detention order
without anything more would result in an automatic continuation
of the detention, even if there is no separate decision to
continue the detention for any specific period as held by this
Court in Dattatreya Moreshwar Pangarkar v. State of Bombay.
When Section 12(1) of the Act speaks of "and continue the
detention of the person concerned for such period as it thinks
fit", it can only mean continuance of detention from the point of
time at which detention would become illegal if the order of
detention is not confirmed, namely, the expiry of three months
from the date of detention. It would not be necessary to confirm
the order of detention even after the receipt of the report of the
Board by the Government if the Government only wants to
continue the detention for the period of three months from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22066412/ 8
Shri Kaikam Kipgen vs The State Of Manipur on 28 February, 2023
date of detention, as the initial order of detention would
authorise the continuance of detention for that period without
any confirmation. Confirmation is necessary only to continue the
detention after the expiry of three months. If that be so, it
stands to reason to hold that the order of detention must be
confirmed before the expiry of the three months.
9. To put the matter in a nut-shell: the State Government has
power under the Act to detain a person without trial beyond a
period of three months but limited to a period of one year. That
power the State Government may exercise on the receipt of the
opinion of the Board that there is sufficient cause for the
detention. When the State Government receives that opinion, it
has still the option to exercise the power and to continue the
detention beyond the period of three months or not.
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 11
Confirmation is the exercise of the power to continue the
detention after the expiry of three months. Unless that power is
exercised within the period of three months from the date of
detention, the detention after the expiry of that period would be
without the authority of the Law.
......................................................................................................
14. The question was considered by this Court in Deb Sadhan Roy v. State of West Bengal6 and the
Court took the view that the order of detention must be confirmed within three months of the date
of detention; else the detention beyond that period would become illegal. We see no reason to doubt
the correctness of this decision and we follow it."
It is clear from the above cited case law that preventive detention is valid for only three months
unless it is extended or confirmed before its expiry. Any further detention without confirmation will
render the detention illegal.
[14] On perusal of the 1st detention order dated 02.09.2022 and the 2nd detention order dated
16.12.2022, both are almost similar contains and there is no fresh material in the 2nd detention
order. There is justification in the submission of Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the
petitioner that in the preventive detention, the 2nd detention order ought to be based on new facts
and the repeated detention order cannot be passed on the same set of facts. It may be noted that FIR
was lodged in the month of April and the 1st detention order was issued in the month of September,
2022 and the 2nd detention order was issued to overcome technicalities only in the month of
December, 2022 after a lapsed of more than 105 days. In the 2 nd detention order, no new facts have
been disclosed for detaining the detenu under preventive detention and it was based on the same set
of facts. It may be noted that the preventive detention is not an alternative means to keep a person
in detention without any trial only on the ground that he will be released on bail. All mandatory,
technicalities and constitutional safeguards have to be meticulously complied with.

[15] In the present case, the representations are not disposed of on
time and the delay in the disposal of the representations and non-furnishing of the information on
time vitiate the detention order. Moreover, the Central Government has no acted upon the
representation while the State Government in their counter affidavit states that the necessary
documents have already been forwarded to the Central Authority on time. The learned counsel for
the Central Government submits that no representation has been forwarded to it and hence, no
decision by the Central Government. So, we are of the view that in the present case, this is a classic
case where both the State and Central Authority have flouted the statutory safeguards given to a
person taken into preventive detention. The detention orders cannot be sustained in the eye of law
[Kindly see Sarabjeet Singh Mokha v. District Magistrate, Jabalpur: MANU/SC/1010/2021 @Para
55]. Accordingly, detention order dated 02.09.2022 and 16.12.2022 are set aside and the detenu,
Mr. Satminlen Kipgen be released from detention, if not required in any other case.
[16] The law of compensation under public law for violation of fundamental right enshrined under
Article 21 of the Constitution has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a catena of cases.
[17] In the case of Sube Singh v. State of Haryana, (2006) 3 SCC 178, Hon'ble Supreme Court
recognised the award of compensation against State for infringement of fundamental right under
Article 21 under the public law in addition to the right of the citizen to claim compensation under
private law of tort. It is held in para 38 as:
"38. It is thus now well settled that the award of compensation against the State is an
appropriate and effective remedy for redress of an established infringement of a
fundamental right under Article 21, by a public servant. The quantum of
compensation will, however, depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
Award of such compensation (by way of public law remedy) will not come in the way
of the WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 13 aggrieved person claiming additional
compensation in a civil court, in the enforcement of the private law remedy in tort,
nor come in the way of the criminal court ordering compensation under Section 357
of the Code of Criminal Procedure."
[18] In the case of Inhuman Conditions in 1382 Prisons, In re, (2017) 10 SCC 658, Hon'ble Supreme
Court considered the concept of compensation for custodial death and illegal detention under public
law relying on the famous case of D K Basu and held in para 46 as:
"46. In D.K. Basu v. State of W.B.9 this Court recognised that at the time of
ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 in 1979,
the Government of India made a specific reservation to the effect that the Indian legal
system does not recognise a right to compensation for victims of unlawful arrest or
detention and only became a party to the covenant, subject to this reservation. It was
noted, however, that the reservation has lost its relevance in view of the law laid
down by this Court in several cases wherein compensation has been awarded for the
infringement of a fundamental right of a citizen. It was also noted that while there is

no express provision in the Constitution for grant of compensation, this right has
been judicially evolved in cases of established unconstitutional deprivation of
personal liberty or life. This Court summed up the law in the following words: (SCC p.
443, para 54) "54. Thus, to sum up, it is now a well-accepted proposition in most of
the jurisdictions, that monetary or pecuniary compensation is an appropriate and
indeed an effective and sometimes perhaps the only suitable remedy for redressal of
the established infringement of the fundamental right to life of a citizen by the public
servants and the State is vicariously liable for their acts. The claim of the citizen is
based on the principle of strict liability to which the defence of sovereign immunity is
not available and the citizen must receive the amount of compensation from the
State, which shall have the right to be indemnified by the wrongdoer. In the
assessment of compensation, the emphasis has to be on the compensatory and not on
punitive element. The objective is to apply balm to the wounds and not to punish the
transgressor or the offender, as awarding appropriate punishment for the offence
(irrespective of compensation) must be left to the criminal courts in which the
offender is prosecuted, which the State, in law, is duty-bound to do.
WP(Cril.) No. 32 of 2022 Page 14 The award of compensation in the public law
jurisdiction is also without prejudice to any other action like civil suit for damages
which is lawfully available to the victim or the heirs of the deceased victim with
respect to the same matter for the tortious act committed by the functionaries of the
State. The quantum of compensation will, of course, depend upon the peculiar facts
of each case and no straitjacket formula can be evolved in that behalf. The relief to
redress the wrong for the established invasion of the fundamental rights of the
citizen, under the public law jurisdiction is, thus, in addition to the traditional
remedies and not in derogation of them. The amount of compensation as awarded by
the Court and paid by the State to redress the wrong done, may in a given case, be
adjusted against any amount which may be awarded to the claimant by way of
damages in a civil suit."
[19] Regarding the compensation for illegal detention, it is an admitted fact that the detention of the
detenu with effect from 02.12.2022 to 15.12.2022 was without any authority of law and hence illegal.
It may be noted that there is no remand order from the Court nor any order extending the detention
beyond 01.12.2022. In fact, the detenu got favourable order from the Ld. Special Judge (ND & PS)
where he was directed to be released on default bail vide order dated 01.12.2022 passed in Cril.
Misc. (B) Case No. 74 of 2022 as charge sheet could not be filed within the stipulated period of 180
days as prescribed under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. (the Manipur amendment). There is no extension
for the period of illegal detention by the State Authority. The explanation given for the same is that
the revocation order dated 15.12.2022 and the detention order dated 16.12.2022 were received on
the same day, i.e., 17.12.2022. In the judgment of DG & IG of Police v. Prem Sagar reported in
(1999) 5 SCC 700, the Hon'ble Supreme Court granted a compensation of Rs. 20,000/- for illegal
detention. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Bhuwneshwar Singh v. Union of India reported in (1993) 4 SCC 327 where the compensation of Rs.
1000/- was enhanced to Rs. 30,000/- for illegal pretrial custody.

[20] In the present case, it is a fact that the detenu was under illegal
detention for a period of 02.12.2022 to 15.12.2022 without any authority by the State Authority
while exercising the extra-ordinary power of preventive detention in a very casual and callous
manner without taking scant respect for the statutory safeguard provided by the statute for which
the detenu have to be adequately compensated. This Court expresses deep anguish in the manner
which the law of preventive detention has been resorted to by the State Authority in a very
mechanical and casual manner and this requires to be rectified immediately. Exercising the inherent
power conferred on this Court and in order to do complete justice, the State Authority is directed to
pay a nominal sum of Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) to the detenu as compensation for his
illegal detention for the period from 02.12.2022 to 15.12.2022 within a period of one month from
the date of receipt of this order failing which, it shall carry an interest at the rate of 6% from the date
of this order.
[21] Writ petition is allowed and disposed of in terms of the above observations and directions.
[22] Send a copy of this order to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information and
necessary compliance.
