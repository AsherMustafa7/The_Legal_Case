Addl.Public Prosecutor
ORDER
Challenging the order of dismissal dated 05.09.2024 in Crl.M.P.No.8919 of 2024, passed by the
learned Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS Act, Chennai, the petitioner, who is the owner of
the vehicle viz.,Maruthi Swift ZDI Car, bearing Reg. No.TN- 02-BP-5521, is before this Court with
the present Revision, for return of vehicle.
2. Mr.A.Tamilselvan, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the
petitioner purchased the vehicle for his use and for his family members. On 19.07.2023 one Rajesh,
a neighbour and a friend borrowed the petitioner's vehicle informing that he and his family
members to visit a temple and latter, the petitioner came to know that the vehicle seized in Crime
No.443 of 2023. The petitioner no way connected with the act of said Rajesh.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The respondent police, on search found 21.500 Kgs., of Ganja
from the car. Thereafter, the accused were arrested, contraband and car seized.
3. Mr.Hasan Mohammed Jinnah, State Public Prosecutor would submit that on 19.07.2023 at about
12.00 hrs., the respondent received secret information about illegal transportation of Narcotic
substance. After receiving information, the respondent along with his police team went to the scene
of occurrence i.e., 400 feet outer ring road, Chithukadu Service Road, Bus Stop. At that time, one
Rajesh came in a Marthi Suzuki Swift Car, bearing Reg.No.TN-02-BP-5521 and the respondent
police stopped and enquired the accused. On search of the vehicle, 21.500 Kgs., of Ganja recovered
from the car. Thereafter, the accused was arrested, the contraband and car seized. He further
submitted that the accused Rajesh in this case is a neighbour to the petitioner, a notorious criminal
having several cases to his credit including murder case. Hence, objected for return of vehicle.
4. The learned State Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed the petition submitting that return of
property in the NDPS Act Cases https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis cannot be entertained invoking
Sections 457 and 451 of Cr.P.C., and it is liable for confiscation under Section 52-A, 60, 61 and 63 of
NDPS Act., unless the owner of the conveyance proves that the conveyance was used without his
knowledge and connivance, he has taken all reasonable precaution against such use. In support of
his contention, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor relied on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190499521/ 2
Naveenraj vs State on 20 December, 2024
Court in the case of Suresh Nanda Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation reported in (2008) 3 SCC 674
to stress the point that, where there is a special Act dealing with subject, resort should be to that Act
instead of general Act providing for the matter connected with the specific Act. He stressed his
argument mainly on Union of India Vs. Mohanlal and Another reported in (2016) 3 SCC 379,
wherein the Apex Court has given directions for storage, seizure and sampling, handling and
disposal of seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Considering the piquant situation in
which accumulation of huge quantities of seized drugs and narcotics increased the chances of their
pilferage for re-circulation in the market and also finding that despite Central Government Standing
Order No.1/1989 and two subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015 giving
directions, directing that no sooner seizure of any narcotic and psychotropic and controlled
substances https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and conveyances is effected, the same shall be
forwarded to the officer in-charge of the nearest police station or to the officer empowered under
Section 53 of the Act and Section 52-A(2) of the Act. The sampling shall be done under the
supervision of the Magistrate and the Central and State Government and its agencies within six
months from the date of the order take appropriate steps to set up storage facilities for the exclusive
storage of seized narcotic and psychotropic substances and conveyances, duly equipped with vaults
and double-locking system to prevent theft, pilferage or replacement of the seized drugs. Further,
the Apex Court given direction to constitute Drug Disposal Committee and disposal of seized drugs
lying in the Police Malkhanas and other places used for storage of drugs and psychotropic
substances.
5. The learned State Public Prosecutor would further submit that this Court in Crl.R.C(MD)No.41 of
2019 in the case of Nahoorkani Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu on 16.06.2023 held that when the
conveyance is seized under NDPS Act, the return of property does not arise as contemplated under
Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C., and it is liable to be confiscated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act in
the light of special procedure under Section 52-A of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Act. Any
person claiming the ownership or right of the conveyance may approach the concerned Drug
Disposal Committee directly and make claim and the Drug Disposal Committee before taking a
decision on disposal of the vehicle, shall grant opportunity of hearing to the parties and pass
appropriate orders on the representation made by the party in accordance with law, as expeditiously
as possible, within a period of two months. Further, if any persons approach the trial Court for
release of vehicle, the property already produced before the trial Court and assigned R.P.Number
then such court shall conduct enquiry and pass suitable orders, as contemplated under Section 63 of
the NDPS Act or if the vehicle not produced before the Court then competent Court shall pass
appropriate order by directing the petitioner to approach concerned Drug Disposal Committee for
getting suitable relief. Further, in the event of trial Court / Special Court for NDPS release the
vehicle under Section 451 Cr.P.C., shall initiate the confiscation proceedings and dispose the vehicle
as contemplated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act.
6. Further, he relied on the order of this this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024, dated
08.02.2024 wherein this Court, following the order passed in Nahoorkani's case (cited supra)
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis held that whenever a return of property is filed, the petitioner has
to satisfy Sections 60, 61 and 62 of NDPS Act. In yet another case, in Crl.R.C(MD)No.1395 of 2023,
Gomathi Vs. State, dated 27.02.2024, this Court passed orders on the similar line of Nahoorkani's
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190499521/ 3
Naveenraj vs State on 20 December, 2024
case. Further, he referred Crl.R.C.No.675 of 2023 in the case of Salimrajan @ Salimraj Vs. State
dated 12.07.2023 wherein this Court again followed the Nahoorkani's case. In sum and substance,
he argued that any property say conveyance seized in NDPS Act cases cannot be returned as a
matter of routine and it is only after satisfying Sections 60, 61, 62, and 63 of the said Act.
7. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner opposed the contention of the learned Additional
Public Prosecutor and submitted that Mohanlal's case, refers to Section 52-A primarily with regard
to not following the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated
10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015, which prescribed procedures to be followed while conducting seizure of
contraband, sampling, safe custody and disposal finding that there is no uniform procedures
followed in seizure, sampling and storing the narcotic in safe vaults and handling and disposal of
seized narcotics, lying in the malkhanas or any other storage place without proper storage facility,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis thereby, the danger of recirculation of seized contraband into
system is very much likely, hence issued directions to the Investigation Agency, Magistrate and
Governments to follow guidelines. Further, submitted that this Court, following the Apex Court
Judgment in Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala and Anr in Crl.A.No.2005/2022, reported in 2022 (7) KHC
2731, wherein the Apex Court released the vehicle involved in the NDPS Act well after Mohanlals'
case. Hence, it cannot be said that Mohanlal's case places restrictions on release of vehicle. The
Sainaba's case, being the Judgment of the Apex Court this Court finding, it is binding under Article
144 of the Constitution of India entertained and allowed the return of property petition filed under
Sections 451 and 457. The citations referred by the Additional Public Prosecutor is no more res
integra on the point of return of property. He further added that this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.41 of
2019, Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024 and Crl.R.C.(MD)No.1395 of 2023 and in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.675 of
2022, the Sainaba's case was not considered. In view of the Apex Court Judgment in Sainaba's case,
the confiscation proceedings cannot be an embargo to consider the return of property petition, but
of course, the return of property petition to be considered on its own merits and hence, there is no
impediment to entertain the above petition. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
8. I have heard the learned counsels appearing on either side and perused the materials available on
record.
9. On perusal of the records it is seen that in Mohanlal's case, the Apex Court finding is that, despite
issuance of the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007
and 16.01.2015, no uniform practice and procedures followed by State or Central Agencies in the
matter of drawing of samples at the time of seizure, storage of drugs in safes and vaults, not placed
in double- locking system and piquant situation arose by which accumulation of huge quantities of
the seized drugs and narcotics increased and the chances of their pilferage for re-circulation in the
market, hence put in place certain procedures and guidelines to the Investigation Agency,
Magistrate, Central and State Governments, and ordered formation of Drug Disposal Committee to
monitor the same. No direction with regard to the conveyance considered and issued. Further, the
Notification No.G.S.R.899(E), dated 23.12.2022 issued in terms of Section 52-A of the NDPS Act.
The question whether there is any legal embargo in view of confiscation proceedings under Sections
60 to 63 of the NDPS Act and whether petition seeking return of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
property under Sections 451 and 457 can be entertained and decided has been dealt in detail by the

Naveenraj vs State on 20 December, 2024
Karnataka High Court Division Bench in Rathnamma v. State rep., by PSI, Channagiri Police
Station, Davabagere District in CRL.P.No.3571/2021, which was in conflict to the Division Bench
Judgement of the Kerala High Court in Shajahan Vs. Inspector of Excise and Others reported in
2019 SCC Online Ker 3685, hence the matter was referred to a Larger Bench by the Kerala High
Court and the Kerala High Court in the case of Pradeep B. Vs. The District Drug Disposal Committee
represented by its Chairman, Kasargod and Others in WA No.1304 of 2022, dated 19.02.2024 dealt
in detail, referring to Section 52-A, guidelines given in the Mohanlal's case and held that
jurisdictional Special Court under the NDPS Act has power to consider the grant of interim custody
of the vehicle under the Act by invoking powers under Section 457 of Cr.P.C., and answered the
reference accordingly. It had also referred to the orders passed by Allahabad High Court in Shams
Tavrej v. Union of India reported in 2023 SCC OnLine AII 1154 and Rajdhari Yadav v. State of U.P.
Reported in 2022 SCC OnLine AII 583 and Union of India v. Tejinder Singh reported in 2023 SCC
OnLine Gau 729 and following Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala (2022 (7) KHC 273) held
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis interim custody of a vehicle involved under the NDPS Act could be
ordered. In Sainaba's case, the procedures contemplated and applicable in NDPS Act in consonace
with Cr.P.C., are dealt in detail. The Apex Court considering both NDPS Act and Cr.P.C., held as
follows:-
“5. It has been opined by the High Court that the Court is not empowered to exercise
the jurisdiction under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to release a
vehicle involved under NDPS Act in interim custody.
6.The appellant has urged inter alia that as per Section 36-C read with Section 51 of
the NDPS Act, Criminal Procedure Code would be application for proceedings by a
Special Court under NDPS Act and Section 451 has an inbuilt provision to impose any
specific condition on the appellant while releasing the vehicle. The appellant is
undoubtedly the registered owner of the vehicle but had not participated in the
offence as alleged by the prosecution nor had knowledge of the alleged transaction.
7. Learned counsel seeks to rely on the judgment of this Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal
Desai Vs. State of Gujarat – 2003 (2) KLT 1089 (SC) = (2002) 10 SCC 283 opining
that it is no use to keep such seized vehicles at police station for a long period and it is
open to the Magistrate to pass https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appropriate orders
immediately by taking a bond and a guarantee as well as security for return of the
said vehicle, if required any any point of time.
8. On hearing learned counsel for parties and in the conspectus of the facts and
circumstances of the case, and the legal provisions referred aforesaid, we are of the
view that this is a appropriate case for release of the vehicle on terms and conditions
to be determined by the Special Court.”
10. It is not in dispute that the petitioner is the owner of the car and not accused in
the case. The objection of the respondent seems to be that steps have been taken for
confiscation proceedings. It is several months passed after registration of the case,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190499521/ 5
Naveenraj vs State on 20 December, 2024
still the confiscation proceeding is at the conception stage and nothing has been
done. Further, if the vehicle is kept in open yard exposed to sunlight and rain, the
condition of the said vehicle will get deteriorate day-by-day and the value of the
vehicle will get diminished.
11. Hence, following the Supreme Court Judgment, in Sainaba's case, and the Full
Bench of Kerala High Court in Pradeep's case, this Court finds the objection of the
learned State https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Public Prosecutor that there is total
embargo in entertaining the petition for return of property under the relevant
provision of Cr.P.C., is no more res intergra. In view of the same, this Court is
inclined to entertain and consider the grant of interim custody of vehicles seized
under the NDPS by invoking the power under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C
consequently under Section 497 and 503 BNSS, subject to the confiscation
proceedings.
12. It is seen that the petitioner produced Registration Certificate of the vehicle,
Insurance and other documents. Admittedly, the petitioner is not an accused. In this
case, investigation completed and charge sheet already filed in C.C.No.997 of 2023.
In view of the same, this Court is inclined to allow the Revision.
13. The lower Court following the guidelines given in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai case,
take photographs, record the features of the vehicle, prepare a proceeding to be used
as proof in the trial, before releasing the vehicle to the petitioner.
14. In view of the foregoing reasons, the order of dismissal dated 05.09.2024 in
Crl.M.P.No.8919 of 2024, passed by the learned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS Act, Chennai, is set aside and this Revision
is allowed with a direction to the learned Principal Sessions Judge, to release the
petitioner's vehicle viz.,Maruthi Swift ZDI Car, bearing Reg. No.TN-02-BP-5521, in
favour of the petitioner on the petitioner submitting an undertaking on the following
terms and conditions:-
i. The petitioner shall furnish an indemnity bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty
Thousand Only) with two solvent sureties, undertaking to produce the vehicle as and
when directed by the court.
ii. The petitioner shall not sale, mortgage or transfer the ownership of the vehicle
during the pendency of the case.
iii. The petitioner shall not change or tamper with the identification of the vehicle in
any manner during pendency of the case.
iv. Any other condition, if any, to be imposed by the trial court.
