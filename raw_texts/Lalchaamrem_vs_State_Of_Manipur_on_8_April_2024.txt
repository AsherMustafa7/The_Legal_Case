Lalchaamrem vs State Of Manipur on 8 April, 2024
some time.
[6] In the circumstances, this Court is inclined to take up the issue of suspension of sentence.
[7] Mr. Serto T Kom, learned counsel for the appellant, submits that from the date of conviction and
sentence i.e. 04.07.2022 and after setting off a period of 3 (three) months already undergone by the
appellant as during the trial, as on 04.04.2024, the appellant has undergone more than 2 (two)
years of sentence which is half of 4 (four) years of total sentence by the Ld. Special Court. He
submits that in various decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of (i) Saudan Singh vs.
State of UP reported as 21 SCC Online SC 3259, para 7 and (ii) Dinesh Kumar Sinha vs. State of
Jharkhand reported as (2009) 6 SCC 628, para 4 held that the Page 2 Court can consider for
suspension of sentence after the convict has undergone 50% of the total sentence awarded by the
Trial Court. [8] It is submitted that in the present case, the appellant has undergone 50% of the total
4 (four) years of sentence awarded by the Ld. Special Court. The appellant is female of 62 years as
on date and there is no possibility of her absconding during the pendency of the present appeal. It is
also pointed out that in the case of Dadu Alias Tulsidas vs. Sate of Maharastra reported as (2000) 8
SCC 437, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Section 32A of the NDPS Act which restricts the
power of the Court for suspension of sentence is unconstitutional and Mr. Serto T Kom, learned
counsel for the appellant, submits that this Court can exercise the power of suspension of sentence
under Section 389 of CrPC. Reference is made to the decision of Bhagwan Rama Shinde Gosai &
Ors. vs. State of Gujarat reported as (1999) 4 SCC 421, para 3 held that when a person is sentence for
a fixed period of sentence, the Court may liberally consider suspension of sentence and in the
similar case, vide order dated 31.05.2019 passed by this Court in Crl.A. No. 11 of 2018, suspended
the sentence of person facing conviction under NDPS Act.
[9] Mr. Y. Ashang, learned PP, draws the attention of this Court to the observation made by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Dadu (Supra) that while considering suspension of sentence
under NDPS Act, the condition as stipulated out under Section 37 of the Act has to be complied and
submits that this Court may pass appropriate order.
Page 3 [10] Considering the peculiar facts of the present case, this Court has perused the materials
on record and the decisions cited at bar. It is seen that the appellant who is lady of 62 years has
undergone 50% of 4 (four) years of sentence awarded by the Trial Court and the appeal will take
some time for considering the conflicting views of the Hon'ble Supreme Court with respect to
Section 52A of the NDPS Act.
[11] In the circumstances, this Court is inclined to suspend the order of sentence dated 04.07.2022
passed by the Ld. Special Court, NDPS in Special Trial No. 11 of 2022 on the condition that the
appellant shall furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) with surety
(Government Employee) of like amount to the satisfaction of the Ld. Special Judge (NDPS),
Churachandpur subject to the condition that she shall appear before Officer-in-Charge,
Churachandpur Police Station on 15th of every month and she shall not leave the State of Manipur
