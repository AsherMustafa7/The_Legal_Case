THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
WP No.3841/2021
Hemant Dhere vs. The Employees Provident Fund Organization
& Ors.
Heard through Video Conferencing
Gwalior, Dated : 08.06.2021
Shri D.P. Singh, Counsel for the petitioner.
Shri R.K. Goyal, Counsel for the respondents.
This petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed against the order dated
21.1.2021 passed by respondent No.2 by which the order revising the pension as well as the revised
PPO has been cancelled and the petitioner has been directed to refund the excess amount.
It is not out of place to mention here that the Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner has also been
impleaded in his personal capacity as respondent No.3.
It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner was the employee of Gwalior Sahakari Dugdh
Sangh Maryadit, Gwalior (respondent No.4). The petitioner had opted the scheme of EPF, 1995 and
employee's contribution was being deducted and the employee subscription was being deposited by
the employer. The petitioner stood retired in the month of April, 2013 and PPO was also issued.
Thereafter, the petitioner made a representation for grant of higher pension under the Scheme of
EPF, 1995 and on the basis of same, the Manager (Adm.) issued letter dated 8.9.2017 asking for
option under the format. Accordingly, on 11.7.2017 the petitioner submitted his THE HIGH COURT

option. Since no decision was taken on the option of the petitioner, therefore, the petitioner along
with other similarly situated persons preferred Writ Petition before this Court and direction was
given to the respondents for extending the benefit on the basis of gazette notification dated 25th
April, 2016. After completing the formalities, the revised PPO was issued granting the benefit of
higher pension.
Thereafter, the respondents No.2/3 issued notice dated 23.12.2020 with regard to the eligibility for
higher pension and sought an explanation within 10 days. The petitioner received notice on

23.12.2020 and submitted its objection on 8.1.2021. Thereafter, on 13.1.2021 another notice was
issued, thereby extending the time to file the objection till 22-1-2021, which was received by the
petitioner on 16.1.2021. Although the petitioner had already filed his objection but before expiry of
period granted by the respondent No.3 in its show cause notice dated 13.1.2021, the respondent
No.3 passed the impugned order on 21.1.2021 itself. Thus it is clear that issuance of show cause
notice was nothing but it was a mere paper formality and for no reason the order was passed on
21.1.2021, whereas the petitioner had every right to file the supplementary reply or to appear before
the respondents No.2 and 3 for his personal hearing on 22.1.2021.
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Hemant Dhere vs. The Employees Provident Fund
Organization & Ors.
This Court, by order dated 15.3.2021 had directed the respondents to produce the record.
It is submitted by the counsel for the respondents that the record is available.
It is submitted by Shri R.K. Goyal, counsel for the respondents that it is true that the second notice
dated 13.1.2021 was issued to the petitioner for filing his reply on or before 22.1.2021, but as the
reply of the petitioner was already received prior to the expiry of the date mentioned in the notice,
therefore, the respondent No.2/3 without waiting for the expiry of period given in show cause
notice, passed the impugned order on 21.1.2021. It is submitted that the subject matter in question
is already sub judice before the Supreme Court.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
Issuance of a notice is not a mere formality. Notice dated 13.1.2021 reads as under:

22.1.2021 to put forward his case either through post or by appearing personally.
Under these circumstances, it is clear that the petitioner THE HIGH COURT OF

had full opportunity to file his supplementary reply/documents dated 22.1.2021. It is submitted by
the counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner was also inclined to avail the opportunity of
personal hearing but that has been denied by the respondents by passing a final order one day prior
to the expiry of the date mentioned in the show cause notice dated 13.1.2021. The manner in which
the impugned order has been passed clearly shows the predetermined mind of the respondent
No.2/3.

Be that whatever it may.
One thing is clear that when the respondent No.2/3 had given time to the petitioner till 22.1.2021 to
put forward his claim/objection either through post or by appearing personally, then he should not
have passed any order prior to expiry of that period. Justice must not only be done but it must also
seen to be done.
In the present case, the respondent No.2/3 has given a complete go-bye to the principles of natural
justice.
So far as the contention of the respondents that the subject matter of the controversy is pending sub
judice before the Supreme Court is concerned, it is suffice to mention here that this Court has not
considered the merits of the case. The impugned order dated 21.1.2021 is being set aside on the
ground of violation of natural justice. On one hand, the stand of the respondents is that the subject

Organization & Ors.
matter is pending sub judice, therefore, this Court should not decide the controversy and on the
other hand, the respondents themselves are passing orders. It is for the respondents to consider
their own stand.
Under these circumstances, this Court is left with no other option but to quash the order dated
21.1.2021 passed by the respondent No.2 in Case No.EPF/RO/MP/GWL/Pension/PPO/Higher
Pension/25852 with cost of Rs.5,000/- to be paid by the respondent No.3 personally. The said cost
shall not be reimbursed to the respondent No.3 by the Department. The cost be deposited in the
account of the petitioner within a period of 15 days from today.
The matter is remanded back to the respondent No.2 to take a final decision in the matter after
giving opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner as well as by taking into consideration that
the subject matter of the case is already sub judice before the Supreme Court.
With aforesaid observations, the petition is finally disposed of.
