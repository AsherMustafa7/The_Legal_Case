Mosmat Sushila Devi vs Chandra Bhushan Chaudhary & Or on 10 January, 2019
The case of the plaintiff is that the suit property
belong to Ram Kripal Chaudhary the husband of the petitioner.
Ram Kripal Chaudhary in his lifetime created a trust namely,
"Sushila Ram Kripal Chaudhary Datavya Aushadhalaya" at
Saidpur Bishanpur for treatment of the needy people. The said
Ram Kripal Chaudhary executed registered deed of 'Will' dated
Patna High Court C.R. No.293 of 2010 dt.10-01-2019
3/5
15.10.1999
creating the trust whereunder the plaintiff and defendant no. 3 were members and the petitioner
was President of the said trust. The claim of the plaintiff is that since the property was a trust
property in pursuance of 'Will' executed by the husband of the petitioner. Petitioner had no right to
execute sale deed in respect of trust property in favour of any person.
The petitioner raised objection before the trial judge that the suit itself is not maintainable because
claim of the plaintiff was based on the 'Will' and unless the 'Will' is probated, no person can claim
any right before the court of law in view of the bar under Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act,
1925.
By the impugned order, the learned court below did not dismiss the suit rather held that unless a
probate is filed by the plaintiff, no decree can be passed in favour of the plaintiff.
Contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that if the statute bars any right to be
established in any court of justice unless the 'Will' is probated, there is no question of
maintainability of the suit without probate of the 'Will'. Therefore, the court below should not have
sustained the maintainability of the suit when the court below was itself of definite opinion that no
decree can be passed in absence of Patna High Court C.R. No.293 of 2010 dt.10-01-2019 probate of
the 'Will'. He further submits that he has gathered information that subsequent thereto, the plaintiff
has filed Probate Case No. 26/2009 and status of that probate case is not known.
In spite of service of notice no one appears on behalf of the sole appellant.
Sub-section (1) of Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act which is relevant for the purpose reads as
follows:-
"213. Right as executor or legatee when established-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77947450/ 3
Mosmat Sushila Devi vs Chandra Bhushan Chaudhary & Or on 10 January, 2019
(1) No right as executor or legatee can be established in any Court of Justice, unless a
Court of competent jurisdiction in [India] has granted probate of the Will under
which the right is claimed, or has granted letters of administration with the Will or
with a copy of an authenticated copy of the Will annexed."
From a perusal of the provision aforesaid it is apparent that no right as executor or legatee can be
established in any court of justice unless the 'Will' is probated by the competent court. In the present
case the 'Will' was not probated on the date of institution of the suit as such the suit was itself
incompetent. If the impugned order would have been passed in favour of the petitioner whole suit
would have been dismissed.
Patna High Court C.R. No.293 of 2010 dt.10-01-2019 Hence, the impugned order is set aside as
devoid of any merit and this civil revision application stands allowed.
However, it is made clear that in the event of grant of probate, the plaintiff of the suit may exercise
his right before the Civil Court by filing a fresh suit, if so advised.
