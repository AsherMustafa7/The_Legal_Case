Mritunjay Kumar Singh And Ors vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 4 September, 2019
Date : 04-09-2019
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the
Patna High Court MJC No.3603 of 2017 dt.04-09-2019
2/6
learned AAG for the State.
This contempt application has been filed alleging
willful disobedience and disrespect shown to the order dated
29.08.2017
passed by the Hon'ble Division Bench in LPA No.67 of 2016 and its analogous matter being LPA
No.106 of 2016. The relevant operative part of the order of the Hon'ble Division Bench is extracted
herein below:-
"4. With only 20 marks added to the marks of Surendra Mahto (private respondent
no. 14), his total marks do not added up to give him the benefit of continuance on the
post of a Panchayat Teacher as the other respondents have more marks in terms of
the percentage minus the weightage as such. It is, therefore, clarified that Surendra
Mahto shall stand removed from his post as a Panchayat Teacher forthwith and so far
as the respondents no. 13 (Sohan Mahto and Kumari Anju) are concerned, since the
learned Single Judge has allowed Sohan Mahto and Kumari Anju to continue to work
on the post of Panchayat Teacher, no interference with that part of the direction or
observation is required. It is expected that the two writ petitioners, Kumari Anju and
Sohan Mahto, who are respondent no. 13 in these appeals, will continue in service as
if they were not disturbed."
On the last date when the matter was taken for Patna High Court MJC No.3603 of 2017
dt.04-09-2019 consideration, learned counsel for the petitioners made a statement that the
petitioners have not been paid their salary in terms of the order of the learned Single Judge for the
period they had worked and further the petitioners claimed that they are still being allowed to
continue during the pendency of Letters Patent Appeal.
In view of the aforesaid submission, we passed the following order on 07.08.2019:-
"It is the grievance of the petitioner in the present application that despite there
being a categorical finding and direction recorded in paragraph 44 and 47 of the
learned Single Judge Judgment in M.J.C. No. 1044 of 2014 that if the respondents
no. 14, 15 and 16 have worked earlier they shall be entitled for their salary, they have
not been paid their salary till date. It is also claimed that respondents no. 14, 15 and

16 were never dislodged by virtue of the judgment of the learned Single Judge and in
fact they were allowed to continue during the pendency of Letters Patent Appeal.
Learned AAG 15 submits that he will get instruction and file supplementary show
cause answering those issues on the next date.
List this matter after two weeks on 21.08.2019."
Today, learned counsel for the petitioners submits Patna High Court MJC No.3603 of 2017
dt.04-09-2019 that on 03.09.2019, i.e., yesterday, the petitioners have been removed and the letter
issued by the District Programme Officer (Establishment), Muzaffarpur has been made available to
petitioner no.1. It is his submission that the removal of the petitioners during the pendency of the
present contempt application is a further willful disobedience of the order of this Court and hence
not only the order of removal be set aside, a proceeding for contempt be also initiated against the
opposite parties-contemners.
Learned AAG for the State has opposed the contempt application as well as interlocutory application
being I.A. No.01 of 2019 by which the impugned letter dated 03.09.2019 by which the petitioners
have been removed has been sought to be challenged. Learned AAG has drawn our attention
towards the judgement of the learned Writ Court as well as the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court.
The learned Writ Court has in paragraph 45 and 47 of its judgement dated 23.07.2014 passed in
MJC No.1044 of 2014 arising out of CWJC No.16707 of 2012 and CWJC No.16707 of 2012 held as
under:-
"45. In the result, these two writ applications are allowed and the order of the
Tribunal without being interfered is modified to Patna High Court MJC No.3603 of
2017 dt.04-09-2019 the extent that the appointment of the petitioners Sohan Mahto
and Kumari Anju will not be disturbed and, in fact, it is the respondent nos. 14, 15
and 16 who on account of having lower marks, will have to make place for
appointment of respondent no. 13 as also for the continuance of the two writ
petitioners.
47. The Panchayat Secretary is hereby directed to not only ensure the compliance of
the order of the Tribunal by way of appointment of respondent no. 13 on the post of
Panchayat Teacher forthwith but also make payment of salary of the respondent nos.
14, 15 and 16 only till today for the earlier work done by them but they shall not
continue in service any longer in the light of observations made above in this
judgment."
Further, our attention has been drawn to the judgement of the Division Bench and it has been
submitted that in paragraph '4' of the said judgement which has already been extracted hereinabove
what has been held is that the appointments of Sohan Mahto and Kumari Anju were only saved. So
far these petitioners are concerned, no reliefs were granted to these petitioners in the Letters Patent
Appeal.

Mritunjay Kumar Singh And Ors vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 4 September, 2019
We have considered the rival submissions at the Bar and find ourselves in agreement with the
submissions of the learned AAG. Perusal of the aforesaid orders clearly Patna High Court MJC
No.3603 of 2017 dt.04-09-2019 demonstrates that so far as these petitioners are concerned at no
stage, either in the writ proceedings or in the appellate Court, their appointments were saved and all
that said was about their entitlement to get the salary for the period they had worked. Within the
scope of the contempt jurisdiction, we are not inclined to entertain the interlocutory application by
which now the removal of the petitioners are sought to be challenged. We, however, leave it open for
the petitioners to seek their remedy if any available in accordance with law. We further make it clear
that if the salary for the period the petitioners have worked in terms of the order of the learned Writ
Court have not been paid, it must be paid within one month from the date of receipt/communication
of this order.
Contempt application is disposed of.
