Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 1 Bail was granted as more than sixty days had elapsed after the
commencement of the trial and both the accused had remained in custody during that period.
Aggrieved thereby, the State of Manipur filed an application under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C., in Cril.
Misc. Case No.100 of 2021, before the learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West, to quash/set aside the
bail order dated 20.03.2021. By order dated 20.11.2021, the learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West,
held that the accused were not entitled to be released on bail under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. and set
aside the bail order dated 20.03.2021. Assailing the said order, the accused filed this Criminal
Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. r/w Section 439 Cr.P.C.
[2] By order dated 26.11.2021, this Court suspended paragraph No.22 of the impugned order dated
20.11.2021 till the next date. Thereby, the learned Sessions Judge had directed the accused to
surrender before the Trial Court within one week, i.e., by 26.11.2021. The interim order was
extended thereafter from time to time. The last such extension was on 15.03.2022, operative till
11.04.2022. However, the accused are admittedly still at large as on date. [3] Heard Mr.
M.Gunedhor Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners/ accused; and Mr. M.Rarry, learned Special
PP, appearing for the respondent. [4] Earlier, Mr. M.Rarry, learned Special PP, had raised the issue
that this Criminal Petition is not maintainable in law. Upon considering the objections raised by
him, a learned Judge of this Court passed order dated 29.12.2021, rejecting the objections raised as
to maintainability and directing the matter to be listed for hearing on merits. This order has attained
finality. The contention of Mr. M.Rarry, learned Special PP, that the issue of maintainability of this
petition should again be revisited, therefore, stands rejected.
Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 2
[5] Facts, to the extent relevant, may be nutshelled thus: After the onset
of Covid-19 virus in India and the imposition of a nationwide lock down in March, 2020, there was a
large scale hoarding and black-marketing of petroleum products. Officials of the Consumer Affairs,
Food and Public Distribution Department (CAF&PD), Government of Manipur, were given the
responsibility of inspecting petroleum outlets across the State under the Disaster Management Act,
Essential Services Maintenance Act, etc. H. Bobby Singh, Civil Supply Inspector, CAF&PD, along
with L.Ibotombi Singh, Area Officer, CAF&PD, were assigned the duty of checking oil pumps located
in Imphal East and Imphal West areas. On 17.04.2020, at about 9.30 pm, these officials visited
Heibok Filling Station KSK located at Naran Konjin in Imphal West and found that it was being run
by two brothers, viz., Laishram Suresh Singh and Laishram Surjit, the accused. The officials
allegedly met with resistance from them and were physically assaulted. H. Bobby Singh, Civil Supply
Inspector, sustained grievous injuries on his nose and leg. In consequence, FIR No.14(04) 2020 was
registered under Sections 353, 326, 307 and 34 IPC along with Section 25(1-C) of the Arms Act,
1959. This FIR was registered on 18.04.2020 at 6.30 pm upon the complaint made by L. Ibotombi
Singh, Area Officer, CAF & PD. During the course of investigation, it was discovered that the oil
pump, Heibok Filling Station KSK, at Naran Konjin, was allotted to Smt. Khaidem (O) Sushila Devi,
w/o late Khaidem Gojendro Singh, a police officer who had died in the line of duty. The trade license
was also issued in her name but the business was being run by the two brothers, viz., the accused.
Thereupon, FIR No.19(05) 2020 WGI PS was registered against them on 09.05.2020 under Sections
420 and 120-B IPC along with Section 13(1)(d) & (e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. It
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173227410/ 2

appears that Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 3 Sections 468, 471, 419, 168 and 34 IPC were added later
on and Section 120-B IPC was removed. The accused were arrested on 09.05.2020 by Wangoi Police
Station in connection with this FIR. They were formally arrested thereafter in relation to FIR
No.14(04) 2020 on 09.05.2020 at 02.45 pm. [6] The accused secured interim bail on medical
grounds, in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020, from the learned Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West,
in Cril. Misc. (LD)(B) Case No. 8 of 2020/Cril. Misc.(B) Case No.44 of 2020. For that purpose, they
produced documents purportedly issued by Dr.Th.Premchand Singh. Using the same medical
documents, the accused then filed Cril. Misc. (B) No.30 of 2020 in June, 2020, seeking to be
released on bail in relation to FIR No.14(04) 2020. However, upon an objection being raised, the
genuineness of the medical documents was verified and it came to light that the same were
fabricated and forged. The Trial Court rejected Cril. Misc. (B) Case No.30 of 2020 on that ground.
[7] The accused then filed their 1st default bail application in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020 under
Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., in Cril. Misc. Case No.82 of 2020, before the learned Special Judge (PC Act),
Imphal West. This application was dismissed on 16.09.2020, holding that it was not maintainable as
the accused were already granted interim bail. The State of Manipur then filed an application in Cril.
Misc. (LD-8) Case No. 01 of 2020/80 of 2020 seeking cancellation of the interim bail granted to the
accused in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020, as they had used fake documents to obtain the same.
This application was filed in September, 2020. Thereupon, the learned Special Judge (PC Act),
Imphal West, cancelled the interim bail granted to the accused, accepting that they had played fraud
upon the Court by using forged documents. The accused then filed their 2nd default bail
Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 4 application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. in relation to FIR No.19(05)
2020, before the learned Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West. This 2nd application was dismissed
on 21.10.2020, holding that the period of custody of the accused was not sufficient and in view of the
observations made in the earlier dismissal order. [8] The accused then filed Bail Application No.12
of 2020 before this Court under Section 439 Cr.P.C. read with Section 167 Cr.P.C.. This application
was filed in October, 2020, seeking release on medical grounds. It was dismissed as withdrawn on
04.11.2020. The accused then filed their 3 rd default bail application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. in
relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020. This application was filed on 18.11.2020. On 15.12.2020, the
learned Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West, granted default bail to the accused in relation to FIR
No.19(05) 2020. [9] Investigation having been completed in relation to FIR No.14(04) 2020, a final
report was filed by the police before the Trial Court, leading to framing of charges on 04.12.2020.
Charges were framed against the accused under Sections 325, 353 and 34 IPC. The case was taken
on record as Cril. (P) Case No.2 of 2020. The accused then filed Cril. Misc.(B) Case No.5 of 2021
therein under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. on 01.02.2021 seeking to be released on bail. [10] While so, the
State of Manipur filed Cril. Petitions Nos.5 and 6 of 2021 before this Court aggrieved by the grant of
default bail to the accused by the learned Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West, vide order dated
15.12.2020, in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020. During their pendency, the Trial Court passed order
dated 20.03.2021 in Cril. Misc.(B) Case No.5 of 2021, accepting the plea of the accused that they
were entitled to bail under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. Shortly thereafter, this Court allowed Cril. Petition
Nos.5 and 6 of 2021, vide order dated Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 5 26.03.2021, and directed the
State to re-arrest the accused. As the accused were not traceable then, this event did not come to
pass immediately. [11] Aggrieved by the order dated 26.03.2021 passed in Cril. Petition Nos.5 and 6
of 2021, the accused approached the Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.)
Nos.3637-3638 of 2021. By order dated 13.05.2021 passed therein, the Supreme Court directed the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173227410/ 3
Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
accused to surrender before the concerned police station within two weeks. They did so on
26.05.2021 at around 4 pm. Ultimately, Special Leave to Appeal (Cril.) Nos.3637-3638 of 2021 filed
by the accused were dismissed by the Supreme Court on 27.07.2021, giving liberty to them to file
applications for release on bail on merits.
[12] The accused then filed Cril. Misc.(B) Case Nos.71 and 72 of 2021 before the learned Special
Judge (PC Act), Imphal West, under Section 439 Cr.P.C., seeking to be released on bail in relation to
FIR No.19(05) 2020. These bail applications were filed on 06.8.2021. Parallelly, the State filed an
application on 07.09.2021 under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. before the learned Sessions Judge, Imphal
West, to quash and set aside the order dated 20.03.2021 passed by the Trial Court in Cril. Misc. (B)
Case No.5 of 2021. On 01.10.2021, the learned Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West, granted bail to
the accused in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020 in Cril. Misc.(B) Case Nos.71 and 72 of 2021. Just
over a month later, the very same Special Judge, being the learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West,
passed the impugned order dated 20.11.2021, quashing and setting aside the bail order dated
20.03.2021 passed by the Trial Court.
[13] The sequence of events that transpired in relation to both the FIRs gains importance owing to
the intricate link between the two and in the light of the Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 6 fact that the
learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West, took into account this chain of events while passing the
impugned order.
[14] This being the preceding checkered history, it would be apposite to now examine Section 437(6)
Cr.P.C as the case turns upon the scope and ambit of this provision. Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. reads as
under: -
'437. When bail may be taken in case of non-bailable offence -
*** *** ***
(6) If, in any case triable by a Magistrate, the trial of a person
accused of any non-bailable offence is not concluded within a period of sixty days
from the first date fixed for taking evidence in the case, such person shall, if he is in
custody during the whole of the said period, be released on bail to the satisfaction of
the Magistrate, unless for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise
directs.' The question that arises is whether an accused is entitled to statutory bail
under this provision as a matter of right or, alternatively, whether the provision does
not stand on par with the default bail provision under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. and,
therefore, no such right would inure to an accused. [15] There are no binding
precedents on the issue but there is an abundance of case law emanating from
different High Courts. The same may be taken note of at this stage.
In Anwar Hussain vs. State of Rajasthan [(2007) 1 RLW 12 (Raj)], a learned Judge of
the Rajasthan High Court observed that, from a plain reading of Section 437(6)
Cr.P.C., it is clear that, ordinarily, if the trial is not completed within sixty days from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173227410/ 4
Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
the first date fixed for taking evidence, the accused would be entitled to be released
on bail but in the same provision, it is further stated that while considering a bail
application on this count, the Trial Court can refuse bail by Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021
Page 7 assigning reasons. The learned Judge therefore held that it cannot be said that
the provision was mandatory in nature, similar to Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., which states
that if the investigation is not completed within the stipulated period, then the
accused is entitled to be released on bail mandatorily, irrespective of the merits of the
case. The learned Judge accordingly held that an accused would not get an absolute
right to be released on bail under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. as the Trial Court can refuse
bail after assigning good reasons.
In Raman Lodhi vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh (ILR 2019 MP 1930), a learned
Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court took note of the fact that, in Devraj
Maratha @ Dillu vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, {2018 (2) MPLJ (Cri)386 = 2018 SCC
OnLIne MP 151}, a learned Judge had referred this very issue to a Division Bench,
owing to cleavage of opinion as to the interpretation of Section 437(6) Cr.P.C., and
the Division Bench held that Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. is mandatory in the sense that the
Magistrate is required to exercise the power to grant bail after the statutory period if
the trial is not concluded. However, passing of the order under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C.
is mandatory but not grant of bail, as the Magistrate is vested with full power to take
into consideration - 1) nature of the allegations; 2) whether the delay is attributable
to the accused or to the prosecution;
and 3) criminal antecedents of the accused or any other justifiable reason, while refusing to grant
bail. In consequence, the learned Judge held that the law stood settled that the accused became
entitled to apply for bail if the trial of a non-bailable offence was not concluded by the Magistrate
within sixty days but the right was not absolute and the Magistrate, for reasons to be recorded in
writing, could reject the plea for bail even under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C.
Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 8 In Robert Lendi vs. The Collector of Customs and another [1987
Crl.L.J. 55 = ILR (1986) 1 Del 147], a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court observed that the
object of Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. is that, if the trial of a non- bailable offence before a Magistrate is
not concluded within sixty days from the first date fixed for taking evidence, such accused shall, if he
is in custody during the whole of the said period, be released on bail unless, for reasons to be
recorded, the Magistrate otherwise directs. The Division Bench then considered the question as to
whether, while refusing bail under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C., the Magistrate can only refuse bail on
limited reasoning germane to the cause of delay or whether bail can be refused on general grounds
recognized as good for refusal of bail. Noting that the object of the provision is undoubtedly to
eradicate delay in the trial, the Bench opined that it would be equally important that the ends of
justice do not suffer. According to the Bench, the twin objects, viz., to eradicate delay in the trial and
to achieve the ends of justice would have to be harmonized. The Bench accordingly concluded that
the legislature had put no fetters on the power of the Magistrate and that the bail can be refused for
reasons other than those germane to the delay.

Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
In Arjun Sahu vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2008 Crl.L.J. 2771), a learned Judge of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court followed the ratio laid down in Robert Lendi (supra) and held that it is
manifestly clear that a Magistrate, after recording reasons in writing, has a right to refuse bail even
if the evidence was not completed within sixty days of the commencement of the trial. [16] The
preponderance of judicial thought therefore weighs in favour of holding that this provision does not
envisage grant of bail to an accused as a matter Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 9 of right. It may be
noted that default bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. stands on a different footing. This provision
postulates that the detention of an accused, otherwise than in the custody of the police, can be
maintained for a total period not exceeding ninety days, where the investigation relates to an offence
punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years,
and sixty days, where the investigation relates to any other offences. If the investigation is not
completed within the stipulated period, the provision states that the accused person 'shall be
released on bail' if he is prepared to do and does furnish bail. Significantly, Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. is
also worded on the same lines, in as much as it states that if the trial of the person accused of a
non-bailable offence is not concluded by the Magistrate within sixty days from the first date fixed for
taking evidence, such person 'shall be released on bail' if he has been in custody during the whole of
the said period. However, the provision does not end there and goes on to add the rider that the
Magistrate may otherwise direct by recording reasons in writing. Therefore, no indefeasible right is
conferred upon an accused to seek release on bail under this provision, on par with Section 167(2)
Cr.P.C., and it would be open to the Magistrate to refuse bail to an accused under Section 437(6)
Cr.P.C., by recording reasons as to why bail is being refused. [17] Viewed thus, in the case on hand, it
may be noted that the Trial Court was very much conscious of the proper interpretation and
application of Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. Though it was contended on behalf of the accused that bail
under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. would stand on par with default bail under section 167(2) Cr.P.C., the
Trial Court observed that it is settled that Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. is Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 10
mandatory in nature but the Magistrate could refuse to grant bail after assigning good reasons in
writing.
[18] Having noted the legal position correctly, the Trial Court then went on to note that the case
against the accused involved offences under Sections 353 and 326 IPC read with Section 34 IPC. The
Trial Court noted that the trial in Cril. (P) Case No.2 of 2020 commenced on 19.12.2020 and the
prosecution had sought adjournments twice but valid reasons were offered therefor. Examination of
PW-1 commenced only on 22.01.2021. By the date of the passing of the order, viz., 20.03.2021, the
examination of PW-1 had not even concluded and 10(ten) more prosecution witnesses were still to
be examined. Admittedly, the accused remained in custody from 04.12.2020 till that date.
[19] The Trial Court also took note of the fact that the accused had produced false medical
documents leading to dismissal of their earlier bail application in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No.30 of 2020
and that the other bail application filed by them had met with the same fate. The sequence of events
in the trial were then noted and it was observed that there was no intention to cause delay, in so far
as the State was concerned. The Trial Court then noted that there was no material produced to infer
that the accused would tamper with the prosecution evidence and influence witnesses after
enlargement on bail or to suspect that they would flee from justice. As Section 325 IPC is a bailable
offence and the offence under Section 353 IPC, though non-bailable, entailed imprisonment which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173227410/ 6
Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
may extend up to 2 years, the Trial Court opined that the accused would be entitled to be released on
bail subject to conditions. Bail was accordingly granted to the accused upon Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021
Page 11 furnishing bail bonds for a sum of `80,000/- each with one surety in the like amount, apart
from imposing other conditions: -
"(i) The sureties shall be near relatives or (from, sic) localities of the accused persons;
(ii) The accused persons shall appear before this Court on every date fixed by this
Court;
(iii) The accused shall not make any attempt to contact any prosecution witnesses
directly or indirectly;
(iv) the accused shall not try to tamper with the evidence and influence any
witnesses.
(v) The accused persons shall not commit offences similar to the offences which they
are accused of;
(vi) The accused persons shall not leave the State of Manipur without prior
permission of this Court."
[20] The learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West, reversed this order upon the application filed by the
State under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C., vide order dated 20.11.2021. Therein, after setting out the
arguments advanced by the counsel for both sides at length, the learned Sessions Judge opined that
failure to complete the trial of a non-bailable offence before a Magistrate within sixty days from the
date of the first recording of evidence would entitle the accused to seek to be released on bail under
Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. but the Magistrate can refuse bail for reasons to be recorded in writing.
Reasons such as 1) gravity of the offence; 2) whether the delay in the trial is attributable to the
accused or to the prosecution; and 3) the criminal antecedents of the accused. The learned Sessions
Judge then analyzed the record of the connected case in FIR No.19(05) 2020 with regard to the
allegation that the accused had forged cheques and their admitted failure to surrender after
revocation of their default bail by this Court in Cril. Petition Nos. 5 and 6 of 2021, and held that the
accused lacked good antecedents. He then observed that the period of punishment cannot be the
sole criteria for deciding the Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 12 gravity of the offence when the
allegation against the accused was that they had assaulted government servants on duty during the
peak of the pandemic. The learned Sessions Judge held that the case of the accused did not fall
within the purview of the beneficial provisions of Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. and they were not entitled
to be released on bail thereunder. The learned Sessions Judge accordingly set aside the order dated
20.03.2021 passed in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No.5 of 2021 and directed the accused to surrender within
a time frame. In this regard, the learned Sessions Judge placed reliance on Vipan Kumar Dhir vs.
State of Punjab [Cril. Appeal No.1161-62 of 2021 dated 04.10.2021], wherein the Supreme Court
examined the law on cancellation of bail and observed that bail can be revoked if the Court
concerned considered irrelevant factors or ignored relevant material available on record, rendering
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173227410/ 7
Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
the bail order legally untenable. Elaborating further, the Supreme Court observed that the gravity of
the offence, conduct of the accused and societal impact of undue indulgence by the Court are
amongst the situations where the superior Court can interfere with a bail order so as to bolster
administration of criminal justice. The Supreme Court further pointed out that while granting bail,
the possibility of the accused influencing prosecution witnesses, threatening family members of the
victim, fleeing from justice or creating other impediments in the fair investigation ought not to be
overlooked. [21] As already noted supra, the very same Sessions Judge, sitting as the Special Judge
(PC Act), thought it fit to grant bail to the accused in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020 just over a
month earlier, vide common order dated 01.10.2021 passed in Cril. Misc. (B) Cases No.71 and 72 of
2021. Perusal of the said order reflects that the learned Judge was very much aware, even then, of
the fact that the Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 13 accused had not surrendered after the order dated
26.03.2021 was passed by this Court in Cril. Petition Nos.5 and 6 of 2021 and that they did so only
after the Supreme Court directed them to surrender within a time frame. The learned Judge then set
out the arguments at length and opined that the consistent legal position was that when the trial was
yet to be initiated and where the charge-sheet was yet to be filed and the trial of the case is likely to
take a long period, injustice and irreparable injury would be caused to the accused by keeping them
in custody. Therefore, in spite of being well aware of the past conduct of the accused, including the
alleged fabrication of false medical documents, the learned Judge observed that, as most of the
documents had been seized, statements had been recorded but the trial was yet to commence,
further custody of the accused was not warranted as investigation could be continued even with the
accused on bail. The learned Judge accordingly allowed the application and granted bail to the
accused upon their furnishing PR bonds of `1,00,000/- each with a surety of a like amount, and
imposed the following conditions: -
"i) the accused shall co-operate with the investigation;
ii) the accused shall appear before the IO or the Court as and when directed;
iii) the accused shall not influence any of the prosecution witness;
iv) the accused shall not leave the State of Manipur without prior permission from
the Court;
v) the accused shall deposit a sum of `50,000/- by cash each;
vi) the accused shall not indulge in propaganda in print, electronic and social media
regarding this case."
Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 14
[22] Mr. M.Rarry, learned Special PP, would contend that irrespective of
the grant of bail in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020, this Court would have to be
mindful of the seriousness of the offences alleged against the accused in Cril. (P) Case
No.2 of 2020. He would point out that the government officials were undertaking
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173227410/ 8
Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
duties during the pandemic lockdown and their assault by the accused at such a time
must be viewed seriously. He would rely on case law in support of his contention that
they are not entitled to be released on bail even though the trial is stretching way
beyond sixty days.
[23] In Chandraswami and another vs. Central Bureau of Investigation {64 (1996) DLT 193}, a
learned Judge of the Delhi High Court observed that the accused in that case were not entitled to be
released on bail under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. as they had made attempts to falsify medical reports
and, therefore, the possibility of their tampering with the evidence could not be ruled out. This
decision is relied upon in the light of the fact that the accused in the case on hand also produced
false medical documents. However, it may be noted that no separate legal action has been initiated
against them in that regard and only the bail granted to them earlier was cancelled. Trite to state,
unless a criminal charge is held proved, it cannot be taken to constitute a criminal antecedent.
In Imamuddin vs. Ayub Khan and others, (1984 Cri.L.J. 117), a learned Judge of the Rajasthan High
Court dealt with the scope of Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. Though the evidence collected in that case was
circumstantial, it was held to be crucial on the question as to whether the death was suicidal or
homicidal. Further, the conduct of the accused was alleged to be highly incriminatory. The inquiry
held by the committing Magistrate tended to show the alleged criminal Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page
15 conduct of the accused. On this ground, the learned Judge cancelled the bail granted to the
accused and directed their re-arrest. Notably, this was a case arising under Section 302 IPC.
In State vs. Captain Jagjit Singh (AIR 1962 SC 253), the Supreme Court observed that the nature
and seriousness of the offence, the character of the evidence, circumstances which are peculiar to
the accused, the reasonable possibility of the presence of the accused not being secured at the trial,
reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interest of the public or
the State would arise when the Court is considering grant of bail in a non-bailable offence.
In Juber Khan vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, (MCrC-29418/2020 dated 01.03.2021), a learned Judge
of the Madhya Pradesh High Court noted that other offences had also been registered against the
accused and that the delay in the trial was caused due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and,
accordingly, upheld the order of the Magistrate rejecting the bail application of the accused under
Section 437(6) Cr.P.C.
In Centrum Financial Services Limited vs. State of NCT of Delhi and another (Criminal Appeal
No.94 of 2022 dated 28.01.2022), the Supreme Court was dealing with a case involving offences
under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468 and 120 B IPC. The Supreme Court found that the High Court
had not at all adverted to or considered the nature of the accusations and the material collected
during the course of the investigation and the serious allegation of siphoning of huge amounts
through shell companies while granting bail to the accused. Reference was made to Prasanta Kumar
Sarkar vs. Ashis Chatterjee and Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 16 another, {(2010) 14 SCC 496},
wherein it was observed that the factors to be borne in mind, amongst others, while considering an
application for bail are

Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
i) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed
the offence; ii) nature and gravity of the accusation; iii) severity of the punishment in the event of
conviction; iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if released on bail; v) character,
behaviour, means, position and standing of the accused; vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated;
viii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being influenced; and viii) danger, of course, of
justice, being thwarted by grant of bail. As the High Court had not at all considered the modus
operandi adopted by the accused in the commission of the serious offence of siphoning and/or
transferring of huge sums through shell companies, the Supreme Court cancelled the bail granted to
the accused.
In Ms.Y vs. State of Rajasthan and another (Criminal Appeal No.649 of 2022 dated 19.04.2022), the
Supreme Court referred to earlier case law on the issue of grant of bail and its cancellation and
observed that it is essential for the Court dealing with such applications to furnish reasons
specifically which would indicate as to what precipitated the passing of that particular order. On that
ground, the bail granted to the accused by the High Court was cancelled.
In Mahipal vs. Rajesh Kumar @ Polia and another (Criminal Appeal No.1843 of 2019 dated
05.12.2019), the Supreme Court observed that the fitness of a case for grant of bail would involve
balancing of numerous factors amongst which, the nature of the offence, the severity of the
punishment and prima facie view of involvement of the accused, would be important. Noting that no
straightjacket formula exists for Courts to assess an application for bail, the Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021
Page 17 Supreme Court held that a Court would not be required to enter into a detailed analysis of
the evidence on record to establish beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the crime as that
would be a matter for trial but the Court would be required to examine whether there is a prima
facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence and on a balance
of the considerations involved, whether the continued custody of the accused would sub-serve the
purpose of the criminal justice system. It was further observed that when bail has been granted by a
lower Court, the Appellate Court must be slow to interfere and ought to be guided by the principles
set out for exercise of such power. Reference in this regard was made to Prasanta Kumar Sarkar
(supra). The Supreme Court went on to state that an Appellate Court would be required to consider
whether the order granting bail suffers from non-application of mind or is not borne out from a
prima facie view of the evidence on record and, therefore, it would be necessary for the Court to
assess whether, on the basis of evidentiary record, there exists a prima facie or reasonable ground to
believe that the accused had committed the crime while taking into account, seriousness of the
crime and severity of the punishment. [24] As already noted supra, the accused were granted bail in
relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020 even though the learned Special Judge was well aware of their past
conduct in the context of producing false medical documents and also avoiding arrest until they
surrendered upon the direction of the Supreme Court. Having granted them such relief, the very
same learned Judge, acting as the learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West, relied upon that very past
conduct to deny them the benefit of bail in relation to Cril. (P) Case No.2 of 2020. When the said
conduct did not carry enough weight in relation to FIR No.19(05) 2020, to which it actually
Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 18 related, such conduct could not have been imported into the case
relating to FIR No.14(04) 2020 and be held against the accused. That apart, it may be noted that the
offences alleged against the accused in Cril. (P) Case No.2 of 2020 are under Sections 325 and 353

Laishram Suresh vs The State Of Manipur on 24 May, 2022
IPC. The offence under Section 325 IPC relates to voluntarily causing grievous hurt and is a bailable
offence, entailing imprisonment which may extend up to 7 years apart from fine. Section 353 IPC is
a non-bailable offence pertaining to assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from
discharging duties but the punishment therefor is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2
years or with fine or both. Though the nature of the offence is rather grave, as it involves the assault
or use of force against an official on duty, the fact remains that the law makers did not think that it
was serious enough to deserve a more severe punishment. It may be noted that the State of
Maharashtra amended the law in this regard and enhanced the punishment under this provision to
a maximum of 5 years imprisonment but the general law, as applicable in the State of Manipur,
remains unaltered. Therefore, the seriousness of the offences alleged and the punishment prescribed
therefor are not sufficiently weighty enough to warrant the continued incarceration of the accused
pending the trial and there is no possibility of the same concluding any time soon as 10(ten) more
witnesses are still to be examined. In Union of India vs. K.A.Najeeb [(2021) 3 SCC 713], the Supreme
Court held that the Constitutional right to speedy trial would prevail over the stringent statutory
provisions of even the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967. That apart, it may be noted that the
accused have been at large for some time now but it is not the State's case that they have tried to
tamper with the evidence or witnesses or breached any of the conditions imposed by the Trial Court
while granting them bail Cril.Petn.No.44 of 2021 Page 19 under Section 437(6) Cr.P.C. Therefore,
their subsequent conduct also did not warrant any interference with the bail order.
[25] On the above analysis, this Court holds that the learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West, Manipur,
erred in setting aside the bail order dated 20.03.2021 passed in Cril. Misc.(B) Case No.5 of 2021.
The Criminal Petition is accordingly allowed, setting aside the order dated 20.11.2021 passed by the
learned Sessions Judge, Imphal West, in Cril. Misc. Case No.100 of 2021 and restoring the bail order
dated 20.03.2021 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Imphal West-I, under
Section 437(6) Cr.P.C, in Cril. Misc.(B) Case No.5 of 2021.
