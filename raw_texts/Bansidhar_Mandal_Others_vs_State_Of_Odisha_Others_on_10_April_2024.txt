Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
2. In 1990 Sikharchandi U.P.(M.E) School was established. On 25.03.1994 the Managing Committee
of the School requested the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation to take over the School.
The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation decided to take over the management of the School and
accordingly passed various resolutions starting with resolution dated 31.03.1995 and thereafter
some resolutions till 31.07.200.
On 13.11.2000, the Chief Executive Officer informed the Government about taking over the
management of the petitioners' school by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation. An amount of
Rs.4.00 lakhs was sanctioned in favour of the petitioners' school by the Corporation for the year
2001-2002.
On 23.01.2003, an advertisement was issued by the Government to open new primary and Upper
Primary Schools. On 30.07.2008 the State Government decided to take over the School and include
it under the Sarva Sikshya Abhiyan (hereinafter for short SSA) Scheme and declare the school as
Project Primary School.
On 21.08.2008 the Managing Committee of the School passed a resolution to hand over the School
building, management, staff (petitioners) to the District Project Coordinator, Odisha Primary
Education Programme Authority (OPEPA), Khurda (opposite party no.5). On 16.02.2008 the
untrained teachers were directed by opposite party no.1 to avail in-service training and acquire the
teacher training qualification. 2.1 On 23.12.2008 the petitioners along with other employees made a
representation for taking over the management of the petitioner's school and since no action was
taken, some of the employees/teachers of the School approached this Court by filing W.P.(C)
No.17411 of 2008. The said writ petition was disposed of by order dated 20.02.2009, wherein, the
petitioners were directed to file representations before the Director, OPEPA within six weeks with
all relevant documents and upon receipt of such representations the opposite party was directed to
pass necessary orders within four months. The relevant portion of the said order dated 20.02.2009
is reproduced herein :
"After hearing learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for the
opposite parties this Court feels that if in fact Sikharchandi U.P.(M.E) School which
is existing since 1990 has been taken over by OPEPA and the said school can cater the
education need of slum area, there is no necessity for establishing a new Primary
School. On the other hand, if the school is not in a position to cater the educational
need of the slum area and has not been taken over by OPEPA, it would be open to the
authorities to pass such orders as felt necessary. That apart, the grievance of the
petitioners involves disputed questions of fact, which cannot be effectually
adjudicated under writ jurisdiction. This Court, therefore, disposes of the writ
petition giving liberty to the petitioners to file representations before the Director,
OPEPA-opposite party no.3 within a period of six weeks hence enclosing all relevant
documents along with staff position, date of establishment of the school and the
order of taking over the School under Sarva Sikhya Abhijan by OPEPA if such
representations are filed the said opposite party shall apply his mind and if satisfied
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 2
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
that the School is existing and has approved and qualified staff and the same can
cater the educational need of slum area, shall pass necessary orders within four
months from the date of filing of the representations by the petitioners."
2.2 Pursuant to the order passed by this Court the opposite party no.2 directed the District Project
Co-ordinator, OPEPA to conduct a joint enquiry and take necessary action in accordance to the
report of the Joint enquiry and the decision taken in the committee meeting. 2.3 On 04.06.2011 the
District Inspector of Schools, Bhubaneswar issued a letter for consideration for absorption of the
petitioners as 'Sikshya Sahayak'. On 06.09.2011 the High Power Committee after due deliberation
and consideration pursuant to the order of the High Court recommended to take over the
management of the petitioners' school with observation to absorb the teachers as Sikshya Sahayak
w.e.f.
30.07.2008, i.e., the date of declaration of the School as Project primary school (Annexure-16).
On 07.02.2013 (Annexure-17 series) the Govt. in the Department communicated decision to take
over the management of the petitioner's school and declare the said school as Project upper Primary
School under SSA. Subsequently another letter was issued on 19.03.2013 wherein the school was
declared as Project Upper Primary School under SSA w.e.f. 30.07.2008 (Annexure- 17 series).
2.4 On 14.05.2013 decision was taken by the Government to absorb the teachers then working in the
petitioners' Institution as Sikshya Sahayak (Trained and Untrained) and two Untrained Teacher
were allowed to undergo in service teachers' training in year 2013-14.
On 25.11.2013 as per report of the Joint Enquiry conducted by the opposite parties, the trained
teachers of the Sikharchandi UP (ME) School were recommended to be absorbed as Sikshya
Sahayaks and the untrained teacher were to be absorbed after acquiring the training qualification
within three years. 2.5 Somehow the matter was set for reconsideration and on 14.02.2014 the High
Power Committee constituted by the Govt again recommended for absorption of trained teachers of
the petitioners' school as Sikshya Sahayaks w.e.f. 30.07.2008 and the untrained teachers as Sikshya
Sahayaks after acquiring teachers' training qualification by 01.04.2015.
2.6 On 30.06.2014 while the matter stood thus the opposite party no.1 passed an order 'recalling'
earlier orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 purportedly on the basis of the decision passed in
Civil Appeal No.2104 of 2004 (Director, Elementary Education & Another v. Dibakar Pradhan
(Annexure-19).
2.7 Earlier on 27.02.2007 in the case of a similar school, i.e., Gopabandhu Primary School at
Bharatpur, Khurda, the State Government had not only to taken over the school but also allowed the
existing staff to continue as Sikshya Sahayaks (Annexure-20).

3. It is submitted by learned senior counsel that the order dated 30.6.2014
(Annexure-19) impugned before this Court is not in consonance of the earlier

4. It is submitted that the last paragraph of the order impugned is not in sync with
the earlier observation made in paragraphs 1 to 4 as the order dated 30.06.2014 does

U.P.(M.E.) School earlier.

Pursuant to the said order dated 29.03.2022 additional affidavit dated 25.07.2022 has been filed on
behalf of opposite party no.1-State represented through the Secretary Department of School and

This Court has gone through the pleadings, the chronological chart of events and notes of
submissions filed by the parties. ` Submissions on behalf of the petitioners
7. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submits that giving effect to the orders dated
07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 of the State Government, the opposite party no.5 directed Block
Resource Cluster Centre Coordinator (BRCC) and Sub Inspector (S.I.) of School, SSA, Khordha for
admission of untrained Elementary School Teachers like Bharati Sahoo (petitioner no.6) and
Prasanna Kumar Routray (Petitioner no.7) in first year of Diploma in Elementary Education
(D.El.Ed) Course through, Distance Education Programme (D.E.P.) for the Sessions 2013-2014, to
provide inservice training. Much thereafter, the impugned order dated 30.06.2014 was passed by
the then Secretary wherein the earlier orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 were cancelled
without taking into consideration the earlier decision and consequential orders of the State
Government giving effect to the decisions dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013.
The impugned order is not in consonance with the earlier decision of the Government for taking
over the petitioners' school, one U.P.(M.E.) School namely Orient Colliery M.E. School and
Gopabandhu Primary School at Bharatpur, Khurda; therefore the action of the Government vis-à-vis
the present petitioners (Staff of Sikharchandi UP(ME) School) is discriminatory as there is no
intelligible differentia between the employees of Orient Colliery M.E. School and Gopabandhu
Primary School on one hand and Sikharchandi UP(ME) School on the other, to be treated
differently. 7.1 It is further submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners that the letter
dated 07.02.2013 as well as 19.03.2013 is not just mere communication rather the same is
communication of conscious decision of the State Government in the department of School and
Mass Education taken pursuant to the order passed by this Court in W.P.(C) No.17411 of 2008, also
keeping in view the recommendation of the committee duly constituted for consideration of various
aspects regarding taking over of the management of the petitioners' school. 7.2 It is submitted that
decision as contained in/ communicated by letters date 07.02.2013 and 19.02.2013, is in
consonance with the Govt. of Oisha Rules of Business.

7.3 It is contended that basing on the inputs regarding possible discrepancies after taking over the
School, the School and Mass Education Department decided to reconsider the proposal for taking
over the Shikarchandi U.P.(M.E.) School. Accordingly, on 14.2.2014 meeting of the reconstituted
committee was convened, wherein, the said committee after due & detailed deliberation, again
recommended for taking over of Shikarchandi U.P.(M.E.) School by the Government.
Submissions on behalf of the opposite parties
8. Since the facts remain uncontroverted, the opposite parties have raised only the legal contentions
against the prayer made in the writ petition which are as follows :
A noting or a decision in a file only gets culminated into an order affecting the rights
of a party when it is expressed in the name of the Governor and authenticated in the
manner provided under Article 166 (2). The decision of the S & M.E Department vide
its letter/office order No.3326/SME dated 07.02.2013 does not culminate into order
affecting rights of the petitioner, as it is without consultation with the Finance
Department under Rule 10 of the Orissa Government Rules of Business made under
Article 166 of the Constitution of India. 8.1 Rule 10 of the Orissa Government Rules
of Business Made Under Article 166 of the Constitution of India stipulates that no
department shall without previous consultation of the Finance Department authorize
any order which will affect finances of the State. The said Rule is extracted herein
below :
"10.(1) No department shall without previous consultation with the Finance
Department authorize any orders (other than orders pursuant to any general
delegations made by the Finance Department) which either immediately or by their
repercussions will affect the finances of the State or which in particular, either-
a. relate to the number or grading or cadres of posts or the emoluments or other
conditions of service or post; or b. involve any grant of land or assignment of revenue
or concession, grant lease or licence of mineral or forest rights or a right to
water-power or any easement or privilege in respect of such concession; or c. in any
way involve any relinquishment of revenue. (2) No proposal which requires previous
consultation with the Finance Department under sub-rule(1) of this rule but in which
the Finance Department has not concurred, may be proceeded with unless a decision
to that effect has been taken by the cabinet."
(emphasis supplied in original by the OPs) 8.2 It is submitted that the decision of the S&ME
Department vide its letter/office order no.3326/SME dated 07.02.2013 affects the finances of the
State and directly relates to number of posts of service. As such the decision is clearly governed by
Rule 10 of the Rules of Business. The decision in letter/office order no.3326/SME dated 07.02.2013
was not proceeded by any consultation with the Finance Department as required under Rule-10(1)
of the Rules of Business. 8.3 The decision in letter/office order no.3326/SME dated 07.02.2013 not
proceeded by "a decision to that effect by the Cabinet." A Cabinet as defined under Rule-4 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 6
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
Orissa Government Rules of Business means "the Committee of the Council of Ministers specified in
Rule 4- A". Rule-4A "shall be a Committee of the Council of Ministers to be called the Cabinet which
shall consist of the Ministers". The Cabinet, therefore, refers to the entire Committee of Council of
Ministers and not to an individual Minister, that too a Minister of State. 8.4 The decision of the
Government in its letter/office order no.3326/SME dated 07.2.2013 has not complied and is not in
accordance with Rule 10 of the Rules of Business. Resultantly, it has not been sanctified and acted
upon by issuing an order in accordance with Articles 166 of the Constitution. Therefore, the said
decision does not get culminated into an order affecting right of the parties.
8.5 It is contended, as is settled law, the decision in letter/office order no.3326/SME dated
07.02.2013 can always be reviewed/reversed/overruled or overturned and the government has no
legal impediment in doing so. The petitioner cannot pray that the Hon'ble Court must take
cognizance of the earlier noting or decision for exercise of the power of judicial review. 8.6 The
decision of the S&ME Department vide its order no.13985/SME dated 30.06.2014 would not
culminate into rights for the petitioner as it has not been effected in terms of Rule-10 of the Orissa
Government Rules of Business under Article 166 by consulting the Finance Department.
8.7 It is submitted that on 08.08.2013 the Minister of State, S&ME Department directed that
Finance Department shall be consulted by recording the following in the file's note sheet :
"... 2 Let the matter be examined once again by the committee formed earlier in
obedience to the direction of the Hon'ble High Court in W.P.(C) No.17411/08...
3. Views of Finance Department and Law Department be obtained"
[Emphasis Supplied] It is contended when the Finance Department was consulted on 03.04.2014, it
did not grant its approval for the takeover of the Shikharchandi U.P.(M.E.) School.
Decision making process culminated into the Order No.13985/SME dated 30.06.2014 that is
impugned and as such, the said order is in accordance with the Rule 10 of Article 166 of the
Constitution and culminates into an order affecting rights of the petitioner.
The provisions of the Constitution of India and the relevant Acts and Rules
9. Article 166 of the Constitution of India which has a direct bearing on the issues raised for
adjudication is reproduced below :

Case Law cited at the Bar
14. The learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State has referred to the following decisions as
far as the submissions of the State on the questions of law are concerned :
In State of Uttaranchal v. Sunil Kumar Vaish :
(2011) 8 SCC 670, affirmed in Mahadeo & others v.
Sovan Devi and others, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1118 (Para-15) encapsulates the law :
"24. A noting recorded in the file is merely a noting simpliciter and nothing more. It
merely represents expression of opinion by the particular individual. By no stretch of
imagination, such noting can be treated as a decision of the Government. Even if the
competent authority records its opinion in the file on the merits of the matter under
consideration, the same cannot be termed as a decision of the Government unless it is
sanctified and acted upon by issuing an order in accordance with Articles 77(1) and
(2) or Articles 166 (1) and (2). The noting in the file or even a decision gets
culminated into an order affecting right of the parties only when it is expressed in the
name of the President or the Governor, as the case may be, and authenticated in the
manner provided in Article 77(2) or Article 166 (2). A noting or even a decision
recorded in the file can always be reviewed/reversed/overruled or overturned and the
court cannot take cognizance of the earlier noting or decision for exercise of the

power of judicial review.
(See State of Punjab v.Sodhi Sukhdev Singh AIR 1061 SC 493 Bachhitar Singh v.
State of Punjab, AIR 1963 SC 395, State of Bihar v. Kripalu Shankar (1987) 3 SCC 34,

v.
DDA (2009) 1 SCC 180 and Shanti Sports Club v. Union of India (2009) 15 SCC 705) The learned
ASC also relies on the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mahadeo and others v.
Sovan Devi and others : 2022 SCC Online SC 1118.
Analysis and Conclusion
15. The law has been well settled for the last so many years that when an order is passed in exercise
of a statutory power on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons mentioned in the
orders. Those reasons cannot be supplemented by other reasons through an affidavit or otherwise.
Were this not so, an order otherwise bad in law at the very outset may get validated through
additional grounds later brought out in the form of an affidavit.
This principle of law laid down in Commissioner of Police v. Gordhan Das Bhanji : AIR 1952 SC 16 :
1951 SCC 1088 & again in Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commission : (1978)
1 SCC 405 has been reiterated by the Supreme Court on several occasions in several
decisions, running like a golden thread in different contexts. One such recent
decision being Opto Circuits (India) Ltd. v. Axis Bank : (2021) 6 SCC 707 : AIR 2021
SC 753 (Para-12 of SCC) :
12. The action sought to be sustained should be with reference to the contents of the
impugned order/communication and the same cannot be justified by improving the
same through the contention raised in the objection statement or affidavit filed
before the Court. This has been succinctly laid down by this Court in Mohinder Singh
Gill v. Chief Election Commr. [Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commr., (1978)
1 SCC 405] as follows :
(SCC p. 417, para 8) "8. The second equally relevant matter is that when a statutory
functionary makes an order based on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by
the reasons so mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape
of affidavit or otherwise.
Otherwise, an order bad in the beginning may, by the time it comes to court on account of a
challenge, gets validated by additional grounds later brought out. We may here draw attention to the
observations of Bose, J. in Gordhandas Bhanji [Commr. of Police v. Gordhandas Bhanji, 1951 SCC
1088] : (SCC p. 1095, para 9) '9. ... public orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority
cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 15
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
of what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do. Public orders made by
public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the actings and conduct
of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the
language used in the order itself.' Orders are not like old wine becoming better as they grow older."
In fact, in the instant case such contention of having exercised power under Section 102 CrPC has
not been put forth even in the counter-affidavit, either in this appeal or before the High Court and
has only been the attempted ingenuity of the learned Additional Solicitor General. Such contention,
therefore, cannot be accepted. In fact, in the objection statement filed before the High Court much
emphasis has been laid on the power available under the PMLA and the same being exercised
though without specifically referring to the power available under Section 17 of the PMLA.
Records of the Government
16. To test merits of the contention raised on behalf of State-O.Ps as noted above, in terms of the
principles laid in Mohinder Singh Gill (supra) and Gordhandas Bhanji (supra) reiterated in Opto
Circuits (supra) the original records of the Government, where the matter has been dealt and
decisions have been taken as contained in the office file 'No.I-SME-G-98/12' were produced by the
Government for perusal of this Court.
17. In view of the rival contentions raised at the bar pertaining to the three 'decisions taken by the
Government' in School & Mass Education Department, by orders dated 07.02.2013, 19.03.2013 and
30.06.2014, in considered opinion of this Court the following questions have arisen to be answered
by this Court :
(i) Whether in terms of Government Odisha Rules of Business the orders dated
07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 of the State Government can be termed/treated; as orders
of the Govt, thereby the consequences thereof have to follow;
(ii) Whether the order dated 29.01.2013 of the Minister of State (Independent Charge) heading the
Department of School & Mass Education is to be treated as orders of the Government;
(iii) Whether the said orders being orders of the Government confer any rights on the petitioners;
(iv) Whether in terms of the Govt. Rules of Business the order dated 30.06.2014 issued by the
Secretary-in-charge of the Government Department can be treated as a order of Government;
(v) If the order dated 30.06.2014 by the Secretary to the Govt is treated as the order of the
Government, by the said order, can the earlier order of the Govt. dated 29.01.2013 and letters dated
07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 could have been recalled and a fresh order could have been passed ?
18. Applying the principles laid down in Gordhandas Bhanji (supra) the notes/writings in the file
produced by the Government are reproduced and considered following the norms judicial review.

180 (at paragraph-14 of SCC) it was held :
"14. It is trite to state that notings in a departmental file do not have the sanction of
law to be an effective order. A noting by an officer is an expression of his viewpoint
on the subject. It is no more than an opinion by an officer for internal use and
consideration of the other officials of the department and for the benefit of the final
decision-making authority. Needless to add that internal notings are not meant for
outside exposure. Notings in the file culminate into an executable order, affecting the
rights of the parties, only when it reaches the final decision- making authority in the
department, gets his approval and the final order is communicated to the person
concerned."

23. Applying the principles laid down in Sethi Auto Service (supra) (paragraph-14 of
SCC) the notes in the file culminated in an executable order affecting rights of the
parties after the Minister (Independent Charge) who is the final decision making
authority in the Department, gave his approval by his order dated 21.01.2013 and
final order got communicated by letter no.3326 dated 07.02.2013 to Special Project

Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
The reasons those can be culled out and are also evident in the detailed notes made in
the file, finally that of the Commissioner-cum-Secretary justifying the decision to
accept recommendations of the Committee to the Govt., to take over the
Sikharchandi U.P.(M.E.) School under 'Sarva Sikshya Abhiyan' as a project Upper
Primary School, to absorb trained teachers as 'Sikshya Sahayaks' and untrained
teachers as 'Gana Sikshyakas' can be summerised as follows :
(i) It is a policy decision of the Government in the framework for implementation of
'Sarva Sikshya Abhiyan' (SSA) Ministry of Human Resource Development,
Department of School Education and Literacy, Government of India. Para-2.5, under
SSA providing for new Primary and Upper Primary School within the area of and
limits of neighbourhood;
(ii) Policy as laid down by the State Government under State Right to Education
Rules. The State RCFCE Rules Part-IV para-6(1)(b) provides : in respect of children
in classes-VI-VIII a school shall be established within a walking distance of 3 kms of
neighbourhood;
(iii) No U.P. School is running within 3 kms of the Sikharchandi U.P. (M.E) School.
The School is running in its own building of seven Class rooms and one Office room,
catering to the students of slum area;
(iv) The OPEPA has already declared the school as project U.P. School with the
existing infrastructure and student strength w.e.f. 30.07.2008;
(v) Previously Gopabandhu Primary School, Bharatpur, Bhubaneswar (slum area)
has been taken over by Govt. under SSA Scheme and only the trained teachers of the
said school were absorbed as Sikshya Sahayaks;
(vi) The trained teachers working in the Sikharchandhi U.P. (M.E.) School are to be
absorbed as 'Sikshya Sahayaks' and untrained teachers shall acquire training by
Distance Education within three years and till then will work as 'Gana Sikhasyaks'.
In considered opinion of this Court all the above reasons are relevant and valid for consideration of
the issue of taking over of the U.P. (M.E.) School by the Government.
24. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Birla Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills (1968) 3 SCR 251 :
AIR 1968 SC 1232, the Supreme Court answered the common questions relating to
the constitutionality of delegation of taxing powers to Municipal Corporations and
the effect of Validation Act, passed by Parliament in connection with tax on the
consumption and sale of electricity levied by M.C.D. One of the contentions raised
before Supreme Court in the challenge to imposition of tax was that sanction by the
Government was not in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 25
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
Supreme Court negatived the said contention by considering the facts of that case, as
observed in paragraph-40 of the SCR, which is quoted herein :
"40. Then it is urged that the sanction by the Government was not in accordance with
the provisions of the Constitution and that in this case the sanction was given by the
Deputy Secretary to the Government who obviously had no authority to do so. We are
of opinion that there is no force in this contention. The order conveying sanction
specifically says that "the Central Government hereby sanctions the resolution passed
by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi under sub-section (1) of Section 150". It is true
that the order is signed by the Deputy Secretary but that does not mean that it was
the Deputy Secretary who sanctioned the rates. It is also true that the words "by the
order of the Central Government" or "by the order of the President" are not there
above the signature of the Deputy Secretary and the authentication therefore is not
quite in accordance with the provisions of Article 77 of the Constitution, but that
deficiency has been made up by the affidavit filed on behalf of the Central
Government in which it is stated that the resolution was approved by the then Deputy
Home Minister and the Minister in the Ministry of Home Affairs to whom the work
relating to the Corporation was assigned by the Home Minister. Reliance in this
connection was placed on the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules,
1961, passed on January 14, 1961 to the effect that "in relation to the business allotted
to a Minister, another Minister or Deputy Minister may be associated to perform
such functions as may be assigned to him". That in our opinion clearly means that a
Cabinet Minister may be assisted in the performance of functions allotted to him by
another Minister or Deputy Minister. It is not necessary where business has been
assigned by a Cabinet Minister to a Minister or a Deputy Minister that the matter
should be put before the Cabinet Minister also after the Minister or the Deputy
Minister has approved of it in accordance with the assignment made in his favour.
We are therefore of the opinion that the sanction has been given by the Central
Government as required by the Act."
[Emphasis supplied]
25. In considered opinion of this Court, read along with the Article 166 of the Constitution, the
OGRB Rules 4A, 5, 7, 9 (1), First Schedule of the OGRB; entries 2, 3, 4 of Table VI(A), and the
instructions issued by the Governor para 1.IV would, lead to an irresistible conclusion that the
'Business of Govt.' regarding the petitioners' claim pertains to the department of School and Mass
Education, i.e., in-charge of the Minister of State (independent charge), department of School and
Mass Education, it was placed before him for obtaining 'Govt. Orders' and he dealt with it by passing
order dated 29.01.2023. Therefore, it has to be held that said decision of the Minister was the
decision and order of the State Government. Significantly, the communication to the petitioners, by
letters dated 07.03.2013 and the subsequent communication by letter dated 19.03.2013 to the other
authorities were ordered in the file by referring to the decision of the Minister as 'Government
Order' and issued with the letter head of the Government in the School and Mass Education
Department (Annexure-17 Series).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 26
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
26. It is further noticed that the order dated 07.02.2013 as well as the order dated 19.03.2013 were
in fact pursuant to the decision of the committee formed by the Government for the purpose headed
by the Special Project Director, Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority (SPD, OPEPA),
having other members such as Additional Secretary, School and Mass Education Department the
representative of the Finance Department (Under Secretary to Government) and Deputy Director
(Planning), Directorate of Elementary Education, Odisha. Therefore, the contention that the
Finance Department was not consulted is found and held to be not correct.
27. By applying the tests laid down in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (supra), it has to be held that
the orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 are Government orders having been given assent by the
Minister-in-charge on 29.01.2013. The subsequent order dated 30.06.2014 having not been
assented to by the Minister-in-charge in a similar manner can not be held to be an order of the
Government.
If the principles enunciated in State of Uttaranchal (supra), relied upon by O.P.-State are applied,
the order dated 30.06.2014 is to be treated/held as noting in the file. By applying the said test the
earlier orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 are to be said to have been issued in accordance
with Articles 166 (1) and (2). As already indicated, it is evident that no order by Government,
supported by reasons, modifying the decision of the Government order dated 29.01.2013 was ever
made after communication of the Government order dated 29.01.2013 to petitioners, other
stakeholders and various Government authorities. Therefore, the subsequent 'reconsideration'
stated in the file and initiated with notes of an Officer, the notings of the Minister following the
notes of the officer cannot be held to be order of the Government.
28. As per instruction-2 contained in part-1 of the instructions issued by the Governor being
empowered by Rule-14 of the OGRB, the functions of the Government in the Department of School
& Mass Education had been allocated by the Governor to the Minister of State (Independent
Charge). The first schedule of the OGRB, made vide Rule-4 provides allocation of business of Govt.
regarding Primary Education, Secondary Education including Secondary Schools, Teacher
Education & Training, all Teachers' Training Programmes, Control of all officer and staff served
under the Department of School to the SME Department.
Significantly, the OGRB Rules 8(1) and Rule 4A provide that the matter(s) involving the present lis
belong to the First Schedule and is not ordinarily required to be considered at a meeting of a
Cabinet. The Rule-5 of the OGRB, 1956 further clarifies that the business of the Government in the
Department of School & Mass Education has been assigned by the Governor on the advice of the
Chief Minister to the charge of a Minister of State. Therefore, as per the principles laid down in
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (supra) the order of the Minister dated 29.01.2013 is Government
Order and not a noting in the file as argued by opposite parties.
29. Rule-9 (1) of the OGRB provides that the Minister of State in-charge of a Department or a
branch or branches thereof shall be primarily responsible for the disposal of business appertaining
that department or branch.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 27
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
As noted above, the allocation of business amongst the School and Mass Education Department
comes within the 'First Schedule' of OGRB and Rule-4 of the OGRB provides that the business of the
School and Mass Education Department shall be transacted in the Department. Primary Education
finds place in Table-VI-A of First Schedule, the relevant entries are 2, 3, 4 and 6. It is also noticed
that none of those entries such as 2, 3, 4 and 6 find place in the 'Second Schedule' of OGRB nor any
matter similar to those entries are there in 'Second Schedule' of the OGRB.
Therefore, the contention of the OPs that the matter was required to be placed for decision of the
'Cabinet' has to be rejected as per the provisions of OGRB which prescribes matters in the 'Second
Schedule' are to be placed before Cabinet. As indicated and quoted above, the Governor under
Rule-14 of the OGRB has issued instructions for more convenient transaction of the business of the
Government of Odisha. Part-1 para-1.IV of the said instructions provides that the Minister of State
in-charge appointed by the Governor is to be in-charge of the Department of Government or branch
thereof to which the case belongs.
30. In the case at hand, the Commissioner-cum- Secretary to the Government, Department of
School & Mass Education along with his detailed notes dated 30.11.2012 placed the matter before
the Minister in charge of the Department for orders, referring to the preceding notes of the Special
Secretary dated 29.11.2012. The notes of the Commissioner-cum- Secretary dated 30.11.2012 those
were laid, culminated in the order of the Minister of State (Independent Charge), School & Mass,
Odisha by order dated 29th January, 2013 of the Minister approving the same 'as proposed' (by the
Commissioner-cum-Secretary). In terms of the specific provisions of OGRB read with the Rules
made by the Governor as quoted above the order of the Minister resulted in the Govt. order.
The Section Officer referred to the order of the Minister as 'Govt. Orders at pre-page' in note sheet :
dated 2.2.2013. The said notes of the Section Officer referring the 'Govt. orders' were
routed through the Under Secretary and resulted in issuance of letter No. 3326 dated
07.02.2013 by the Govt. in the SME Department to the Special Project Director,
OPEPA. Letter No. 3326 dated 07.02.2013 was further followed by/led to the letter
No. 7230 dated 19.03.2013 (Annexure-17) issued by Govt. of Odisha, Department of
School & Mass Education in continuation of the earlier letter No. 3326 dated
7.2.2013. In considered opinion of this Court the decision of the Minister dated
29.01.2013, followed by the orders/communication dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013
satisfy the tests laid down in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (supra) as well as Sethi
Auto Services (supra) and also enunciated in State of Uttaranchal (supra).
31. Concededly the subsequent notes/opinion written by the Minister-in-charge
dated 06.08.2013 was a reiteration of the earlier notes of the officers to the effect that
the matter has to be examined once again by the committee formed earlier. As
indicated in the note sheet at page-6 of the Govt. file the Committee headed by the
State Project Director, OPEPA vide Office Order no.22218 dated 14.11.2008 was
assigned to consider the case of the petitioner. The said aspect has been noted by
order of this Court dated 14.12.2023.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 28
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
32. The learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned counsel for the State
have also agreed regarding the formation of the Committee by letter no.22218 dated
14.11.2008 which is reproduced herein :
"GOVERNMENT OF ORISSA SCHOOL & MASS EDUCATON DEPARTMENT
No.22218/ SME., Dt. 14.11.08 IISME-OC-2/08 OFFICE ORDER In pursuance of the
orders No.9 dt. 10.11.07 of Hon'ble High Court of Orissa passed in OJC
No.3846/2000 and orders No.3 dtd.30.7.08 passed in WP(C) No.7592/03 govt. after
careful consideration have been pleased to constitute a committee with following
members to examine the viability of private managed primary schools to declare as
Project Primary School and furnish their recommendation to Govt. within one month
from the date of issue of the order for consideration of the proposal.
1. Commissioner-cum-SPD, OPEPA - Chairman

Memo No. /dt.14.11.08 Copy forwarded to Director, Elementary Education, Orissa
Deptt. for information and necessary action. He is requested to provide all required
information/document to the Committee within the stipulated period.
Deputy Secretary to Govt."
Significantly enough, the Committee after detailed deliberation as indicated above decided for
absorption of the seven petitioners in the writ petition i.e. four trained teachers as 'Sikshasahayak'
and three untrained teachers as 'Ganasikshyaka' with effect from 30.07.2008. Subsequently another
Committee having different persons as members by their posts held/designation also made the
similar recommendation in favour of the petitioners.
33. On perusal of the original files and also indicated in the counter filed by the State, it is noticed
that before the purported 'reconsideration' by the Government starting with a note of the Section
Officer dated 16.03.2013 and 15.07.2013, there has been no decision of the Government to
'reconsider' the earlier decision post Government order dated 29.01.2013 that was communicated by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66266526/ 29
Bansidhar Mandal & Others vs State Of Odisha & Others ........ ... on 10 April, 2024
letter dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013. What could be the reason for such reconsideration has not
been stated in the relevant portion of the file nor it is indicated that any decision has been taken by
the Govt. to reconsider. Rather no discernible reason has been shown to be available to take a view
opposite to that of the earlier Government Order with the reasons well discussed and elaborated in
the file notings as summed up in paragraph-23 above.
From perusal of the series of notings in the file, starting from the Section Officer to that of the
Commissioner-cum-Secretary dated 29.05.2014 upto referral of the matter to the Finance
Department and the opinion dated 04.06.2014 (Page-63 of file) no discernable objective reason is
evident anywhere, which also includes the note of the Minister dated 06.08.2013 which is
reproduced below (at page-45 of the note sheet) :
"The District Administration/D.P.C., Khurda be asked to maintain status-quo in this
aspect.
2. Let the matter be examined once again by the Committee formed earlier in
obedience to the direction of the Hon'ble High Court in W.P.(C) No.17411/08,
Banshidhar Mandal & others and order dated 24.12.2010 passed in W.P.(C)
No.13874/09 Lilupama Behera & others.
3. Views of Finance Department and Law Department be obtained.
Sd/-
06.08.2013.
Seal of the Minister of State (Independent Charge) School & Mass Education,
Odisha."
34. Applying the tests laid down in Gordhan Das Bhanji (supra), and Mohinder Singh Gill (supra)
reiterated in Opto Circuits (supra), supplementary/subseqeunt reasons those may have been
furnished before this Court for so called 'reconsideration' would not come to aid of sustaining the
'reconsideration' and the purported 'reconsideration' is held to be bad in law and set aside.
35. In view of the above discussions, the impugned order dated 30.06.2014 by the
Commissioner-cum- Secretary is held not validly passed and the order is set aside. As a consequence
thereof, the orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 (quoted supra) are held to be valid and
operative for all purposes. The entitlements that would accrue to the petitioners as consequences of
the orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013, the further benefits that are to follow are to be
determined by the appropriate authority forthwith. The monetary benefits are to be calculated and
the current benefits are to be granted within eight weeks. The arrears of admissible monetary
benefits, if any, that would be due in terms of the orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013 are to be
calculated by the appropriate authority and released to the petitioners within a period of eight weeks
after release of the current dues. In case of any delay in payment of the dues/arrears that would be

admissible to the petitioners in terms of the Government orders dated 07.02.2013 and 19.03.2013,
the amount shall carry an interest payable to the petitioners by the Govt. at rate of 7% per annum,
for the period beyond the time specified and directed above.
36. The writ petition is allowed with the above observations and directions. However, in the facts
and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
