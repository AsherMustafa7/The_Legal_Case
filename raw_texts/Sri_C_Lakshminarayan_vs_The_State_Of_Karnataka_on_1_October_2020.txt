Sri C Lakshminarayan vs The State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
This petition has been filed by the petitioner- accused No.2 under Section 438 of Cr.P.C., to enlarge
him on anticipatory bail in Crime No.55/2016 registered by Vishwanathpura Police Station,
Bengaluru (pending on the file of Civil Judge and J.M.F.C at Devanahalli) for the offence punishable
under Section 465, 467, 468, 471 and 420 read with Section 34 of IPC.
2. I have heard the learned counsel Sri Mohan Kumar H.G, for petitioner-accused No.2 by virtual
hearing and Sri Divakar Maddur, the learned HCGP for respondent-State.
3. The gist of the case of the complaint is that the complainant had purchased land bearing
Sy.No.162/P35 measuring 1 acre 10 guntas from his vendor through absolute sale deed dated
15.06.2005. Accused No.2 claiming to be the general power-of- attorney holder of complainant has
sold the said land in favour of accused No.1 by sale deed dated 25.06.2011 by fabricating and
creating the documents. On the basis of the complaint, a case has been registered.
4. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner-accused No.2 is that already accused
No.1 has been granted bail by the trial Court and on the ground of parity petitioner-accused No.2 is
entitled to be released on bail. It is his further submission that civil dispute is also pending with
regard to genuinely of the documents. It is his further submission that alleged offences are not
punishable with death or imprisonment for life. He is ready to abide by any of the conditions that
may be imposed by this Court and ready to offer the sureties. On these grounds, he prays to allow
the petition and to release petitioner-accused No.2 on bail.
5. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader vehemently argued and submitted that
petitioner-accused No.2 has got executed the sale deed on the basis of an unregistered general
power-of- attorney and has fabricated and cheated the documents. The investigation is still in
progress. Petitioner-accused No.2 has not cooperated and was not available and he is absconding, as
such, the investigation has been hampered. On these grounds, he prays to dismiss the petition.
6. I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel
appearing for the parties and perused the records.
7. On perusal of the records it indicates that some transactions have been taken place between the
parties and on the basis of general power-of-attorney given in favour of the petitioner-accused No.2,
the civil suit is also pending and the alleged offences are not punishable with death or imprisonment
for life. Under the said facts and circumstances, that too when accused No.1 has been already
released on bail. Even on the ground of parity, petitioner-accused No.2 is entitled to be released on
bail.
8. Taking into consideration of the facts and circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that if by
imposing some stringent conditions, if the petitioner- accused No.2 is ordered to be released on
anticipatory bail, it is going to meet the ends of justice.
9. In that light, petition is allowed.
