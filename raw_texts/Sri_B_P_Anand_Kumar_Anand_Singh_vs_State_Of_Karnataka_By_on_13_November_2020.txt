1969.
2. Sri. Hashmath Pasha, learned Senior Counsel for petitioner has raised the following contentions:
(i) The Special Investigating Team (SIT) has no jurisdiction to investigate and to file
the charge sheet against the petitioner in respect of the alleged offences.
Referring to the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in WP (Civil) No.562/2009 dated 07.09.2012,
the learned Senior Counsel pointed out that by the said order, the CBI was directed to institute
FIR(s) and to investigate the case(s) relating to illegal extraction of about 50.79 lakhs MT of iron ore
from the forest areas of Karnataka during the period from January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010; the
illegal transport of the aforesaid quantity of iron ore from the area(s) of extraction to Belekeri port
and from there its illegal export to other countries. He further pointed out that the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the aforesaid petition, by order dated 16.09.2013, directed the State Government to take
necessary action under the relevant laws as recommended by the CEC in its Report dated
05.09.2012, with regard to those exporters who have exported less than 50,000 MT of iron ore,
which was illegally extracted from the forest area. Therefore, there was no scope for investigation by
the SIT in respect of the mining of iron ore in a lease area which is not a forest area.
(ii) The learned Special Judge has committed serious error in taking cognizance of the alleged
offences based on the charge sheet submitted by the SIT. The learned Special Judge had no
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences under the provisions of the MMDR Act in view of the
bar contained in Section 22 of the MMDR Act. Primary offence alleged against the petitioner being
punishable under the provisions of the MMDR Act, the other offences alleged in the charge sheet
were inseparable and therefore, the summons issued to the petitioner to face trial for the offences
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32937724/ 7
Sri B P Anand Kumar @ Anand Singh vs State Of Karnataka By on 13 November, 2020
punishable under the IPC and Karnataka Forest Rules are also vitiated and bad in law.
(iii) In view of the explanation appended to Section 23 of the MMDR Act, "firm" includes the
Company. All the allegations leveled in the charge sheet are directed against the company, but the
company having not been made an accused in any of the above cases, prosecution of the petitioner
in his capacity as partner of the aforesaid firms, is legally untenable in view of the law laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in STANDARD CHARTERED BANK AND OTHERS Vs. DIRECTORATE
OF ENFORCEMENT AND OTHERS reported in (2005) 4 SCC 530; SHARAD KUMAR SANGHI Vs.
SANGITA RANE reported in (2015) 12 SCC 781 and ANEETA HADA Vs. GODFATHER TRAVELS &
TOURS PRIVATE LIMITED reported in (2012) 5 SCC 661.
(iv) The allegations leveled in the charge sheet do not prima-facie make out the ingredients of the
offences charged against the petitioner. No prima-facie material is produced to show that the
petitioner herein was instrumental in the sale or transport of iron ore. On the other hand, the
materials produced by the Investigating Agency disclose that the iron ore was extracted from the
mining lease area. The alleged sale was not effected by the petitioner either as proprietor of M/s.
Vaishnavi Minerals or as Director of M/s. Vaishnavi Anand Project Private Limited or as partner of
M/s. S.B. Minerals.
(v) The allegations leveled against the petitioner are without any basis and no supporting material is
produced in support of the charges leveled against the petitioner. The charge sheet does not
prima-facie disclose the material constituting the above offences so as to take cognizance and to
issue summons to the petitioner. As a result, the impugned proceedings are liable to be quashed.
3. Meeting the above arguments, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent
would submit that insofar as the jurisdiction of the SIT to register the FIR and to investigate into the
alleged offences is concerned, this Court in W.P.Nos.14220-14224/2018 (DD on 01.10.2018)
between R.P.TRIVIKRAM AND OTHERS VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in 2019(1) KLJ 149
has held that the SIT has jurisdiction to register the FIR and to investigate into the alleged offences
and therefore, the said contention does not survive for consideration.
4. Regarding the validity of the cognizance order and the summoning order made by the Special
Judge, the learned Special Public Prosecutor would submit that in compliance of requirement of
Section 22 of the MMDR Act, requisite complaint has been filed by the Authorized Officer before the
Special Judge in all of the above cases except in Crl.P.No.3525/2017, and as such, there is
substantial compliance of the requirements of Section 22 of the MMDR Act.
5. Regarding prosecution of the petitioner in his capacity as partner of the involved firms, the
learned Special Public Prosecutor would submit that the allegations in the charge sheet are directed
against the petitioner in his capacity as the partner of the involved firms as well as in his personal
capacity. Further referring to Section 23 of the MMDR Act, the learned Special Public Prosecutor
would submit that in view of the proviso to Section 23 of the MMDR Act, it is for the petitioner to
establish during trial that the alleged offences were committed by the company or the firm without
his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offences and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32937724/ 8
Sri B P Anand Kumar @ Anand Singh vs State Of Karnataka By on 13 November, 2020
therefore, the said contention does not furnish a ground to the petitioner to seek quashment of the
proceedings.
6. Regarding the merits of the case, the learned Special Public Prosecutor would submit that the
material collected by the Investigating Agency and the statement of witnesses would clearly disclose
the transactions alleged against the petitioner and as such, there being prima-facie material to
proceed against the petitioner, none of the contentions urged by the petitioner merit acceptance.
7. Considered the submissions and perused the record.
8. Regarding the jurisdiction and the authority of SIT to investigate into the alleged offences and to
submit the charge sheet is concerned, the said issue is already decided by me by referring to the
directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order dated 16.09.2013 in W.P.(Civil)
No.562/2009 and the CEC report dated 05.09.2012 as well as the Government Order dated
22.11.2013 in W.P.Nos.14220-14224/2018 (DD 01.10.2018) between R.P.TRIVIKRAM AND
OTHERS VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in 2019(1) KLJ 149. In view of this order, the first
contention urged by the learned Senior Counsel is liable to be rejected and is accordingly rejected.
9. The submission of the learned Senior counsel that by order dated 16.09.2013, the State
Government was directed to take action only in relation to the iron ore extracted from the forest
area, is misconceived. A reading of the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
W.P(Civil).No.562/2009 would clearly indicate that in its first order dated 07.09.2012, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court issued directions to the CBI. The said direction reads as under:
"We accept the report and in light of the recommendations made in it, we direct the
CBI to immediately institute FIR(s) and to investigate the case(s) relating to the
illegal extraction of about 50.79 lakh MT of iron ore from the forest areas of
Karnataka during the period January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010, the illegal transport of
the aforesaid quantity of iron ore from the area(s) of extraction to Belekeri Port and
from there its illegal export to other countries."
The directions issued to the State Government finds place in the order dated 16.09.2013, which
reads as under:
"(d) We direct the State of Karnataka to take further necessary action under the
relevant laws as recommended by the CEC in its Report dated 5th September, 2012
with regard to those exporters who have exported less than 50,000 MT and report
compliance within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of communication
of this order."
There is nothing in this order to indicate that the State Government was directed to take action to
investigate only with regard to the export of the iron ore from the forest areas as contended by the
learned Senior Counsel. Even otherwise, this issue having already considered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in THE STATE OF KARNATAKA Vs. LINGANAGOUDA IN SLP
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32937724/ 9
Sri B P Anand Kumar @ Anand Singh vs State Of Karnataka By on 13 November, 2020
Nos.6244-6251/2017 (D.D.12.10.2017), no further order is necessary on the objection raised by the
learned Senior Counsel.
10. Coming to the objection relating to the validity of the cognizance taken by the learned Special
Judge and the consequent orders of summons issued to the petitioner is concerned, a perusal of the
order sheets produced by the petitioner indicate that on perusal of the FIR, Charge Sheet, Seizure
mahazar and documents collected by the Investigating Officer, the learned Special Judge has taken
cognizance of the alleged offences and has issued summons to the petitioner. This order clearly
reflects application of mind and consideration of the material leading to issuance of summons. The
offences in respect of which summons are issued are also detailed in the order, as such, no fault
could be found with the impugned orders.
11. However, the difficulty arises in respect of the offences under the provisions of MMDR Act.
Section 22 of the Act creates a restriction on the courts in taking cognizance of the offences under
the Act. The Section reads as under:
"22. Cognizance of offences.― No court shall take cognizance of any offence
punishable under this Act or any rules made thereunder except upon complaint in
writing made by a person authorised in this behalf by the Central Government or the
State Government."
12 Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner/accused has placed heavy reliance on the decision of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of STATE (NCT OF DELHI) vs. SANJAY, (2014) 9 SCC 772, in
paragraph 70, wherein it is held as under:
" 70. There cannot be any dispute with regard to restrictions imposed under the
MMDR Act and remedy provided therein. In any case, where there is a mining
activity by any person in contravention of the provisions of Section 4 and other
sections of the Act, the officer empowered and authorized under the Act shall exercise
all the powers including making a complaint before the jurisdictional magistrate. It is
also not in dispute that the Magistrate shall in such cases take cognizance on the
basis of the complaint filed before it by a duly authorized officer. In case of breach
and violation of Section 4 and other provisions of the Act, the police officer cannot
insist Magistrate for taking cognizance under the Act on the basis of the record
submitted by the police alleging contravention of the said Act. In other words, the
prohibition contained in Section 22 of the Act against prosecution of a person except
on a complaint made by the officer is attracted only when such person sought to be
prosecuted for contravention of Section 4 of the Act and not for any act or omission
which constitute an offence under the Penal Code."
(underlining supplied)
13. What emerges from the above decision is that based on the final report filed under Section 173 of
the Code, the Special Court cannot take cognizance of the offences under the provisions of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32937724/ 10

MMDR Act. Apparently, to get over this restriction, the respondent appears to have filed a
complaint in each of the proceedings before the Special court (except in Criminal Petition No.
3525/2017 (Special C.C.No.469/2016) in terms of Section 22 of the MMDR Act. The learned Special
Public Prosecutor for the respondent has made available copies of the complaints filed by the
authorized officer before the learned Special Judge which contain the very same allegations as found
in the charge sheet submitted by SIT. These complaints therefore could be taken as due compliance
of the statutory requirement prescribed in Section 22 of the MMDR Act. But the question still
remains to be considered is, whether by mere filing the complaint, can it be said that the Special
Court has taken cognizance of the offences based on the said complaint as mandated in Section 22 of
the MMDR Act?
14. Though it is vehemently argued by the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner/accused that
such exercise has not been done by the Special Court as the impugned orders of cognizance does not
reflect that the learned Special Judge has looked into the averments made in the complaints yet,
what is significant to be noted is that the allegations made in these complaints as well as the facts
constituting the offences alleged against the petitioner/accused in the final report filed by the SIT
are one and the same. Under the said circumstance, if the learned Special judge has looked into the
allegations made in the final report filed by the SIT and on satisfying himself that these allegations
prima facie disclose the commission of offences by the petitioner/accused under IPC as well as
under the MMDR Act, it could possibly be held that the learned Special Judge has taken cognizance
of the offences in terms of Section 22 of MMDR Act.
15. In drawing the above conclusion, I am fortified by the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of FAKHRUDDIN AHMAD vs. STATE OF UTTARANCHAL AND ANOTHER,
(2008) 17 SCC 157, wherein it is observed that "whether Magistrate has or has not taken cognizance
of offence will depend upon circumstances of the particular case, including mode in which case is
sought to be instituted and the nature of preliminary action". No doubt, even in the said case it is
held that "before a Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance of an offence, it is imperative
that he must have taken notice of accusations and applied his mind to allegations made in complaint
or in police report or information received from a source other than a police report, as the case may
be, and material filed therewith. It is only when the Magistrate applies his mind and is satisfied that
allegations, if proved, would constitute an offence and decides to initiate proceedings against the
alleged offenders, that it can be positively stated that he has taken cognizance of the offence."
16. Similar view is taken in MEHMOOD UL REHMAN vs. KHAZIR MOHAMMAD TUNDA AND
OTHERS, (2015) 12 SCC 420, wherein it is held that "though no formal or speaking or reasoned
orders are required at the stage of Ss.190/204 CrPC, there must be sufficient indication in the order
that the Magistrate is satisfied that: (i) the facts alleged in the complaint constitute an offence, and
(ii) these facts when considered along with the statements recorded under S.200 CrPC and the
result of inquiry or report of investigation under S.202 CrPC, if any, prima facie make the accused
answerable before the criminal court."
17. As the impugned orders and the records of the proceedings disclose that the learned Special
Judge has considered the material placed before him namely, the charge sheet which contain
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32937724/ 11
Sri B P Anand Kumar @ Anand Singh vs State Of Karnataka By on 13 November, 2020
identical allegations as found in the complaint filed by the authorized officer under Section 22 of the
Act, I hold the cognizance taken by the learned Special Judge and the summons issued by him in
respect of MMDR offences is in accordance with Section 22 of MMDR Act.
18. Viewed from another angle, on filing a complaint either under Section 200 CrPC or under
Section 22 of MMDR Act, the course open for the Court/Magistrate was either to take cognizance
based on the facts alleged in the complaint or to refer the complaint for investigation under Section
156(3) of CrPC or to postpone the process and hold an enquiry in terms of Section 202 of CrPC. In
the instant cases, detailed investigation into the alleged offences having already been undertaken by
SIT pursuant to the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and necessary evidence having been
collected in respect of the alleged offences, the Special Court could not have ordered a parallel
investigation nor could it have rejected the final report. It is not the case of the petitioner that the
report submitted by the SIT is without authority of law. Even otherwise, investigating of the offences
is within the domain of the police and the power of the police officer to investigate into cognizable
offence is not ordinarily impinged by any fetters. There is no provision under the MMDR Act that
the appropriate authority alone shall investigate any complaint of breach of any of the provisions of
the MMDR Act. As observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in KANWAR PAL SINGH vs. THE
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH (Crl.Appeal No.1920/2019, arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.10707/2019,
dated December, 18, 2019), "the violation of Section 4 being cognizable offence, the police could
always investigated the same, there being no bar under the MMDR Act". Therefore, it follows that
when the police have the power to investigate the contraventions of Section 4 of the Act, they have
also the power to submit the final report. Therefore, no illegality could be attached to the final report
and the evidence collected by the police officers in proof of the offences investigated by them under
the Act. This report, therefore, cannot be excluded from consideration while taking cognizance of
the offence under the Act, provided a complaint as required under Section 22 is filed by the
authorized officer. If the argument of the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner is accepted,
despite there being a report on investigation, the Court has to either order for fresh investigation or
hold an enquiry under Section 202 of Cr.PC, which would tantamount to nullifying the investigation
ordered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Government of Karnataka, which in the
circumstances of the case cannot be permitted. It is a cardinal principle of law that every law is
designed to further the ends of justice and shall not be frustrated on mere technicalities. When the
law authorizes the police/SIT to investigate the offences including the offences under the MMDR
Act, the said report cannot be excluded from consideration at the stage of cognizance or issuance of
summons to the accused subject to the compliance of the requirements of Section 22 of the Act.
19. In the light of these principles and for the reasons discussed above, and especially keeping in
mind the peculiarities of the present case and the special circumstances arising on account of the
investigation report submitted by SIT, in my view, the course adopted by the learned Special Judge
in considering the final report for issuing process to the petitioner cannot be faulted with. Likewise,
as held in the above decisions, non recording the reasons by the Special Court while issuing
summons to the petitioner also cannot be a reason to set aside the orders of cognizance and the
summons issued to the petitioner. In the circumstances of the case, even if there is an error or
omission on the part of the learned Special Judge, it is not something so vital as to cut at the root of
jurisdiction so as to render the impugned orders illegal or without jurisdiction so as to quash the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32937724/ 12
Sri B P Anand Kumar @ Anand Singh vs State Of Karnataka By on 13 November, 2020
entire proceedings as sought for by the petitioner. Since the petitioner was notified of the offences at
the earliest point of time before his appearance, there is substantial compliance of the "outward
forms of the law" as held by the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in WILLIE (WILLIAM)
SLANEY vs. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH, AIR 1956 SC 116.
20. As a result, I hold that the impugned orders of cognizance and the consequent orders of
summons issued by the learned Special Judge do not suffer from any error or illegality vitiating the
proceedings pending against the petitioner.
21. The next contention urged by learned Senior counsel for the petitioner that the allegations
leveled in the charge sheet are directed only against the firm and therefore the prosecution of the
petitioner is not tenable in the eye of law, is also liable to be dismissed. A reading of the charge
sheets and the allegations made in the complaints clearly disclose that the petitioner is sought to be
prosecuted not only as the partner of the involved firms, but also in his personal capacity.
22. As could be seen from the above narration, petitioner has been implicated in the alleged offences
in his individual capacity and not as alter ego of the company. There are no allegations in the entire
charge sheets that the alleged offences were committed by the firm or company. The question of
making the firm or the company an accused would arise only when such company commits an
offence involving mens rea, it would normally be the intent and action of the individual who would
act on behalf of the company. Only then, an individual who has perpetrated the commission of an
offence on behalf of a company can be made an accused, along with the company, if there is
sufficient evidence of his active role coupled with criminal intent. This is the law laid down in SUNIL
BHARTI MITTAL vs. CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, (2015)4 SCC 609 (paras 40, 42
and 43), which is extracted herebelow:-
"40. It is abundantly clear from the above that the principle which is laid down is to
the effect that the criminal intent of the "alter ego" of the company, that is the
personal group of persons that guide the business of the company, would be imputed
to the company/corporation. The legal proposition that is laid down in the aforesaid
judgment is that if the person or group of persons who control the affairs of the
company commit an offence with a criminal intent, their criminality can be imputed
to the company as well as they are "alter ego" of the company.
42. No doubt, a corporate entity is an artificial person which acts through its officers,
directors, managing director, chairman etc. If such a company commits an offence
involving mens rea, it would normally be the intent and action of that individual who
would act on behalf of the company. It would be more so, when the criminal act is
that of conspiracy. However, at the same time, it is the cardinal principle of criminal
jurisprudence that there is no vicarious liability unless the statute specifically
provides so.
43. Thus, an individual who has perpetrated the commission of an offence on behalf
of a company can be made accused, along with the company, if there is sufficient

Sri B P Anand Kumar @ Anand Singh vs State Of Karnataka By on 13 November, 2020
evidence of his active role coupled with criminal intent. Second situation in which he
can be implicated is in those cases where the statutory regime itself attracts the
doctrine of vicarious liability, by specifically incorporating such a provision."
23. In the instant cases, the allegations are directed only against the petitioner. The role played by
the petitioner has been narrated. It is not the case of the respondent that the alleged acts were
committed by the petitioner for and on behalf of the company. He is not prosecuted in his capacity
as the partner of the firm because he is a partner. When the notion of the company or its corporate
identity is used to circumvent law, to defeat public policy, perpetuate fraud or illegality and used as a
cover or façade to justify wrong, defend crime, to lend a name to a private dealing, law will not
regard the company as a corporate entity and afford the protection which is otherwise entitled under
law. When camouflaged transactions are carried on behind the legal façade, court may lift this veil
and look behind the artificial personality of the company and identify the real personalities or
natural persons operating behind the veil. The facts and circumstances disclosed in the material
collected by Investigating officer undoubtedly point out that the petitioner ingeniously has been
operating behind the cover of firm or company by entering into conspiracy with other accused with
intent to make unlawful gain making out the ingredients of offence under sections 420 and 120B of
IPC. Therefore, the contention of the petitioner that the prosecution launched against him is bad for
non-prosecution of the firm or the company does not hold water.
24. The allegations made in the respective complaints which are duly supported by the material
collected by SIT during investigation undoubtedly make out the ingredients of the offences under
Sections 379, 409, 420, 471, 120(B) of IPC and Sections 21, 23 r/w 4(1) and 4(1)(A) of MMDR Act,
1957 and Rule 165 r/w 144 of Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969. In the course of the arguments, the
learned Special Public Prosecutor has referred to the relevant documents which prima facie disclose
the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offences. Under the said circumstances, the criminal
action having been rightly initiated against the petitioner, I do not find any justifiable ground to
interfere in the impugned proceedings. Accordingly, rejecting the contentions urged by the learned
Senior counsel for the petitioner, Criminal Petition Nos.3405/2017, 3406/2017, 3407/2017,
3526/2017, 3527/2017, 3575/2017, 3576/2017, 3577/2017, 3899/2017 and 4012/2017 are
dismissed.
Criminal Petition No.3525/2017 is allowed-in-part. The cognizance taken by the learned Special
Judge and the summons issued to the petitioner is set aside only insofar as the offences under the
provisions of the MMDR Act are concerned. It is made clear that the trial against the petitioner
(Accused No.6) in respect of the offences under IPC and the Karnataka Forest Rules, shall continue
in accordance with law.
Liberty is reserved to the respondent to make necessary complaint in terms of Section 22 of the
MMDR Act, if desired, in respect of the alleged offences punishable under the provisions of the
MMDR Act.
In view of dismissal of main petitions, all pending I.As are also dismissed.
