the basis of compromise.

order was passed:-
"1. Heard Mr. Shivakant, learned counsel for the applicant as well as learned A.G.A.
for the State and perused the record.
2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the entire proceeding
of Case No.144262/2023 (State vs. Vaibhav @ Golu and Others), in Case Crime

3. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the parties have reconciled their
differences and a compromise has been entered between them. In this regard, an
application along with compromise deed on behalf of both the parties has been filed
before the court below stating therein that they have entered into compromise and
they do not want to press the case, copy of said application has been annexed as
Annexure no.4 to this application. Therefore, no useful purpose would be served in
continuing the proceedings before the court below and the same is not only sheer
wastage of time of the Court but also abuse of the process of law.
4. Learned AGA, however, submits that it is the concerned court below, which has to
verify the fact as to whether the parties have entered into compromise, hence the
applicant may approach the concerned court below and move an application with
respect to compromise between the parties, which will be decided in accordance with
law.
5. In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with an application for verification of the compromise deed as well as a
certified copy of this order within two weeks from today. It is expected that the trial
court may fix a date for the verification of the compromise and after ensuring the
presence of parties, pass an appropriate order with respect to the same in accordance
with law, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of two months from
today. While passing the order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall
also record the statement of the parties as to whether all the terms and conditions
mentioned in the original compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not?
6. The court in that scenario will allow the parties to obtain certified copy of the order
verifying the compromise deed and it will be open to the applicant to approach this
Court again for quashing of the proceedings.
