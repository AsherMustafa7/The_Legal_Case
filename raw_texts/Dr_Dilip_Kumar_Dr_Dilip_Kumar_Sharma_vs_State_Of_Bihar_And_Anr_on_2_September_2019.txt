C.A.V. JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HEMANT KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA)
Date : 02-09-2019
1. This petition under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure has been filed on behalf of the petitioner
for quashing of order dated 3.12.2015 passed by Principal
Judge, Family Court, Munger in Maintenance Case No. 153 of
2014 directing the petitioner to pay interim compensation to his
wife (O.P. No. 2) and his children @ Rs. 15,000/- per month
since the date of filing of interim petition dated 3.8.2015 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 1
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
also directed to pay lump sump of Rs. 10,000/- towards filing of
maintenance petition and other petitions and attending the court
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019
2/32
till the date and onward Rs. 1000/- on each date towards
litigation cost.
2. O.P. No. 2 filed Maintenance Case No. 153
of 2014 under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
against petitioner for her maintenance as well as for
maintenance of her three children.
3. The petitioner appeared in the aforesaid
maintenance case and filed his show cause. However, during
pendency of the aforesaid maintenance case, O.P. No. 2 under
second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure filed a petition for grant of interim maintenance and
the expenses of the proceeding of her as well as her minor
children. The petitioner contested the aforesaid petition but the
learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Munger, allowed the
interim maintenance petition passing interim order dated
3.12.2015
, which has been challenged before this Court by filing petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure.
4. Initially, this petition was listed before learned Single Bench of this Court and learned Single
Bench having heard the matter at length vide order dated 21.11.2108, doubted the correctness of the
view expressed by Division Bench of this Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 Court in Md. Akil Ahmad Vs. State of Bihar and Ors. reported in 2016(4) PLJR 968
and, accordingly, observed that the law laid down by the Division Bench of this Court in Md. Akil
Ahmad case (Supra) needs reconsideration by the Division Bench as no finding was given over
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 2
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
applicability of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure though impliedly jurisdiction has
been derecognised and, directed to place the matter before Division Bench and, accordingly, by
order of the Chief Justice, this matter has been placed before us.
5. In Md. Akil Ahmad case (Supra), the issue before the Division Bench for determination was the
maintainability of application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the
order of the interim maintenance passed by the Family Court under second proviso of Section 125 of
Code of Criminal Procedure during the pendency of the proceeding of maintenance under Chapter
IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the above stated case, the learned Division Bench of this
Court having considered various aspects as well as decisions cited came to conclusion that the only
remedy available to challenge the order of interim maintenance passed under second proviso of
Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was to make an application under Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 Article 227 of the Constitution of India before this Court.
6. The learned Division Bench in Md. Akil Ahmad case (Supra), further, held that petition under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed against the order of interim maintenance passed
by Family Court under second proviso of Criminal Procedure Code is not maintainable.
7. It is pertinent to mention here that at the time of hearing, none appeared on behalf of the
petitioner to assist the Court and, accordingly, this Court appointed Sri Rajesh Kumar Singh,
advocate as well as Sri Ansul, Advocate, Amicus Curiae to assist the Court.
8. Learned Amicus Curiae Sri Rajesh Kumar Singh, Advocate, submitted that the view expressed by
Hon'ble Division Bench in Md. Akil Ahmad's case (Supra) is not a correct view because, the inherent
power vested into the court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be limited.
He, further, submitted that in Madhu Limaye Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (1977) 4 SCC 551,
it has been held by Apex Court that inherent power vested into the Court under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure may be invoked for quashing interlocutory orders even though revision
is prohibited. Learned Amicus Curiae Mr. Singh Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 submitted that the law laid down in Madhu Limaye case (Supra) still holds the field,
and, therefore, the view of learned Division Bench rendered in Md. Akil Ahmad case (Supra)
appears to be per incurium. Learned Amicus Curiae Mr. Singh, further, submitted that no doubt, in
the case of Amar Nath and Ors. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors. reported in (1977) 4 SCC 137, the two
Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court held that inherent powers cannot be exercised when there is an
express power in a provision of the Code but the correctness of aforesaid view was doubted by
Hon'ble three Judges of Supreme court in Madhu Limaye case (Supra) and came to conclusion that
inherent powers may be invoked for quashing interlocutory order even though revision is
prohibited.
9. Learned Amicus Curiae Mr. Ansul, Advocate, seconded the submissions advanced by learned
Amicus Curiae Mr. Singh. However, learned Amicus Curiae Mr. Ansul submitted that the order of ad
interm maintenance being an intermediate order, the revision against said order is also
maintainable. Learned Amicus Curiae Mr. Ansul submitted that in the case of Manish Aggarwal Vs.
Seema Aggarwal and others decided on 13.9.2012 in FAO No. 388/2012, CM No. 15067/2012 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 3
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
CM No. 15068/2012, the Division Bench of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 Hon'ble Delhi High Court has answered all the questions which have been raised in
the present petition. He, further, submitted that a person aggrieved by the order of ad interim
maintenance can either file petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under
Section 19(4) of Family Courts Act. He referred several decisions in support of his contentions such
as follows:
(I) Madhu Limaye vs. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1978 SC 47]
(ii) Manish Aggarwal Vs. Seema Aggarwal and others decided on 13.9.2012 in FAO
No. 388/2012, CM No. 15067/2012 and CM No. 15068/2012,
(iii) Amar Nath and Ors. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors. [(1977) 4 SCC 137]
(iv) Shah Babulal Khimji vs. Jayaben D. Kania & Anr [AIR 1981 SC 1786]
(v) Prabhu Chawla Vs. State of Rajsthan [2016(16) SCC 30]
10. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor also submitted that the order of interim maintenance
passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 Procedure is revisable order and hence, revision petition is
maintainable under Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984.
11. Having heard the above stated contentions, I went through the record as well as decisions cited
before this Court.
12. In Md. Akil Ahmad case (Supra), the Division Bench considered the question of maintainability
of application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order of interim
maintenance passed by the Family Court under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure during the pendency of the proceeding of maintenance under Chapter IX of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Division Bench in the above stated case after referring to
the definition of interlocutory order as provided in Blacks Law Dictionary (1990) page 814 and
having taken into consideration the decision of Single Judge of this Court rendered in Arvind Kumar
Singh Vs. State of Bihar reported in 2014(4) PLJR 587 came to the conclusion that the order of
interim maintenance passed by the Family Court under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure during pendency of proceeding of maintenance under Patna High Court CR.
MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure is an
interlocutory order and in terms of Section 19(4) of Family Courts Act, the revision is barred against
the aforesaid order. Furthermore, learned Division Bench in the aforesaid Md. Akil Ahmad case
(Supra) held that Section 10(2) of the Family Courts Act permits the applicability of provisions of
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to the proceeding under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal
Procedure before a Family Court and, therefore, in terms of Sub Section 2 of Section 10 of the
Family Courts Act, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure are not applicable before the
High Court as to test the propriety and correctness of any order passed under the proceeding of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 4
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
Chapter IX of the Code by the Family Court.
13. For better appreciation, I would like to reproduce paragraph 18, 19 and 20 of the Md. Akil
Ahmad case (Supra) which runs as follows:-
18. For deciding the issue as referred above, we may take notice of Section 10 of the
Act, which reads thus:
"Section 10. Procedure generally-(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act and
the rules, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) and of any
other law for the time being in force shall apply to the suits and proceedings other
than the proceeding under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of
1974), before a Family Court and for the purposes of the said Patna High Court CR.
MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 provisions of the Code, a Family Court shall
be deemed to be a Civil Court and shall have all the powers of such Court.
(2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act and the rules, the provisions of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or the rules made there under, shall apply to
the proceedings under Chapter IX of that Code before a Family Court.
(3) Nothing in sub-section (1) or sub-
section (2) shall prevent a Family Court from laying down its own procedure with a view to arrive at
a settlement in respect of the subject matter of the suit or proceedings or at the truth of the facts
alleged by the one party and denied by the other."
19. From bare reading of Section 10(2) of the Act, it appears that the provisions of Code of Criminal
Procedure 1973 or the rules made there under are made applicable to the proceedings under
Chapter IX of the Code, only before a Family Court. Therefore, in terms of sub-section 2 of Section
10 of the Act, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure are not applicable before the High
Court as to test the propriety and correctness of any order passed under the proceedings of Chapter
IX of the Code, by a Family Court. An appeal against the judgment or order of the Family Court is
filed before the High Court in terms of Section 19(1) of the Act, not under the provisions of Code of
Criminal Procedure; similarly, a revision application is filed against an order of the Family Court,
relating to proceedings of Chapter IX of the Code, under Section 19(4) of the Act not under the
provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, the application of provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure is confined only to the Family Court in the proceedings under Chapter IX of that
Code.
20. It is worth to take notice of Section 20 of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 the Family Courts Act, which reads thus:
"20. Act to have overriding effect.- The provisions of this Act shall have effect
notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 5
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than
this Act."
14. Furthermore, the learned Division Bench in the case of Md. Akil Ahmad (Supra) having relied
upon a decision reported in 1990(2) PLJR 693 held that if a person is aggrieved by order of the
interim maintenance passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
he may make an application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. I would like to refer
paragraphs 22 and 23 of the decision rendered in Md. Akil Ahmad case (Supra), which runs as
follows:
"22. Under the similar situation a Full Bench of this Court had occasion to determine
the issue:
"Whether an appeal would be available under Section 19 (1) of the Family Courts Act,
1984 against an order passed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955?"
This Court while delivering judgment, reported in AIR 2010 Patna 184, held that an
order passed by the Family Court, being interlocutory in nature, would be amenable
to the writ jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
23. We would also like to refer a decision of this Court reported in 1990(2) PLJR 693, rendered by a
larger Bench of this Court. In the said decision, Their Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 Lordships, in paragraph 16, held as under:
"16. Whether the High Court can exercise such power of superintendence only when
no appeal or revision has been provided under the Code against orders passed by
such criminal courts or even in cases where the persons concerned have availed the
remedy provided under the Code for setting aside such orders? It may be urged that
in the aforesaid two Full Bench decisions of this Court and in the case of Chandra
Shekhar Singh & Another (supra) before the Supreme Court, no internal remedy by
way of appeal or revision had been provided, rather there was a bar so far exercise of
appellate or revisional power of this Court under the old Code is concerned, in my
view whether a bar has been placed or not on exercise of the appellate or revisional
power under the Code itself is not of much consequence so far as the power of this
Court under Article 227 of the Constitution is concerned. But there may be three
situations under which the power under Article 227 may be invoked. Firstly, where
no appeal or revision has been provided against the order in question, secondly,
where the person aggrieved has already filed a revision application before Sessions
Judge and his revision application to this Court against the order passed by the
Sessions Judge is barred under Section 397(3) of the Code. The third eventuality may
be where although a revision application or an application under Section 482 of the
Code is maintainable before this Court, still an application under Article 227 is filed.
In my view, there is no question exercise of power under Article 227 in the third
category of cases, the remedy being available to petitioner under the provisions of the
Code itself. So far the cases falling in the first category i.e., where no appeal or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 6
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
revision has been provided as has been said by the Supreme Court, it will require an
exceptional case before power under Article Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of
2016 dt.02-09-2019 227 is to be exercised. In respect of the cases coming under
second category i.e., the revision application have already been dismissed by the
Sessions Judge, and bar under Section 397(3) is applicable for interference under
Article 227, very exceptional circumstances must exist in view of the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Jagir Singh(Supra)".
15. Now the question for determination is as to whether the petition under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure can be filed before the High Court against the order of interim maintenance
passed by Family Court under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and
the view expressed by the Division Bench in Md. Akil Ahmad case (Supra) needs reconsideration.
16. I have noticed that in Md. Akil Ahmad case (Supra), the Division Bench has given specific
finding that in terms of Section 10(2) of the Family Courts Act, the provision of Section 482 Code of
Criminal Procedure cannot be exercised by the High Court against the order of interim maintenance
passed by Family Court under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as
the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 or the Rules made thereunder are made
applicable to the proceedings under Chapter IX of the Code, only before a Family Court and,
therefore, in terms of sub Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 Section 2 of
Section 10 of the Act, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure are not applicable before the
High Court as to test the propriety and correctness of any order passed under the proceeding of
Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure and, furthermore, revision application under Section
19(4) of the Family Court is filed against an order of Family Court and not under the provisions of
Code of Criminal Procedure. However, I have to see as to whether a petition under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure can be filed against the order passed by Family Court under second
proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
17. Here, I would like to mention that the above stated controversy arose before several other High
Courts of this country and the different High Courts answered the question in their own ways.
18. In case of Manish Aggarwal Vs. Seema Aggarwal and others decided on 13.9.2012 in FAO No.
388 of 2012; M No. 15667 of 2012 and CM No. 15668 of 2012, the Division Bench of Delhi High
Court having considered the divergent views of different High Courts of this country came to
conclusion that the remedy of criminal revision would be available against both the interim and final
order passed under Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 Sections 125 to
128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure under sub Section (4) of Section 19 of the Family Courts Act.
The Division Bench of Delhi High Court in the aforesaid case also held that the interim maintenance
order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not an
interlocutory order rather it is an intermediate order against which revision can be filed.
19. The Second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure inserted by the amending
Act, 1950 of 2001 with effect from 24.9.2001, specifically, empowers the Magistrate to grant interim
maintenance pending consideration of application under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 7
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
Procedure. For better appreciation of the matter, I would like to refer the provisions of Sections 125
to 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which runs as follows:
"125. Order for maintenance of wives, children and parents.--
(1) If any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain--
(a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or
(b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to

attained majority, where such child is, by reason of any physical or mental
abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or
(d) his father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself, a Magistrate of the

proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for
the maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, at such monthly rate
[***], as such Magistrate thinks fit, and to pay the same to such person as the
Magistrate may from time to time direct:
Provided that the Magistrate may order the father of a minor female child referred to
in clause (b) to make such allowance, until she attains her majority, if the Magistrate
is satisfied that the husband of such minor female child, if married, is not possessed
of sufficient means:
[Provided further that the Magistrate may, during the pendency of the proceeding
regarding monthly allowance for the maintenance under this sub-section, order such
person to make a monthly allowance for the interim maintenance of his wife or such
child, father or mother, and the expenses of such proceeding which the Magistrate
considers reasonable, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from
time to time direct:
Provided also that an application for the monthly allowance for the interim
maintenance and expenses of proceeding under the second proviso shall, as far as
possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of the service of notice of the
application to such person.] Explanation.--For the purposes of this Chapter,- ( a)

[(2) Any such allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding
shall be payable from the date of the order, or, if Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 so ordered, from the date of the application for maintenance or interim maintenance

cause to comply with the order, any such Magistrate may, for every breach of the order, issue a
warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines, and may sentence such
person, for the whole or any part of each month's 4[allowance for the maintenance or the interim
maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] remaining unpaid after the execution
of the warrant, to imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or until payment if

this section unless application be made to the Court to levy such amount within a
period of one year from the date on which it became due:
Provided further that if such person offers to maintain his wife on condition of her
living with him, and she refuses to live with him, such Magistrate may consider any
grounds of refusal stated by her, and may make an order under this section
notwithstanding such offer, if he is satisfied that there is just ground for so doing.
Explanation.-- If a husband has contracted marriage with another woman or keeps a
mistress, it shall be considered to be just ground for his wife' s refusal to live with
him.
(4 ) No wife shall be entitled to receive an 1 [allowance for the maintenance or the
interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] from her
husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 9
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
Provided that if the Magistrate is satisfied that the person against whom an order for
payment of maintenance is proposed to be made is wilfully avoiding service, or
wilfully neglecting to attend the Court, the Magistrate may proceed to hear and

may be, on such Magistrate being satisfied as to the identity of the parties and the non-payment of
the 5 [allowance, or as the case may be, expenses, due]."
20. Furthermore, I would like to refer sub Section (2) of Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1984,
which runs as follows
7. Jurisdiction (1) ..... ....... ........ ........... ........... ........ ....... (2) Subject to the other provisions of this
Act, a Family Court shall also have and exercise-
(a) the jurisdiction exercisable by a Magistrate of the First Class under Chapter IX (relating to order
for maintenance of wife, children and parents) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974);
and
(b) such other jurisdiction as may be conferred on it by any other enactment."
21. Furthermore, I would like to refer sub Section (2) of Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1984,
which runs as Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 follows:-
"10. Procedure generally (2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act and the rules,
the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, (2 of 1974) or the rules made
thereunder, shall apply to the proceedings under Chapter IX of that Code before a
Family Court."
22. Section 14 of the Family Courts Act permits the application of Indian Evidence Act, 1872,
whereas Sections 15 and 16 of the Family Courts Act speak about the procedure to record oral
evidence in suits or proceeding before a Family Court. Section 17 of the Family Courts Act speaks
about the contents of judgment pronounced by the Family Court whereas Section 18 of the Act
speaks about the execution of decrees and orders passed by the Family Court. Section 19 of the Act
prescribes the procedure of appeals and revisions. Here, I would like to refer Section 19 of the
Family Courts Act, which runs as follows:-
"19. Appeal (1) Save as provided in sub-section (2) and notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), or in any other law, an appeal shall lie from every

judgment or order, not being an interlocutory order, of a Family Court to the High
Court both on facts and on law. (2) No appeal shall lie from a decree or order passed
by the Family Court with the consent of the parties 2[or from an order passed under
Chapter IX of the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) :
PROVIDED that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to any appeal pending before
a High Court or any order passed under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) before the commencement of the Family Courts
(Amendment) Act, 1991.] (3) Every appeal under this section shall be preferred
within a period of thirty days from the date of judgment or order of a Family Court.
[(4) The High Court may, of its own motion or otherwise, call for and examine the record of any
proceeding in which the Family Court situate with in its jurisdiction passed an order under Chapter
IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness,
legality or propriety of the order, not being an interlocutory order, and, as to the regularity of such
proceeding.] [(5)] Except as aforesaid, no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any
judgment, order or decree of a Family Court.
[(6)] An appeal preferred under sub-section (1) shall be heard by a Bench consisting of two or more
Judges."
23. From bare perusal of Section 19(2) of the Act, it is obvious that no appeal shall lie from an order
passed under Chapter IX of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 but Section 19(4) of the Act gives
power to High Court to call for and examine the record of any proceeding in which the Family Court
situate within its jurisdiction passed an order under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 propriety of the order, not being an interlocutory order, and, as to
the regularity of such proceeding. Therefore, it is obvious from perusal of Section 19(4) of the Family
Courts Act that revision petition can be filed against the order of Family Court passed under Chapter
IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 subject to condition that the order of Family Court
should not be an interlocutory order. Now, question arises as to whether order passed by Family
Court under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is an interlocutory
order or not.
24. The word 'interlocutory order' has not been defined either in Family Courts Act, 1984 or in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 but as per Black(cid:128)s Law Dictionary (1990) P. 814, the word
"interim" means "for the time being", "in the meantime", "meanwhile", "temporary", "provisional",
"not final", "intervening". The word "interim" means "intervening" when it is used as a noun and
when used as an adjective it means "temporary" or "provisional". As per Advanced Law Lexicon
(2005) Vol. II, " interlocutory" means, not that which decides the cause, but that which only settles
some intervening matter relating to the cause; a decree or judgment given provisionally during the
course of legal action. Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 The word
'interlocutory order' has also been defined in Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume 22 of the third
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 12
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
edition at page 742 and para 1606 of the same reads as under:
"1606. Final or interlocutory. No definition is given in the Judicature Acts, or the
orders and rules thereunder, of the terms "final"
or "Interlocutory", and a judgment or order may be final for one purpose and interlocutory for
another, or final as to part and interlocutory as to part. The meaning of the two words must
therefore be considered separately in relation to the particular purpose for which it is required."
25. From comparative reading of the above stated definitions, I find that the definition of word
'interlocutory', given in Black's Law dictionary, is not explanatory in nature whereas an elaborate
explanation has been given in Halsbury's Laws of England. The perusal of definition given in
Halsbury's Laws of England goes to show that an order which substantially affects rights of an
accused or party or decides certain rights of the parties during pendency, proceeding is not an
interlocutory order. Furthermore, the meaning of interlocutory should be considered in relation to
the particular purpose for which it is required.
26. Here, I would like to mention that the Full bench of Allahabad High Court in Smt. Kiran Bala
Srivastava Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 Vs. Jai Prakash Srivastava
[2005(23) LCD 1] discussed the judgment delivered by the Apex Court in Shah Babulal Khimji Vs.
Jayaben D. Kania & Anr. reported in AIR 1981 SC 1786 and I think it proper to extract the paragraph
11 of the judgment delivered in Smt. Kiran Bala Srivastava (supra) which runs as follows:
11. ....The Apex Court laid down that there can be three kinds of judgments. Relevant
portion of the said judgment to that effect is as follows:
"(1) A final judgment--A judgment which decides all the questions or issues in
controversy so far as the trial Judge is concerned and leaves, nothing else to be
decided. This would mean that by virtue of the judgment, the suit or action brought
by the plaintiff is dismissed or decreed in part or in full. Such an order passed by the
trial Judge indisputably and unquestionably is a judgment within the meaning of the
Letters Patent and even amounts to a decree so that an appeal would lie from such a
judgment to a Division Bench.
(2) A preliminary judgment--This kind of a judgment may take two forms--(a) where
the trial Judge by an order dismisses the suit without going into the merits of the suit
but only on a preliminary objection raised by the defendant or the party opposing on
the ground that the suit is not maintainable. Here also, as the suit is finally decided
one way or the other, the order passed by Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of
2016 dt.02-09-2019 the trial Judge would be a judgment finally deciding the cause so
far as the trial Judge is concerned and, therefore, appealable to the larger Bench. (b)
Another shape which a preliminary judgment may take is that where the trial Judge
passes an order after hearing the preliminary objections raised by the defendant
relating to maintainability of the suit, e.g., bar of jurisdiction, res judicata, a manifest
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 13
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
defect in the suit. Absence of notice under Sec. 80 and the like, and these objections
are decided by the trial Judge against the defendant, the suit is not terminated but
continues and has to be tried on merits but the order of the trial Judge rejecting the
objections doubtless adversely affects a valuable right of the defendant who, if his
objections are valid, is entitled to get the suit dismissed on preliminary grounds.
Thus, such an order even though it keeps the suit alive, undoubtedly decides an
important aspect of the trial which affects a vital right of the defendant and must,
therefore, be construed to be a judgment so as to be appealable to a larger Bench.
(3) Intermediary or interlocutory judgment: Most of the interlocutory orders which
contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses
(a) to (w) of Order 43, Rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments
within the meaning of the Letters Patent and, therefore, appealable. There may also
be interlocutory orders which are not covered by Order 43, Rule 1 Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 but which also possess the characteristics
and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of
the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. Before
such an order can be a judgment the adverse affect on the party concerned must be
direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote......."
27. Admittedly, an interim order under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure is passed during pendency of petition filed under Section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. The second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been brought
on statute book to give instant relief to the applicant but the interim order, admittedly, decides
rights and liabilities of the respective parties. No doubt, before passing interim order under Section
125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is no need of formal proof of the claim of the applicant
but the interim maintenance order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, prima facie, decides rights and liabilities of the parties. Furthermore, the
interim maintenance order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure can be altered from time to time. Similarly, the order passed under Section 125(1) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure can also be altered at Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 subsequent stage, if the circumstance demands.
28. Furthermore, I find that if a person against whom the order of interim maintenance has been
passed fails without sufficient cause to comply with the order of the Court, coercive steps may be
taken against him. The order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure appears to be an interlocutory order on its very face but as to whether in true sense the
order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is an
interlocutory order or not, it has to be seen.
29. Section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure gives power to Court to alter the order passed
either under Section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under second proviso of Section
125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, therefore, according to Section 127 of the Code of Criminal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 14
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
Procedure, even the order passed under Section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not a
final order and that order can be altered later on, if the change of circumstance demands. Similar
position is in respect of second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as the order
of interim maintenance can also be altered at subsequent stage of the proceeding, therefore, it is
obvious that nature of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 both the orders,
either passed under Section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure or passed under second
proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, are quite similar in nature as both orders
can be altered at subsequent stage. Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act does not, specifically, bar
the revision against the order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure and the only restriction is to avail the provision of Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act
that order in challenge should not be an interlocutory order. Therefore, in the aforesaid
circumstance, the nature of order of interim maintenance passed under second proviso of Section
125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appears is an intermediate order and Section 19(4) of Family
Courts Act, 1984 bars the entertainment of revision only against interlocutory order and not against
intermediate order.
30. As I have already observed that the second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure falls under the category of intermediate order, therefore, the interim maintenance order
passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be revised under
Section 19(4) Family Courts Act.
31. However, it is pertinent to note here that Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016
dt.02-09-2019 learned Division Bench of this Court in Md. Akil Ahmad case (supra) did not
consider the aforesaid aspect and treating the order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure as interlocutory order came to conclusion that revision under
Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, against the interim maintenance order passed under
second proviso of Section 125 of Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable. Therefore, in my
view, the aforesaid observation of learned Division Bench of this Court given in Md. Akil Ahmad
(supra) case needs reconsideration by a larger Bench.
32. It is true that Sub Section (2) of Section 7 of Family Courts Act, 1984, authorises only Family
Court to exercise jurisdiction given to a Magistrate of the First Class under Chapter IX of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 and furthermore, sub Section (2) of Section 10 of Family Courts Act, 1984,
speaks that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, or the Rule made thereunder
shall apply to the proceedings under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, therefore,
it is obvious that according to sub Section (2) of Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, the
provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure shall only apply to Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740
of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 the proceeding under Chapter IX of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, before
a Family Court. Furthermore, Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 gives power to High
Court to call for and examine the record of any proceeding in which the Family Court situate within
its jurisdiction passed an order under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the
purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of the other order, not being an
interlocutory order , and as to the regularity of such proceeding. Therefore, it is obvious that the
order passed under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 by the Family Court can
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82830629/ 15
Dr. Dilip Kumar @ Dr. Dilip Kumar Sharma @ ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 September, 2019
only be challenged by invoking the provision of Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, and
not by invoking the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure. The only rider of challenging the
order passed under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is that the said order
should not be interlocutory order but as I have already discussed that the interim maintenance
order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not an
interlocutory order rather it is an intermediate order which can be challenged under Section 19(4) of
the Family Courts Act, 1984 and, therefore, it is apparent from the aforesaid Patna High Court CR.
MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 discussions that the interim maintenance order passed
under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the Family Court cannot
be challenged under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 because the remedy is
available to challenge the said order in Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act itself.
33. In view of the aforesaid discussions, in my view, the matter requires consideration by a larger
Bench of this Court as in the case of Md. Akil Ahmad (supra), Learned Division Bench of this Court
has held that the interim maintenance order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is an interlocutory order, therefore, I formulate the following questions
for determination by a larger Bench:-
(I) Whether interim maintenance order passed under second proviso of Section 125
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is an interlocutory order or an intermediate
order?
(II) If the interim maintenance order passed under second proviso of Section 125 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is an intermediate order, whether revision
against the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.6740 of 2016 dt.02-09-2019 said order is
maintainable under Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, or not?
34. Let this order be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Bench for
giving decision on the above formulated questions.
(Hemant Kumar Srivastava, J) Partha Sarthy, J: I agree.
