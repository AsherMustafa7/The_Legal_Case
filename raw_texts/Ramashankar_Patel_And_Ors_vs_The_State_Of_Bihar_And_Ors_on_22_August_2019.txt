HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD
C.A.V. JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD)
Date : 22-08-2019
These two writ applications have been placed before
this Full Bench to resolve the issues raised by the learned Single
Judge in his order dated 20.03.2017 passed in C.W.J.C,. No. 11255
of 2016. In order to appreciate the reference, we think it just and
proper to re-produce the order dated 20.03.2017 as under :
"Heard learned counsel for the petitioners
and the State.
The petitioners have moved the Court
being aggrieved by non-consideration of their case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 2
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
for promotion to B.A. Trained Scale. The petitioners
have the degree of Sahitya Alankar from Hindi
Vidyapeeth, Deogarh which is claimed to be
equivalent to graduate degree. Learned counsel for
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019
3/46
the petitioners submitted that being equivalent, such
degree has to be recognized for the purposes of
promotion also, since based on such degree, they
havegot post graduate degree from Nalanda Open
University which is the University of the State
Government. Learned counsel has also drawn the
attention of the Court to the circular of the Personnel
and Administrative Reforms Department dated
11.01.1991
by which Sahitya Alankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deogarh has been made at par with B.A. degree
with the rider that it should be with English. Learned counsel submitted that even a Division Bench
of this Court in L.P.A. No. 11 of 2014 (Dr. Amresh Thakur Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) dated
27.01.2016 as well as L.P.A. No. 460 of 2014 (Binod Kumar Vs.The State of Bihar & Ors.) dated
19.08.2016 has held that a person having Sahitya Alankar degree on the basis of which he had
achieved higher qualification, shall be considered for the purpose of giving promotion to
B.A./Graduate Trained Scale. Learned counsel also referred to a co- ordinate Bench judgment dated
03.05.2016 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 4401 of 2013 (Chandra Bhushan Pd. Singh & Ors. Vs. The State
of Bihar & Ors.) for the same proposition.
Learned counsel for the State submitted that all the orders passed, including that by the Division
Benches, have not taken into consideration the earlier order passed by a Division Bench in C.W.J.C.
No. 13836 of 2012 ( Murlidhar Singh & Ors. Vs. the State of Bihar & Ors.) dated 27.11.2012, where it
has been held that for the Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 purposes of
employment or promotion the qualification of Sahitya Alankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deogarh
cannot be taken into consideration. Learned counsel submitted that the said view was also
expressed by this Court in earlier decisions of this Court in the cases of State of Bihar vs. Mamta
Kumari reported as 2010 (4) PLJR 318 and Poonam Sharma vs. State of Bihar reported as 2012(1)
PLJR 226. It was submitted that the Court in the said decision has referred to various articles of the
Bihar Education Code as well as provisions of the Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers'
Promotion Rules, 1993, which subsequent judgments have not considered.
In view of the aforesaid, in the opinion of this Court, the subsequent judgments of this Court relied
upon by learned counsel for the petitioners, having not considered/noticed the earlier Division
Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Murlidhar Singh & Ors. (supra), and also taking into
account the fact that subsequently the Government has also clarified the situation by categorically
holding that Sahitya Alankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deogarh shall not be recognized as equivalent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 3
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
to graduate degree in Notification No. 5267 dated 08.04.2016 of the General Administration
Department, the matter is referred to a Larger Bench for considering the issue.
Accordingly, the matter be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for being heard by a Full Bench."
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019
2. The petitioners in these cases were appointed as Assistant Teachers against Matric Trained Posts
and were posted in different elementary schools in the District of Begusarai. They had obtained their
certificate of Sahityaalankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohgar that was at the relevant time of their
appointment taken as equivalent to a graduation degree. It appears that some disputes with regard
to promotion of the elementary school teachers were under consideration in L.P.A. No. 985 of 1996
and its analogous cases which were ultimately disposed of on 21.04.2009 (Ramnath Prasad Singh
Vs. The State of Bihar reported in 2009 (3) PLJR 384 ) by Hon'ble Full Bench of this Court with a
direction to fill all the vacancies in light of the observations made. The relevant paragraph no.8 and
9 of the judgment of Ramnath Prasad Singh (Supra) are quoted hereunder for a ready reference :
"The learned Advocate General pointed out that in view of the direction of the
Division Bench, a consolidated list was prepared without any distinction between
Arts and Science teachers and fresh rules were framed (but not implemented) only
because of the directions of the Division Bench in Naresh Jha's case (supra) and due
to urgency of the matter but subject to the orders of the Court in these cases. In view
of the interim order, it has not been finalised. We are of the view that the direction of
the Division Bench in Naresh Jha's case (supra), without setting aside the valid
Promotion Rules 1993 was not correct. We overrule the same. It is for the
Government to make separate lists of qualified teachers for both Science and Arts
subjects as per the quota/unit fixed for promotion to Grade 4 and promotions can be
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 made separately depending
upon quota fixed for promotion among the Arts and Science teachers. But, after
Grade 4, a common seniority list is to be prepared for promotion, so that both Arts
and Science teachers could become Headmasters based on such common seniority
list as prescribed in the Promotion Rules, 1993.
9. In the light of the above, we are of the view that a fresh seniority list has to be
prepared in accordance with the Promotion Rules 1993 and the joint seniority list
prepared in accordance with the directions of the Division Bench in Naresh Jha's case
(supra) and the draft Rules created in 2006 subject to the approval of this Court with
regard to promotions cannot be acted upon. We direct the Government to prepare a
fresh list and make consequential promotions and transfers according to law. No
separate orders are necessary. In view of the interim order of status quo granted,
promotions were not made for the last 10 years. In the above circumstances, we
direct the Government to make separate seniority lists for promotion to Grade 4 for
Arts and Science teachers afresh and thereafter to prepare a consolidated list for
promotion as expeditiously as possible. The draft list should be published within
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 4
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment and the final
seniority list shall be thereafter published and promotions and transfers made in
accordance with law."
3. The State Government, thereafter, promulgated Bihar Elementary School Teachers Promotion
Rule 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Rules of 201') and proceeded to prepare the seniority list of
Matric Trained Teachers in the district in which the petitioners were posted. Name of these
petitioners found place in their respective position and to this extent they had no grievance. The
petitioners got aggrieved when they found that their names were not included in the final seniority
list which was prepared for promotion to the B.A. (Trained) posts. Respondent Patna High Court
CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 no. 5 and 6 prepared a separate seniority list of the persons
having degrees of Sahityaalankar obtained from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohgar and then without
publication of the final seniority list the respondent no. 5 and 6 promoted persons who were junior
to the petitioners. Name of these petitioners were not considered for promotion on the post of B.A.
(Trained) posts. A statutory appeal said to have been preferred before respondent no. 4 remained
pending.
4. It is the case of the petitioners no. 1 to 7 that they had passed out and were declared successful in
the Sahityaalankar examination in the year 2002, 2006, 2003, 2002, 1999, 2002 and 2000
respectively. They also completed their post graduation from Nalanda Open University after
obtaining due permission from the competent authority. Their results were published in the year
2009, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2002 and 2003 respectively. It is stated that all the petitioners have
done their post graduation in History subject except petitioner no. 2 who has done M. A. in Political
Science.
5. Petitioners have relied upon notification No. 541 dated 11.01.1999 issued by the General
Administration Department, Government of Bihar (Annexure '5') by which the Govt. of Bihar
declared and granted permanent equivalence to Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016
dt.22-08-2019 the degree of Sahityaalankar awarded by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar as equivalent to
graduation in Arts. They also sought to rely upon the Hon'ble Division Bench judgment of this Court
passed in L.P.A. No. 11 of 2014 (Dr. Amaresh Thakur Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors) and L.P.A. No.
1027 of 2014 (Ganesh Prasad Singh & Ors. V. The State of Bihar & Ors) to submit that the Hon'ble
Division Bench of this Court had in similar circumstances taken a view that Sahityaalankar from
Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar was granted equivalence with graduation for the purpose of joining as
Teacher and it is only by virtue of that Rules of the year 2011, effectively, the equivalence has been
taken away. Prior to 2011 Rules, first time on 27.08.2008 the State Government had issued circular
by which equivalence /validity have been withdrawn. Therefore, it pre-supposes that at least up to
2008, the State was recommending Sahityaalankar as equivalent to graduation and therefore, any
person who had earned the citation, cannot be denied benefit but any person who got it thereafter
cannot claim equivalence.

Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
6. Altogether 15 persons have joined in this writ application seeking a writ of Mandamus that the
Sahityaalankar degree acquired by the petitioners be treated as equivalent to a Patna High Court
CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 graduation degree and by virtue of that the petitioners be
granted promotion as per stipulated Rules and Regulations and to pay them the arrears from the
date of their eligibility for the promotion.
7. In the writ application in a tabular chart the petitioners have provided the date of their initial
appointment and the year in which they acquired Sahityaalankar degree. For ready reference this
Court is placing the same hereinbelow in a tabular chart by combining them as under:
Petitioner Date of Initial Appointment Sahityaalankar Degree no. Acquired in Year 1
06.12.1999 2002 2 06.12.1999 1998 3 30.06.1987 2000 4 06.12.1999 2010 5
06.12.1999 2002 6 06.12.1999 2002 7 20.11.1999 8 29.09.1994 2001 9 07.01.2000

2003 14 29.09.1994 2008 15 01.02.1993 2008
8. In course of hearing of the writ application learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners informed us
that some of the Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 petitioners had also
acquired post graduation degree. As regards petitioner no. 7 there was no information in the tabular
chart in the writ application with regard to the year in which he had obtained Sahityaalankar degree.
We had thus, permitted learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners to place the said information on
record through an affidavit. An affidavit in the form of second supplementary affidavit has been filed
on behalf of the petitioners in this writ application.
9. It is the case of the petitioners that out of 15 petitioners, seven petitioners namely, petitioner no.
1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 11 have improved their educational qualifications. Petitioners no. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 11
have done their post graduation from Nalanda Open University and Indira Gandhi National Open
University. Petitioner no. 3 and 6 have done M.A. (Setu) from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohgar.
10. It is further stated that petitioners no. 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are only Sahityaalankar.
Petitioner no. 4 has passed his Sahityaalankar in the year 2010, however, the petitioner no. 5, 7, 10,
12, 13, 14 and 15 all have acquired Sahityaalankar degree in between the year 2001 and 2008.
11. It is submitted that the promotion of the petitioners who are teachers of Elementary Schools is
governed by Bihar Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 Taken Over Elementary
Schools Teachers Promotion Rules, 1993 which came into effect on 09.07.1993 (hereinafter referred
to as the 'Rules'). Rule 2 (3) and Rule 2 (10) of the Rules provide the grades of Elementary Schools
Teachers. There are presently 8 grade scales in existence for the government teachers in the State of
Bihar. The grades as per their qualification are mentioned hereunder for sake of convenience:
Grade Classification
Grade 1 Matric trained Basic Scale
Grade 2 Matric trained Senior Scale
Grade 3 Matric trained Selection Scale
Grade 4 Trained Arts Graduate/Trained Science

Graduate
Grade 5 Trained Graduate Senior Scale
Grade 6 Trained Selection Scale
Grade 7 Middle School Headmasters Basic Scale
Grade 8 Middle School's Headmaster Senior Scale
12. It is stated that on 07.05.2012 when the gradation list was prepared, the name of the petitioners
was in the list but subsequently in the gradation list dated 16.06.2012 their names were removed on
the ground that the Sahityaalankar degree possessed by them is not recognized. It is submitted that
Rule 7(2) of the Rules which governs the promotion of the petitioners, Grade- 4, requires a trained
graduate and minimum 8 years of service in Grade 1, which the petitioners fulfill. According to Rule
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 4(2) of the Rules, the candidates should
possess the minimum prescribed educational qualification with reference to Rule 2(6) of the Rules
i.e. Trained Arts graduate. It is their submission that all languages are considered 'Arts' subject and
almost all the Universities of India offer degrees in Hindi and other languages which are 'Arts'
degree.
13. By filing a supplementary affidavit the petitioners have brought on record a notification
contained in Letter No. 3- 5267 dated 08.04.2016 issued by the General Administration
Department, Govt. of Bihar. This notification is said to have been issued keeping in view the
observations made by this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 13343 of 2011 (Reeta Srivastava Vs. The State of
Bihar & Ors. reported in 2012 (3) PLJR 353 ). The notification states that by the judgment and order
dated 07.05.2012 this Court held, that from the date of order, the different degrees awarded by
Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar were declared not to be valid but the order categorically held that all
degrees issued prior to 07.05.2012 by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar would not affect the appointment
and promotions already made. It is, thus, submitted on behalf of the petitioners that in view of the
notification dated 08.04.2016 (Annexure '2' to the supplementary affidavit) all the petitioners who
have obtained their Sahityaalankar degree prior to date of Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016
dt.22-08-2019 notification shall be entitled to have their degree of Sahityaalankar acknowledged for
consideration to the promotion in the scale of B.A. (Trained) Scale.
Stand of the State
14. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State in C.W.J.C. No. 11255 of 2016 a stand has
been taken that the State Government made a Rule with respect to promotions in Government
Elementary Schools. Copy of the notification no. 940 dated 06.09.2011 has been placed on record to
submit that the Promotion Committee called for applications from eligible teachers and after
considering the Rules and norms in the light of the notifications of the State Government and
adjudications of this Court found, that those candidates who do not fulfil the conditions under rules
and regulations of the State Government their candidatures are to be rejected.
15. Respondents have also referred to Memo No. 225 (Law) Patna dated 07.06.2012 issued to all the
District Education Officers of Bihar directing them that for promotion, Sahityaalankar degree is not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 7
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
sustainable/equivalent and are therefore not to be treated as equivalent. They have also relied upon
the judgment of this Court in the case of Reeta Srivastava (Supra) and have submitted that in similar
circumstances when Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 the teachers
belonging to the District of Banka filed writ application being C.W.J.C. No. 13836 of 2012
(Mulrlidhar Singh and Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) the same was referred to the Hon'ble
Division Bench and then the Hon'ble Division Bench has held that a certificate of Sahityaalankar
conferred by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohgar is not recognized for the purpose of appointment or
promotion of teachers. It is their submission that the petitioners who have got Sahityaalankar
degree during their service tenure are not possessing an equivalent citation to a graduation degree,
hence, in the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of Murlidhar Singh
(supra), the notification and the guidelines the petitioners have no case.
16. In C.W.J.C. No. 3828 of 2015 a counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the District
Programme officer (Establishment), Banka. It is his submission that in a case where minimum
qualification is prescribed as Bachelor degree, a person cannot claim promotion or their benefits by
virtue of acquiring a qualification of Sahityaalankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohghar. This counter
affidavit reiterates the judgment of this Court in the case of Reeta Srivastava (supra) and some of the
Hon'ble Division Bench Judgments on the same line. He has brought on record the notification
bearing Letter No. 10878 dated 24.08.2017 Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016
dt.22-08-2019 issued by the General Administration Department, Govt. of Bihar to submit that the
departmental order as contained in Memo No. 541 dated 11th January,1991 has been cancelled with
effect from 07.05.2012 i.e. the date of the judgment in the case of Reeta Srivastava (supra) but then
after obtaining opinion from the learned Advocate General a decision has been taken that the
appointments made and promotions given in between 07.05.2012 and 08.04.2016 on the basis of
Sahityaalankar degree obtained prior to 07.05.2012 shall remain unaffected but no
appointment/promotion shall be granted after 08.04.2016 on the basis of those certificates.
Consideration Developments during pendency of Reference
17. In the aforementioned background of the facts, before we proceed to take a view in these matters,
it would be important to note that the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court comprising two of us
(Hon'ble the Chief Justice and Hon'ble Justice Smt. Anjana Mishra) had occasion to consider
C.W.J.C. No. 5129 of 2009 (Sanjay Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) and its analogous matters
which were pending for consideration in view of the order of remand by the Hon'ble Patna High
Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 Apex Court passed on 6th January, 2016 in Civil
Appeal No. 4273 of 2014 and Civil Appeal No. 4274 of 2014.
18. In those writ applications a dispute had arisen with regard to selection and appointment on the
post of Librarian in an institution governed by the provisions of the Bihar Zila Parishad Madhyamik
Evam Uchchtar Madhyamik Shikshak Niyojan Evam Seva Sharten Niyamavali, 2006. The
petitioners were claiming their entitlement for employment on the ground that they possessed an
equivalent qualification of Sahityaalankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohar. Earlier the Hon'ble
Division Bench had allowed the writ application vide a decision reported in 2009 (4) PLJR 1038
(Sanjay Kumar & Or. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. ) Questioning the correctness of the judgment of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 8
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court the State of Bihar moved in Civil Appeals before the
Hon'ble Apex Court where the Hon'ble Apex Court had been pleased to note that an advertisement
bearing no. 11 dated 25.08.2008 was issued by Government of Bihar, Human Resources and
Development Department for appointment to the post of Librarian and Teacher in different schools
under Zila Parishad and Nagar Nikaya in the State of Bihar. The respondents applied for the post of
Librarian. After the advertisement was issued, the department came out with order no. Patna High
Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 11 /Ma.1-01/2008 on 27.08.2008 containing
exhaustive list of twenty eight colleges/universities /degrees that were not then recognized by the
Government of Bihar for the purpose of the Recruitment Rules 2006 and the Advertisement dated
25.08.2008 and such degrees were not valid for employment of teachers. Another order no.
11/M-44/2008-1968 was issued on 25.11.2008 declaring that the degree of Sahityaalankar awarded
by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohghar is not valid for employment.
19. Having taken note of the aforesaid facts, in paragraph 8, 9, 10 and 11 the Hon'ble Apex Court
discussed the issues and remitted the matter to the High Court for consideration. Those paragraphs
8, 9, 10 and 11 are quoted hereunder for a ready reference:
8. The issue involved in these appeals is concerned with the interpretation of
provisions in Rule 4 (k) (vii) (a) of Bihar District Council, Secondary & Higher
Secondary Teacher (Employment & Service Conditions) Manual 2006 as amended in
2008. As noticed earlier, Rule 4(k)(vii)(a) prescribes that the candidate must have
passed graduation examination with minimum 45% marks from any recognized
university. It is the contention of the State that the respondents do not fulfill the
eligibility criteria as they possessed graduation degree Patna High Court CWJC
No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 from Hindi Vidyapeeth Deoghar which is not a
recognized university. As noticed above, as per the direction of the Patna High Court
in CWJC No.15237/2007, the State of Bihar examined the matter and by an order
dated 25.11.2008 held that degree of Sahityaalankar cannot be a valid degree for
appointment as teacher. Para 6 of the said order reads as under:-
"In Bihar District Council/Urban Body
Secondary/Higher Secondary (Employment
and Service Conditions) Manual, 2006, there is no provision to employing on any
equivalent degree. Besides it, for employment, after deciding the all phases, the
degree of "Sahityaalankar" given by Deoghar Vidyapeeth and other many degrees
have not been decided recognized." Mainly, the holder of Sahityaalankar Degree
appear only at exam of some Sahitya papers while general B.A. pass the exam of
graduation in many papers, which is more useful for education, due to this reason the
degree of Sahityaalankar from Deoghar Vidyapeeth is not valid for employment."
Contention of the appellants is that pursuant to the above, the State sent instructions to all the
districts vide Order dated 13.12.2008 directing them to have appointment of teachers and librarians
in accordance with Recruitment Rules 2006 as amended in 2008 and notification governing the
validity of degrees.

Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
9. On behalf of the State, it is further submitted that the validity of Sahityaalankar degree from
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 the Hindi Vidyapeeth Deoghar and its
equivalence with the graduation degree has been considered in detail by the Patna High Court in
subsequent decisions filed by the State of Bihar in CWJC No.13343/2011 and several other
connected matters. It is submitted that in the above batch matters, High Court has rejected the
claim of the petitioners thereon that the Degree of Sahityaalankar is equivalent to graduation degree
and the State of Bihar heavily relies upon the said judgment in CWJC No.13343/2011 and batch
matters. It was also submitted that the letter dated 11.01.1991 should be read in consonance with
earlier circular with respect to Hindi Vidyapeeth Deoghar wherein it has been mentioned that any
recognition given to such degrees including Sahityaalankar is only for the purpose of Hindi
examination and not at par with graduation or equivalence and in this regard reliance is placed
upon Press Note dated 05.05.1988 issued by the Central Government.
10. Having regard to the stand of the appellants and reliance placed upon order dated 25.11.2008
and the Press Note dated 05.05.1988 and the subsequent decision in CWJC 13343/2011 etc. and in
the interest of justice without commenting on the merit of the case, we deem it necessary to remit
the matter back to the High Court for consideration afresh.
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019
11. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, the impugned order is set aside and the same is remitted
back to the High Court for consideration of the matter afresh after affording sufficient opportunity
to both the parties. Liberty granted to the parties to file additional documents/pleadings. We
request the High Court to dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible. The appeals are
disposed of accordingly. Consequently, intervention application stands disposed of granting liberty
to the interveners to approach the High Court in accordance with law. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs."
20. While considering the writ applications of Sanjay Kumar and Ors. (supra) the Hon'ble Division
Bench took note of the developments which took place during the pendency of the writ petitions.
The notification dated 08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 came to be considered and those are re-produced

21. At this stage the Hon'ble Division Bench noticed the notification dated 08.04.2016 which in the
last sentence stated that any appointment or promotion made on the basis of degree awarded prior
to 07.05.2012 shall not be affected. The subsequent notification dated 24.08.2017 which was by way
of a clarification was also taken note of by the Hon'ble Division Bench for the reason that the said
notification specifically clarified that any appointments made on the basis of a degree obtained prior
to Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 07.05.2012 between 07.05.2012 and
08.04.2016 shall remain unaffected. The contention of the learned Advocate General as regards the
notification dated 08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 were that these were the notifications of the State
Government through the General Administration Department, thus the same would not apply in
relation to appointment of teachers who are under the control of the Human Resources
Development Department, Govt. of Bihar. It was submitted that those notifications would not apply
either in respect of these writ petitioners or any similarly situated claimant. It was submitted that
the notification dated 27.08.2008 cannot be said to have been affected in any manner so as to
render any relief to the writ petitioners. The Hon'ble Division Bench, however, did not agree with
the submissions of learned Advocate General and held that the notification issued by one
Department or the other in the name of the Governor is a notification by the Government in exercise
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 12
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
of its executive power under Article 162 of the Constitution. The Hon'ble Division Bench refused to
split up the applicability of the notifications and held that the State itself had fortified the stand of
the petitioners by issuing a clarification which clearly contradicted the arguments advanced on
behalf of the State. The Hon'ble Division Bench in its concluding paragraph held as under:
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 ".......we find no reason to
accept any of the submissions on behalf of the State to the effect that the notifications
dated 08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 do not apply to the Education /Human Resources
Department. The clarificatory notification also in its last note again mentions the
effect that the same is being sent to all the Departments for information and
appropriate action......."
22. The Hon'ble Division Bench held that the writ petitioner namely, Sanjay Kumar
shall be reinstated in service forthwith and both the writ petitioners shall be treated
to have been validly appointed with their entitlement of consequential reliefs.
23. As regards C.W.J.C. No. 16483 of 2012, which was referred to the Hon'ble
Division Bench by a learned Single Judge and L.P.A. No. 894 of 2016 are concerned,
the writ petitioners and the appellants in those cases were denied promotional
pay-scales and benefits on the ground that they did not possess the minimum
eligibility qualification and were claiming the benefits on the strength of the degree of
Sahityaalankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohgar. The Hon'ble Division Bench
allowed both the writ applications as well as the appeal when it was found that both
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 were in possession of the
degree of Sahityaalankar obtained prior to the year 2008.
Case-Laws Discussed
24. Now coming to the conflicts pointed out by the learned Single Judge in the order of reference, we
find on facts it is quite evident that by notification bearing no. 541 dated 11.01.1991 the degree of
Sahityaalankar was treated to be equivalent to graduation degree provided the same has been
obtained along with English. The State Government issued a letter dated 27.07.2007 taking a stand
that the degree of Sahityaalankar awarded by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deohgar was not equivalent to
degree of graduation for purpose of appointment under the Bihar Education District Council,
Secondary and Higher Secondary Teachers (Employment and Services) Rules, 2006. The letter
dated 27.07.2007 was the subject matter of challenge in C.W.J.C. No. 15237 of 2007 (Pramod
Paswan Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.). In the said writ application the Sate was directed to take a
fresh decision and then the Government examined the matter and vide Memo No.
11/M-44/2008/1968 dated 25.11.2008 the Government of Bihar, Human Resources Development
Department issued letter No.11(Na.1-9/2008-2053 wherein it was specifically mentioned that the
degree of Sahityaalankar awarded Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 by
Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar cannot be attached to the merit list of the candidates.

Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
25. In the case of The State of Bihar & Ors. Vs. Mamta Kumari & Ors. reported in 2010 (4) PLJR
318, the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court considered the cases of the writ petitioners who had
obtained degree of Madhyama (Visharatd) from the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad between
2003 and 2005 and had applied for the post of Panchayat Teacher in the year 2006 (except one
Babita Kumari) they were subsequently removed from the service on the ground that they did not
possess the qualification for the post of Panchayat Teacher inasmuch as their degree of Shiksha
Visarad from Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad was neither recognized nor equivalent
qualification of Intermediate. The Hon'ble Division Bench heavily relied upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan and Ors. versus Lata Arun reported in (2002) 6
SCC 202 and held that the said judgment is a complete answer in all respect that examination of
Madhyama (Visharad) passed by the writ petitioners from Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad
cannot be treated equivalent to Intermediate Examination as prescribed under the Rules specially
when it's equivalence was never recognized by the State of Bihar. From a Patna High Court CWJC
No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 reading of this judgment it appears that in the said case the
Government of Bihar had not come out with any notification granting equivalence to the Madhyama
(Visharad) passed from Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad as equivalent of Intermediate
Examination prescribed under the Bihar Panchayat Primary Teachers (Appointment and Service
Condition) Rules, 2006. The Hon'ble Division Bench also distinguished the Division Bench
judgment of this Court in the case of State of Bihar & Ors. Vs. Poonam Sharma reported in 2009
(3)PLJR 84.
26. The Hon'ble Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Poonam Sharma Vs. The State
of Bihar reported in 2012 (1) PLJR 226 and its analogous matters considered the case of the
elementary teachers who were appointed in the Municipal Schools governed by the Bihar Municipal
Elementary Teachers (Employment and Service Conditions ) Rules 2006. The writ petitioners had
obtained their certificate of 'Prathama' awarded by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad. A
learned Single Judge of this Court vide its judgment and order dated 26th January, 2008 passed in
C.W.J.C. No. 6266 of 2007 allowed the writ petition and held that the certificate of 'Prathama'
awarded to the intervenors by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad prior to 31st December, 1997
was recognized by the State of Bihar Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 as a
qualification equivalent to the matriculation therefore, they were eligible for appointment as
Elementary Teachers in Municipal Schools. The said judgment was affirmed by the Hon'ble Division
Bench in Letters Patent Appeal No. 297 of 2009 and pursuant thereto the intervenors were
reinstated in service on 7th September, 2009. In the facts of the said case it was found that since
termination of the service of the intervenors on 21 th September, 2007 the respondent authorities
had operated the wait list and appointed some 11 persons against the resulting vacancies. But
consequent to the order of the High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 6266 of 2007 and reinstatement of the
intervenors in service on 7th September, 2009, the respondent authorities stopped paying salary to
the writ petitioners and feeling aggrieved by the same, the writ petitioners filed C.W.J.C. No. 13955
of 2010. The intervenors were allowed to intervene. The learned Single Judge was of the opinion
that once the original appointees (the intervenors) were reinstated in service under the order of the
Court, the writ petitioners were liable to be removed. But at this stage while disposing of the writ
petition, the learned Single Judge has also examined the claim of the intervenors and came to the
conclusion that the certificate of 'Prathama' awarded to them by Hindi Shahitya Sammellan,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 14
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
Allahabd was not recognized by the Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 State
of Bihar and therefore, the intervenors were not eligible for appointment as an Elementary Teachers
in Municipal Schools. The learned Single Judge had relied upon a Division Bench judgment of this
Court in the case of Surendra Prasad Sahi Vs. The State of Bihar and Ors. decided on 4th December,
2009 in L.P.A. No. 654 of 2009 and in the matter of Mamta Kumari (supra).
27. In this background the Hon'ble Division Bench proceeded to consider the matter and held that
as a matter of fact that at no pint of time any of the certificate awarded by the Hindi Sahitya
Sammelan, Allahabad was considered equivalent to matriculation or higher Secondary Intermediate
Examination as the case may be, by the State of Bihar. The reliance placed on the Government Order
dated 7th January, 1987 was held to be totally misleading and the accompanying equivalence
certificate refers, iner alia, to Hindi Viswavidyalaya, Allahabad and not to Hindi Sahitya Sammelan,
Allahabad. The Hon'ble Division Bench observed that the claim that the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan,
Allahabad and the Hindi Vishwavidalaya, Allahabad are one and the same institution is highly
questionable.
28. In the case of Murlidhar Singh (supra) the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court was considering
a writ application Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 which was referred to
the Division Bench to consider as to whether the qualification of Sahityalankar from Hindi
Vidyapeeth, Deoghar is equivalent to graduation in service and promotion in the State of Bihar more
particularly in the light of the Education Code of the decision of the State Government dated
11.01.1991 and what may be contained in Letter No. 1346 dated 27.08.2008.
29. In the said case the petitioners had obtained qualification of Sahityalankar from Hindi
Vidyapeeth, Deoghar, they were claiming qualification equivalent to graduate and being trained
graduate were looking for promotion to Grade 6. The Hon'ble Division Bench referred Article 359 of
the Bihar Education Code and held that in the State of Bihar the certificate of Sahityalankar
conferred by the Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar is not recognized for the purpose of appointments or
promotion of a teacher. Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of Mamta
Kumari (supra) and Poonam Sharma (supra). Article 359 of the Bihar Education Code which has
been referred by the Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of Murlidhar Singh (supra) is quoted
hereunder for a ready reference:
"Article 359 of the Bihar Education Code makes the intention of the State
Government not to engage any teacher who does not posses a Secondary School
Examination certificate from a recognized Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016
dt.22-08-2019 Board or a degree from a statutory University. It reads thus:
"Article 359. Appointment to teacher's post forbidden on the basis of equivalence of
Certificates.-In order to raise the quality of teaching in school, it has been decided by
the State Government that only those persons who have passed examinations held by
the Bihar School Examination Board, Central Board of Education, Secondary
Examination Boards of other States or Degrees obtained from statutory Universities
shall be compulsory for appointment to the post of teachers in the Primary,Middle
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 15
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
and High Schools.
2. x x x x x x------
3. But if teachers of Primary, Middle and High Schools pass examination equivalent
to Intermediate, Graduate, and Post-Graduate Degrees whose equivalence is
recognized by the Personnel Department as mentioned in the preceding Article, may
be promoted to higher pay-scale beyond matriculation. This facility shall not be given
to Middle trained teachers for getting Matric trained pay-scale on the basis of
equivalence. For getting Matric trained scale of pay, a Middle trained teacher must
pass the Secondary School Examination from the Bihar School Examination Board"
It may be reiterated here that the qualification of Sahitya Alankar is not mentioned in the preceding
article, Article 358.
It is thus clear that the qualification of Sahitya Alankar secured from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar is
not recognized for the purpose of appointment and promotion of the teachers.
In above view of the matter, we hold that in the State of Bihar the certificate of Sahitya Alankar
conferred by the Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar is not recognized for the purpose of appointment or
promotion of a teacher. The same view has been expressed by this Court in the matters of State of
Bihar and Ors. V. Mamta Kumari [2010(4) PLJR 318]; and of Poonam Sharma V. State of Bihar
[2012(1) PLJR 226].
Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 For the aforesaid reasons, we see no merit
in this petition. Petition is dismissed in limine."
30. During this period a learned Single Judge of this Court delivered a judgment in the case of Reeta
Srivastava (supra) on 07.05.2012 and held therein that the degree of Sahityalankar issued by Hindi
Vidyapeeth, Deohgar cannot be taken as a recognized degree.
31. There is another case which came before this Court in the case of Dr. Amaresh Thakur (supra)
where the writ petitioner had done their Intermediate from Bihar Intermediate Education Council
and then joined as Assistant Teacher in the year 1994, he was granted Matric Trained Scale.
Subsequently in the year 1999 he obtained the citation of Sahityalankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth,
Deoghar and in the year 2005 he completed his master of Arts from Nalanda Open University. The
petitioner thereafter, got his Ph.D. from Lalit Narayan Mishra University in the year 2010 and
certificate whereof were granted in the year 2011. Based on this he was granted graduate trained
scale but then the District Programme Officer cancelled the graduate trained scale on the ground
that in terms of Bihar Elementary Teachers Promotion Rules, 2011 a graduate means a degree at
graduate level granted by recognized university and Sahityalankar citation Patna High Court CWJC
No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 granted by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar not being a recognized
college and a recognized university it could not be treated as a valid degree. The Hon'ble Division
Bench did not go into the question of recognition of Sahityaalankar as legally equivalent to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 16
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
graduation certificate on the ground that the judgment in the case of Ganesh Prasad Srivastav & Ors.
Vs. Punjab National Bank & Ors., reported in 2004(1) PLJR 387. was passed on a different sets of
facts. The facts being disimilar and quite different the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court held that
in the undisputed facts where the petitioner has a doctorate degree from the recognized university of
Bihar if it is held that his graduation was irrelevant or illegal or not equivalent to the graduation
then, this Court would have to held that his post graduation and doctorate are also invalid. The
Hon'ble Division Bench found that prior to the Rules of 2011 the equivalence has been taken away
for the first time on 27.08.2008 which pre-supposes that at least up to 2008 the State was
recognizing Shahityalankar as equivalent to graduation and if a person who had earned his citation
before 27.08.2008 he cannot be denied benefit but a person who gets it thereafter cannot claim
equivalence.
32. In the case of Binod Kumar Vs. State of Bihar (L.P.A. No. 460 of 2014 decide don 19.08.2016)
another Hon'ble Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 Division Bench of this
Court was pleased to set aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge by relying upon the
judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Dr. Amaresh Thakur (supra) and held
that the case would be squarely applicable to the facts of the present case and hence, the order of the
learned Single Judge was not sustainable.
33. Having discussed the various case laws on the subject, we are of the considered opinion that
both line of the decisions of this Court have been rendered in different facts and circumstances. We
do not find any conflict even in both the sets of judgment. As noticed above, in the case of Mamta
Kumari (supra) the Hon'ble Division Bench of this court found that the Madhyama (Visharad)
passed by the writ petitioners from Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad was never recognized as
equivalent by the Government of Bihar, therefore, the said certificate cannot be treated to be
equivalent of Intermediate Examination as prescribed under the Rules of 2006 read with Rule 9 and
Article 358 of the Bihar Education Code. In the present case, it is an admitted position that the
citation of Sahityaalankar had been recognized as equivalent to graduation level vide notification
dated 11.01.1991. This is a distinguishable feature of this case. Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of
2016 dt.22-08-2019
34. Similarly in the case of Poonam Sharma & Ors. (supra) the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court
found that the 'Prathama' certificate issued by Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad was not
considered equivalent to Matriculation or higher secondary examination or Intermediate by the
State of Bihar and the reliance placed on the Government's order dated 7 th January 1987 was
totally misleading. It was found that equivalence certificate refers to 'Hindi Viswavidayalya',
Allahabad and not to the 'Hindi Sahitya Sammelan', Allahabad.
35. In the case of Reeta Srivastava (supra) decided on 07.05.2012 a learned Single Judge of this
Court had declared that the Sahityaalankar certificate issued by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar would
not be taken as a valid and recognized degree for appointment of Panchayat teachers but prior to
that for the first time on 27.08.2008 itself the State Government had issued a circular by which
equivalence/validity of Sahityaalankar as equivalent to graduation had been taken away.

Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
36. So far as Murlidhar Singh's case (supra) is concerned, this Court has taken note of the facts of
the said case. There seems to be no pleading before the Hon'ble Division Bench that the petitioners
there had obtained post graduation degree or any other higher degree from a recognized college and
university Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 in the State of Bihar. The
judgment in Murlidhar Singh's case (supra) was rendered on 09.08.2016 but we do not find any
reference to the judgment of the earlier Division Bench of this court in the case of Dr. Amaresh
Thakur (supra). It is evident from a bare reading of the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in
the Murlidhar singh's case (supra) that in the said case there was no pleading before the Hon'ble
Division Bench that the petitioners had obtained post graduation degree or any other higher degree
on the basis of Sahityaalankar degree taking the same as a graduation level certificate. Murlidhar
Singh's case (supra) therefore, did not refer the facts similar to Dr. Amaresh Thakur's case (supra).
Further another Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of Rajesh Prasad (L.P.A. No. 273 of
2015 decided on 09.08.2016) referred Ganesh Prasad Srivastav (supra) and Reeta Srivastava (supra)
affirmed in L.P.A. No. 1303 of 2012 (Smt. Usha Prasad Bhakta Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.). In this
case also the judgment does not refer to any facts showing that the petitioner had obtained post
graduate degree on the basis of Sahityaalankar from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar.
37. Thus, to this Court, there would be no hesitation in recording that the line of cases such as
Mamta Kumari (supra), Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 Poonam Sharma
(supra), Murlidhar Singh (supra) and Rajesh Prasad (supra) are of those line of cases in which the
Hon'ble Division Bench had no occasion to consider a case similar to the facts of Dr. Amaresh
Thakur (supra) and Binod Kumar (supra). In fact the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in the
case of Binod Kumar (supra) has been rendered only ten days after the judgment in the case of
Rajesh Prasad (supra) by the same Hon'ble Division Bench. In case of Binod Kumar (supra) the
Hon'ble Division Bench has followed Dr. Amaresh Thakur's case (supra) and finding that the said
decision clearly covers the facts of the said case the order of learned Single Judge was set- aside.
38. We are also of the view that by virtue of the two notifications which we have reproduced
hereinabove issued on 08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 the Government of Bihar has in fact created an
anomalous situation. The notification dated 08.04.2016 has been issued referring to the decision of
the learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Reeta Srivastava (supra) on 07.05.2014. This
clearly states that the Education Department (the then Human Resources Department) has already
declared the 'Praveshika' 'Sahitya Bhushan' and Sahityaalankar certificates of Hindi Vidyapeeth,
Deoghar invalid vide memo No. 3152 dated Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016
dt.22-08-2019 5.08.2008 and 1346 dated 27.08.2008 for the purpose of appointment in the
Elementary and Secondary/Higher Secondary Schools in the matter of appointment of Teachers.
Vide notification dated 08.04.2016 the earlier departmental order contained in memo dated 11th
January, 1991 was cancelled with effect from the date of judgment i.e. 07.05.2012 and it was
declared that the appointments made on the basis of different certificates awarded by the Hindi
Vidyapeeth, Deoghar prior to the said date shall remain unaffected. Thus, it appears to us that the
appointments made till 07.05.2012 on the basis of certificates awarded by Hindi Vidyapeeth,
Deoghar before 25.08.2008 were saved.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 18
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
39. The subsequent notification dated 24.08.2017 has been issued with an intention to save the
appointments/promotions granted between 07.05.2012 and 08.04.2016 on the basis of the degree
awarded by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar prior to 07.05.2012.
40. In our opinion, the notification dated 08.04.2016 clearly provided that the appointments made
prior to 07.05.2012 on the basis of the certificates granted by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar shall not
get affected. The notification dated 08.04.2016 did not extend the validity of the certificates granted
after Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 25.08.2008. The notification vide
Memo No. 3152 dated 25.08.2008 and Memo No. 1346 dated 27.08.2008 had already declared the
certificates granted by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar invalid for the purpose of teachers appointment
but when the notification dated 24.08.2017 was issued, paragraph '3' of the said notification was
couched in different words without referring to the Memo No. 3152 dated 25.08.2008 and 1346
dated 27.08.2008. The reference seems to have been purposely avoided. As both the notifications
are of the same General Administration Department, Government of Bihar. In this background the
notification dated 24.08.2017 has been issued saying that the appointments made and promotions
granted between 07.05.2012 and 08.04.2016 on the basis of the certificates granted by Hindi
Vidyapeeth, Deoghar prior to 07.05.2012 shall remain unaffected. The last notification of the
General Administration Department has, thus, done two things by ignoring the order as contained
in Memo No. 3152 dated 25.08.2008 and 1346 dated 27.08.2008 issued by the Education
Department, Government of Bihar. The first consequence of it is that now they have granted validity
to the certificates issued by Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar from 25.08.2008 till 06.05.2012 and
secondly they have validated the appointments Patna High Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016
dt.22-08-2019 made on the basis of those certificates after 07.05.2012 till 08.04.2016.
41. It is because of those two notifications the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of
Sanjay Kumar (supra) has declared that the notifications issued by the Education Department as
well as the Administration Department cannot be taken differently because the notifications issued
by one Department or the other in the name of Governor is a notification by the Government. We,
therefore, find that the subsequent notification dated 08.04.2017 has in fact undone the effect of the
memo dated 25.08.2008 and 27.08.2008 issued by the Human Resources Development
Department. The respondent State and its authorities have to hold themselves responsible for this
anomalous situation. We find that in the case of Sanjay Kumar (supra) in fact the writ petitioners
had obtained degree of Sahityaalankar prior to the year 2008 but was offered appointment on
26.12.2015 and then Sanjay Kumar and others were given benefits of the notification dated
08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 as those were not under challenge before the Hon'ble Division Bench.
The judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of Sanjay Kumar (supra) and its analogous
matters are thus, in relation to a third kind of fact situation. Mr. Raghwanand, learned Patna High
Court CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 Government Counsel has reiterated the stand of
learned Advocate General in the case of Sanjay Kumar (supra). No other issue or argument has been
raised.
42. In the light of the discussions made hereinabove, we conclude that there is no conflict of opinion
in the two sets of cases which have been referred by the learned Single Judge. The judgments of the
Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of Mamta Kumari (supra), Poonam Sharma (supra)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 19
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
and Murlidhar Singh (supra) were rendered in a totally different fact situation. The judgment of the
Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of Dr. Amaresh Thakur (supra) and Binod Kumar
(supra) even though does not refer the earlier judgments of the learned co-ordinate Bench, they
have been rendered in respect of the petitioner(s) who had acquired higher qualification. These two
judgments are, therefore, not in conflict with the earlier judgments on the subject. We answer the
reference accordingly.
43. We would have referred the matters back to the learned Single Judge at this stage, but as
recorded in our order dated 07.08.2019, learned counsel for both the parties have given their
consent and have requested this Court to finally dispose of both the writ applications after resolving
the legal issues. We, therefore, proceed to dispose of both the writ applications. Patna High Court
CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019
44. So far as the present case is concerned, we find that the writ petitioner in C.W.J.C. No. 11255 of
2016 would be fully covered by the judgments rendered by the Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of
Dr. Amaresh Thakur (supra) and Binod Kumar (supra) as the petitioners have done their post
graduation from Nalanda Open University with due permission of competent authority. They are,
thus, entitled to be considered for the benefit of B.A. (Trained) scale from the date on which the
juniors to them have been granted the same benefits. We accordingly, direct the respondent
authorities to consider the case of the petitioners and grant them the same benefits with effect from
the date the benefits have been granted to the juniors to the petitioners.
45. In C.W.J.C. No. 3838 of 2015 we find that some of the petitioners have obtained post graduation
degree from Nalanda Open University and Indira Gandhi National Open University, therefore, their
cases are squarely covered by the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in the Case of Dr.
Amaresh Thakur (supra). Some of the petitioners have done M.A. (Setu) from Hindi Vidyapeeth,
Deoghar and some of them have done Sahityaalankar. Except petitioner no. 4 all other petitioners
have acquired their Sahityaalankar degree / citation up to the year 2008. Patna High Court CWJC
No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 Petitioner no. 4 has, however, acquired his Sahityaalankar citation
in the year 2010.
46. In terms of the notification of the General Administration Department as contained in Memo
No. 541 dated 11th January, 1991 the Sahityaalankar certificate had got equivalence to the
graduation at least prior to 25.08.2008, therefore, those writ petitioners who obtained their
Sahityalankar degree from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar prior to 25.08.2008 would come within the
framework of the notification dated 11 th January, 1991 and shall be entitled for consideration for
promotion to B.A. (Trained) Scale. By virtue of the notification dated 08.04.2016, the promotions
granted between 07.05.2012 and 08.04.2016 have been saved. Further by notification dated
17.04.2017 now even the degree obtained prior to 07.05.2012 and the appointment/promotion
granted between 07.05.2012 and 08.04.2016 have been saved. In these circumstances the
petitioners no. 4, 7 and 15 shall also be entitled for the benefits because in both cases i.e. notification
dated 08.04.2016 and notification dated 17.04.2017 the State respondents cannot contend that
while the promotions granted to the persons junior to the petitioners in the gradation list between
07.05.2012 and 08.04.2016 shall be saved, the petitioners would not be entitled Patna High Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118786862/ 20
Ramashankar Patel And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 August, 2019
CWJC No.11255 of 2016 dt.22-08-2019 for the same. This would be discriminatory because once
equivalence granted to Sahityaalankar degree obtained from Hindi Vidyapeeth, Deoghar prior to
07.05.2012 is saved it will save the petitioners who have their Sahityaalankar degree obtained prior
to 07.05.2012. They would be entitled to maintain their position in the seniority list and in case
juniors to them have been granted promotion in terms of B.A. (Trained) Scale, these petitioners
shall also be entitled for the same from the date their juniors have received the benefit.
47. We answer the reference accordingly and both the writ applications are thus, allowed.
