CORAM:
JUSTICE SASHIKANTA MISHRA
JUDGMENT
th 6 February, 2025 SASHIKANTA MISHRA, J. All these writ applications involve a common
question of fact and law and as such, they were heard together and are being disposed of by this
common judgment.
FACTS
2. An advertisement was published by the Collector- cum-DPC, DRDA Subarnapur on 30.06.2018
inviting applications from intending candidates for their appointment as Gram Rozgar Sevaks
(GRS) in different Gram Panchayats of Subarnapur District. 19 posts were notified, of which 5 were
reserved for SC and 14 for ST candidates. Said advertisement, inter alia, mentioned that the „post(cid:129)
of GRS under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 2
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
contractual and the engagement would be initially for a period of one year, which can be extended
on the basis of satisfactory performance and recommendation by the concerned Block Development
Officer. It also mentioned that the provisions of Odisha Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and
Services (for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Act, 1975 (in short "ORV Act") and Rules
formulated thereunder shall be strictly followed.
3. Prior to publication of the advertisement, the Government in the Department of Panchayati Raj
and Drinking Water formulated comprehensive guidelines for selection and engagement of GRS
under MGNREGS as per Notification dated 06.04.2018. Among other things, it was provided that
the provisions of ORV Act shall be strictly followed in the selection of GRS and that GRS will form a
district cadre. Pursuant to the advertisement and upon submission of applications by the intending
candidates, selection was made and on 03.12.2018, a final list was prepared. After verification of
documents produced by the selected candidates, a revised final merit was published.
4. While the matter stood thus, one Biswaranjan Panigrahi, a person belonging to the general
category, has filed W.P.(C) No.13017 of 2018 challenging the guidelines as well as advertisement
mainly on the ground that the principles of reservation could not have been applied to all the 19
posts notified to be filled up. The following relief has been claimed in the said writ application:
"Under the above circumstances it is humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may
graciously be pleased to issue a writ in appropriate nature to quash the
Advertisement dated 30.6.2018 so far as the decision to reserve all 19 posts in favour
of reserved category and direct the respondents to issue advertisement afresh
maintaining the ceiling limit of 50% as per the settled position of law pertaining
reservation or treating all the posts as unreserved being single posts in different gram
Panchayats of Subarnapur district and consider the candidatures of all eligible
candidates irrespective of category for such selection and this Hon'ble Court may
further be pleased to quash the guidelines dated 06.04.2018 issued by Panchayatraj
Department so far as the decision to apply the provisions of ORV Act and Rules to the
selection of GRS and making the post of GRS is District Cadre concerned.
Any other order/ orders, direction/directions as would be deemed fit and proper be
issued in the interest of justice and equity."
5. On the other hand, the petitioners in the other two writ applications i.e., W.P.(C) No.15082 of
2020 and W.P.(C) No. 21256 of 2021 having been selected pursuant to the above advertisement,
filed those writ applications because of the delay in issue of engagement orders in their favour.
6. Be it noted that the petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 15082 of 2020 had earlier approached this Court in
W.P.(C) No. 21777 of 2019, which was disposed of by order dated 21.11.2019 by directing the
Collector to take a decision on the representation filed by them. Pursuant to such order, the
Collector vide order dated 27.12.2019 held that the engagement of GRS is not possible at present as
this Court has passed an interim order in the writ application filed by Biswaranjan Panigrahi being
W.P.(C) No. 13017 of 2018. As such, the petitioners have filed W.P.(C) No. 15082 of 2020 seeking
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 3
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
the following relief:
"The petitioners therefore humbly (sic) pray that the Hon'ble Court may be graciously
pleased to admit this case, issue notice to opposite parties for show cause and after
hearing both the sides may be pleased to issue a writ in nature of
mandamus/certiorari with a direction to the opposite parties particularly to O.P. No.-
2 i.e. Collector, Subarnapur to take immediate steps to issue appointment letters as
per selection list published vide advertisement No.275 dated 17.01.2019 vide
Annexure- 2 series for the post of Gram Rozgar Sevak (GRS) in Subarnapur district
on the basis of the earlier order of this Hon'ble court vide Annexure-4 by modifying
the order passed by Collector, Subarnapur vide Annexure- 5 within a stipulated
period with cost.
And to pass such other order or direction as this Hon'ble Court deems just, fit, equitable and proper
in the facts and circumstances of the present case."
7. While the matter stood thus, the Collector, Subarnapur issued another advertisement on
24.03.2021 inviting applications for engagement of GRS in different GPs of the district Subarnapur.
25 posts were notified, of which, 10 were reserved for SC, 11 for ST and 4 for unreserved candidates.
Challenging the aforesaid advertisement, the petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 15082 of 2020 have again
approached this Court in W.P.(C) No. 21256 of 2021 seeking the following relief:
"The petitioners therefore humbly(sic) pray that the Hon'ble Court may be graciously
pleased to admit this case, issue notice to opposite parties for show cause and after
hearing both the sides may be pleased to issue a writ in nature of
mandamus/certiorari with a direction to the opposite Parties particularly to O.P. No.-
2 to take immediate steps to give appointment as per selection list published in
advertisement No. 275 dated 17.01.2019 vide Annexure- 2 series for the post of Gram
Rozgar Sebhak (GRS) in Subarnapur district by quashing the present advertisement
i.e. Advertisement dated 24.03.2021, vide Annexure-6 within a stipulated period with
cost.
And to pass such other order or direction as this Hon'ble Court deems just, fit,
equitable and proper in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
And for which act of kindness, the petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray."
8. The other writ petition, being W.P.(C) No. 29309 of 2022 has been filed by the candidates
selected pursuant to the advertisement dated 30.06.2018 claiming the following relief:
"It is therefore, most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court be graciously pleased to
i) Admit the writ application.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 4
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
ii) Call for the record.
iii) Issue a writ in the nature of Mandamus by directing the opp. parties to issue
necessary engagement order for the post of GRS on the basis of their rank in the
select list which was prepared pursuant to their advertisement dated 30.06.2018 and
further direction may be issued to extend all financial and service benefits in favour
of the petitioners within a reasonable time to the stipulated by this Hon'ble Court.
iv) And/or pass such other or der/orders, direction/directions as this Hon'ble Court
may deems fit and proper for the ends of justice.
And for the said act of kindness, the petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray."
9. Thus, out of the four writ applications so filed, three, being W.P.(C) No. 15082 of 2020, W.P.(C)
No. 21256 of 2021 and W.P.(C) No.29309 of 2022 are filed by the candidates selected pursuant to
the advertisement dated 30.06.2018, who are aggrieved by non-issuance of engagement orders in
their favour. On the other hand, the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.13017 of 2018 is an outsider, who
challenges the advertisement as well as comprehensive guidelines on the ground that all the posts
notified could not have been reserved for SC and ST Category.
10. In view of the importance of the issue involved, this Court requested the assistance of two senior
Counsel Ms. Pami Rath and Mr. P.K. Rath as Amicus Curiae.
11. Heard learned counsel, Mr. B.B. Mohanty for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.13017 of 2018; Mr. J.
Gupta for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.15082 of 2020 and W.P.(C) No. 21256 of 2021; and Mr. S.K.
Samal for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No. 29309 of 2022 and also Mr. S.N. Pattnaik, learned Addl.
Government Advocate for the State in all the cases.
Submissions against the Advertisement dated 30.06.2018 and comprehensive guidelines dated
06.04.2018
12. Mr. B.B. Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to assail the guidelines dated
06.04.2018 in so far as the same provides for application of the provisions of the ORV Act and
making the GRS a district cadre post and consequently the advertisement dated 30.06.2018 in so far
as it provides for reservation of all the 19 posts notified on the following grounds:
(i) GRS is not a civil post as per OCS (CCA) Rules, 1962 nor under the Mahatma
Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005.
(ii) Admittedly, GRS is a contractual engagement as per comprehensive guidelines as
also the advertisement renewable from year to year.
(iii) Section 3(d) of the ORV Act specifically bars applicability of the said Act to
contractual posts.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 5
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
(iv) Section 19 of the ORV Act gives overriding effect to the Act as against any Rule,
order, guidelines etc. Therefore, any guidelines issued by the Central Government or
the State Government to the contrary has no force of law.
13. Admittedly, 109 „posts(cid:129) of GRS were available in Subarnapur district, all of which being single
„posts(cid:129) were filled up without adhering to the principle of reservation at the relevant time. The
impugned advertisement intends to retrospectively apply the principle of reservation to the said
„posts(cid:129), which is not permissible in law. Moreover, the comprehensive guidelines dated 06.04.2018
itself provides for its prospective application only.
Submissions supporting the advertisement and comprehensive guidelines.
14. Mr. S.N. Pattnaik, learned Addl. Government Advocate, supported by Mr. J. Gupta, and Mr. S.K.
Samal, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in other three writ applications, has made the
following submissions.
(i) GRSs are engaged on contractual basis in each Gram Panchayat for execution of
work, which is co-terminus with MGNREG Scheme. Finance Department concurred
in the creation of 6234 posts of GRS on 22.09.2014 and after reorganization of Gram
Panchayats in 2017, it again concurred in the creation of 567 new posts, taking the
total number of posts to 6801.
(ii) There are 96 Gram Panchayats in Subarnapur district prior to reorganization,
which increased to 109 after reorganization. The circulars issued by the Government
in 2006 and 2013 relating to GRS have lost their force in view of the issuance of the
comprehensive guidelines dated 06.04.2018.
(iii) Out of the 109 GRS posts in Subarnapur District, only 9 SC, 29 UR and 50 SEBC
category persons are in position. There is thus, a deficit of 9 SC and 25 ST candidates
and surplus of 10 belonging to UR and SEBC taken together. Therefore, there is no
question of filing up the vacancy of UR or SEBC category as only 19 posts of GRS
were available. Thus, the claim of the petitioner regarding exceeding 50% ceiling of
reservation and of making 100% reservation is factually incorrect.
(iii) At the relevant time, there being only one post of GRS in each Gram Panchayat,
there was no application of reservation but after becoming a district cadre post it was
found that there was no proper representation of the reserved category candidates,
for which the impugned advertisement was issued only to make good the shortfall so
as to ensure proper representation of all communities.
(iv) Though initially, the GRS was a single post but now it has been clubbed up and a
district cadre has been formed. Further, for appointment of the village level workers
as per Orissa Village Level Workers (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules,
2008, 30% of the vacancies are to be filled up by selection from amongst GRS.

Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
Submissions by Amicus Curiae
15. Ms. Pami Rath, learned Senior Counsel submits that Article-16(4) and (4-A) of the Constitution
are enabling provisions conferring power on the State to provide reservation. No one can claim
reservation as a Fundamental Right by virtue of Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India. Ms. Rath,
has referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Case Mukesh Kumar v. State of
Uttarakhand1, in this regard. She further submits that exercising its legislative (2020) 3 SCC 1
power, the State of Odisha enacted ORV Act making it applicable to all posts under the State
excluding certain categories of posts as laid down in Section 3 thereof. Section- 3(d) excludes the
applicability of the Act to contractual posts. That apart, Section 19 has an overriding effect over all
other Rules, resolutions etc. GRS being a contractual engagement, the provisions of the ORV Act
cannot be made applicable as the same would run contrary to its provisions. Ms. Rath further
submits that there is no question of retrospectively applying reservation to a post which itself was
not subject to reservation at the relevant time. Ms. Rath concludes her argument by submitting that
reservation is always in respect of the post and not the employee and further, reservation does not
mean that the reserved category candidate cannot compete for the unreserved seats.
16. Mr. P.K. Rath, learned Senior Counsel would submit that there is no provision in the
Constitution or in any other law for retrospective application of the principles of reservation.
Further, reservation is a benefit claimed by a candidate. The State cannot force reservation upon a
candidate. Since in the instant case the concerned persons were appointed admittedly when there
was no reservation, the State cannot subsequently segregate them on the basis of the social
categories to which they belong and apply the principle of reservation suo motu at this distance of
time. In any case, the posts being contractual in nature, they stand automatically excluded from the
purview of the ORV Act and in view of the overriding provision of Section 19, the State has no power
to make the Act applicable by an executive/administrative decision.
Analysis and findings
17. The concept of reservation flows from Article-16 of the Constitution, Clause-4 of which confers
power on the State to make provision for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any
backward class of citizens, which in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the
services under the State. As argued by Ms. Rath, learned Amicus Curiae, it is basically an enabling
provision utilizing which the State can make laws to provide for reservation to the backward classes.
For instance, the State of Odisha has enacted ORV Act to provide for reservation in appointment to
members of the SC and ST communities. It is thus, a positive benefit conferred by the legislature
drawing power from the Constitutional provision but then, reservation is not automatic but a right
to be claimed by persons belonging to the reserved categories. Unless a claim is laid it is not for the
State to provide the benefit to a person only because he belongs to a particular social category. This
is being said for the reason that it is open to persons of all social categories to compete on merits
without claiming reservation. In the case of Mukesh Kumar (supra), the Supreme Court observed as
follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 7
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
"12. Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) do not confer fundamental right to claim reservations
in promotion [Ajit Singh (2) v. State of Punjab, (1999) 7 SCC 209 : 1999 SCC (L&S)
1239] . By relying upon earlier judgments of this Court, it was held in Ajit Singh (2)
[Ajit Singh (2) v. State of Punjab, (1999) 7 SCC 209 : 1999 SCC (L&S) 1239] that
Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) are in the nature of enabling provisions, vesting a
discretion on the State Government to consider providing reservations, if the
circumstances so warrant. It is settled law that the State Government cannot be
directed to provide reservations for appointment in public posts [C.A. Rajendran v.
Union of India, (1968) 1 SCR 721 : AIR 1968 SC 507] . Similarly, the State is not
bound to make reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of
promotions. However, if they wish to exercise their discretion and make such
provision, the State has to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of
representation of that class in public services. If the decision of the State Government
to provide reservations in promotion is challenged, the State concerned shall have to
place before the Court the requisite quantifiable data and satisfy the Court that such
reservations became necessary on account of inadequacy of representation of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in a particular class or classes of posts
without affecting general efficiency of administration as mandated by Article 335 of
the Constitution. [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC
(L&S) 1013]
13. Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) empower the State to make reservation in matters of
appointment and promotion in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
"if in the opinion of the State they are not adequately represented in the services of
the State". It is for the State Government to decide whether reservations are required
in the matter of appointment and promotions to public posts.
The language in clauses (4) and (4-A) of Article 16 is clear, according to which, the inadequacy of
representation is a matter within the subjective satisfaction of the State. The State can form its own
opinion on the basis of the material it has in its possession already or it may gather such material
through a Commission/Committee, person or authority. All that is required is that there must be
some material on the basis of which the opinion is formed. The Court should show due deference to
the opinion of the State which does not, however, mean that the opinion formed is beyond judicial
scrutiny altogether. The scope and reach of judicial scrutiny in matters within the subjective
satisfaction of the executive are extensively stated in Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board
[Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board, AIR 1967 SC 295] , which need not be reiterated.
[Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1]"
To reiterate, reservation is a claim and not an automatic conferment of right on a
person.
18. Before proceeding to examine the applicability of the provisions of the ORV Act in the matter of
engagement of GRS, it would be apt to keep in mind the fundamental principle underlying
reservation that a single post cannot be reserved, as it would amount to 100% reservation, as was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 8
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
held by the Supreme Court in the case of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research2
v. Faculty Assn. The following observations of the Supreme Court in the aforesaid case are
noteworthy.
"34. In a single post cadre, reservation at any point of time on account of rotation of
roster is bound to bring about a situation where such a single post in the cadre will be
kept reserved exclusively for the members of the backward classes and in total
exclusion of the general members of the public. Such total exclusion of general
members of the public and cent per cent reservation for the backward classes is not
permissible within the constitutional framework. The decisions of this Court to this
effect over the decades have been consistent.
35. Hence, until there is plurality of posts in a cadre, the question of reservation will
not arise because any attempt of reservation by whatever means and even with the
device of rotation of roster in a single post cadre is bound to create 100% reservation
of such post whenever such reservation is to be implemented. The device of rotation
of roster in respect of single post cadre will only mean that on some occasions there
will be complete reservation and the appointment to such post is kept out of bounds
to the members of a large segment of the community who do not belong to any
reserved class, but on some other occasions the post will be available for open
competition when in fact on all such occasions, a single post cadre should have been
filled only by open competition amongst all segments of the society."
19. To briefly advert to the facts of the case, it is admitted that there were 96 „posts(cid:129) of GRS in
Subarnapur district, which were Gram Panchayat-based and as such, were single „posts(cid:129). Therefore,
appointments were made to the said „posts(cid:129) without applying the principles of reservation. The
number of „posts(cid:129) increased to 109 after reorganization. (1998) 4 SCC 1 There were 19 vacancies at
the time of issuance of the impugned advertisement. As per the comprehensive guidelines dated
06.04.2018, the Government decided to make the GRS a district cadre „post(cid:129) meaning thereby, that
all 109 „posts(cid:129) formed a part of single cadre. Thus, 96 „posts(cid:129), which were originally single „posts(cid:129),
now purportedly became part of a cadre comprising 109 „posts(cid:129).
20. In its counter affidavit filed in W.P.(C) No.29309 of 2022, the State has enclosed the operational
guidelines of MGNREG Act, 2005 of which, Clause-4.6.7 (ii) provides as follows:
"(ii) In the recruitment process, the reservation policy of the State for contractual
employment should be followed. The MGNREGS staff should be adequately
represented by women, SCs, STs. Disabled etc."
The MGNREG Act, 2005 however, does not provide for any such provision regarding engagement of
GRS. The State of Odisha has applied the provisions of the ORV Act to the engagement of GRS as
per the comprehensive guidelines dated 06.04.2018. It is to be seen whether such application of the
provisions of the Act is permissible in law or not.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 9
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
21. The ORV Act was enacted to "provide for adequate representation of scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes in posts and services under the State". The term „posts(cid:129) has not been defined in the
Act. The Odisha Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal Rules, 1962 provides for
classification of posts under Rule-8, and reads as under;
"8. Classification of post - [(1) Civil Posts under the State other than those ordinarily
held by persons to whom these rules do not apply or included in any State Civil
Service shall by a general or special order of the Governor, issued in this behalf, be
classified as follows :-
(i) State Civil Posts, Group-A
(ii) State Civil Posts, Group-B
(iii) State Civil Posts, Group-C
(iv) State Civil Posts, Group-D (2) Any order made by the competent authority and in
force immediately before the commencement of these rules relating to classification
of civil posts under the State shall continue to be in force until altered, rescinded or
amended by an order of Governor under sub-rule (1).
(3) If any Civil post under the State has not been classified by an order of the
Governor and a question as to its classification arises, the decision thereon of the
appropriate department of Government after taking into account the class to which
another Civil Post carrying a comparable scale of pay belongs, shall be final."
22. Admittedly, GRS has not been classified as Civil Post as per Rule-8 of the 1962 Rules. There is
also no post of GRS provided under MGNREG Act, 2005. On the contrary, the comprehensive
guideline dated 06.04.2018, without saying that it is a civil post, specifically mentions that it is a
contractual post. In fact, the introduction to the comprehensive guidelines read as follows:
"Multipurpose Assistants namely Gram Rozgar Sevaks (GRSs) are engaged on
contractual basis in each Gram Panchayat for execution of work which is co-terminus
with MGNREG Scheme. Government in Finance Department concurred in creation
of 6234 nos. of posts of Gram Rozgar Sevaks (GRSs) on 22-09-2014.
Consequent upon reorganization of Gram Panchayats, Finance Department have concurred in
creation of 567 new posts of GRS increasing the total no. of posts of GRS to 6801.
The selection of GRSs on contractual basis should be done in a fair and transparent manner at the
District level under the overall direction, control & supervision of Collector-cum-DPCs in the
capacity of CEO, Zilla Parishad abiding by the following Guidelines:"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 10
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
23. The following provisions of the comprehensive guidelines are also relevant and are quoted
hereinbelow:
EXECUTION OF AGREEMENT & ISSUE OF ENGAGEMENT ORDER;
UNDERTAKING:
• Prior to execution of agreement, an undertaking should be obtained from the GRS
as follows: - • "I am quite aware that the engagement offered is purely temporary and
for a specific purpose of executing the work under MGNREGA and this is not a
permanent job. Hence, I solemnly affirm that I would not claim my permanent
absorption in the job under State Government/ Zilla Parishad/ Panchayat Samities/
Gram Panchayats etc. Further, I undertake not to approach any Court of Law for
engaging me on permanent basis under the State Government or any other
organization merely on the ground of my engagement as Gram Rozgar Sevak". (Ref:
Letter No. 5664 dated 07-02-2008] • The Collector-cum-CEO, Zilia Parishad will
execute an agreement with the GRS in Non-judicial stamp paper and issue
engagement order (contractual and coterminous with the Scheme).
• If any fraudulent testimonial is detected in future or if he/she has been criminally
prosecuted, the engagement shall be cancelled without notice and action as deemed
proper will be taken against him/her as per the provision of Law.
NATURE OF ENGAGEMENT:
The GRS will be engaged on contractual basis for a period of one year. The selected
candidates who join may be engaged in any Gram Panchayat of the concerned
District by the Collector-cum-CEO, Zilla Parishad.
RENEWAL OF CONTRACT:
The BOG will assess the performance of GRS of each Gram Panchayat every year as
per their Job Chart. On the basis of the satisfactory performance and
recommendation by the EDO, the contract of GRS may be renewed for another one
year by the Collector-cum- CEO, Zilla Parishad; and so on.
REMUNERATION:
The GRS may be paid a consolidated monthly remuneration of Rs.5000/- (Rupees
Five Thousand) which may be revised with the approval of Government. The
remuneration may be paid from the Administrative Contingency of MGNREGS
parked at District level. Payment of remuneration may be made through e-FMS. [Ref:
Letter No. 7240 dated 27-04-2016] Thus, from a conjoint reading of all the
aforequoted provisions there can be no manner of doubt that engagement of a GRS is

Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
not against any civil post in the State of Odisha but is a purely contractual
engagement, initially for a period of one year and renewable from time to time
depending on performance.
24. Having held that GRS is a purely contractual engagement, the question is, whether the
provisions of ORV Act would be applicable, as has been sought to be done in the comprehensive
guidelines as well as the advertisement dated 30.06.2018. Firstly, GRS not being a „post(cid:129) or
„service(cid:129) under the State, the provisions of the ORV Act would ordinarily not be applicable.
Secondly, Section-3 of the ORV Act reads as follows:
"3.Applicability- This Act shall apply to all appointments to the Posts and Services
under the State except-
(a) Class I posts which are above the lowest rank thereof and meant for conducting or
guiding or directing Scientific and Technical research;
(b) Class I posts which are above the lowest rank thereof and classified as scientific
posts;]
(c) tenure posts;
(d) those filled up on the basis of any contract;
(e) ex-cadre posts;
(f) those which are filled up by transfer within the cadre or on deputation;
(g) the appointment of such staff the duration of whose appointment does not extend
beyond the term of office of the person making the appointment and the work
charged staff which are required for emergencies like flood relief work, accident
restoration and relief etc.;
(h) temporary appointments of less than forty-five days duration;
(h-1) those which are required to be filled up by appointment of persons under the rehabilitation
assistance given to the members of the family of the deceased of permanent disabled employee who
suffers from the disability while in service;
(i) those in respect of which recruitment is made in accordance with any provision contained in the
Constitution."
Thus, as per Clause-(d) of Section 3, the applicability of the provisions of the Act stands excluded to
those to be filled up on the basis of any contract

Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
25. The question is, can the State acting administratively decide to apply the provisions of the Act on
its own. Given the Scheme of the Act as reflected in its provisions, the answer would an emphatic
„no(cid:129). Reference in this regard may be had to Section-19 of the ORV Act, which reads as follows:
"19. Overriding effect of the Act.- The provisions of this Act shall have effect
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law or in any rule, order or
resolution made by the State Government."
26. Thus, on the face of Section 3(d), read with Section 19 of the ORV Act, the operational guidelines
issued under the MGNREG Act and the comprehensive guidelines dated 06.04.2018 can have no
sanction of law in so far as applying the principles of reservation to the engagement of GRS is
concerned. Of course, had there been any enabling provision in the ORV Act conferring power on
the State to act in a manner contrary to Section 3 or had the Act provided any exception, the matter
would have been different. But in the absence of any such provision and on the face of the provision
under Section 19, the State is denuded of its power to do so. In other words, the State has no power
to suo motu apply the provisions of the ORV Act in the matter of selection and engagement of GRS
on its own.
27. It would be profitable at this stage to refer to a judgment passed by a Division Bench of this
Court in the case of Susanta Kumar Sethi vs. State of Odisha3, wherein, referring to the provision
under Section 3(d) of the ORV Act, it was held as follows:
30. Section 3 makes it clear that the Act will apply to all appointments to the posts
and services under the State. Section 3 of the ORV Act lists out the posts to which the
ORV Act will not apply. What is relevant here is that under Section 3 (d) the ORV Act
will not apply to posts "filled up on the basis of any contract."
Admittedly, the post of SS is a contractual post and therefore, the ORV Act does not apply to it.
36. With the ORV Act itself making it clear that it will not apply to the recruitment for the post of SS,
the question of applying Section 6 of the ORV Act and thereby insisting that the unfilled vacancies of
STs should be filled up by SCs alone and nobody else, cannot be sustained in law. It was rightly
rejected by the learned Single Judge.
28. The State has made a feeble attempt to justify its decision by citing two grounds, firstly that GRS
has become a district cadre post and secondly, appointment to the post of village level worker as per
the 2008 Rules can be made from amongst GRS to the extent of 30 %. For the reasons to be
indicated below this Court finds both the arguments fallacious and absurd. As has already been held,
GRS is not MANU/OR/0330/2021 : ( W.A. No. 86 of 2018 decided on 03.09.2021) a civil post under
the State nor is it a service within the meaning of the OCS(CCA) Rules. It is an engagement
coterminous with the MGNREG Scheme with the engagees being given consolidated remuneration
and on executing agreement with undertaking that they shall not claim regular employment under
the State. So, even if the State makes a fiction of creating a district cadre, the same will not confer a
status akin to a civil post or service in the State to the said district cadre. In fact, it would be a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156128563/ 13
Biswaranjan Panigrahi vs Govt. In Panchayati Raj & on 6 February, 2025
namesake cadre without the trappings of a civil post or service under the State. Secondly, reference
to the 2008 Rules is also fallacious for the reason that only because the State has provided an
avenue of appointment to the said service from amongst the GRSs would not change their status as
contractual appointees. Of course, once they are appointed under the said Rules, their status would
change but prior to that their status as contractual appointees would remain intact.
29. In view of the clear finding of this Court that GRS being a contractual appointment the
principles of reservation would have no application, the alternative argument advanced to the effect
that the comprehensive guidelines would be effective only prospectively, is not necessary to be gone
into.
Conclusion
30. Thus, from a conspectus of analysis of facts, statutory provisions and the case laws referred, this
Court is of the considered view that the impugned comprehensive guidelines dated 06.04.2018 in so
far as it relates to making the provisions of the ORV Act strictly applicable, cannot be sustained in
the eye of law. Consequently, the advertisement dated 30.06.2018 providing for reservation in
respect of all the 19 vacancies also cannot be sustained.
31. In the result, W.P.(C) No. 13017 of 2018 is allowed. The comprehensive guidelines dated
06.04.2018 in so far as it provides that the provisions of ORV Act and Rules framed thereunder
would be strictly followed is hereby quashed. Further, the advertisement dated 30.06.2018 is also
quashed.
32. Consequently, W.P.(C) Nos. 15082 of 2020, W.P.(C) No. 21256 of 2021 and W.P.(C) No. 29309
of 2022 are hereby dismissed.
33. In view of the above findings, the advertisement dated 24.03.2021 shall be modified/revised
accordingly to invite applications from candidates without applying the principles of reservation.
