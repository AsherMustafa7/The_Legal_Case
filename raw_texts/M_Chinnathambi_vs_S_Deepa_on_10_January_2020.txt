M.Chinnathambi vs S.Deepa on 10 January, 2020
2.The appellant is the claimant in M.C.O.P.No.539 of 2016 on the file of the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Namakkal. He filed the above said claim petition, claiming a
sum of Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the accident that took
place on 01.07.2016.
3.The Tribunal considering the pleadings, oral and documentary evidence, held that the accident
occurred due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of the car belonging to the first respondent,
insured with the second respondent and directed the respondents 1 and 2 to pay a sum of
Rs.1,93,960/- as compensation to the appellant.
4.Not being satisfied with the amounts awarded by the Tribunal, the appellant has come out with
the present appeal seeking enhancement of compensation.
5.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the appellant suffered multiple
fractures all over the body and a surgery was also peformed on 02.07.2016. P.W.3/Doctor was
examined to prove the disability suffered by the appellant and he assessed 12% disability. Due to the
fractures, the appellant could not do the work as http://www.judis.nic.in he was doing earlier. The
Tribunal awarded only a sum of Rs.36,000/- towards disability. Though P.W.3/Doctor has assessed
the disability as 12%, the appellant suffered 100% loss of earning power. The Tribunal ought to have
adopted multiplier method while awarding compensation towards disability. The appellant was
working as an agriculturist and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. The Tribunal has fixed
a meagre sum of Rs.3,000/- per month as notional income of the appellant and awarded a sum of
Rs.6,000/- (Rs.3,000/- x 2 months) towards loss of income for 2 months. The Tribunal has not
awarded any amount towards future medical expenses. The compensation awarded by the Tribunal
under different heads are meagre and prayed for enhancement of compensation.
6. Per contra, Mr.S.Vadivel, learned counsel appearing for the second respondent- Insurance
Company contended that the Tribunal accepted the disability certificate issued by P.W.3-Doctor and
granted compensation. In the absence of any evidence with regard to income of the appellant, the
Tribunal has fixed notional income of the appellant at Rs.3,000/- per month and awarded a sum of
Rs.6,000/- (Rs.3,000/-x 2) towards loss of income. The said amount is excessive. The total
compensation awarded by the Tribunal under different heads are not meagre and prayed for
dismissal of the appeal.

examined P.W.3/Doctor, who deposed about the nature of injuries and treatment taken by the
appellant and assessed the disability as 12%. In the absence of any contra evidence, the Tribunal has
accepted the disability assessed by the doctor and awarded a sum of Rs.36,000/- towards disability

by awarding Rs.3,000/- per percentage of disability. The appellant has not proved that he suffered
functional disability and hence, he is not entitled to compensation by applying multiplier method.
The amount awarded by the Tribunal per percentage of disability is meagre. The amount awarded
on percentage basis was periodically enhanced. This Court by the judgment reported in “2013(2)
TNMAC 583” in the matter of “National Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. G.Ramesh”, granted Rs.3,000/- per
percentage for accident occurred in the year 2009, enhancing from Rs.2,000/- per percentage
taking into account the cost of living at that time. Due to passage of time, a sum of
http://www.judis.nic.in Rs.3,000/- per percentage of disability awarded in the year 2013 for the
accident of the year 2009 is to be enhanced. Taking into consideration the raise in cost of living, it
will be reasonable to award a sum of Rs.4,000/- per percentage for the accident of the year 2014 and
2015 and Rs.5,000/- per percentage for the accident from the year 2016 onwards towards disability
certified by the qualified Doctor or Medical Board. In the present case, the accident has occurred on
01.07.2016. A sum of Rs.5,000/- per percentage of disability is granted. Accordingly, a sum of
Rs.60,000/- (Rs.5,000/- X 12%) is awarded towards disability by awarding a sum of Rs.5,000/- per
percentage of disability. According to the appellant, he was aged 36 years at the time of accident and
was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month by doing agriculture. The appellant has not filed any
document to prove the same. Hence, the Tribunal has fixed a sum of Rs.3,000/- as monthly income
of the appellant and awarded a sum of Rs.6,000/- towards loss of income for a period of two
months. The accident is of the year 2016 and the monthly income fixed by the Tribunal is meagre. A
sum of Rs.10,000/- is fixed as monthly income of the appellant. Due to the fractures, the appellant
would not have attended his work atleast for a period of four months. Therefore, the appellant is
entitled to a sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rs.10,000/- X 4) towards loss of income for four months.

9. According to the appellant, he was admitted in hospital on 02.07.2016 and underwent surgery on
the same day and has taken treatment for 5 days. The Tribunal has not awarded any amount
towards attendant charges. Hence, a sum of Rs.10,000/- is granted by this Court. The Tribunal has
awarded a meagre amount of Rs.5,000/- towards transportation and the same is hereby enhanced
to Rs.10,000/-. The Tribunal has not awarded any amount towards loss of amenities and damage to
clothes. Considering the nature of injuries and disability suffered by the appellant, a sum of
Rs.10,000/- and Rs.3,000/- are granted towards loss of amenities and damage to clothes. The
amounts granted by the Tribunal under the other heads are just and reasonable and hence, they are
hereby confirmed. Thus, the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is modified as follows:
