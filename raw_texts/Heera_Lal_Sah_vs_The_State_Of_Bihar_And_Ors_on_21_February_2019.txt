quashing the order dated 12.06.2017 passed by the Panchayat
Secretary, Malahi Balua, Bairiya, West Champaran, Bettiah.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner has
submitted that by an order dated 16.06.2014 passed by a

order of termination of the petitioner herein dated 06.12.2012,

Heera Lal Sah vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 21 February, 2019
passed by the District Programme Officer (Establishment), West
Champaran was quashed on the ground that the District
Teachers Employment Appellate Authority, West Champaran
Patna High Court CWJC No.10266 of 2017 dt.21-02-2019
2/4
had held that the degree of the petitioner was valid and it
appears that thereafter, the petitioner was reinstated and the said
punishment of reinstatement of the petitioner was recorded in
the order dated 06.07.2017 passed in Contempt case bearing
M.J.C. no. 4081 of 2014, which is reproduced hereinbelow :-
"Keeping in view the show cause
filed by the respondents showing
reinstatement of the petitioner and
settlement of his dues, now no further
action is required to be taken in the
matter. In case, after reinstatement,
again action has been taken, it gives
a fresh cause to the petitioner to
agitate the same, but the subsequent
event of termination cannot be looked
into in these proceedings of contempt.
Once the respondents have reinstated
and settled the claim of the petitioner
till the date of his reinstatement, no
action in this contempt application is
called for. Petitioner shall have
liberty to challenge the subsequent
action in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid observation, the
application stands disposed of."
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner has
submitted that the order dated 12.06.2017, whereby and
whereunder the appointment of the petitioner has been
cancelled, is not only contrary to the order dated 06.07.2017
passed in the contempt proceedings bearing M.J.C. no. 4081 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117712800/ 2
Heera Lal Sah vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 21 February, 2019
2014 but also contrary to the order dated 16.06.2014 passed in
CWJC no. 1220 of 2013, relevant portion whereof is
Patna High Court CWJC No.10266 of 2017 dt.21-02-2019
3/4
reproduced hereinbelow :-
" From the order, it is apparent that
this Court found that the District
Programme Officer had no authority to
cancel appointment of the petition on
the ground that the institution was not
recognized by N.C.T.E. in 1992. The
order makes it apparent that the District
Teacher Employment Appellate
Authority, West Champaran had already
held that the degree was valid. Secondly,
the Court also noticed that N.C.T.E.
itself came into existence pursuant to
the Central Act in 1995. Hence, the
recognition of the institution by N.C.T.E.
in 1992 was apparently an absurd stand
of the District Programme Officer.
Learned counsel for the respondents
submits that he ha no more submission
to be advanced than what has been
stated in the counter affidavit and
noticed in the said order.
Learned counsel for the respondent
nos. 8 and 9 is not present in Court to
defend the said order of the District
Programme Officer, West Champaran
and the follow-up actions.
In the circumstances, this Court has
no option but to allow this writ
application. The Application, is
accordingly, allowed. The order of the
District Programme Officer
(Establishment) West Champaran
contained in Memo No. 6431 dated
06.12.2012
and all the follow up actions by respondent nos. 8 and 9 i.e. Mukhiya and the Panchayat Secretary,
terminating services of petitioner are quashed. Respondents are directed to reinstate the petitioner
forthwith.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that though there was stay of operation of the said order,
petitioner Patna High Court CWJC No.10266 of 2017 dt.21-02-2019 has not been paid his salary.

Heera Lal Sah vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 21 February, 2019
Respondents are, therefore, directed to allow the petitioner to perform his duty and to pay his
arrears of salary within one month as well as pay his current salary regularly, subject to any further
order of any competent authority."
4. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents does not dispute the position as existing on
facts as also in law.
5. Having regard to the facts and cirumstances of the case and for the reasons mentioned
hereinabove, the impugned orders dated 14.12.2014 passed by the respondent no. 5 and the one
dated 12.06.2017 passed by the Panchayat Secretary, Malahi Balua, Bairiya, West Champaran,
Bettiah, being contrary to the earlier order of this Court dated 16.06.2014 passed in C.W.J.C. no.
1220 of 2013 are quashed and the respondent- authorities are directed to reinstate the petitioner
forthwith and give all the consequential benefits.
