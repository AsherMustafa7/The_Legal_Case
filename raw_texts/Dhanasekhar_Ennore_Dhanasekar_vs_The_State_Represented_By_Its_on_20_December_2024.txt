(cid:12) Crl.O.P.(MD)No.22666 of 2024
ORDER
The Petitioner / A3 facing trial in C.C.No.244 of 2021 for the offence under Sections 20(b)(ii)(c), 25,
29(1), 8(c) of NDPS Act, has filed the above petition.
2. Mr.Prabhakaran G, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the trial
Court while recording the evidence of P.W.4, Village Administrative Officer, the attesting witness to
the confession of A3, recorded the entire confession in the evidence, which is not proper. The
confession implicates the petitioner and draws adverse inference against the petitioner. Though the
petitioner objected for recording the inadmissible evidence, the trial Court ignoring the objection,
finally marked the signature of P.W.4 in the confession as Ex.P12 and further recorded that the
objection of the petitioner can be decided at the time of final hearing.
3. The learned counsel further submitted that recording of inadmissible evidence is in violation of
Sections 24 to 26 of Indian Evidence Act r/w 22(1), 23(1) and 23(2) of Bharatiya Sakshya
Adhiniyam, 2023. He further submitted that the trial Court put this part of evidence under Section
313 Cr.P.C., r/w Section 351 of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.22666 of 2024
BNSS, thus caused prejudice to the petitioner. The petitioner represented to the trial Court, but it
was not considered. Hence, left with no other option, the above petition has been filed. The trial
Court ought to have decided the objection then and there and not followed Rule 42(7) and 13 of the
Criminal Rules of Practice. Further submitted that recording of objection by the trial Court can be
decided at the time of final hearing might be proper when it is a factual objection. In this case it is a
legal objection. Hence, mere recording of the objection of the petitioner would not be sufficient.
Hence, to eschew the evidence of P.W.4 with regard to this portion, the present petition has been
filed. In support of his contention, the learned counsel relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in
the case of Bipin Shantilal Panchal Vs. State of Gujarat and Anr reported in 2002-1-L.W. (Crl.) 115
and the decision of this Court in Crl.O.P.No.21435 of 2024, dated 03.09.2024.
4. Mr.A.Thiruvadi Kumar, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that P.W.4 is the
Village Administrative Officer, who narrated the factual aspects, which happened in his presence.
Hence, it cannot be termed as though the entire confession of A3 recorded. Further, the trial Court
rightly observed in the order that the objection of the petitioner can be considered at the time of
final arguments. The trial Court considered the objection https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.22666 of 2024 made by the petitioner / accused and the prosecution recorded the
evidence subject to the objection. It is for the trial Court to decide the same at the time of
considering the evidence while rendering the judgment and at this stage, filing the above petition to
eschew the entire evidence will not be proper, hence, he strongly objects the petitioner's contention
and prayed for dismissal of the petition.

5. I have heard the learned counsels appearing on either side and perused the materials available on
record.
6. Considering the submission and perusal of the materials and evidence of P.W.4 , filed along with
the typed set it is seen that P.W. 4 is the VAO of Madakulam and on 04.12.2020 he was called by the
Inspector of Police, Subramaniapuram Police Station and request him to be present as witness to
the arrest and confession of one Danasekar accused in Crime No.1453 of 2020. In the presence of
P.W.4, the petitioner/ A3 given confession. From the evidence of P.W.4 it is seen that the confession
has been verbatim recorded in first person as confession by the petitioner/ A3. Though the
confession has been recorded only the signature of PW.4 marked as Ex.P12. It is settled position that
confession of an accused to a Police Officer is hit by Sections 24 to 25 under the Indian Evidence
Act, correspondingly Sections 22(1), 23(1) and 23(2) of BNSS. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.22666 of 2024 trial Court though in the deposition recorded objection of the
counsel for the accused, it has also recorded the objection of the Public Prosecutor and hence, the
objection to be rejected. What is the new facts which has been disclosed, based on the confession,
there is nothing to show that any new facts has been disclosed from the confession. In such
circumstances, merely recording the objection and recording the entire confession given to a police
officer by an accused and the same is recorded in the evidence is not proper. The Judgment relied on
by the petitioner in Bipin Shantilal Panchal 's case, the Apex Court had held that the trial Court can
make a note of such objection in the evidence during trial. It would be useful to extract paragraphs
15 to 17, which reads as follows:-
“15. It is an archaic practice that during the evidence collecting stage, whenever any
objection is raised regarding admissibility of any material in evidence the court does
not proceed further without passing order on such objection. But the fall out of the
above practice is this: Suppose the trial court, in a case, upholds a particular
objection and excludes the material from being admitted in evidence and then
proceeds with the trial and disposes of the case finally. If the appellate or revisional
court, when the same question is re- canvassed, could take a different view on the
admissibility of that material in such cases the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.22666 of 2024 appellate court would be deprived of the benefit of
that evidence, because that was not put on record by the trial court. In such a
situation the higher court may have to send the case back to the trial court for
recording that evidence and then to dispose of the case afresh. Why should the trial
prolong like that unnecessarily on account of practices created by ourselves. Such
practices, when realised through the course of long period to be hindrances which
impede steady and swift progress of trial proceedings, must be recast or re- moulded
to give way for better substitutes which would help acceleration of trial proceedings.
15. When so recast, the practice which can be a better substitute is this: Whenever an
objection is raised during evidence taking stage regarding the admissibility of any
material or item of oral evidence the trial court can make a note of such objection and
mark the objected document tentatively as an exhibit in the case (or record the
objected part of the oral evidence) subject to such objections to be decided at the last
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123867816/ 3

stage in the final judgment. If the court finds at the final stage that the objection so
raised is sustainable the judge or magistrate can keep such evidence excluded from
consideration. In our view there is no illegality in adopting such a course. (However,
we make it clear that if the objection relates to deficiency of stamp duty of a
document the court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.22666 of
2024 has to decide the objection before proceeding further. For all other objections
the procedure suggested above can be followed.
16.The above procedure, if followed, will have two advantages. First is that the time in
the trial court, during evidence taking stage, would not be wasted on account of
raising such objections and the court can continue to examine the witnesses. The
witnesses need not wait for long hours, if not days. Second is that the superior court,
when the same objection is re-canvassed and reconsidered in appeal or revision
against the final judgment of the trial court, can determine the correctness of the
view taken by the trial court regarding that objection, without bothering to remit the
case to the trial court again for fresh disposal. We may also point out that this
measure would not cause any prejudice to the parties to the litigation and would not
add to their misery or expenses.”
7. As far as the other contentions of the petitioner that the Criminal Rules of Practice
Rule 43 has not been complied with would not be applicable, when the Apex Court
guideline and direction is contrary to the Rules. The other citation relied by the
petitioner to eschew all portions, which are barred under Section 24 of the Indian
Evidence Act and only retains so much of evidence which would fall
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.22666 of 2024 under Sections 27
of the Evidence Act cannot be straightway applicable to the case in hand. In the said
order, what is the evidence, which has been objected and what is the fact there is no
reference. The facts of the each case differs, the applicability of law is in accordance
to the facts of the particular case. In view of the same, the citations referred by the
petitioner would not applicable in the context to the above case.
8. It is not in dispute that P.W.4, VAO gone to the Police Station, in the Police
Station, Accused/A3 given a confession to the Police in presence of P.W.4. Evidence
of P.W.4 recorded in which A3's evidence extracted. On going through the evidence it
is seen that the evidence is in first person as though spoken by A3. Thus, making it
clear that it is clearly hit under Sections 24 to 26 Evidence Act r/w Section 22(1),
23(1) and 23(2) of BSA. The trial Court recording the objection without extracting the
admissible portion alone or the objected portion and kept in as separate not been
done.
Further, from the confession it is seen that there is no new disclosure. Except for signature of P.W.4,
marked as Ex.P12, nothing can be looked beyond it. In view of the same, the trial Court not to
consider the confession of Petitioner /A3 as recorded in the evidence of P.W.4.
