Commission, Patna (hereinafter referred to as the Commission)
whereby and whereunder the candidature of the petitioner has
been rejected on the ground that non-creamy layer certificate
Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019
2/15
has not been produced by the petitioner at the time of his
counseling, as such, the candidature of the petitioner has been
shown under the general category. It has further been prayed to
consider the candidature of the petitioner under the BC
(Backward Caste) category and publish the result of the
petitioner.
2. The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner is
working as Agriculture Coordinator since the date of his
appointment on contractual basis. The contractual service of the
petitioner has been extended from time to time and in the
meantime, an advertisement was published by the Commission
on 29.04.2015 for the purposes of making recruitment to the
post of Agriculture Coordinator against the sanctioned and
vacant 4391 posts under the Agriculture Directorate, Bihar,
Patna. Clause 7 of the said advertisement prescribes the
procedure for selection wherein it has been provided that the
merit list shall be prepared on the basis of the percentage
obtained in the graduation exam and on the basis of the work
experience in the Agriculture Department, Government of Bihar.
The percentage obtained in the graduation level was to be
valued up to a maximum marks of 70 and 30 marks were to be

given to the work experience. In Clause 4(ii), it has been
Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019
3/15
provided that the caste certificate issued by the notified Circle
Officer regarding certification of the caste of the backward class
and extremely backward class which states about the candidate
not belonging to the Creamy Layer, shall be considered valid.
Similar provision has also been made with regard to the
schedule caste / scheduled tribe candidates. It has further been
provided that at the time of applying online, it is not necessary
to furnish caste certificate, but at the time of counseling, the
candidates belonging to the backward category / extremely
backward category should produce the non-creamy layer
certificate and the SC/ST candidates should produce the caste
certificate and in case, they fail to submit the said certificates,
such candidates would be considered under the unreserved
category and they will not get the benefit of reservation. It has
further been provided that at the time of filling up of the form,
the candidates should keep in mind that they should only claim
the benefit of that reservation category under which they fall.
3. It is the further case of the petitioner that being fully
eligible, the petitioner had submitted his application online
whereafter, admit card was issued to the petitioner for the
purposes of counseling. The petitioner had appeared before the
concerned authority and counseling was conducted on

Shashi Bhushan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 17 May, 2019

. The petitioner is stated to have filed his objection on the earlier result dated 05.08.2016,
individually before the Secretary of the Commission and before the other authorities. It is further
submitted by the petitioner that the petitioner had submitted his non-creamy layer certificate at the
time of his initial selection and also at the time of his counseling. It has also been stated that the
non-creamy layer certificate of the petitioner is dated 31.12.2012. It is the case of the petitioner that
the petitioner was surprised when his name did not find place, when the results were declared
whereafter many candidates approached this Hon'ble Court and this Hon'ble Court vide order dated
30.05.2017 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 13658 of 2016 had directed the Commission / the authority
concerned to consider the objections raised by the petitioners of the said case and dispose of the
same by a speaking order. The writ petition filed by the petitioner herein i.e. C.W.J.C. No. 15063 of
2016 was also disposed of along with the aforesaid writ petitions bearing C.W.J.C. No. 13658 of
2016. Although, the petitioner had filed representation dated 21.04.2017 and 29.05.2017 before the
Chairman of the Commission, he had again filed his objection online before the Commission in light
of the aforesaid order dated 30.05.2017 passed by this Court. Thereafter, the Patna High Court
CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019 Commission had published the combined Selection List of
Agriculture Coordinator vide Memo dated 24.11.2017 and 25.11.2017 on its website, however, the
roll number of the petitioner did not find place in the said result declared by the Commission. The
Commission had also passed a speaking order dated 22.07.2017 on the online objection of the
petitioner herein whereby and whereunder the claim / candidature of the petitioner has been
rejected on the ground that the petitioner had not submitted the non-creamy layer certificate at the
time of counseling. It was further noted in the said order that the caste certificate is dated
02.05.2016 and the petitioner did not submit the non-creamy layer certificate on the date of
counselling.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that admittedly, the petitioner had submitted the
non-creamy layer certificate, which is evident from the impugned order dated 22.07.2017, but still
the candidature of the petitioner has not been considered. It is further submitted that the action of
the Respondent-Commission in preparing the Combined Selection list / result dated 24/25.11.2017
is irrational, mala fide, arbitrary, unjustified, discriminatory and illegal as well as is based on pick
and choose basis.
5. It has further been submitted that the Commission had Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018
dt.17-05-2019 published necessary instructions regarding filing of online objection for the
Agriculture Coordinator (Annexure-8 to the writ petition) wherein at Serial No. 4, it has been
specified that if any candidate has, by mistake, wrongly filled the educational qualification,
experience figure and / or has wrongly filled the reservation category, which is different from the
original, information thereof can be registered in the form of objection, failing which in future the
recommendation / appointment would be liable to be cancelled without giving reasons.

6. The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on a judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex
Court, reported in (2016) 4 SCC 754 to contend that the candidature of those candidates who belong
to the SC/ST categories cannot be rejected simply on account of late submission of caste certificate
since the same would amount to denial of equality of opportunity, as contemplated under Articles
14, 15, 16 and 39-A of the Constitution of India.
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner has also relied upon a judgment dated 04.10.2016 passed
by the learned Division Bench of this Court in L.P.A. No. 651 of 2016 and other analogous cases,
judgment dated 17.11.2016 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 6151 of 2016, judgment dated 25.05.2017 passed
in Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019 C.W.J.C. No. 3868 of 2016 and judgment
dated 13.07.2017 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 1329 of 2016 to contend that the action of the authorities in
cancelling the candidature of the candidates on account of non furnishing of original certificates
within time is unreasonable.
8. Per contra, the learned counsel for the Commission, relying on the counter affidavit filed in this
case, has stated that the petitioner had submitted online form under the BC Category for being
selected on the post of Agriculture Coordinator, but during the counseling held on 05.05.2016, the
petitioner had failed to submit the non-creamy layer certificate, hence, his candidature was
considered under the general category on account of non-submission of the non-creamy layer
certificate. It has further been submitted that though the petitioner claims to have submitted
non-creamy layer certificate dated 02.05.2016 during the counseling held on 05.05.2016, but
according to the records of the commission, the non-creamy layer certificate was submitted by the
petitioner along with his application dated 29.05.2017 which was received by the office of the
Commission only on 31.05.2017.
9. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials on record.
Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019
10. It is apparent from the records of this case that on the one hand, the petitioner is claiming that
he had submitted the non- creamy layer caste certificate dated 02.05.2016 at the time of counseling
held by the Commission on 05.05.2016 and had further submitted the same along with his
representation dated 29.05.2017, however, it is the contention of the Commission that no such
non-creamy layer caste certificate was submitted by the petitioner on 05.05.2016 during the course
of the counseling and the same had only been submitted along with the representation of the
petitioner dated 29.05.2017 which was received in the office of the Commission on 31.05.2017.
Thus, the only ground for debarring the candidature of the petitioner under the BC Category and
putting him in the general category is that the non-creamy layer certificate has not been submitted
at the time of the counseling held by the Commission wherein the petitioner had participated and
instead, the petitioner had submitted the same subsequently, along with his representation dated
29.05.2017.
11. It is apparent from the records that while the aforesaid batch of writ petitions bearing C.W.J.C.
No. 13658 of 2016 and other analogous cases were pending consideration before this Court, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184822382/ 5
Shashi Bhushan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 17 May, 2019
Commission had itself invited objections and the Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018
dt.17-05-2019 petitioner had also filed his objection and re-furnished the non- creamy layer caste
certificate, as has also been admitted in the impugned order dated 22.07.2017 passed by the
Commission, apart from the Commission admitting the fact that the petitioner was under the
Backward Category as on the date of the advertisement. In such view of the matter, the candidature
of the petitioner could not have been rejected and put under the general category since not only
prior to the publication of the result on 24/25.11.2017 but also as on the date of filing of objection
and passing of the reasoned impugned order dated 22.07.2017, the Commission was fully aware that
not only the petitioner is a backward category candidate but the Commission was also in possession
of the requisite non-creamy layer caste certificate furnished by the petitioner, hence, the petitioner
could not have been precluded from being granted benefit of being considered as a backward
category candidate.
12. The present case is squarely covered by the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in a
judgment reported in (2016) 4 SCC 754 (Ram Kumar Gijroya Vs. Delhi Subordinate Services
Selection Board and Another), paragraph Nos. 14 to 18 whereof are reproduced hereineblow:-
"14. The Division Bench of the High Court erred in not considering the decision
rendered in Pushpa. Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019 In that
case, the learned single Judge of the High Court had rightly held that the petitioners
therein were entitled to submit the O.B.C. certificate before the provisional selection
list was published to claim the benefit of the reservation of O.B.C. category. The
learned single judge correctly examined the entire situation not in a pedantic manner
but in the backdrop of the object of reservations made to the reserved categories, and
keeping in view the law laid down by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Indra
Sawhney v. Union of India as well as Valsamma Paul v. Cochin University. The
learned single Judge in Pushpa also considered another judgment of Delhi High
Court, in Tej Pal Singh, wherein the Delhi High Court had already taken the view that
the candidature of those candidates who belonged to the S.C. and S.T. categories
could not be rejected simply on account of the late submission of caste certificate.
15.The relevant paragraph from the judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney has
been extracted in Pushpa along with the speech delivered by Dr Ambedkar in the
constituent assembly and reads thus :(Pushpa case, SCC Online Del para 9) "9.....
'251. Referring to the concept of equality of opportunity in public employment, as
embodied in Article 10 of the draft Constitution, which finally emerged as Article 16
of the Constitution, and the conflicting claims of various communities for
representation in public administration, Dr Ambedkar emphatically declared that
reservation should be confined to "a minority of seats", lest the very concept of
equality should be destroyed. In view of its great importance, the full text of his
speech delivered in the Constituent Assembly on the point is appended to this
judgment. But I shall now read a few passages from it. Dr Ambedkar stated:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184822382/ 6
Shashi Bhushan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 17 May, 2019
"... firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity, secondly, that there shall be
Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019 reservations in favour of
certain communities which have not so far had a 'proper look-in' so to say into the
administration .... Supposing, for instance, we were to concede in full the demand of
those communities who have not been so far employed in the public services to the
fullest extent, what would really happen is, we shall be completely destroying the first
proposition upon which we are all agreed, namely, that there shall be an equality of
opportunity..... Therefore the seats to be reserved, if the reservation is to be
consistent with sub-clause (1) of Article 10, *must be confined to a minority of seats*.
It is then only that the first principle could find its place in the Constitution and
effective in operation ... we have to safeguard two things, namely, the principle of
equality of opportunity and at the same time satisfy the demand of communities
which have not had so far representation in the State, ...".
[Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7, pp. 701-02 (1948-49).] These words embody the raison
d'etre of reservation and its limitations. Reservation is one of the measures adopted by the
Constitution to remedy the continuing evil effects of prior inequities stemming from discriminatory
practices against various classes of people which have resulted in their social, educational and
economic backwardness. Reservation is meant to be addressed to the present social, educational and
economic backwardness caused by purposeful societal discrimination. To attack the continuing ill
effects and perpetuation of such injustice, the Constitution permits and empowers the State to adopt
corrective devices even when they have discriminatory and exclusionary effects. Any such measure,
insofar as one group is preferred to the exclusion of another, must necessarily be narrowly tailored
to the achievement of the fundamental constitutional goal.' (Indra Patna High Court CWJC No.727
of 2018 dt.17-05-2019 Sawhney case, SCC pp. 433-34, para 251)"
16. In Pushpa, relevant paragraphs from Tej Pal Singh have also been extracted,
which read thus: (Pushpa case, SCC OnLine Del para 11) "11......'15. The matter can be
looked into from another angle also. As per the advertisement dated 11-06-1999
issued by the Board, vacancies are reserved for various categories including SC
category. Thus in order to be considered for the post reserved for SC category, the
requirement is that a person should belong to SC category. If a person is SC his is so
by birth and not by acquisition of this category because of any other event happening
at a later stage. A certificate issued by competent authority to this effect is only an
affirmation of fact which is already in existence. The purpose of such certificate is to
enable the authorities to believe in the assertion of the candidate that he belongs to
SC category and act thereon by giving the benefit to such candidate for his belonging
to SC category. It is not that petitioners did not belong to SC category prior to
30-6-1998 or that acquired the status of being SC only on the date of issuance of the
certificate. In view of this position, necessitating upon a certificate dated prior to
30-6-1998 would be clearly arbitrary and it has no rationale objective sought to be
achieved.

Shashi Bhushan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 17 May, 2019
16. While taking a particular view in such matters one has to keep in mind the
objectives behind the post of SC and ST categories as per constitutional mandate
prescribed in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) which are enabling provisions authorising the
Government to make special provisions for the persons of SC and ST categories.
Articles 14(4) and 16(4), therefore, intend to remove social and economic inequality
to make equal opportunities available in reality. Social and economic justice is a
Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019 right enshrined for protection
of society. The right in social and economic justice envisaged in the Preamble and
elongated in the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of the Constitution, in
particular Arts. 14, 15, 16, 21, 38, 39 and 46 are to make the quality of the life of the
poor, disadvantaged and disabled citizens of the society meaningful.' (Tej Pal Singh
case, SCC Online Del paras 15-16)"
17. Further, in Pushpa, relevant portion from the judgment of Valsamma Paul case has also been
extracted, which reads as under:
(Pushpa case, SCC Online Del para 11) "11 .... '17. ...... "21. The Constitution through
its Preamble, Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles created a secular State
based on the principle of equality and non-discrimination, striking a balance between
the rights of the individuals and the duty and commitment of the State to establish an
egalitarian social order."
(Valsamma Paul case, SCC pp. 560-61, para 21)' (Tej Pal Singh case, SCC OnLine Del para 17)"
18. In our considered view, the decision rendered in the case of Pushpa is in conformity with the
position of law laid down by this Court, which have been referred to supra. The Division Bench of
the High Court erred in reversing the judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge,
without noticing the binding precedent on the question laid down by the Constitution Benches of
this Court in Indra Sawhney and Valsamma Paul wherein this Court after interpretation of Articles
14,15,16 and 39A of the Directive Principles of State Policy held that the object of providing
reservation to the SCs/STs and educationally and socially backward classes of the society is to
remove inequality in public employment, as candidates belonging to these categories are unable to
compete with the candidates belonging to the Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018
dt.17-05-2019 general category as a result of facing centuries of oppression and deprivation of
opportunity. The constitutional concept of reservation envisaged in the Preamble of the Constitution
as well as Articles 14, 15, 16 and 39-A of the Directive Principles of State Policy is to achieve the
concept of giving equal opportunity to all sections of the society. The Division Bench, thus, erred in
reversing the judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge. Hence, the impugned
judgment and order passed by the Division Bench in the Letters Patent Appeal No. 562 of 2011 is not
only erroneous but also suffers from error in law as it has failed to follow the binding precedent of
the judgments of this Court in Indra Sawhney and Valsamma Paul.
Therefore, the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is
liable to be set aside and accordingly set aside. The judgment and order dated 24.11.2010 passed by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184822382/ 8
Shashi Bhushan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 17 May, 2019
the learned single Judge in Ram Kumar Gijroya v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi) is hereby restored."
13. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, I am of the considered view that the candidature of the
petitioner could not have been rejected merely on account of late submission of the non-creamy
layer caste certificate, though the same has been submitted admittedly much prior to the publication
of the result on 24/25.11.2017.
14. In such view of the matter, the order dated 22.07.2017 passed by the Commission, as
communicated to the petitioner herein vide Memo dated 18.08.2017 is set aside and the Respondent
Nos. 7 to 9 are directed to reconsider the application of the petitioner herein against the BC category
Patna High Court CWJC No.727 of 2018 dt.17-05-2019 and take appropriate decision within a
period of one month from today.
15. The writ petition is allowed.
