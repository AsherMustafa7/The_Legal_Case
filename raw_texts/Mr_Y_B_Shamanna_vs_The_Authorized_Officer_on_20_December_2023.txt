THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE
ORDER DTD 08.03.2023 AND THE ORDER DTD 15.03.2023 PASSED
BY THE HONBLE DEBT RECOVERY TRIBUNAL (DRT-2) IN SA. NO.
114/23 IN SO FAR AS REFUSAL TO CONSIDER THE INTERIM RELIEF
SOUGHT IN THE APPEAL AND IA NO.1/23 AND IA NO.2/23 FILED
BY THE PETITIONERS HEREIN AT ANNEXURE-P.
THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED
FOR ORDERS ON 06.12.2023, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
The petitioners are before this Court calling in question orders dated 08-03-2023 and 15-03-2023
passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal-II, Bengaluru (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal' for
short) in S.A.No.114 of 2023 insofar as it refuses to consider the interim relief sought in the appeal
on applications in I.A.No.1 of 2023 and I.A.No.2 of 2023 filed by the petitioner and have sought
consideration of the interim relief sought before the Tribunal.
2. Facts in brief, germane are as follows:-
The 2nd petitioner is the borrower and the 1st respondent is the lender. The 2nd
petitioner borrows an amount of `1,70,00,000/-
on 14-08-2015 on mortgage of the scheduled property owned by his father, petitioner
No.1. The loan was regular up to a certain point and became sticky in the year 2018.
It is then the Bank sought to initiate proceedings invoking the Securitisation and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002
('the Act' for short) in respect of the schedule property by issuing a notice as is
required under sub-sections (2) and (4) of Section 13 of the Act. When the amount
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 2
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
was left unpaid despite all efforts, the Bank notifies the schedule property for sale in
terms of its notification dated 10-10-2019. This is called in question by the 2nd
petitioner before this Court in Writ Petition No.50465 of 2019 wherein the petitioner
sought a direction by issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus to consider his
representation for restructuring of the loan. Writ Petition comes to be disposed of on
19-11-2019 after noticing the reply to the representation of the petitioner. Therefore,
the said sale did not take place in the light of the interim order operating in the
aforesaid petition.
3. A fresh sale notice was issued on 23-08-2021 bringing the property again to sale fixing the sale on
14-09-2021. This is called in question before the Tribunal in S.A.No.1298 of 2021 in an appeal filed
on 09-09-2021. The Tribunal does not grant any relief. The auction takes place on 14-09-2021 for a
bid amount of `2,01,25,000/-. The auction purchaser immediately deposits 25% of the bid amount.
The auction purchaser then pays the entire balance amount that was to be paid. The possession of
the schedule property is still with the petitioners. This action of sale is challenged by the 2nd
petitioner before this Court in W.P.No.19957 of 2021.
This Court in terms of its order dated 11-11-2021 permits the petitioner to deposit `30,00,000/- and
stalled further proceedings.
Writ Petition No.19957 of 2021 is disposed of directing the petitioner to pay the entire loan amount
with all interest with an outer limit of 8 weeks and also pay `25,00,000/- as solatium to the auction
purchaser, failing which the Court directed the Bank to issue sale certificate. This was an order
passed on consent. Against the said order, a writ appeal comes to be filed by the 2nd petitioner in
Writ Appeal No.1045 of 2022 and the petitioner would withdraw the writ appeal reserving liberty to
fulfill the order passed by the learned single Judge. The order was not complied. On 27-10-2022 a
sale certificate is also issued in favour of the 2nd respondent and the same is registered on
03-01-2023.
4. The Bank then seeks to take possession of the property.
Petitioner No.1, father of petitioner No.2 files another writ petition in W.P.No.4965 of 2022 seeking
quashment of the possession order in Crl.Mis.No.1471 of 2019. On 12-12-2022 the time to comply
the interim order passed in Writ Petition No.19957 of 2021 was extended by three more weeks. Writ
Petition No.4965 of 2022 comes to be dismissed on 13-02-2023 reserving liberty to the petitioner to
challenge the sale certificate that was issued to the auction purchaser before the appropriate forum.
It is then, the petitioners filed S.A.No.114 of 2023. The Tribunal on 8-03-2023 directs serving of
copy of the appeal on the auction purchaser and the Bank. They do not do it. Again on 15-03-2023
the same direction is issued by the Tribunal. They do not comply this time also. Instead of
complying with the directions of the Tribunal, they approached this Court in the subject petition
alleging that the Tribunal has not considered their plea for interim relief and, therefore, the subject
petition is filed seeking the very relief that is sought before the Tribunal. On the submission of the
learned counsel for the petitioner, this Court directed the petitioners to deposit `25,00,000/- within
24 hours and subject to such direction stalled further proceedings. The interim order later was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 3
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
continued on the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the conditional interim
order had been complied with and voluntarily submits that `30,00,000/- would be paid within two
weeks. The payment is said to have been made. In all, the petitioners, as on date, are said to have
paid `1,05,00,000/- from 2019 to 2023.
5. Heard Sri Aditya Sondhi, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, Sri.
Parashuram.K.R., learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1/Bank and Sri Puttige R.Ramesh,
learned senior counsel appearing for respondent No.2/auction purchaser.
6. The learned senior counsel Sri Aditya Sondhi would vehemently contend that the Bank at every
step has not given adequate opportunity to the petitioners to make the payment.
Merely because sale certificate is issued or the confirmation of sale is made, this Court would not
dismiss the petition on account of its maintainability on the score of statutory violation at every
step. He would submit that the Tribunal did not grant any interim order.
Therefore, it is his case that interim order should be granted in this writ petition as sought before
the Tribunal and the Tribunal should be permitted to proceed further.
7. Per-contra, the learned senior counsel Sri Puttige R. Ramesh representing the 2nd
respondent/auction purchaser would take this Court through the entire documents appended to the
petition as well as to the statement of objections to contend that the petition itself is not
maintainable once the sale notice is issued and this Court has repeatedly shown undue sympathy to
the petitioners, who at all times did not comply with the order. He would seek to place reliance upon
the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of CELIR LLP v. BAFNA MOTORS (MUMBAI) PRIVATE
LIMITED1. Taking the Court through the order impugned, he would seek to contend that no right of
the petitioners is taken away by the order as the order is only to serve a copy of the appeal upon the
Bank and the auction purchaser. Having not served copy, suppressing every fact, the petitioners are
before this Court time and again seeking interim relief.
8. The learned counsel representing the 1st respondent/Bank would submit that auction was
conducted on 14-09-2021, sale certificate is issued on 27-10-2022, it is registered on 03-01-2023
and the entire proceedings are complete. The petitioners have not yet delivered possession of the
property on one pretext or the other right from the date of issuance of sale certificate.
2023 SCC OnLine SC 1209
9. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
and have perused the material on record.
10. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The entire case revolves around juggleries of dates.
Therefore, the dates, though narrated hereinabove, would require reiteration. The undisputed fact is
that loan was availed by the 2nd petitioner, son of the 1st petitioner pursuant to a mortgage of the
schedule property in a sum of `1,70,00,000/-. The loan becomes sticky as the petitioners failed to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 4
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
pay equal monthly installments diligently month on month. This leads the Bank to initiate
proceedings under the Act. A notice is issued under sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Act on
03-09-2018. When the petitioners did not come forward to clear the loan, action under sub-section
(4) of Section 13 was taken by the Bank. The property was then put to sale by issuance of sale
notification on 05-02-2019 to conduct auction on 07-03-2019. No bidder came forward and,
therefore, the sale did not take place.
The second sale notice was issued on 10-10-2019 fixing the date of sale on 31-10-2019. The 2nd
petitioner approaches this Court in W.P.No.50465 of 2019. Initially an interim order was granted
and later the petition comes to be disposed of by the following order:
"2. Learned counsel for respondent Bank Sri. K.R. Parashuram has filed a memo
alongwith reply to the representation of the petitioner dated 30.10.2019 and in the
reply dated 14.11.2019, it is specifically stated as under:-
"You are being informed that the Bank/Authorised Officer have not been vested and
conferred with such Authority to held up or defer the legal proceedings under the
SARFAESI Act, 2002 without any valid reasons and causes. Since you have been
failed to deposit the Overdue amounts in both the Loan accounts in time in spite of
your repeated commitments earlier and your loan accounts have been running
irregular for long time, it has been very difficult on our part to be convinced
regarding your proposed future course of repayment of the Bank's dues in time.
Therefore you have been advised once again to deposit a minimum of Rs.40.00 Lac,
Rs.20.00 lac in each of the loan account within 7-10 days from the date of this letter
for a valuable consideration of your proposal on our part. We will revert to your
proposal only after receiving an amount of Rs.40.00 lac in both the Loan accounts.
Otherwise we shall not have any other options but to initiate further suitable legal
course of action as deemed fit to recover the Bank's dues."
In view of the said reply stated supra, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner
has paid the said amounts. In view of the subsequent developments, the prayer sought for in this
writ petition would not survive for consideration. Accordingly, the petition is disposed of."
The Bank would wait for two more years so that the petitioners would make some payment. When
the petitioners failed to make payment, the bank again issues a fresh sale notice on 23-08-2021
fixing the date of sale on 14-09-2021. The sale on 14-09-2021 takes place. The 2nd respondent is the
auction purchaser. The auction bid amount was `2,01,25,000/-. 25% of the bid amount is deposited
by the auction purchaser immediately which would amount to `50,31,250/- and on subsequent
dates concludes the entire payment up to 23-11-2021. The dates of payments are as follows:
"14-09-2021 10% of the EMD paid to online `18,08,750/-
e-auction bidding and
subsequently credited to the
loan account on 16-09-2021.

paid
23-11-2021 1% TDS amount paid `2,01,250/-
Total `2,01,25,000/-"
Therefore, as on 23-11-2021 the entire amount of `2,01,25,000/-
was paid by the auction purchaser. The 2nd petitioner approaches this Court in Writ
Petition No.19957 of 2021. A conditional order was passed on 11-11-2021 in the said
writ petition directing the 2nd petitioner to pay an amount of `30,00,000/- within
two days. The 2nd petitioner did not comply with the interim order and it was then
projected illness of the father of the 2nd petitioner to be the reason.
Therefore, this Court disposed of the writ petition by the following order:
"Petitioner-borrower has presented this writ petition essentially assalling the coercive
action of recovery by Issuance of notice dated 23.08.2021 Issued under SARFAESI
Act, 2002. This Court vide interim order dated 11.11.2021 had granted reprieve to the
petitioner as under:
"Office Objections are over ruled.
Issue emergent notice.
Interim order as prayed for till next date of hearing subject to petitioner depositing
with the respondent Bank a sum of Rs.30,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty Lakh) only within
two days, falling which, Interim order withers away on its own."

2. After service of notice, the first respondent has entered appearance through its Panel Counsel; the
second respondent-auction buyer is represented by his own counsel. Both the advocates oppose the
writ petition contending that petitioner is a chronic defaultes and despite granting several
opportunities, he has not repaid the loan and eventually the security property having been auctioned
the second respondent being successful bidder has remitted a sum of Rs.2,01,25,000/- In all. So
contending, they seek dismissal of the writ petition.
3. On the previous, occasion, the matter was heard for some tine and on the suggestion of this Court,
the petitioner has come out with a proposal as under:
1) The petitioner shall pay back the entire loan amount with all the interest accruing
due to the Bank within an outer limit of eight weeks.
2) The petitioner shall pay a sum of Rs.25,00,000/-
(Rupees Twenty Five Lakh) only to the second respondent auction buyer as solatium.
3) The amount if credited as above, the first respondent shall refund Rs.2,01,25,000/- (Rupees Two
Crore One Lakh and Twenty Five Hundred) only to the second respondent.
The respondents having opposed the petition for some time, now broadly agree with the above
proposal of the petitioner subject to the rider that the auction shall be treated as having been
confirmed should the petitioner fall to abide by the undertaking as above.
In the above circumstances, this writ petition is disposed off with following directions:
I) The accomplished auction sale shall be kept in abeyance for a period of eight weeks
to enable the petitioner to make the payment as stated above.
ii) The petitioner shall pay to the second respondent a sum of Rs.25,00,00/- within
an outer limit of eight weeks by way of solatium.
iil) If the petitioner fails to pay in terms of the proposal above, the auction shall be
treated as having been confirmed and the first respondent-Bank shall issue the Sale
Certificate to the second respondant Immediately.
iV) If above proposal does not materialize, the petitioner shall peaceably deliver the
possession of subject property to the second respondent, forthwith;
If the petitioner falls to deliver possession; the jurisdictional police shall assist the respondent. No.1
to take possession and hand, the property to the second respondent."
The order was on consent of both the parties. The payment is not made but a writ appeal is
preferred in Writ Appeal No.1045 of 2022 only to drag the proceedings. But, the writ appeal comes
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 7
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
to be withdrawn on 21-10-2022. The Bank in obedience to the pendency of the writ appeal had not
issued sale certificate notwithstanding non-compliance of the order dated 26-08-2022 passed in
Writ Petition No.19957 of 2021. The Bank later on 27-10-2022 issued the sale certificate and
registered it on 03-01-2023. After issuance of the sale certificate an application comes to be filed by
the petitioners seeking extension of time in Writ Petition No.19957 of 2021. This Court showing
indulgence extended the time in terms of its order dated 12-12-2022. The order dated 12-12-2022
reads as follows:
"This court while disposing of the Writ Petition has granted relief as reflected in the
operative portion of the judgment in question wherein the grant was subject to
condition of making payments.
Learned Sr. Advocate appearing for the petitioner presses the application seeking
extension of the period for making the payment contending that there were some
financial difficulties which his client was put to and therefore, he could not make the
payment as directed in the judgment. Learned Panel Counsel appearing for the Bank
and the learned private counsel appearing for the auction buyer, oppose the
application contending that the entire judgment is constructed on the principle of
equity and therefore, the one who seeks equity should do it to the other side; not even
a rupee having been paid under the judgment, there is absolutely no reason for
granting extension again on the pleaded ground of equity.
Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the Petition
Papers, this court is inclined to grant a very short extension in the fitness of things, of
course subject to conditional levy enuring to the benefit of private respondent herein.
The period prescribed under the judgment in question is extended by three weeks
subject to the condition that the petitioner should pay another sum of Rs.7,50,000/-
(Rupees Seven Lakh Fifty Thousand) only, to the 2nd Respondent in addition to the
payable Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Lakh) only.
Ordered accordingly, all other terms & conditions of the order remaining intact."
This was again left un-complied. Therefore, the sale certificate was registered by the Bank on
03-01-2023. The 1st petitioner then again files writ petition in Writ Petition No.4965 of 2022. The
writ petition is dismissed on account of non-compliance of the order but permits the petitioner to
avail of such remedy as is available in law and in the light of the interim order operating continued it
for 15 days. The order reads as follows:
"The petitioner is before this Court calling in question an order, dated 19.02.2022
passed in Crl. Mis. No. 1471/2019 and has consequently sought to consider the
representation Submitted by him on 22.10.2020.
2. The very petitioner was before this Court calling in question a sale notice, issued by
the respondent-Bank seeking to sell the property of the petitioner. The said writ
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 8
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
petition came to be disposed in terms of an order dated 26.08.2022, The order reads
as follows:
"2. After service of notice, the first respondent has entered appearance through its
Panel Counsel; the second respondent-auction buyer is represented by his own
counsel. Both the advocates oppose the writ petition contending that petitioner is a
chronic defaulter and despite granting several opportunities, he has not repaid the
loan and eventually the security property having been auctioned the second
respondent being successful bidder has remitted a sum of Rs.2,01,25,000/- in all. So
contending, they seek dismissal of the writ petition.
3. On the previous occasion, the matter was heard for some time and on the
suggestion of this Court the petitioner has come out with a proposal as under:
1) The petitioner shall pay back the entire loan amount with all the interest accruing
due to the Bank within an outer limit of eight weeks.
2) The petitioner shall pay a sum of Rs.25,00,000/-
(Rupees Twenty Five Lakh) only to the second respondent auction buyer as solatium.
3) The amount if credited as above, the first respondent shall refund Rs.2,01,25,000/- (Rupees Two
Crore One Lakh and Twenty Five Hundred) only to the second respondent.
The respondents having opposed the petition for some time, now broadly agree with the above
proposal of the petitioner subject to the rider that the auction shall be treated as having been

In the above circumstances, this writ petition is disposed off with following directions:

iii) If the petitioner falls to pay in terms of the proposal above, the auction shall be
treated as having been confirmed and the first respondent-Bank shall issue the Sale
Certificate to the second respondent Immediately.
iv) If above proposal does not materialize, the petitioner shall peaceably deliver the
possession of subject property to the second respondent, forthwith; If the petitioner
fails to deliver possession, the jurisdictional police shall assist the respondent No.1 to
take possession and hand the property to the second respondent.

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
3. This Court recorded that the auction sale of the property has taken place and the auction
purchaser has deposited the amount, notwithstanding that a last opportunity was granted by
directing accomplished auction sale to be kept in abeyance for a period of 8 weeks, on the condition
that the petitioner had to deposit Rs.25.00 lakhs within an outer limit of 8 weeks by way of solatium
to the auction purchaser. If he failed, the sale was directed to be confirmed by Issuance of a sale
certificate. The petitioner filed an application seeking extension of time before the very same Court.
The Court on 12.12.2022 rejected the application observing that the petitioner has not deposited or
paid even a rupee pursuant to the order dated 26.08.2022.
4. Later the auction purchaser was issued with a sale certificate and the sale is also registered in
favour of the auction purchaser. After all these proceedings, the petitioner again files the subject
petition on 25.02.2022 suppressing the earlier petition filed in the year 2021, in which the aforesaid
orders were passed, it is filed on the ground that the petitioner would pay certain amount. Interim
order was granted on the submission of the petitioner that pursuant to the Interim order in the
aforesaid writ petition, two demand drafts were paid amounting to Rs.10.00 and Rs.20.00 lakhs
respectively which is also disputed.
5. In the light of the non-compliance of the order passed by this Court, the petition would not merit
any consideration at the hands of this Court. Since the sale certificate is already issued, it is open for
the petitioner to call the said sale certificate in question in a manner known to law.
6. In the light of the Interim order operating, it shall continue to operate for another 15 days.
7. For the aforesaid reasons and observations, reserving such liberty, the petition stands disposed."
The petitioners then approach the Tribunal in S.A.No.114 of 2023.
The Tribunal on 08-03-2023 passes the following order:
"Counsels for the appellant, respondent Bank and respondent No.2 are present.
Counsel K.R. Parshuram undertakes to file vakalath for the respondent Bank.
Counsel for the respondent Bank submits that the appellant has not served copy of
the SA to the counsel for the respondent Bank.
Heard the submissions of al the three counsels.
Counsel for the appellant is directed to serve copy of the SA to the Counsels for the
respondent Bank and respondent No.2 forthwith for filing their objections.
For objections, list the matter on 15-03-2023."

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
All that the Tribunal directed was to serve copy of the appeal on the learned counsel for the
respondent-Bank and the auction purchaser to enable them to file their objections and ordered
listing of the mater on 15-03-2023. On 15-03-2023 noticing the fact that the petitioners had not
complied with the earlier order passed the following order:
"Counsels for the appellant, respondent Bank and respondent No.2 are present
Counsel for the respondent Bank seeks a direction to the appellant to serve copy of
the SA to the respondent Bank for filing the objections.
Heard the submissions of all the three counsels.
Counsel for the appellant is directed to serve copy of the SA to the counsel for the
respondent Bank forthwith enabling them to file its objections.
For objections, list the matter on 27-03-2023."
The matter was posted for objections again with a direction to serve a copy of the appeal on the
respondents. It is un-understandable as to what right of the petitioners is taken away by the afore-
quoted orders. They were orders directing service of copy of the appeal upon the respondents to
enable them to file their objections.
Projecting that the Bank is likely to take possession of the property, the subject writ petition is
preferred.
11. In the subject writ petition slew of orders are passed. On 17-03-2023, 04-05-2023, 07-06-2023
and 03-10-2023 the following orders are passed.
17-03-2023:
"Heard Sri. Aditya Sondhi, learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioners.
The learned Senior counsel to demonstrate the bonafides of the petitioners, is ready
and willing to deposit Rs.25,00,000/-.
The submission is placed on record.
The petitioners are directed to deposit the said demand draft before the Bank in the
next 24 hours and file an acknowledgment before this Court.
Subject to the aforesaid, there shall be interim order of stay, as prayed for till the next
date of hearing."

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
04-05-2023:
"On 17.03.2023, an interim order was granted subject to the petitioners depositing a
sum of Rs.25 lakhs within 24 hours.

petitioners are ready to deposit another sum of Rs.30,00,000/- (Rupees thirty lakhs
only) and seeks leave of this Court to deposit the sum with the respondent-Bank.
Leave is granted. The petitioners are permitted to deposit another sum of Rs.30,00,000/- with the
respondent- Bank. Needless to observe that the deposit permitted by this Court will not in any way

Learned Senior Counsel Sri Puttige Ramesh appearing for the respondent-Bank would submit that
the case of the petitioners stands covered by a recent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Celir LLP Vs. Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Pvt. Ltd. And Others reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC

Learned Senior Counsel Sri Aditya Sondhi, appearing for the petitioners seeks for a short
accommodation to go through the said judgment and make his submissions.
Re-list this matter on 09.10.2023.
Interim order granted earlier stands extended till the next date of hearing."
The petitioners claim to have made substantial payment to the Bank. This Court, on 03-10-2023
observed that the deposit permitted by this Court to the Bank will not take away or affect the rights
of the auction purchaser, the 2nd respondent. In all the jugglery of dates hereinabove, one fact that
would unmistakably emerge is abuse of the process of law by the petitioners. On rotation, the son
and the father are filing petitions. This is the 4th petition filed by the petitioners. Every time
indulgence is shown by this Court directing payment to be made only to see that the property of the
petitioners is not lost, but every time the interim orders are violated.
12. After availing of the loan on 14-08-2015 the Act comes to be amended. The amendment is on
01-09-2016. After the amendment, the moment a sale notification is published, the right of the
borrower to redeem the mortgage is lost. Interpretation of sub-section (8) of Section 13 of the Act
need not detain this Court for long or delve deep into the matter. The Apex Court in the case of
BAFNA MOTORS PVT. LTD.(supra) has held as follows:
"REDEMPTION OF MORTGAGE UNDER THE SARFAESI ACT
45. Sub-section (8) of Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act, as originally enacted, stated as
under:--
"13. Enforcement of security interest.-
(8) If the dues of the secured creditor together with all costs, charges and expenses incurred by him
are tendered to the secured creditor at any time before the date fixed for sale or transfer, the secured
asset shall not be sold or transferred by the secured creditor, and no further step shall be taken by
him for transfer or sale of that secured asset."
46. In Mathew Varghese (supra), this Court had the occasion to consider the right of redemption of
mortgage under the SARFAESI Act vis-à-vis the Act, 1882, wherein, this Court made the following
relevant observations, being reproduced below:--
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 13
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
"38. ... a mere conferment of power to sell without intervention of the court in the
mortgage deed by itself will not deprive the mortgagor of his right to redemption,
that the extinction of the right of redemption has to be subsequent to the deed
conferring such power, that the right of redemption is not extinguished at the expiry
of the period, that the equity of redemption is not extinguished by mere contract for
sale and that the mortgagor's right to redeem will survive until there has been
completion of sale by the mortgagee by a registered deed. The ratio is also to the
effect that the power to sell should not be exercised unless and until notice in writing
requiring payment of the principal money has been served on the mortgagor. The
above proposition of law of course was laid down by this Court in Narandas
Karsondas [Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247] while construing
Section 60 of the TP Act. But as rightly contended by Mr. Shyam Divan, we fail to
note any distinction to be drawn while applying the abovesaid principles, even in
respect of the sale of secured assets created by way of a secured interest in favour of
the secured creditor under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, read along with the
relevant Rules. We say so, inasmuch as, we find that even while setting out the
principles in respect of the redemption of a mortgage by applying Section 60 of the
TP Act, this Court has envisaged the situation where such mortgage deed providing
for resorting to the sale of the mortgage property without the intervention of the
Court. Keeping the said situation in mind, it was held that the right of redemption
will not get extinguished merely at the expiry of the period mentioned in the
mortgage deed. It was also stated that the equity of redemption is not extinguished by
mere contract for sale and the most important and vital principle stated was that the
mortgagor's right to redeem will survive until there has been completion of sale by
the mortgagee by a registered deed. The completion of sale, it is stated, can be held to
be so unless and until notice in writing requiring payment of the principal money has
been served on the mortgagor. Therefore, it was held that until the sale is complete by
registration of sale, the mortgagor does not lose the right of redemption. It was also
made clear that it was erroneous to suggest that the mortgagee would be acting as the
agent of the mortgagor in selling the property.
39. When we apply the above principles stated with reference to Section 60 of the TP
Act in respect of a secured interest in a secured asset in favour of the secured creditor
under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act and the relevant Rules applicable, under
Section 13(1), a free hand is given to a secured creditor to resort to a sale without the
intervention of the court or tribunal. However, under Section 13(8), it is clearly
stipulated that the mortgagor i.e. the borrower, who is otherwise called as a debtor,
retains his full right to redeem the property by tendering all the dues to the secured
creditor at any time before the date fixed for sale or transfer. Under sub-section (8) of
Section 13, as noted earlier, the secured asset should not be sold or transferred by the
secured creditor when such tender is made by the borrower at the last moment before
the sale or transfer. The said sub-section also states that no further step should be
taken by the secured creditor for transfer or sale of that secured asset. We find no
reason to state that the principles laid down with reference to Section 60 of the TP
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 14
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
Act, which is general in nature in respect of all mortgages, can have no application in
respect of a secured interest in a secured asset created in favour of a secured creditor,
as all the abovestated principles apply on all fours in respect of a transaction as
between the debtor and secured creditor under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
xxx xxx xxx
41. ... even if there was some difference in the amount tendered by the borrower while
exercising his right of redemption under Section 13(8), the question of difference in
the amount should be kept open and can be decided subsequently, but on that score
the right of redemption of the mortgagor cannot be frustrated. Elaborating the
statement of law made therein, we wish to state that the endeavour or the role of a
secured creditor in such a situation while resorting to any sale for the realisation of
dues of a mortgaged asset, should be that the mortgagor is entitled for some lenience,
if not more to be shown, to enable the borrower to tender the amounts due in order
to ensure that the constitutional right to property is preserved, rather than it being
deprived of."
(Emphasis supplied)
47. In Dwarika Prasad v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2018) 5 SCC 491, this Court speaking through one
of us Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, CJI., considered the unamended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act,
keeping in mind the decision in the case of Mathew Varghese (supra). The Court took the view that
the right of redemption of mortgage is not lost until there is a transfer by a registered instrument.
The following observations as contained in para 8 of the judgment are reproduced below:
"8. ... These provisions have fallen for interpretation before this Court in Mathew
Varghese. Dwelling on Section 60 of the Transfer of the Property Act, 1882 this Court
held that the right of redemption is available to a mortgagor unless it stands
extinguished by an act of parties. The right of the mortgagor to redeem the property
survives until there has been a transfer of the mortgagor's interest by a registered
instrument of sale. ..."
48. In, yet one another decision of this Court in Allokam Peddabbayya v. Allahabad Bank, (2017) 8
SCC 272, a similar view was taken. The relevant observations made therein are as under:
"23. The aforesaid discussion leads to the conclusion that the plaintiffs lost the right
to sue for redemption of the mortgaged property by virtue of the proviso to Section
60 of the Act, no sooner that the mortgaged property was put to auction-sale in a suit
for foreclosure and sale certificate was issued in favour of Defendant
2. There remained no property mortgaged to be redeemed. The right to redemption
could not be claimed in the abstract."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 15
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
49. Thus, prior to the amendment of Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, this Court consistently
held, that the borrower shall continue to have a right of redemption of mortgage until the execution
of the conveyance of the secured asset by way of a registered instrument. Furthermore, this Court in
Mathew Varghese (supra) found no inconsistency between the unamended Section 13(8) of
SARFAESI Act and the general right of redemption under Section 60 of the Act, 1882.
50. However, later on 1st September, 2016, the Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of
Debt Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (Amendment) Act, 2016 ("2016 Amendment") was enacted
which inter- alia amended sub-section 8 of Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act, and substituted the
words "any time before the date fixed for sale or transfer" of the original provision with "at any time
before the date of publication of notice for public auction or inviting quotations or tender from
public or private treaty for transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the secured assets". The
amended provision of Section 13 sub- section (8) of the SARFAESI Act, now reads as under:--
"13. Enforcement of security interest. -
(8) Where the amount of dues of the secured creditor together with all costs, charges
and expenses incurred by him is tendered to the secured creditor at any time before
the date of publication of notice for public auction or inviting quotations or tender
from public or private treaty for transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the
secured assets,--
(i) the secured assets shall not be transferred by way of lease, assignment or sale by
the secured creditor; and
(ii) in case, any step has been taken by the secured creditor for transfer by way of
lease or assignment or sale of the assets before tendering of such amount under this
sub-
section, no further step shall be taken by such secured creditor for transfer by way of lease or
assignment or sale of such secured assets."
51. The true purport and scope of the amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act was looked into
by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sri. Sai Annadhatha Polymers v. Canara Bank rep. by its
Branch Manager, Mandanapalle, 2018 SCC OnLine Hyd 178. The court took the view that in
accordance with the unamended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, the right of the borrower to
redeem the secured asset was available till the sale or transfer of such secured asset. The court went
on to say that the amended provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act brought in a radical
change inasmuch as the right of the borrower to redeem the secured asset would stand extinguished
thereunder on the very date of publication of the notice for public auction under Rule 9(1) of the
Rules of 2002. It is pertinent to note that the High Court has referred to and relied upon the
decision of this Court in Mathew Varghese (supra). The relevant observations made by the High
Court are reproduced hereinbelow:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 16
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
"6. In terms of the amended provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, the
right of redemption given to the borrower would expire upon publication of such a
notice. However, Rule 8(6) of the Rules of 2002, as interpreted by the Supreme Court
in Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar [(2014) 5 SCC 610], stipulates that the
thirty day notice period mentioned therein is for the purpose of enabling the
borrower to redeem his property. Significantly, this provision remains unaltered.
Therefore, this statutory notice period of thirty days is sacrosanct and deviation
therefrom would curtail the statutory right of redemption available to the borrower.
However, in terms of the amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, once the
notice under Rule 9 of the Rules of 2002 is published, the said right stands
extinguished.
xxx xxx xxx
20. In the light of the aforestated changes in the statutory scheme, certain crucial
aspects may be noted. As per the unamended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, the
right of the borrower to redeem the secured asset was available till the sale or transfer
of such secured asset. Case law consistently held to the effect that a sale or transfer is
not completed until all the formalities are completed and there is an effective transfer
of the asset sold. In consequence, the borrower's right of redemption did not stand
terminated on the date of the auction sale of the secured asset itself and remained
alive till the transfer was completed in favour of the auction purchaser, by
registration of the sale certificate and delivery of possession of the secured asset. The
recent judgment of the Supreme Court in ITC LIMITED v. BLUE COAST HOTELS
LIMITED also affirmed this legal position.
21. However, the amended provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act bring in a
radical change, inasmuch as the right of the borrower to redeem the secured asset
stands extinguished thereunder on the very date of publication of the notice for
public auction under Rule 9(1) of the Rules of 2002. In effect, the right of redemption
available to the borrower under the present statutory regime stands drastically
curtailed and would be available only till the date of publication of the notice under
Rule 9(1) of the Rules of 2002 and not till completion of the sale or transfer of the
secured asset in favour of the auction purchaser. ...
xxx xxx xxx
23. Therefore, even after the amendment of Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, a
secured creditor is bound to afford to the borrower a clear thirty day notice period
under Rule 8(6) to enable him to exercise his right of redemption. In consequence, a
notice under Rule 9(1) of the Rules of 2002 cannot be published prior to expiry of
this thirty day period in the new scenario, post-amendment of Section 13(8) of the
SARFAESI Act, as such right of redemption would stand terminated immediately
upon publication of the sale notice under Rule 9(1) of the Rules of 2002. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 17
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
judgment of the Supreme Court in CANARA BANK v. M. AMARENDER REDDY,
which was rendered in the context of the unamended provisions, would therefore
have no application to the post-amendment scenario in the light of the change
brought about in Section 13(8). To sum up, the post-amendment scenario inevitably
requires a clear thirty day notice period being maintained between issuance of the
sale notice under Rule 8(6) of the Rules of 2002 and the publication of the sale notice
under Rule 9(1) thereof, as the right of redemption available to the borrower in terms
of Rule 8(6) of the Rules of 2002, as pointed out in MATHEW VARGHESE, stands
extinguished upon publication of the sale notice under Rule 9(1)."
(Emphasis supplied)
52. The amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act was also looked into by the High Court of
Telangana in the case of K.V.V. Prasad Rao Gupta v. State Bank of India, 2021 SCC OnLine TS 328
and relying on the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Sri. Sai Annadhatha
Polymers (supra), the court observed in para 21 as under:
"21. Thus from the above judgments it is clear that under Rule 8(6) of the Rules of
2002, the petitioners are entitled for a thirty day notice period enabling them to clear
the loan and to redeem the property as envisaged under Section 13(8) of the
SARFAESI Act, and that if they fail to repay the amount within the stipulated period,
after expiry of said period of 30 days, the secured creditor is entitled to issue
publication of sale notice under Rule 9(1), and that on publication of such notice, the
right of the borrower to redeem the property stands extinguished."
(Emphasis supplied)
53. The Telangana High Court in Concern Readymix (supra), examined the amended Section 13(8)
of the SARFAESI Act, & held that the same only restricts the right of the secured creditor and not
the borrowers right of redemption, which will continue to exist until the execution of the
conveyance. The following relevant observations are reproduced below:--
"10. The first distinction between the unamended and amended sub-section (8) of
Section 13 is that before amendment, the facility of repayment of the entire dues
along with the costs, charges and expenses, was available to the debtor at any time
before the date fixed for the sale or transfer. But after the amendment, the facility is
available upto the time before the date of publication of notice for public auction or
inviting quotations or tender from public or private treaty. The second distinction is
that the unamended sub-section (8) did not provide for the contingency when the
dues are tendered by the borrower before the date of completion of the sale or lease
but after the issue of notice. But the amended sub-section (8) takes care of the
contingency where steps have already been taken by the secured creditor for the
transfer of the secured asset, before the payment was made. Except these two
distinctions, there is no other distinction.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 18
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
xxx xxx xxx
13. What is important to note both from the amended and unamended provisions of
Section 13(8) and Rule 9(1) is that both of them do not speak in express terms, about
the equity of redemption available to the mortgagor. The amended Section 13(8)
merely prohibits the secured creditor from proceeding further with the transfer of the
secured assets by way of lease, assignment or sale. A restriction on the right of the
mortgagee to deal with the property is not exactly the same as the equity of
redemption available to the mortgagor. The payment of the amounts mentioned in
Section 13(8) ties the hands of the mortgagee (secured creditor) from exercising any
of the powers conferred under the Securitisation Act, 2002. Redemption comes later.
But unfortunately, some Courts, on a wrong reading of the decision of the Supreme
Court in Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar [(2014) 5 SCC 610], have come to
the conclusion as though Section 13(8) speaks about the right of redemption. The
danger of interpreting Section 13(8) as though it relates to the right of redemption, is
that if payments are not made as per Section 13(8), the right of redemption may get
lost even before the sale is complete in all respects. But in law it is not. It may be seen
from paragraphs-34 to 36 of the decision of the Supreme Court in Mathew Varghese
that the Supreme Court took note of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act and
the combined effect of Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 17 of the
Registration Act to come to the conclusion that the extinction of the right of
redemption comes much later than the sale notice. Therefore, we should first
understand that the right of redemption is not lost immediately upon the highest bid
made by a purchaser in an auction being accepted.
14. Perhaps the Courts were tempted to think that Section 13(8) speaks about
redemption, only on account of what is found in Rule 3(5) of the Security Interest
(Enforcement) Rules, 2002. Rule 3(5) inserted by way of amendment with effect
from 04-11-2016 states that the demand notice issued under Section 13(2) should
invite the attention of the borrower to the provisions of Section 13(8), in respect of
the time available to the borrower to redeem the secured assets. Today, it may be
convenient for one borrower to contend that the right of redemption will be lost
immediately upon the issue of notice under Rule 9(1). But if it is held so, the same
would tantamount to annulling the relevant provisions of the Transfer of Property
Act, which do not stand expressly excluded, insofar as the question of redemption is
concerned."
(Emphasis supplied)
54. We are conscious of the fact, that the aforesaid decision of Concern Readymix (supra) was
carried upto and challenged before this Court by way of Special Leave Petition (C) No. 20500 of
2019, which came to be dismissed by this Court in limine, being as follows:--
"ORDER Delay condoned.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 19
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed"
55. In Shakeena (supra), while primarily dealing with the unamended provision of Section 13(8) of
the SARFAESI Act, this Court also made certain pertinent observations in respect of the amended
provision of Section 13(8), which are being reproduced hereunder:--
"15. Be it noted that on 1-9-2016 amendment to Section 13(8) of the 2002 Act came
into force as a result of which the dues of the secured creditor together with all costs,
charges and expenses incurred by him are required to be tendered to the secured
creditor at any time before the date of publication of notice for public auction or
inviting quotations or tender from public or private treaty for transfer by way of
lease, assignment or sale of the secured assets.
xxx xxx xxx
30. A fortiorari, it must follow that the appellants have failed to exercise their right of
redemption in the manner known to law, much less until the registration of the sale
certificate on 18-9- 2007. In that view of the matter no relief can be granted to the
appellants, assuming that the appellants are right in contending that as per the
applicable provision at the relevant time [unamended Section 13(8) of the 2002 Act],
they could have exercised their right of redemption until the registration of the sale
certificate -- which, indisputably, has already happened on 18-9-2007. Therefore, it is
not possible to countenance the plea of the appellants to reopen the entire auction
process. This is more so because, the narrative of the appellants that they had made a
valid tender towards the subject loan accounts before registration of the sale
certificate, has been found to be tenuous. Thus understood, their right of redemption
in any case stood obliterated on 18-9-2007. Further, the amended Section 13(8) of
the 2002 Act which has come into force w.e.f. 1-9-2016, will now stare at the face of
the appellants. As per the amended provision, stringent condition has been stipulated
that the tender of dues to the secured creditor together with all costs, charges and
expenses incurred by him shall be at any time before the "date of publication of
notice" for public auction or inviting quotations or tender from public or private deed
for transfer by way of lease assessment or sale of the secured assets. ..."
(Emphasis supplied)
56. The Punjab & Haryana High Court while rendering its decision in Pal Alloys (supra), looked into
the Report of the Joint Committee on the 2016 Amendment and the decision in Concern Readymix
(supra), & concluded that under the amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, the right of
redemption of mortgage would continue till the execution of conveyance or issuance of sale
certificate.
It further observed that the decision in Shakeena (supra) was not applicable inasmuch as it did not
deal with the right of redemption under the Act, 1882. The observations made in it are given below:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 20
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
"78. It is interesting to note that para 24 of the Report of the Joint Committee
referred to above deals with the proposed amendment to Section 13(8) of the
SARFAESI Act and gives a heading "Provisions to stop secure creditor to lease or
assignment or sale in the prescribed conditions-Amendment to Section 13(8) of the
SARFAESI Act."
79. Thus the amendment was proposed w.r.t.
when to stop the secured creditor from selling/transferring the secured asset. The words 'when to
stop the exercise of right of redemption by the borrower/mortgagor' were not used.
80. In the said Report, at pg.12, Clause 11(ii) of the Bill which proposed to amend Section 13(8) of
the SARFAESI Act is noted. After extracting the existing Section 13(8) of the Act which stands as
under:--
"If the dues of the secured creditor together with all costs, charges and expenses
incurred by him are tendered to the secured creditor at any time before the date fixed
for sale or transfer, the secured asset shall not be sold or transferred by the secured
creditor, and no further step shall be taken by him for transfer or sale of that secured
asset."
81. The proposed modification to Section 13(8) is set out also at pg.12 as under:--
"(8) Where the amount of dues of the secured creditor together with all costs, charges
and expenses incurred by him are tendered to the secured creditor at any time before
the date fixed for lease, assignment or sale of the secured assets,-
(i) the secured assets shall not be leased, assigned or sold by the secured creditor; and
(ii) in case, any step has been taken by the secured creditor for lease or assignment or
sale of the assets before tendering of such amount under this sub-section, no further
step shall be taken by such secured creditor for lease or assignment or sale of such
secured assets."
82. Strangely, on the next page at page 13, the following is stated:--
"The Committee after examining the proposed amendment and the existing Rules in
this regard decide to modify proposed Clause 11(ii) [section 13(8) of the principal Act]
as under:
"(8) Where the amount of dues of the secured creditor together with all costs, charges
and expenses incurred by him is tendered to the secured creditor at any time before
the date of publication of notice for public auction or inviting quotations or tender
from public or private treaty for transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 21
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
secured assets,-
(i) the secured assets shall not be transferred by way of lease, assignment or sale by
the secured creditor; and
(ii) in case, any step has been taken by the secured creditor for transfer by way of
lease or assignment or sale of the assets before tendering of such amount under this
sub-
section, no further step shall be taken by such secured creditor for transfer by way of lease or
assignment or sale of such secured assets."
83. Nothing is mentioned as to why the proposal indicated in Page-12 was changed on page- 13
differently.
84. Admittedly, what is stated in page-13 was passed in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and then
it became the Act 44 of 2016 and came into effect on 01.09.2016.
85. But the important thing to note is that this Report does not indicate that the Committee had
even considered Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which provides the general law of
right to redeem a mortgaged asset of a mortgager vis-a-vis the provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
86. It no where says that there was an intention to bring about a change with regard to the time
before which a mortgagor can exercise his right to redeem the mortgage.
87. Even the heading of Para 24 of the Report which says "Provisions to stop secure creditor to lease
or assignment or sale in the prescribed conditions - Amendment to Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI
Act"
seems to suggest that the focus of the Committee was on the date when the secured
creditor's right to lease or assignment or sale would stop.
88. In our considered opinion, it is clear that the legislature did not have any intention to deal with
the right of mortgagor to redeem the mortgage when they amended Sec. 13(8) or to modify it in any
manner; and amendment cannot be said to have intended to modify the existing law which
continued even when the un-amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act was in force. The
amended Sec. 13(8) was intended to only deal with the date when the secured creditor's right to
transfer the secured asset should stop and nothing more.

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
94. We shall now consider the judgment of Supreme Court in Shakeena [(2019) 5 RCR (Civil) 689
(SC)]cited by the counsel for 1st respondent. In that case, sale certificate had been issued in favour
of the auction purchasers on 06.01.2006 and a Writ Petition was filed on 19.01.2006 challenging the
auction and it was registered on 18.9.2007. The Court held that the appellants had failed to make a
valid tender of amounts due or exercise their right of redemption in a manner known to law until the
registration of the sale certificate on 18.09.2007 and that the right of redemption stood obliterated
on 18.09.2007. The statement therein in para 29 that as per the amended provision stringent
conditions have been stipulated that the tender of dues to the secured creditor shall be at any time
before the date of publication of notice for public auction does not, in our opinion, lead to an
expression of opinion by the Supreme Court that the law of redemption as per Section 60 of the
Transfer of Property Act would not apply in view of amendment to Section 13(8). We do not find any
discussion in the decision in Shakeena [(2019) 5 RCR (Civil) 689 (SC)] about the decisions of the
apex court dealing with the right of redemption under Sec. 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1872.
So reliance on the said decision does not help the 1st respondent.
xxx xxx xxx
96. Keeping in mind (i) the Report of the Joint Committee on the Enforcement of Security Interest
and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (Amendment) Bill, 2016 discussed above,
(ii) the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Mathew Varghese [(2014) 5 SCC 610] and (iii) the
decision in Concern Readymix [(2019) 3 ALD 384 : Law Finder Doc Id # 1380151] of the Telangana
and Andhra Pradesh High Court, with which we respectfully agree, we hold that the amended
Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act merely prohibits a secured creditor from proceeding further with
the transfer of the secured asset by way of lease, assignment or sale; a restriction on the right of the
mortgagee to deal with the property is not exactly the same as the equity of redemption available to
the mortgagor; the payment of the amount mentioned in Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act ties the
hands of the mortgagee (secured creditor) from exercising any of the powers conferred under the
Act; that redemption comes later; extinction of the right of redemption comes much later than the
sale notice; and the right of redemption is not lost immediately upon the highest bid made by a
purchaser in an auction being accepted. We also hold that such a right would continue till the
execution of a conveyance i.e. issuance of sale certificate in favour of the mortgagee. ...
97. It would, therefore, certainly be available to the petitioners herein before the issuance of sale
certificate in favour of respondents No. 2 and 3. Point
(a) is answered accordingly in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents."
(Emphasis supplied)
57. In S. Karthik (supra) a three-Judge Bench of this Court, made the following relevant
observations given below:--
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 23
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
"53. It could thus be seen that this Court in Mathew Varghese [Mathew Varghese v.
M. Amritha Kumar, (2014) 5 SCC 610 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 254] observed that the
equity of redemption is not extinguished by mere contract for sale and that the
mortgagor's right to redeem will survive until there has been completion of sale by
the mortgagee by a registered deed. This Court further observed that applying the
principles stated with reference to Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act in
respect of a secured interest in a secured asset in favour of the secured creditor under
the provisions of the SARFAESI Act and the relevant Rules applicable, a free hand is
given to a secured creditor to resort to a sale without the intervention of the court or
tribunal. It has, however, been held that under Section 13(8), it is clearly stipulated
that the mortgagor i.e. the borrower, who is otherwise called as a debtor, retains his
full right to redeem the property by tendering all the dues to the secured creditor at
any time before the date fixed for sale or transfer.
54. This Court in Mathew Varghese [Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar, (2014)
5 SCC 610 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 254] further held that if the tender is made by the
borrower at the last moment before the sale or transfer, the secured asset should not
be sold or transferred by the secured creditor. This Court held that there was no
reason as to why the general principle laid down by this Court in Narandas
Karsondas [Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247] with reference to
Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act could not have application in respect of a
secured interest in a secured asset created in favour of a secured creditor. It has been
held that the said principles will apply on all fours in respect of a transaction as
between the debtor and secured creditor under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
xxx xxx xxx
115. Even if viewed from another angle, the claim of the appellants is not sustainable.
The two- Judge Bench of this Court in Mathew Varghese [Mathew Varghese v. M.
Amritha Kumar, (2014) 5 SCC 610 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 254], has heavily relied on the
judgment of the three-Judge Bench of this Court in Narandas Karsondas. It has been
held by this Court in Narandas Karsondas [Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam,
(1977) 3 SCC 247], that the right of redemption, which is embodied in Section 60 of
the Transfer of Property Act, is available to the mortgagor unless it has been
extinguished by the act of parties. It has been held, that only on execution of the
conveyance and registration of transfer of the mortgagor's interest by registered
instrument, that the mortgagor's right of redemption will be extinguished.
xxx xxx xxx
118. It is further relevant to note that this Court in Dwarika Prasad [Dwarika Prasad
v. State of U.P., (2018) 5 SCC 491] and in Shakeena [Shakeena v. Bank of India,
(2021) 12 SCC 761] held that the right to redemption stands extinguished on the sale
certificate getting registered."

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
(Emphasis supplied)
58. Concern Readymix (supra) was referred to and relied upon later in another decision by the
Telangana High Court titled Amme Srisailam (supra), wherein the following relevant observations
were made:
"38. After referring to the amendments brought to the Security Interest
(Enforcement) Rules, 2002, this Court took the view that amended Section 13(8)
merely prohibits the secured creditor from proceeding further with the transfer of the
secured assets by way of lease, assignment or sale if the dues are paid before issuance
of notice for public auction. Thereafter it has been held that a restriction on the right
of the mortgagee to deal with the property is not exactly the same as the equity of
redemption available to the mortgagor. Payment of the amounts mentioned in
Section 13(8) ties the hands of the mortgagee (secured creditor) from exercising any
of the powers conferred under the SARFAESI Act. Redemption comes later. It has
been held as follows:
The danger of interpreting Section 13(8) as though it relates to the right of
redemption, is that if payments are not made as per Section 13(8), the right of
redemption may get lost even before the sale is complete in all respects. But in law it
is not.
39. Thus this Court emphasised that the right of redemption is not lost immediately
upon the highest bid made by the purchaser in an auction is accepted.
40. A three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in S. Karthik (supra) held that the
right of redemption which is embodied in Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 is available to the mortgagor unless it has been extinguished by the act of the
parties. Only on execution of the conveyance and registration of transfer of
mortgagor's interest by registered instrument that the mortgagor's right of
redemption will be extinguished. Referring to the previous decisions of the Supreme
Court, it has been held that the right to redemption stands extinguished only on the
sale certificate getting registered.
41. This position has been explained by the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Pal
Alloys & Metal India Private Limited (supra), wherein it has been clarified that the
amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act merely prohibits the secured creditor
from proceeding further with the transfer of the secured asset by way of lease,
assignment or sale if the dues are paid before issuance of sale notice for public
auction. A restriction on the right of the mortgagee to deal with the property is not
exactly the same as the equity of redemption available to the mortgagor.
42. Let us now examine the decision of the Supreme Court in Shakeena (supra) relied
upon by the petitioner. As opposed to S. Karthik (supra) which was rendered by a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 25
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
three-Judge Bench, Shakeena (supra) was delivered by a two-Judge Bench of the
Supreme Court. That was a case which dealt with Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act
prior to amendment. In this case, the appellants failed to exercise their right of
redemption until registration of the sale certificate; therefore, relief was declined.
While coming to the above conclusion, the Division Bench of the Supreme Court adverted to the
amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act observing by way of obiter that tender of dues to the
secured creditor with all costs, charges and expenses incurred by him shall be at any time before the
date of publication of notice for public auction etc.
43. The decision in Shakeena (supra) was rendered by a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court on
20.08.2019. On the other hand, the decision in S. Karthik (supra) was rendered by a three-Judge
Bench of the Supreme Court much later i.e., on 23.09.2021. The decision in S. Karthik (supra) being
a later judgment and by a larger bench therefore will be binding on us and this decision says that the
right of redemption stands extinguished only on the sale certificate getting registered.
44. Before we revert back to the facts of the present case, we may also refer to Sections 35 and 37 of
the SARFAESI Act. While Section 35 says that the provisions of the SARFAESI Act shall have effect
notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in
force, Section 37 clarifies that provisions of the SARFAESI Act or the rules made thereunder shall be
in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being in force.
45. This brings us to Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Section 60 says that at any
time after the principal amount has become due, the mortgagor has a right, on payment or tender, of
the mortgage money, to require the mortgagee (a) to deliver to the mortgagor the mortgage deed
and all documents relating to the mortgaged property which are in possession or power of the
mortgagee, (b) where the mortgagee is in possession of the mortgaged property, to deliver
possession thereof back to the mortgagor, and (c) at the cost of the mortgagor either to re-transfer
the mortgaged property to him or to such third person as he may direct, or to execute and to have
registered an acknowledgement in writing that any right in derogation of his interest transferred to
the mortgagee has been extinguished. As per the proviso, the right conferred under the aforesaid
provision shall not be extinguished by any act of the parties or by decree of a Court.
46. Therefore, on a careful application of Sections 35 and 37 of the SARFAESI Act, it is evident that
the situation contemplated under Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act does not exclude application of
Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. As explained by this Court in Concern Readymix
(supra), a restriction on the right of the mortgagee to deal with the property post issuance of notice
for public auction is not the same as the right of redemption available to the mortgagor."
(Emphasis supplied)
59. Thus, from the aforesaid, it is evident that the Telangana High Court in the Amme Srisailam
(supra) has not referred to or looked into its earlier decision in the case of K.V.V. Prasad Rao Gupta
(supra). The decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sri Sai Annadhatha Polymers (supra)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 26
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
was also not been looked into by the Telangana High Court in the case of Amme Srisailam (supra). It
appears that the Telangana High Court in Concern Readymix (supra) and Amme Srisailam (supra)
as well as the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of Pal Alloys (supra) have taken the view
that the amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act does not exclude the application of Section 60
of the Act, 1882 in view of Sections 35 and 37 respectively of the SARFAESI Act.
EFFECT OF THE AMENDMENT TO SECTION 13(8) OF THE SARFAESI ACT
60. Before proceeding with the analysis of the provision of Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, it
would be appropriate to refer to the said provision as it stood prior to the amendment and as it
stands after the amendment, which is given below:--
Pre-amendment Section Post-amendment Section 13(8) 13(8) (8) If the dues of the
(8) Where the amount secured creditor together of dues of the secured with all costs,
charges and creditor together with expenses incurred by him all costs, charges and
are tendered to the secured expenses incurred by creditor at any time before him is
tendered to the the date fixed for sale or secured creditor at transfer, the secured
asset any time before the shall not be sold or date of publication transferred by the
secured of notice for public creditor, and no further step auction or inviting shall be
taken by him for quotations or tender transfer or sale of that from public or secured
asset. private treaty for transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the secured
assets,--
(i) the secured assets shall not be transferred by way of lease assignment or sale by
the secured creditor; and
(ii) in case, any step has been taken by the secured creditor for transfer by way of
lease or assignment or sale of the assets before tendering of such amount under this
sub-section, no further step shall be taken by such secured creditor for transfer by
way of lease or assignment or sale of such secured assets.
61. At this juncture, it would be apposite to refer to the decision of this Court in Embassy Hotels
Private Ltd. v. Gajraj and Company, (2015) 14 SCC 316, wherein this Court had held that the
expression "by act of the parties" in the Proviso to Section 60 would include the failure of the parties
to settle the dispute and by their act allowing the mortgaged property to be sold in auction. The
relevant observations made in it are reproduced below:--
"16. Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act protects the right of redemption
available to a mortgagor by providing that the mortgagor can exercise such a right by
paying the mortgaged money any time after the principal money has become due. But
the proviso clarifies that the right conferred by that section is available only if it has
not been extinguished by act of the parties or by decree of the court. The act parties
would cover act of the mortgagor and mortgagee, if they are unable to settle the
dispute arising out of money claim covered by the mortgage and by their action, allow
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 27
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
the mortgaged property to be sold through auction in favour of a third party. Hence,
it is not possible to accept the case of the plaintiff-respondent that in spite of sale of
suit property becoming final through court auction, for the purpose of grant of
specific relief to the plaintiff in the present suit, the first defendant would be deemed
to still retain the right to the mortgage and transfer the suit property to the plaintiff
regardless of the right, title and possession already legally vested in the
auction-purchaser the appellant."
(Emphasis supplied)
62. It is equally well settled that the rights created for the benefit of the borrower under the
SARFAESI Act, can be waived. Waiver can be contractual or by express conduct in consideration of
some compromise. However, a statutory right may also be waived by implied conduct, like, by
wanting to take a chance of a favourable decision. The fact that the other side has acted on it, is
sufficient consideration, as observed by this Court in Arce Polymers Pvt. Ltd. v. Alpine
Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., (2022) 2 SCC 221, referred as under:--
"16. Waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. Waiver applies when a
party knows the material facts and is cognizant of the legal rights in that matter, and
yet for some consideration consciously abandons the existing legal right, advantage,
benefit, claim or privilege. Waiver can be contractual or by express conduct in
consideration of some compromise. However, a statutory right may also be waived by
implied conduct, like, by wanting to take a chance of a favourable decision. The fact
that the other side has acted on it, is sufficient consideration.
17. It is correct that waiver being an intentional relinquishment is not to be inferred
by mere failure to take auction, but the present case is of repeated positive acts post
the notices under Sections 13(2) and (4) of the SARFAESI Act. Not only did the
borrower not question or object to the auction of the Bank, but it by express and
deliberate conduct had asked the Bank to compromise its position and alter the
contractual terms. The borrower wrote repeated request letters for restructuring of
loans, which prayers were considered by the Bank by giving indulgence, time and
opportunities. The borrower, aware and conscious of its rights, chose to abandon the
statutory claim and took its chance and even procured favourable decisions. Even if
we are to assume that the borrower did not waive the remedy, its conduct had put the
Bank in a position where they have lost time, and suffered on account of delay and
laches, which aspects are material. Auction on the subject property was delayed by
more than a year as at the behest of the borrower, the Bank gave them a long rope to
regularise the account. To ignore the conduct of the borrower would not be
reasonable to the Bank once third-party rights have been created. In this background,
the principle of equitable estoppel as a rule of evidence bars the borrower from
complaining of violation."

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
63. We are of the view that the failure on the part of the borrower in tendering the entire dues
including the charges, interest, costs etc. before the publication of the auction notice as required by
Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, would also sufficiently constitute extinguishment of right of
redemption of mortgage by the act of parties as per the proviso to Section 60 of the Act, 1882.
Furthermore, in the case on hand, there was no claim for right of redemption by the borrower either
before the publication of the auction notice or even thereafter. The borrowers entered into the fray
only after coming to know of the confirmation of auction. Be that as it may, once the Section 13(8)
stage was over and auction stood concluded, it could be said that there was an intentional
relinquishment of his right of redemption under Section 13(8), whereby the Bank declared the
appellant as the successful auction purchaser having offered the highest bid in accordance with the
terms of the auction notice.
64. The SARFAESI Act is a special law containing an overriding clause in comparison to any other
law in force. Section 60 of the Act, 1882, is a general law vis- a-vis the amended Section 13(8) of the
SARFAESI Act which is special law. The right of redemption is clearly restricted till the date of
publication of the sale notice under the SARFAESI Act, whereas the said right continues under
Section 60 of the Act, 1882 till the execution of conveyance of the mortgaged property. The
legislative history has been covered in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment and how the
Parliament desired to have express departure from the general provision of Section 60 of Act, 1882.
The SARFAESI Act is a special law of recovery with a paradigm shift that permits expeditious
recovery for the banks and the financial institutions without intervention of Courts. Similarly,
Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act is a departure from the general right of redemption under the
general law i.e. the Act, 1882. Further, the legislature has in the objects and reasons while passing
the amending Act specifically stated "to facilitate expeditious disposal of recovery applications, it
has been decided to amend the said Acts....". Thus, while interpreting Section 13(8) vis-à-vis Section
60 of the Act, 1882, an interpretation which furthers the said object and reasons should be preferred
and adopted. If the general law is allowed to govern in the manner as sought to be argued by the
borrowers, it will defeat the very object and purpose as well as the clear language of the amended
Section 13(8).
65. In Mathew Varghese (supra) this Court had interpreted the unamended section 13(8) of
SARFAESI Act and Section 60 of Act, 1882 respectively. However, thereafter the legislature
amended Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act. Thus, on this score, the decision in Mathew Varghese
(supra) could be said to have been partially legislatively overruled as the substratum of the verdict
stands altered/amended.
66. Even otherwise, we should not lose sight of the fact that in Mathew Varghese (supra) the court
held in regard to the right of redemption that both the SARFAESI Act and Act, 1882 are
complimentary to each other and equally applicable. It had held this because, the words "before the
date fixed for transfer" in the unamended Section 13(8), amongst other things also means and
connotes the date of conveyance of the secured asset by a registered instrument (which is the
ordinary process of extinguishment of right of redemption under Act, 1882). Since, this Court
observed that the stipulation or expression "date fixed for transfer" could also mean the date of
conveyance/transfer of such secured asset and being so, is not much different from the ordinary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 29
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
process of redemption under the Act, 1882, it could not be said that there was any material
inconsistency between the SARFAESI Act & Act, 1882, and thus it found no reason or hesitation to
hold that the Act, 1882 is inapplicable and thus made an endeavour of harmonizing the two.
67. It appears that while considering the right of redemption of mortgage under the unamended
Section 13(8), this Court in Mathew Varghese (supra) only went so far to say that in the absence of
any material inconsistency between the SARFAESI Act & Act, 1882, there was no good reason to
hold that the Act, 1882 would not be applicable and as such, held that general right of redemption of
mortgage contained in Section 60 Act, 1882 would apply even in respect of the SARFAESI Act.
68. However, with the advent of the 2016 Amendment, Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act now uses
the expression "before the date of publication notice for public auction or inviting quotations or
tender from public or private treaty for transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the secured
assets" which by no stretch of imagination could be said to be in consonance with the general rule
under the Act, 1882 that the right of redemption is extinguished only after conveyance by registered
deed. Thus, in the light of clear inconsistency between Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act and
Section 60 of the Act, 1882 the former special enactment overrides the latter general enactment in
light of Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act. Thus, the right of redemption of mortgage is available to
the borrower under the SARFAESI Act only till the publication of auction notice and not thereafter,
in light of the amended Section 13(8).
69. This aspect of inapplicability of the Act, 1882 vis- a-vis the SARFAESI Act can be looked at from
one another angle. In Madras Petrochem (supra) this Court made a pertinent observation that the
Sections 35 and 37 respectively of the SARFAESI Act form a unique scheme of overriding
provisions, however the scope and ambit of Section 37 is restricted only to the securities law. The
relevant portion is given as under:--
"39. This is what then brings us to the doctrine of harmonious construction, which is
one of the paramount doctrines that is applied in interpreting all statutes. Since
neither Section 35 nor Section 37 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of
Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 is subject to the
other, we think it is necessary to interpret the expression "or any other law for the
time being in force" in Section 37. If a literal meaning is given to the said expression,
Section 35 will become completely otiose as all other laws will then be in addition to
and not in derogation of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets
and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Obviously this could not have been
the parliamentary intendment, after providing in Section 35 that the Securitisation
and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act,
2002 will prevail over all other laws that are inconsistent therewith. A middle ground
has, therefore, necessarily to be taken. According to us, the two apparently conflicting
sections can best be harmonised by giving meaning to both. This can only be done by
limiting the scope of the expression "or any other law for the time being in force"
contained in Section 37. This expression will, therefore, have to be held to mean other
laws having relation to the securities market only, as the Recovery of Debts and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 30
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
Bankruptcy Act, 1993 is the only other special law, apart from the Securitisation and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002,
dealing with recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions. On this
interpretation also, the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 will
not be included for the obvious reason that its primary objective is to rehabilitate sick
industrial companies and not to deal with the securities market."
(Emphasis supplied)
70. This Court in M.D. Frozen Foods Exports Private Limited v. Hero Fincorp Limited, (2017) 16
SCC 741, observed that since as per Section 37 SARFAESI Act, the RDBFI Act which also
contemplates arbitration proceedings, is in addition to the SARFAESI Act, it held that both
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and the SARFAESI Act would go hand in hand. The relevant
observations are reproduced below:--
"27. On the SARFAESI Act being brought into force seeking to recover debts against
security interest, a question was raised whether parallel proceedings could go on
under the RDDB Act and the SARFAESI Act. This issue was clearly answered in
favour of such simultaneous proceedings in Transcore v. Union of India. A later
judgment in Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar also discussed this issue in the
following terms: (Mathew Varghese case, SCC pp. 640-41, paras 45-46) "45. A close
reading of Section 37 shows that the provisions of the SARFAESI Act or the Rules
framed thereunder will be in addition to the provisions of the RDDB Act. Section 35
of the SARFAESI Act states that the provisions of the SARFAESI Act will have
overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law
for the time being in force. Therefore, reading Sections 35 and 37 together, it will
have to be held that in the event of any of the provisions of the RDDB Act not being
inconsistent with the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the application of both the
Acts, namely, the SARFAESI Act and the RDDB Act, would be complementary to
each other. In this context reliance can be placed upon the decision in Transcore v.
Union of India. In para 64 it is stated as under after referring to Section 37 of the
SARFAESI Act : (SCC p. 162) '64. ... According to American Jurisprudence, 2d, Vol.
25, p. 652, if in truth there is only one remedy, then the doctrine of election does not
apply. In the present case, as stated above, the NPA Act is an additional remedy to
the DRT Act. Together they constitute one remedy and, therefore, the doctrine of
election does not apply. Even according to Snell''s Principles of Equity (31st Edn., p.
119), the doctrine of election of remedies is applicable only when there are two or
more co-existent remedies available to the litigants at the time of election which are
repugnant and inconsistent. In any event, there is no repugnancy nor inconsistency
between the two remedies, therefore, the doctrine of election has no application.'
46. A reading of Section 37 discloses that the application of the SARFAESI Act will be
in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of the RDDB Act. In other
words, it will not in any way nullify or annul or impair the effect of the provisions of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195736486/ 31
Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
the RDDB Act. We are also fortified by our above statement of law as the heading of
the said section also makes the position clear that application of other laws is not
barred. The effect of Section 37 would, therefore, be that in addition to the provisions
contained under the SARFAESI Act, in respect of proceedings initiated under the said
Act, it will be in order for a party to fall back upon the provisions of the other Acts
mentioned in Section 37, namely, the Companies Act, 1956; the Securities Contracts
(Regulation) Act, 1956; the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992; the
Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993, or any other law for the time being in
force."
xxx xxx xxx
29. The aforesaid two Acts are, thus, complementary to each other and it is not a case of election of
remedy.
30. The only twist in the present case is that, instead of the recovery process under the RDDB Act,
we are concerned with an arbitration proceeding. It is trite to say that arbitration is an alternative to
the civil proceedings. In fact, when a question was raised as to whether the matters which came
within the scope and jurisdiction of the Debt Recovery Tribunal under the RDDB Act, could still be
referred to arbitration when both parties have incorporated such a clause, the answer was given in
the affirmative. That being the position, the appellants can hardly be permitted to contend that the
initiation of arbitration proceedings would, in any manner, prejudice their rights to seek relief under
the SARFAESI Act.

32. The aforesaid is not a case of election of remedies as was sought to be canvassed by the learned
Senior Counsel for the appellants, since the alternatives are between a civil court, Arbitral Tribunal
or a Debt Recovery Tribunal constituted under the RDDB Act. Insofar as that election is concerned,
the mode of settlement of disputes to an Arbitral Tribunal has been elected. The provisions of the
SARFAESI Act are thus, a remedy in addition to the provisions of the Arbitration Act. In Transcore
v. Union of India it was clearly observed that the SARFAESI Act was enacted to regulate
securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest and for
matters connected therewith. Liquidation of secured interest through a more expeditious procedure
is what has been envisaged under the Sarfaesi Act and the two Acts are cumulative remedies to the
secured creditors."

71. It would be also appropriate to refer to another decision of this Court rendered in Vishal N.
Kalsaria v. Bank of India, (2016) 3 SCC 762 wherein this Court while construing the expression "any
other law" occurring in Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act, held the same would mean any other law
operating in the same field. The relevant observations made in it are given below:--

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
"37. It is a settled position of law that once tenancy is created, a tenant can be evicted
only after following the due process of law, as prescribed under the provisions of the
Rent Control Act. A tenant cannot be arbitrarily evicted by using the provisions of the
SARFAESI Act as that would amount to stultifying the statutory rights of protection
given to the tenant. A non obstante clause (Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act) cannot
be used to bulldoze the statutory rights vested in the tenants under the Rent Control
Act. The expression "any other law for the time being in force"
as appearing in Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act cannot mean to extend to each and every law
enacted by the Central and State Legislatures. It can only extend to the laws operating in the same
field."
(Emphasis supplied)
72. Thus, it appears from a combined reading of the decisions rendered by this Court in Madras
Petrochem (supra) and M.D. Frozen Foods Exports (supra) that this Court has consistently
construed that only those laws which have either been enumerated in Section 37 SARFAESI Act or
similar to it would be applicable in addition to the SARFAESI Act i.e., laws which deal with
securities or occupy the same field as the SARFAESI Act. Thus, even on this aspect, we are of the
view that the Act, 1882 would not be applicable in addition to the SARFAESI Act. Suffice to say, that
in view of the above discussion, the statutory right of redemption under the Act, 1882 will not be
applicable to the SARFAESI Act at least in view of the amended Section 13(8) and any right of
redemption of a borrower must be found within the SARFAESI Act in terms of the amended Section
13(8)."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court holds that in terms of sub-section (8) of Section 13, once the
sale notice is issued, right to redeem mortgaged property by the borrower is lost and the right of
enforcement of security interest by the Bank is absolute.
(Emphasis is mine)
13. The facts obtaining before the Apex Court completely fit into the facts obtaining in the case at
hand and only some dates would require reiteration. The sale notice was issued on 23-08- 2021, the
property was sold on 14-09-2021, the auction purchaser has paid the entire amount on or before
23-11-2021, the sale certificate was issued on 27-10-2022 and it was registered on 03-01-2023. All
that the petitioners have done during these dates is only litigation and nothing else. From
05-09-2018 to May 2023 the petitioners have on intermittent intervals, in a staggering manner,
deposit `1.02 crores to the Bank in their account which was in default. Therefore, if the law laid
down by the Apex Court is fitted to the facts of the case at hand, it becomes a classic case of repeated
abuse of the process of law after having defaulted at every time in the undertakings given to this
Court and the subject petition calls in question an order that did not take away any right of the
petitioners who have dragged on the proceedings for 7 months now. Therefore, it becomes a case
where the petition is to be rejected with exemplary costs.

Mr. Y .B. Shamanna vs The Authorized Officer on 20 December, 2023
14. Since the matter is at large before the Tribunal, it is for the petitioners to pursue the remedy
before the Tribunal and not approach this Court time and again by misusing and abusing the
process of law and repeatedly violating the undertakings given to this Court. The petitioners submit
that they have made payment of `1.02 crores till now. It is for the Tribunal to consider those
submissions, as the proceedings are pending before it. No order on that score can be passed in
favour of the petitioners in these proceedings, in view of the preceding analysis.
15. For the aforesaid reasons, finding no merit in the petition, the petition stands rejected with costs
of `25,000/- to be paid to the 2nd respondent/auction purchaser within eight weeks from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order. Interim order, subsisting if any, shall stand dissolved
Consequently, I.A.No.4 of 2023 also stands disposed.
