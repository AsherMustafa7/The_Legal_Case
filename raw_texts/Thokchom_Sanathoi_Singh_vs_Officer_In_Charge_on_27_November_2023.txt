numbering about 200/300 comprising of males and females assembled and formed an unruly mob
at Heirok Part-II Bazar area by violating the promulgation orders of District Magistrate, Thoubal

like spades, iron rods, dao, wooden legs, etc. and started pelting stones among themselves and heard
gun shots. As a result, some individuals received injuries and evacuated to Hospital for medical
treatment. Acting on the information, a suo-motu case under FIR No. 31(12)2021 HRK-PS U/S
147/148/149/188/326 IPC & 25(1-C) Arms Acts was registered.

[3] On the basis of a complaint lodged by one Mr. Khundongbam
Shyambi Singh another FIR No. 38(12)2021 HRK-PS U/S 457/307/34 IPC & 25 (1-C) Arms Act was
registered. In the complaint dated 22.12.2021 lodged by the complainant, namely Mr.
Khundongbam Shyambi Singh, the names of the 3 (three) petitioners were specifically mentioned.
Apprehending arrest, the petitioners approached this Court by way of the present applications under

granted interim protection to the petitioners with the following conditions:

(iv) The petitioner should not leave the State without prior permission of the arresting authority;
and AB No. 2 of 2022; 3 of 2022 & 4 of 2022 Page 3
(v) Liberty is given to the police to make any appropriate application for modification/recalling this
order, if the petitioner violates any of the conditions imposed by this Court.
[5] Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned counsel for the petitioners, submits that the petitioners did not
participate in the mob and they are the cousins of the complainant and due to personal enmity, their
names have been included in the complaint. He further submits that the petitioners were not
involved and they were present there to pacify the mob consisting of members of BJP and Congress
on both sides. The 2 (two) FIRs are arising out of the same incident and to be clubbed together.
Hence, only one bail application each is filed against both the FIRs. It is stated that the petitioners
apprehended arrest in connection with the present case and prayed for granting pre-arrest bail and
to undertake that they will comply with all the directions imposed by this Court.
[6] Mr. H. Samarjit, learned PP, submits that the petitioners involved in the mob and bullet injury
was sustained by the son of the complainant. Custodial interrogation of the petitioners is required to
establish the true facts of the case and involvement of other accused persons. It is stated that as per
the medical report issued by RIMS, Hospital, the nature of injury sustained is grievous one caused
by fire weapon. Learned PP prays that the bail application may be rejected for proper and smooth
investigation of the case.
AB No. 2 of 2022; 3 of 2022 & 4 of 2022 Page 4
[7] Considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for
the parties and materials on record.
[8] As reported in the newspaper report, there was a clash
between BJP and Congress workers and son of the complainant got sustained bullet injury. But from
the bail objection report, it is not clear who fired the bullet and who is the owner of the gun. On
perusal of the bail objection report, it is seen that as directed by this Court, the petitioners appeared
before the investigating officer and their statements have been recorded. Nothing specific is
mentioned in the report against the petitioners. Since the petitioners are co-operating with the
investigation and in absence of any concrete material against them at this stage of investigation, this
Court is inclined to allow the bail applications.
[9] Accordingly, the interim bail granted vide order dated 07.03.2022 are made absolute on the
same condition. Bail applications are disposed of accordingly.
[10] Send a copy of this order to the O.C. Heirok PS for information.
