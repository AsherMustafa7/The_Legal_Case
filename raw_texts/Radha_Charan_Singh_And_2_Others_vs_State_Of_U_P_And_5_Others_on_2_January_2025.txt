1. The petitioners have assailed the validity of a notice dated 21.10.2024 issued to them by
respondent no. 3 requiring them to refund excess compensation amount paid to them towards
acquisition of their land. The order recites that they were paid compensation as per report of
Tehsildar, Mawana dated 21.06.2023. It seems that thereafter the private respondent no. 6 made a
complaint and on the said complaint a report from S.D.M. Mawana was called for. He submitted his
report on 07.09.2024 and in which he mentioned that excess payment had been made to the
petitioners.

2. Counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned order is wholly exparte. The petitioners
were not supplied the report of S.D.M. dated 07.09.2024 nor given any opportunity to place their
version on record. Specific assertion in this regard has been made in paragraph-15 of the writ
petition.
3. Sri Rajiv Gupta, learned Additional Chief Standing Counsel concedes that the impugned order
does not reveal that any notice was given to the petitioners or their explanation was sought for. He
suggests that the petitioners may be granted liberty to submit their explanation and the third
respondent be directed to take a fresh decision.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent no. 6 also does not object to the said course being adopted.
5. Since the impugned order is stated to be an exparte order and therefore, we quash the same.
6. The impugned order would be treated to be a show cause notice and the petitioners would submit
reply against the same within three weeks along with true attested copy of the instant order. In case,
the petitioners move any application before respondent no. 3 for being supplied with copy of the
relevant reports, the same shall be provided to them by respondent no. 3 within three days from the
receipt of the application. It shall also be open to the respondent no. 6 to submit his reply/objection
to the representation as may be filed by the petitioners. The respondent no. 3 will thereafter take
final decision in the matter within next eight weeks.
7. The petition stands disposed of accordingly.
