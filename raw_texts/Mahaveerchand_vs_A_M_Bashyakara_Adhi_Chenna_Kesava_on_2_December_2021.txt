COMMON ORDER
(The matter is heard through 'video conferencing/hybrid mode') These Civil Revision Petitions are
filed to set aside the common order and decree dated 25.03.2015 made in I.A.No.18973 of 2010 in
O.S.No.8812 of 2009, I.A.No.12017 of 2014 in O.S.No.8813 of 2009, I.A.No.19034 of 2010 in

Assistant City Civil https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015
Court, Chennai.
2.The facts, issue involved and the respondent in all the Civil Revision Petitions are one and the
same and hence, they are disposed of by this common order. Only the fact in C.R.P.No.3072 of 2015
is extracted hereunder as the facts in all the Civil Revision Petitions are one and the same.
3.The petitioner in all the Civil Revision Petitions are defendants in O.S.Nos.8812 to 8815, 8817,
8819, 8821, 13041, 13039 and 8816 of 2009 respectively. The respondent-temple filed the said suits
for eviction of the petitioners and to surrender the vacant possession of the suit schedule property.
In the said suits, the petitioners filed applications in I.A.No.18973 of 2010, 12017 of 2014, 19034,
19035, 15575, 18972, 15577 & 17214 of 2010, 10559 of 2014 and 16756 of 2010, to reject the plaints.
According to the petitioners, the suit property was originally part of a minor Inam granted in favour
of the respondent-Temple. On abolition of Inam, the property was vested with the Government. As
per Section 13 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 (1) of
the Tamil Nadu Minor Inams (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1963, (hereinafter
referred to as, 'the Act'), every building standing in an inam land becomes property of the person
who is in possession of the property before coming into force of the said Act. As per Section 13 (2) of
the Act, “building” includes the land on which it stands. Hence, the petitioners became absolute
owner of the building as well as land on which the building stood. Hence, the respondent/plaintiff
has no right to seek delivery of possession of suit schedule property. The Settlement Tahsildar
issued joint pattas, recognizing the respondent- Temple as owner of the land and petitioners as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 2
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
owners of the building. Hence, the suits against the co-owners are not maintainable. The order of
Settlement Tahsildar is not final and petitioners can challenge the same in civil proceedings. The
present suits, without declaration of title, are not maintainable. The enhancement of rent claimed as
per the Government Order for the properties of religious institution is not applicable, as petitioners
are not owners of the property. As per G.O.Ms.370, Commercial Taxes and Religious Endowments
Department dated 03.10.1974, grand mother of the petitioners made applications, as she
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 was in continuous
possession of the suit property and only after thorough investigation, she was recognized as owner
of the property. The petitioners are paying all statutory dues and they have been mutated as legal
heirs of their grand mother, the original lessee. The respondent is not entitled to fix different rent
than what is mentioned in the lease deed and rent mentioned in G.O.Ms.No.456, Tamil
Development Culture & Religious Endowment, dated 09.11.2007 is not applicable and it is creating
artificial arrears of rent. The petitioners purchased the property in the year 1936 itself and ground
rent that was agreed to be paid under the lease deed was only a nominal amount payable to the
temple in recognition of its rights as its original Inamdar and subsequently, as a Pattadar for ground
rent. Hence, the respondent-Temple cannot claim any superior title outside the property of Tamil
Nadu Minor Inams (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1963. The petitioners are
co-owners and respondent cannot claim any rent from the co-owners. On these grounds, the
petitioners prayed for rejection of plaints.
4.The respondent-Temple filed separate counter statements, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 denying all the averments and submitted that they
terminated the lease by issue of notice dated 31.03.2008, under Section 106 of Transfer of Property
Act. The petitioners failed to pay revised rent. There is huge arrears of rent payable by the
petitioners. There is cause of action for filing the suits against the petitioners. The respondent made
various averments with regard to proceedings of Settlement Tahsildar and subsequent filing of the
appeals before this Court and submitted that the suit property belongs to the Temple and building
alone belongs to the petitioners and prayed for dismissal of the applications.
5.The learned Judge considering the averments in the affidavits and counter affidavits, dismissed all
the applications, holding that there is cause of action for filing the suits, suits are not barred by law
and claim of the petitioners that they became co-owners or absolute owners is a mixed question of
fact and law and the same can be decided only after full fledged trial.

6.Against the said common order dated 25.03.2015 made in I.A.No.18973 of 2010 in O.S.No.8812 of
2009, I.A.No.12017 of 2014 in O.S.No.8813 of 2009, I.A.No.19034 of 2010 in O.S.No.8814 of 2009,
I.A.No.19035 of 2010 in O.S.No.8815 of 2009, I.A.No.15575 of 2010 in O.S.No.8817 of 2009,
I.A.No.18972 of 2010 in O.S.No.8819 of 2009, I.A.No.15577 of 2010 in O.S.No.8821 of 2009,

I.A.No.16756 of 2010 in O.S.No.8816 of 2009, the petitioners have come out with the present Civil
Revision Petitions.

Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
7.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners reiterated the averments in the affidavits and
grounds raised in the revisions. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners contended that
the averments in the plaints are vague and it is not clear on what basis the respondent is claiming
relief. In view of the same, the petitioners are not in a position to defend the claim made against
them. The respondent has not produced alleged lease deed entered into between them and
Chinnammal, the original lessee. The failure on the part of the respondent
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 to produce the lease
deed is fatal to the claim of the respondent and plaints are liable to be rejected on this ground also.
The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners further submitted that the plaints does not
disclose any cause of action and are barred by law. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
extensively referred to the averments in the plaints and argued that originally, the suit property is
inam land, the proceedings initiated before the Settlement Tahsildhar are subsequent proceedings
and the petitioners are co-owners of the suit property. The petitioners are paying rent and hence,
suits are not maintainable. The respondent had issued notice dated 31.03.2008, after 45 years of
settlement proceedings and they had abandoned and relinquished their rent. The cause of action
mentioned in the plaints is illusory and therefore, the claim of the respondent is barred by
limitation. The learned Judge ought to have seen that if cause of action is illusory, the law of
limitation will consequently apply and there is no need for the Court to re- agitate the issue to be
determined in the suit. The issue of law of limitation also can be decided as per Order VII Rule 11(d)
of C.P.C. Even if quit rent is paid by the petitioners, it will not revive the right of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 respondent and the
same is barred by limitation.
8.In support of his contentions, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, relied on the
following judgments:
(i) (1977) 4 SCC 467 [T.Arivandandam Vs. T.V.Satyapal and another]:
“5.We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the petitioner for the gross
abuse of the process of the court repeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the
statement of the facts found in the judgment of the High Court, it is perfectly plain
that the suit now, pending before the First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant
misuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints. The learned Munsif must
remember that if on a meaningful-not formal-reading of the plaint it is manifestly
vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, be should
exercise his power under Or. VII r. 1 1 C.P.C. taking care to see that the ground
mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever, drafting has created the illusion of a
cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party
searchingly under Order X C.P.C. An activist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law
suits. The trial court should insist imperatively on examining the party at the first
bearing so that bogus litigation can be shot down at the earliest stage. The Penal Code
(Ch. XI) is also resourceful enough to meet such men, and must be triggered
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015
against them. In this case, the learned Judge to his cost realised what George Bernard
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 4
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
Shaw remarked on the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi "It is dangerous to be too
good." ”
(ii) (1985) 4 SCC 10 [State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Ramalinga Samigal Madam]:
“14........ In other words since the Settlement Officer has no power to do what Civil
Court would normally do in a suit it is difficult to imply ouster of Civil Court's
jurisdiction simply because finality has been accorded to the Settlement Officer's
order under s. 64- C of the Act.
15.Counsel for the appellants invited our attention to two decisions of this Court one
in M. Chayana v. K. Narayana,(1) under the Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Estates
(Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 26 of 1948 and the other in O.
Chenchulakshmamma v. D. Subramanya(2) under the Madras Estates (Abolition and
Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 26 of 1948.
It may be stated that both the enactments (the A.P. Act as well as the Madras Act) contain
substantially identical provisions and in particular s. 56 with which the Court was concerned in the
two cases is in identical language. Sub-sec (1) of sec. 56 provides that "whereafter an estate is
notified, a dispute arises as to (a) whether any rent due from a ryot for any Fasli year is in arrear or
(b) what amount of rent is in arrear or (c) who the lawful ryot in respect of any holding is, the
dispute shall be decided by the Settlement Officer".
Sub- sec. (2) provides for an appeal to the tribunal against the decision of the Settlement Officer and
the tribunal's decision in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of
2015 appeal has been rendered final and not liable to be questioned in a Court of law. In both the
cases this Court has taken the view that a dispute between two rival claimants as to who is the lawful
ryot entitled to the patta of the holding in question had been exclusively left to the determination of
the Settlement Officer under that provision and since finality has been accorded to such
determination which is not liable to be called in question in any Court of law the Civil Court's
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such dispute has been excluded. Relying upon these decisions,
counsel for the appellant urged before us that the civil court's jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the
issue of real nature or character of the land should be held to have been excluded under s. 64-C of
the Act which also accords finality to the Settlement Officer's order refusing to grant the ryotwari
patta to a ryot under s. 11 of the Act on the ground that the land in question is not ryoti land. It is not
possible to accept this contention for the two decisions are clearly distinguishable. In the first place
s. 56 with which the Court was concerned in those cases does not contain the words "for the
purposes of the Act" which occur in s. 64-C; and presumably in view of the absence of those words in
the section this Court in M. Chayana's case observed that there was no warrant for taking the view
that the Settlement Officer's decision under s. 56 (1) (c) on the question as to who was the lawful
ryot of holding was only for the purpose of indentifying the person liable to pay the arrear of rent.
Secondly under s. 56 (1)(c) the Settlement Officer is expressly required to make an inquiry into and
decide the question as to who is a lawful ryot of the holding between two rival claimants whereas as
stated earlier there is no express provision https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 5
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 directing an inquiry into the question of the real nature or character of the
land while considering a ryot's application for a patta under s. 11 read with the proviso to s. 3(d). In
other words, the two provisions are dissimilar. Moreover, it may be pointed out that so far as the
Madras Act is concerned by Madras Act 34 of 1958 s. 56 itself has been repealed with effect from
27th December 1958 and s. 9(2) of the repealing Act (No. 34 of 1958) has gone on to provide that all
proceeding pending before the Settlement Officer or Tribunal under that section shall abate. As a
result of such repeal the Madras High Court in two decisions, Krishna Swami Thevar's case(1) and
A.R. Sanjeevi Naicker's(2) case has held that now there is no machinery available under the Madras
Act to have a determination of the dispute between two rival claimants regarding their title as to
who would be entitled to the patta and s. 11 does not contain machinery for deciding disputed
questions of title. Whatever be the position in regard to dispute concerning rival claims or titles, the
ratio of the two decisions of this Court on which counsel placed reliance is inapplicable to the issue
raised in these appeals for our determination.
16.Having regard to the above discussion we confirm the High Court's view that the Civil Court's
jurisdiction to adjudicate on the real nature of the land is not ousted under s. 64-C by reason of the
Settlement Officer's decision to grant or refuse to grant a patta under s. 11 read with the proviso to s.
3(d) of the Act. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed but with no costs.”
(iii) (2004) 3 SCC 137 [Sopan Sukhdeo Sable and others Vs. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 Assistant Charity Commissioner and others]:
“19.Order VI Rule 2(1) of the Code states the basic and cardinal rule of pleadings and
declares that the pleading has to state material facts and not the evidence. It
mandates that every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a
concise form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or
defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved.
20.There is distinction between 'material facts' and 'particulars'. The words 'material
facts' show that the facts necessary to formulate a complete cause of action must be
stated.
Omission of a single material fact leads to an incomplete cause of action and the statement or plaint
becomes bad. The distinction which has been made between 'material facts' and 'particulars' was
brought by Scott, L.J. in Bruce v. Odhams Press Ltd. (1936) 1 KB 697 in the following passage :
“The cardinal provision in Rule 4 is that the statement of claim must state the
material facts. The word "material" means necessary for the purpose of formulating a
complete cause of action; and if any one "material" statement is omitted, the
statement of claim is bad; it is "demurrable" in the old phraseology, and in the new is
liable to be "struck out" under R.S.C. Order XXV, Rule 4 (see Philipps v. Philipps); or
"a further and better statement of claim" may be ordered under Rule 7.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 6
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
The function of "particulars" under Rule 6 is quite different. They are not to be used
in order to fill material gaps in a demurrable statement of claim
- gaps which ought to have been filled by appropriate statements of the various
material facts which together constitute the plaintiff's cause of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015
action. The use of particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate
requirement of pleading, imposed in fairness and justice to the defendant. Their
function is to fill in the picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with information
sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he had to meet
and to enable him to prepare for trial. The dictum of Scott, L.J. in Bruce case (supra)
has been quoted with approval by this Court in Samant N. Balkrishna v. George
Fernandez (1969 (3) SCC 238), and the distinction between "material facts" and
"particulars" was brought out in the following terms:
“The word 'material' shows that the facts necessary to formulate a complete cause of
action must be stated. Omission of a single material fact leads to an incomplete cause
of action and the statement of claim becomes bad. The function of particulars is to
present as full a picture of the cause of action with such further information in detail
as to make the opposite party understand the case he will have to meet.” Rule 11 of
Order VII lays down an independent remedy made available to the defendant to
challenge the maintainability of the suit itself, irrespective of his right to contest the
same on merits. The law ostensibly does not contemplate at any stage when the
objections can be raised, and also does not say in express terms about the filing of a
written statement. Instead, the word 'shall' is used clearly implying thereby that it
casts a duty on the Court to perform its obligations in rejecting the plaint when the
same is hit by any of the infirmities provided in the four clauses of Rule 11, even
without intervention of the defendant. In any event, rejection of the plaint under Rule
11 does not preclude the plaintiffs from presenting a fresh plaint in terms of Rule 13.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015
...............
22.Under Order II Rule 1 of the Code which contains provisions of mandatory nature,
the requirement is that the plaintiffs are duty bound to claim the entire relief. The
suit has to be so framed as to afford ground for final decision upon the subjects in
dispute and to prevent further litigation concerning them. Rule 2 further enjoins on
the plaintiff to include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in
respect of the cause of action. If the plaintiff omits to sue or intentionally relinquishes
any portion of his claim, it is not permissible for him to sue in respect of the portion
so omitted or relinguished afterwards. If the plaintiffs as contended by Mr. Mohta
want to relinquish some reliefs prayer in that regard shall be done before the trial
Court. A reading of the plaint and the reliefs along with the contents of the plaint
goes to show that the main dispute relates to the question of continuance of tenancy
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 7
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
and the period of tenancy. They are in essence unrelated with the other reliefs
regarding enquiry into the affairs of the trust. Such enquiries can only be undertaken
under Section 50 of the Act. For instituting the suit of the nature specified in Section
50, prior consent of the Charity Commissioner is necessary under Section 51. To that
extent Mr. Savant is right that the reliefs relatable to Section 50 would require a prior
consent in terms of Section 51. If the plaintiffs give up those reliefs claimed in
accordance with law, the question would be whether a cause of action for the residual
claims/reliefs warrant continuance of the suit. The nature of the dispute is to be
resolved by the Civil Court. The question of tenancy cannot be decided under Section
50 of the Act. Section https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to
2838 & 3072 of 2015 51 is applicable only to suits which are filed by a person having
interest in the trust. A tenant of the trust does not fall within the category of a person
having an interest in the trust. Except relief in Para D of the plaint, the other reliefs
could be claimed before and can be considered and adjudicated by the Civil Courts
and the bar or impediment in Sections 50 and 51 of the Act will have no relevance or
application to the other reliefs. That being so, Sections 50 and 51 of the Act would not
have any application to that part of the relief which relates to question of tenancy, the
term of tenancy and the period of tenancy. The inevitable conclusion therefore is that
Courts below were not justified in directing rejection of the plaint. However, the
adjudication in the suit would be restricted to the question of tenancy, terms of
tenancy and the period of tenancy only. For the rest of the reliefs, the plaintiffs shall
be permitted within a month from today to make such application as warranted in
law for relinquishing and/or giving up claim for other reliefs.”
(iv) (2012) 8 SCC 706 [Church of Christ Charitable Trust and Educational Charitable
Society Vs. Ponniamman Educational Trust]:
“13. While scrutinizing the plaint averments, it is the bounden duty of the trial Court
to ascertain the materials for cause of action. The cause of action is a bundle of facts
which taken https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072
of 2015 with the law applicable to them gives the plaintiff the right to relief against
the defendant. Every fact which is necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to
get a decree should be set out in clear terms. It is worthwhile to find out the meaning
of the words “cause of action”. A cause of action must include some act done by the
defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue.
14. In A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. A.P. Agencies, Salem (1989) 2 SCC 163,
this Court explained the meaning of “cause of action” as follows:
“12. A cause of action means every fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for
the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the court. In other
words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with the law applicable to them gives the
plaintiff a right to relief against the defendant. It must include some act done by the
defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 8
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
It is not limited to the actual infringement of the right sued on but includes all the
material facts on which it is founded. It does not comprise evidence necessary to
prove such facts, but every fact necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to
obtain a decree. Everything which if not proved would give the defendant a right to
immediate judgment must be part of the cause of action. But it has no relation
whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend
upon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff.”

“23.13.If on a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly
vexatious and without any merit, and does not disclose a right to sue, the court would
be justified in exercising the power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.
...
23.15.The provision of Order VII Rule 11 is mandatory in nature. It states that the
plaint “shall” be rejected if any of the grounds specified in clause (a) to (e) are made
out. If the Court finds that the plaint does not disclose a cause of action, or that the
suit is barred by any law, the Court has no option, but to reject the plaint.
.............
24.2. In T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal & Anr.9 this Court held that while
considering an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC what is required to be
decided is whether the plaint discloses a real cause of action, or something purely
illusory, in the following words : -
“5. …The learned Munsiff must remember that if on a meaningful – not formal –
reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not
disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his power under O. VII, R. 11, C.P.C.
taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever
drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first
hearing …”
25.The Limitation Act, 1963 prescribes a time-limit for the institution of all suits,
appeals, and applications. Section https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 2(j) defines the expression “period of
limitation” to mean the period of limitation prescribed in the Schedule for suits,
appeals or applications. Section 3 lays down that every suit instituted after the
prescribed period, shall be dismissed even though limitation may not have been set
up as a defence. If a suit is not covered by any specific article, then it would fall within

Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
the residuary article.
26.Articles 58 and 59 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act, prescribe the period of
limitation for filing a suit where a declaration is sought, or cancellation of an
instrument, or rescission of a contract, which reads as under :
Description of suit Period of limitation Time from which limitation period begins to
run
58. To obtain any other Three years When the right to sue first declaration. accrues.
59. To cancel or set aside Three years When the facts entitling the an instrument or
decree or plaintiff to have the for the rescission of a instrument or decree contract.
cancelled or set aside or the contract rescinded first become known to him.” The
period of limitation prescribed under Articles 58 and 59 of the 1963 Act is three
years, which commences from the date when the right to sue first accrues.
27.In Khatri Hotels Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India & Anr., this Court held that the
use of the word ‘first’ between the words ‘sue’ and ‘accrued’, would mean that if a suit
is based on multiple causes of action, the period of limitation will begin to run
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 from
the date when the right to sue first accrues. That is, if there are successive violations
of the right, it would not give rise to a fresh cause of action, and the suit will be liable
to be dismissed, if it is beyond the period of limitation counted from the date when
the right to sue first accrued.”
(vi) 2021 SCC Online SC 565 [Srihari Hanumandas Totala Vs. Hemant Vithal Kamat
and others]:
“17.Order 7 Rule 11(d) of CPC provides that the plaint shall be rejected “where the
suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law”. Hence, in
order to decide whether the suit is barred by any law, it is the statement in the plaint
which will have to be construed. The Court while deciding such an application must
have due regard only to the statements in the plaint. Whether the suit is barred by
any law must be determined from the statements in the plaint and it is not open to
decide the issue on the basis of any other material including the written statement in
the case. Before proceeding to refer to precedents on the interpretation of Order 7
Rule 11(d) CPC, we find it imperative to refer to Section 11 of CPC which defines res
judicata:
“11. Res judicata.—No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly
and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit
between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim,
litigating under the same title, in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit or

C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 raised, and has been heard and finally
decided by such Court.””
(viii) Order dated 04.12.2009 made in W.P.No.7649 of 2009 [Arulmighu
Thiruvateeswarar Devasthanam, Triplicane Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu, Land
Administration Department and others]:
“4.(iv).The quit rent register of the petitioner clearly clinches the entire issue, since it
states in unequivocal terms that the patta stands in the name of a private party with
clear description of the property and what is required to be paid is a quit rent which
in Tamil means (kid thp) which can be translated as "land tax amount". Hence the
document of the petitioner itself is the best document to show that the grant is only
for the collection of revenue by way of land tax and nothing more.
...........
12...............
“11.In Ramanatha Aiyar's Law Lexicon, "Quit-Rent" is defined as "A certain small rent, payable by
the tenant in token of subjection, by which the tenant goes quiet and free. (Tomlins Law dictionary);
Chief rent. This is a small yearly payment made by owners of land to a more or less nominal
landlord (2 Blackstone,
42)". There is nothing in Indian Law to show that quit rent is payable only to a melwaramdar by a
kudiwaramdar. The question as to the extent of ownership of the person who pays the quit rent and
of the person who receives the same has to be decided only on the basis of the entire evidence on
record. Hence, that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015
reasoning of the Appellate judge is erroneous."
..........
24............"The appellant Adheenam also recognised such Kudivaram rights owned by the ryots for
over several decades by permitting them to dispose of their ownership in the lands while retaining
its right to collect the beriz or cess amount".”
9.The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent-Temple contended that in an
application under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C., only averments in the plaint and documents filed
along with the plaint can be taken into account to decide whether plaint can be rejected or not. In
the present case, the averments in the plaints and documents filed along with the plaints discloses
cause of action and hence, claim of the respondent is maintainable. In the reply notice dated
30.04.2008, the petitioners have admitted and furnished the details of the lease entered into
between the respondent and Chinnammal, the original lessee and therefore, the contention of the
learned counsel for the petitioners that averments in the plaints are vague and particulars with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 11
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
regard to lease given in the plaints are not correct. The documents filed along with the plaints form
part of the plaints and it has to be read along with the avements in the plaints.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 The present
arguments of the learned counsel for petitioners have no relevance to decide the issue for rejection
of plaints. The same can be raised only in defence, by filing written statement and during trial. The
common order of the learned Judge is valid and there is no reason to interfere with the said order of
the learned Judge. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that the
judgments relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners are not applicable to the
facts of the present case and prayed for dismissal of all the Civil Revision Petitions.
10.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners as well as the learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the respondent-Temple and perused the entire materials available on record.
11.From the materials on record, it is seen that the petitioners are seeking rejection of plaints on two
grounds, under Order VII Rule 11 Clause (a) and (d) of C.P.C., that plaints do not disclose cause of
action and suits are barred by law. When an application for rejection of plaint under Order VII Rule
11 of C.P.C. is filed, only material that can be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830
to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 considered is the averments made in the plaint and documents filed along
with the plaint. The defence taken in the written statement, documents or averments filed in Interim
Applications under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C are not relevant and cannot be considered while
deciding the application to reject the plaint. Considering the averments made in the plaints, it is
seen that the respondent is seeking eviction of petitioners and for delivery of vacant possession. In
the plaints, the respondent has stated how the respondent is entitled to relief sought for in the suits,
how they are owner of the suit property.
12.The respondent has issued notice dated 31.03.2008, as per Section 106 of Transfer of Property
Act, terminating the lease and as mentioned in the said notice, if petitioners fail to vacate and
deliver vacant possession on 01.04.2008, they will be liable to pay damages for use and occupation.
The petitioners sent a reply dated 30.04.2008, through their counsel. In the reply, the petitioners
have admitted that in the year 1936, the respondent-Temple conducted public auction and
auctioned the lease of the land after obtaining permission from the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 Department. One
Chinnammal was successful bidder for house site measuring 534 sq.ft., for a sum of Rs.255/-. The
respondent and said Chinnammal entered into registered lease deed dated 27.03.1936, for 50 years,
with option to renew the lease for further two years of 50 years each. In the said reply notice, the
petitioners have stated that after death of Chinnammal, they have became lessee as legal heirs of
Chinnammal. Further, in the end of the said reply notice, the petitioners have stated that they have
enclosed a cheque bearing No.407110 dated 27.03.2008, drawn on Indian Bank, Theyagarayanagar,
Chennai, for a sum of Rs.744/-, being the rent due and calculated up to 30.06.2008, as per the
terms of lease agreement. Apart from these, the petitioners have raised various objections with
regard to right of the respondent, proceedings of Settlement Tahsildhar, joint patta, etc.,
13.The averments in the plaints and notice dated 31.03.2008 filed along with the plaints and reply
dated 30.04.2008 issued by the petitioners disclose cause of action. Whether the petitioners are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80249076/ 12
Mahaveerchand vs A/M Bashyakara Adhi Chenna Kesava on 2 December, 2021
co-owners or absolute owners of the suit property and whether as per the proceedings of Settlement
Tahsildar, Special Appellate Tribunal and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to
2838 & 3072 of 2015 withdrawal of proceedings in Second Appeal is binding on the petitioners and
whether they can claim ownership of the suit property can be decided only after full fledged trial and
the contentions raised by the petitioner in the present application cannot be considered and decided
in the applications filed under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. The learned Judge has considered all the
materials placed before him, scope of Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C, judgments relied on by the parties
and dismissed all the Interim Applications. In view of the above, the judgments relied on by the
learned counsel appearing for the petitioners do not advance the case of the petitioners. The learned
Judge has considered the entire materials and dismissed all the applications by giving cogent and
valid reason. There is no error or irregularity in the order of the learned Judge, warranting
interference by this Court.
For the above reason, all the Civil Revision Petitions are dismissed. No costs. Consequently,
connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed. It is open to the petitioners to prove their contention
by letting in oral and documentary evidence, without being influenced by the common order
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.(PD).Nos.2830 to 2838 & 3072 of 2015 passed in I.As. as
