mode.
Heard Mr. P.K. Rath, learned counsel for the
petitioner.
The petitioner has filed this writ petition challenging
the award dated 25.02.2020 bearing No.
IO/BHU/A/LI/228/2019-2020 under Annexure-1 passed by
the Insurance Ombudsman and further the petitioner seeks
direction to reject the complaint petition under Annexure-3.
Mr. P.K. Rath, learned counsel for the petitioner
contended that opposite party no.2 was insured by the Life
Insurance Corporation, India under the Policy of 'Jeevan
Saral' being Policy No.588648201, which is a high risk plan.
The feature of the said policy covers maturity benefit as well
as death benefit. Accordingly, the petitioner has paid
insurance premium for a period of ten years and after
maturity he got maturity benefit of Rs.41,602/- (including
Maturity Sum Assured + Loyalty Addition). Subsequently,
opposite party no.2 sought refund of the premium amount
which is not permissible. But, the Insurance Ombudsman for
the State of Odisha vide order dated 25.02.2020 under
Annexure-1 passed the award directing the insurer to refund
all the premium received by it against the subject policy with
interest by deducting the amount already paid as maturity
benefit. It is contended that Insurance Ombudsman for the
State of Odisha has acted beyond his jurisdiction, which is
contrary to the provisions contained in Rule-13 of the
Insurance Ombudsman Rules, 2017. To substantiate his
contentions, he has relied upon Industrial Promotion and
Investment Corporation of Orissa Limited v. New India
Assurance Company Limited, (2016) 15 SCC 315.
In the opinion of this Court, the matter requires
consideration.
Issue notice to the opposite parties by Registered
Post with A.D. fixing a short returnable date, requisites for
which shall be filed within three days.
As an interim measure, it is directed that the order
dated 25.02.2020 passed by opposite party no.1- Insurance
Ombudsman for the State of Odisha in Annexure-1 shall
remain stayed till 08.02.2021.
