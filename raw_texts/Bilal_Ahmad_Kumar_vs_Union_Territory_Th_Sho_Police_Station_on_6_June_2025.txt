JUDGMENT
Sanjay Parihar-(J)
1. Aforesaid appeals arise out of common order of rejection of bail dated 11.11.2024 passed by
Special Judge (UAPA) Anantnag in case FIR No. 20/2021 under Section 7/25 Arms Act, 3/4
Explosive Substances Act, 18, 20, 23, 39 of UA(P) Act of PS Bijbehara which is assailed on the
ground that both the appellants are facing trial for over more than four years and the order of
rejection of bail has been passed without appreciating the facts and circumstances of the case. Trial
Court has presumed them guilty and rejected their bail application when there was no material to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199183420/ 1
Bilal Ahmad Kumar vs Union Territory Th. Sho Police Station ... on 6 June, 2025
lay presumption against appellants. That the impugned order is against due process of law as
_________________________________________________________ CrlA(D)
78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 1 prosecution story itself being prima facie weak and there
is not even remote connection of the appellants having been involved in the commission of aforesaid
offences. That the case was based on hearsay and evidence is wholly inadmissible under law, so
available material cannot satisfy the requirement of Section 43-D of the UAPA, on that ground alone
the application deserved to be admitted. That the appellants have been in custody for long who are
presumed to be innocent until proved guilty.
2. Respondents were notified of the filing of the appeals who have appeared and filed their response
supporting the order drawn by the trial court. It is argued by the respondents that the order drawn
by the trial court is reasoned one because the petitioners are involved in offences carrying
punishment for imprisonment of life and there is cogent and reliable evidence against them which
directly connects them with the commission of the offence. That the nature of the accusations is
grave and the appellants are a threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the nation. In case the
appellants are released on bail that may hamper the further recording of the prosecution evidence.
That the trial court has dismissed the bail application after due appreciation of law.
3. The brief facts giving rise to the aforesaid appeals happen to be that it was on 30.01.2021 PS
Bijbehara received information, when a police escort along with army were performing naka
checking at Green Tunnel near Doonipora Sangam, they intercepted an Alto Car bearing
Registration No. HP12C/0961. On being asked to halt, the occupants of the car tried to escape but
were overpowered. During questioning they disclosed their particulars as Imran Ahmad Hajam and
Irfan Ahmad Ahanger and during search of the vehicle 02 pistols, 13 pistol magazines, 116 live pistol
rounds were recovered which led to registration of FIR No. 20/2021 under Section 7/25 Arms Act
20/30 UA(P). During questioning, they were found to be active recruits of banned terrorist
organization JeM. On the disclosure of Imran Ahmad Hajam identity of various other active
members surfaced who were receiving arms and ammunition from JeM terrorist Hidayat-ullah
Malik for carrying subversive activities in order to boost militancy. Further, on their questioning,
involvement of appellants Bilal Ahmad Kumar and Tawfeeq Ahmad Laway
_________________________________________________________ CrlA(D)
78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 2 also surfaced whereupon from the possession of former
one hand grenade was recovered and from that of later, one kilogram of explosive material came to
be recovered who too were booked.
4. From the evidence collected and the statements of the witnesses, as many as six accused including
the appellants were found involved in hatching criminal conspiracy against the sovereignty of India
and based upon evidence, were found to be involved in militant activities carrying explosive
substances for committing a terrorist act. Appellants, therefore, have been charged under Sections
18, 23, 39 UA(P) and 7/25 Arms Act and so they are under trial.
5.Counsel for appellants argued that accused have been in custody since January, 2021 and only 11
witnesses stood examined so far and the way the trial is proceeding, there is no immediate prospect
of trial concluding in the near future, so the appellants deserve to be admitted to bail pending trial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199183420/ 2
Bilal Ahmad Kumar vs Union Territory Th. Sho Police Station ... on 6 June, 2025
as delay in trial defeats their right of speedy trial. It is further submitted that custody of the
appellants is based on the alleged disclosure statement of the co-accused and there is no other
material or any evidence having come forth during the recording of the evidence against him,
therefore, the Trial Court was not right in applying Section 43-D.
5. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent urged that the appellants were found in possession
of explosive substance and given the mandate of Section 23, their act is punishable with
imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine. That the appellants were found associated with
militants namely Aftab Ahmad Wani, Rayees Ahmad Bhat who both were killed in an encounter in
the year 2021, thus, the appellants were the persons who were aiding the terrorists. It is argued that
appellants are a threat to society at large, whose admission on bail would not only derail trial but
even left over witnesses might not be able to come forward for deposition.
6. We have heard both the counsels and gone through the record of the trial court.
7. At the very outset, from the possession of appellant explosive substance has been recovered which
is in the nature of hand grenade and other explosive substances. They have been accused of offence
under Sections 18, 23, 38 UA(P) and 7/25 Arms Act read with 3/4 Explosive Substances Act.
_________________________________________________________ CrlA(D)
78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 3 Whereas, offences under Sections 18, 23, 38 UA(P) Act
carry punishment which may extend to imprisonment for life and fall under Chapter IV and VI of
the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (hereafter called as Act). In terms of Section 43-D (5) no
person accused of an offence punishable under Chapter IV and VI, shall be released on bail if, court
is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against such
persons are prima facie true. The main limb of the appellant's claim is that they have been roped in
on the disclosure statement of co-accused, therefore, the recovery effected from them is untenable.
Such an argument cannot hold good for the reasons that at the stage of grant or refusal of bail, the
merits of the prosecution case are not to be touched. Having said so and given the nature of
explosives recovered and their association with various other persons who were found to be active
militants and a few of them were killed in encounter in the year 2021, such allegations, therefore,
describe the appellants acting as foot soldiers for transit and carrying of arms and explosive
substances which in fact were later on used by the active militants to indulge in subversive activities.
8. In "National Investigating Agency v/s Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watalli (2019) 5 SCC", in a case under
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that:
"23. By virtue of the proviso to subsection (5), it is the duty of the Court to be satisfied
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the
accused is prima facie true or otherwise.
By its very nature, the expression "prima facie true" would mean that the
materials/evidence collated by the Investigating Agency in reference to the
accusation against the concerned accused in the first information report, must prevail
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199183420/ 3
Bilal Ahmad Kumar vs Union Territory Th. Sho Police Station ... on 6 June, 2025
until contradicted and overcome or disproved by other evidence, and on the face of it,
shows the complicity of such accused in the commission of the stated offence. It must
be good and sufficient on its face to establish a given fact or the chain of facts
constituting the stated offence, unless rebutted or contradicted. In one sense, the
degree of satisfaction is lighter when the Court has to opine that the accusation is
"prima facie true", as compared to the opinion of accused "not guilty" of such offence
as required under the other special enactments. In any case, the degree of
_________________________________________________________
CrlA(D) 78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 4 satisfaction to be recorded by the
Court for opining that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation
against the accused is prima facie true, is lighter than the degree of satisfaction to be
recorded for considering a discharge application or framing of charges in relation to
offences under the 1967 Act.
A priori, the exercise to be undertaken by the Court at this stage of giving reasons for
grant or non-grant of bail is markedly different from discussing merits or demerits of
the evidence. The elaborate examination or dissection of the evidence is not required
to be done at this stage. The Court is merely expected to record a finding on the basis
of broad (2005) 2 SCC 13 (1962) 3 SCR 622 (1978) 1 SCC 118 probabilities regarding
the involvement of the accused in the commission of the stated offence or otherwise.
For that, the totality of the material gathered by the Investigating Agency and
presented along with the report and including the case diary, is required to be
reckoned and not by analyzing individual pieces of evidence or circumstance. In any
case, the question of discarding the document at this stage, on the ground of being
inadmissible in evidence, is not permissible. For, the issue of admissibility of the
document/evidence would be a matter for trial. The Court must look at the contents
of the document and take such document into account as it is.
The question is whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the
accusations made against the respondent (Accused No.10) are prima facie true. That
will have to be answered keeping in mind the totality of materials including the one
presented along with the police report. Be it noted that the prosecution is relying on
several documents forming part of the first charge-sheet (pending further
investigation) filed against the respondent (Accused No.10) allegedly showing his
involvement in the commission of the stated offences.
The fact that there is a high burden on the accused in terms of the special provisions
contained in Section 43D (5) to demonstrate that the prosecution has not been able
to show that there exists reasonable grounds to show that the accusation against him
is prima facie true, does not alter the legal position expounded in K. Veeraswami
(supra), to the effect that the charge sheet need not contain detailed analysis of the
evidence. It is for the Court considering the application for bail to assess the
material/evidence presented by the Investigating Agency along with the report under

9. In Union of India vs. K.A. Najeeb Criminal Appeal No. 98 of 2021 decided on 01.02.2021" the
respondent was facing prosecution for offence under Section 16, 18, 18-B, 19 and 20 of the UA(P)
Act and had been in jail for over five years wherein during trial several witnesses were yet to be
examined. In that case some of co-accused had already been convicted whereas respondent was
being tried by way of supplementary charge-sheet wherein the co-accused had been sentenced to
eight years' rigorous imprisonment. The Hon'ble Apex Court found that having regard to the
peculiar facts, it was legitimately expected that if the respondent is held guilty, he would receive the
same sentence which the co-accused had been awarded and given that two-third of the incarceration
had already been completed in that background, the bail order was not interfered by the Hon'ble
Apex Court. It held that:
18. It is thus clear to us that the presence of statutory restrictions like Section 43D (5)
of UAPA perse does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on
grounds of violation of Part III of the Constitution. Indeed, both the restrictions
under a Statue as well as the powers exercisable under Constitutional Jurisdiction
can be well harmonized. Whereas at commencement of proceedings, Courts are
expected to appreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigors of such
provisions will melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within
a reasonable time and the period of incarceration already undergone has exceeded a
substantial part of the prescribed sentence. Such an approach would safeguard
against the possibility of provisions like Section 43D (5) of UAPA being used as the
sole metric for denial of bail or for wholesale breach of constitutional right to speedy
trial.
19. Adverting to the case at hand, we are conscious of the fact that the charges
levelled against the respondent are grave and a serious threat to societal harmony.
Had it been a case at the threshold, we would have outrightly turned down the
respondent's prayer. However, keeping in mind the length of the period spent by him
in custody and the unlikelihood of the trial being completed anytime soon, the High

_________________________________________________________
CrlA(D) 78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 6 other option except to grant bail.
An attempt has been made to strike a balance between the appellant's right to lead
evidence of its choice and establish the charges beyond any doubt and simultaneously
the respondent's rights guaranteed under Part III of our Constitution have been well
protected.

10. In "Gurinder Singh vs. State of Punjab and Another 2024 live law (SC) 100" the accused was
facing trial for offence under Sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act read
with Section 25 Arms Act. In that case also, the recovery was affected from the petitioner on the
strength of disclosure statement made by the co-accused. It was the case of the appellant therein
that in terror funding charge the name of the appellant does not find place. Again, it was argued that
given the large list of witnesses, the trial is likely to take certain time. Apex court denying the
concession of bail and distinguishing K.A. Najeeb's case held as under, "32. The Appellant's counsel
has relied upon the case of KA Najeeb (supra) to back its contention that the appellant has been in
jail for last five years which is contrary to law laid down in the said case. While this argument may
appear compelling at first glance, it lacks depth and substance. In KA Najeeb's case this court was
confronted with a circumstance wherein except the respondent-accused, other co-accused had
already undergone trial and were sentenced to imprisonment of not exceeding eight years therefore
this court's decision to consider bail was grounded in the anticipation of the impending sentence
that the respondent- accused might face upon conviction and since the respondent-accused had
already served portion of the maximum imprisonment i.e., more than five years, this court took it as
a factor influencing its assessment to grant bail. Further, in KA Najeeb's case the trial of the
respondent-accused was severed from the other co-accused owing to his absconding and he was
traced back in 2015 and was being separately tried thereafter and the NIA had filed a long list of
witnesses that were left to be examined with reference to the said accused therefore this court was of
the view of unlikelihood of completion of trial in near future. However, in the present case the trial
is already under way and 22 witnesses including the protected witnesses have been examined. As
already discussed, the material available on record indicates the involvement of the appellant in
furtherance of terrorist activities backed by members of banned terrorist
_________________________________________________________ CrlA(D)
78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 7 organization involving exchange of large quantum of
money through different channels which needs to be deciphered and therefore in such a scenario if
the appellant is released on bail there is every likelihood that he will influence the key witnesses of
the case which might hamper the process of justice. Therefore, mere delay in trial pertaining to
grave offences as one involved in the instant case cannot be used as a ground to grant bail. Hence,
the aforesaid argument on the behalf the appellant cannot be accepted."
11. In "Thwaha Fasal and Ors vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors Criminal Appeal No's 1302 of 2021
and 1303 of 2021 decided on 28.10.2021 it was held, "17. The stringent conditions for grant of bail in
sub-section (5) of Section 43D will apply only to the offences punishable only under Chapters IV and
VI of the 1967 Act. The offence punishable under Section 13 being a part of Chapter III will not be
covered by sub-section (5) of Section 43D and therefore, it will be governed by the normal
provisions for grant of bail under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The proviso imposes
embargo on grant of bail to the accused against whom any of the offences under Chapter IV and VI
have been alleged. The embargo will apply when after perusing charge sheet, the Court is of the
opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is
prima facie true. Thus, if after perusing the charge sheet, if the Court is unable to draw such a prima
facie conclusion, the embargo created by the proviso will not apply."

18. In the case of Watali (supra), this Court has extensively dealt with sub-section (5) of Section 43D
of the 1967 Act and has also laid down the guidelines for dealing with bail petitions to which sub-
section (5) of Section 43D is applicable. In paragraph 23, this Court considered the difference in the
language used by Section 37 of the NDPS Act governing grant of bail and sub-section (5) of Section
43D of the 1967 Act. Paragraph 23 of the said decision reads thus:-
"23. By virtue of the proviso to sub-section (5), it is the duty of the Court to be
satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against
the accused is prima facie true or otherwise. Our attention was invited to the
decisions of this Court, which has had an occasion to deal with similar special
provisions in TADA and MCOCA. The principle underlying those decisions may have
some bearing while considering the prayer for bail in relation to the offences under
the 1967 Act as well. Notably, under the special enactments such as TADA, MCOCA
_________________________________________________________
CrlA(D) 78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 8 and the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the Court is required to record its opinion that
there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is "not guilty"
of the alleged offence. There is a degree of difference between the satisfaction to be recorded by the
Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is "not guilty" of such offence
and the satisfaction to be recorded for the purposes of the 1967 Act that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is "prima facie" true. By its very
nature, the expression "prima facie true" would mean that the materials/evidence collated by the
investigating agency in reference to the accusation against the accused concerned in the first
information report, must prevail until contradicted and overcome or disproved by other evidence,
and on the face of it, shows the complicity of such accused in the commission of the stated offence. It
must be good and sufficient on its face to establish a given fact or the chain of facts constituting the
stated offence, unless rebutted or contradicted. In one sense, the degree of satisfaction is lighter
when the Court has to opine that the accusation is "prima facie true", as compared to the opinion of
the accused "not guilty" of such offence as required under the other special enactments. In any case,
the degree of satisfaction to be recorded by the Court for opining that there are reasonable grounds
for believing that the accusation against the accused is prima facie true, is lighter than the degree of
satisfaction to be recorded for considering a discharge application or framing of charges in relation
to offences under the 1967 Act."
12. Review of the law laid down in aforesaid cases goes on to describe, that for offences falling under
Chapter IV and VI of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the restrictions imposed under
Section 43-D (5) are in addition to the restrictions imposed under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
So, what Section 43-D speaks of is that it modifies the application of general provisions of bail in
respect of the offences punishable under Chapter IV and VI of the Act.
13. The aforesaid law further holds, that the words "prima facie true" on the face of it, mean that the
material must show the complicity of the accused in the commission of the offence i.e. the
material/evidence must be good and sufficient to establish the given fact or chain of facts
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199183420/ 7
Bilal Ahmad Kumar vs Union Territory Th. Sho Police Station ... on 6 June, 2025
constituting the stated offence, unless rebutted or contradicted by other evidence. The exercise to be
undertaken at the stage of grant or refusal of the bail is merely different because the Court cannot
elaborate into examination or dissection of the evidence, rather the Court is expected to record the
f i n d i n g o n t h e b a s i s o f
_________________________________________________________ CrlA(D)
78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 9 broad probabilities regarding the involvement of the
accused in the commission of the stated offences or otherwise.
14. In the instant case, the appellants have already undergone more than four years of custody
whereas, trial is underway and eleven witnesses have been examined. The offences for which
appellants are being tried carry imprisonment extending up to life and for some, the imprisonment
is for ten years, so by applying K.A. Najeeb's case still the appellants are short of having completed
five years of trial, so the bail on such ground cannot be asked for as a matter of right.
15. As held in Gurinder's case "supra", what Section 43D (5) proposes to ensure is "accused person
shall not be released on bail" which means the 'principle of bail not jail' would not be applicable in
cases of the nature alleged against the appellant. Therefore, the conventional idea in bail
jurisprudence vis-a-vis ordinary penal offences does not find any place while dealing with UA(P) Act
cases. The exercise of general principle to grant bail in such offences is severely restrictive in scope.
Relying on "Peerzada Shah Fahad vs. UT of J&K (2023) SCC Online 954" it was argued that
appellants deserve to be granted concession of bail.
Reliance on this case is utterly misplaced for the reasons that in said case the coordinate bench was
of the view that, at the most, the appellant is prima facie found to have committed offence under
Section 13 and not under Section 18, in that background, the accused was bailed out.
16. We on going through the record of the trial court find that explosive substance in the nature of
hand grenade/explosive material stood recovered from the possession of the accused so much so
there are also accusations that the appellants were part of a module that included active militants as
well (Aijaz Ahmad Wani, Rayees Ahmad Bhat) who were killed in an encounter in the year 2021. The
factum of recovery of explosive substance from the possession of the appellants gave rise to
commission of offences under Section 23 (enhanced penalties) coupled with Section 18 which
provides that 'whosoever conspires to commit a terrorist act or any act preparatory to the
commission of the terrorist act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be

_________________________________________________________ CrlA(D)
78/2024 c/w CrlA(D) 77/2024 Page No: 10 imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine'.
Similarly, offence under Section 39 also relates to support given to terrorist organization. So, on the
face of such a material shows complicity of the accused in commission of offence. In addition, the
case of the appellants is also to be examined from another perspective. What the provisions of
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 relate to is to curb terrorist activities and make stringent
laws to ensure there is zero tolerance of such acts. This is because what such activity intends to
achieve is to bring insecurity amongst general public who feel terrorized so they can follow the
dictates of such organisation whose sole objective is to harm national interest and undermine the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199183420/ 8
Bilal Ahmad Kumar vs Union Territory Th. Sho Police Station ... on 6 June, 2025
sovereignty and integrity of the nation. Here comes the duty of the Court to ensure that while
balancing the rights of an under-trial on the touchstone of liberty, one must not lose sight of the fact
that nothing is above the sovereignty and integrity of the nation besides peace and tranquility to
public at large.
17. When examined in that perspective, the offences committed by the appellants cannot be
regarded as run of the mill, but the one that are exceptional in nature. Once the charges have been
framed and the matter is pending trial, that itself assumes a strong suspicion that the material
before the Court has prompted it to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual
ingredients constituting the offence alleged against the appellants. Whereas the appellants have not
been able to show us any material to warrant a view that the participation of the appellant in
commission of offence is meek or hearsay, rather on going through the record of the trial court we
lean in favour of drawing the inference that on broader probabilities the involvement of the
appellant in the commission of the stated offence has been disclosed and the trial court has rightly
not released the appellants on bail. The totality of the material available before the trial court that
led it to draw charge and put the appellants to trial and so much so more than eleven witnesses
stood examined, it cannot be stated that the trial of the appellants is proceeding at a snail's pace.
18. As discussed above, the material available on record indicates the involvement of the appellants
in furtherance of terrorist activities backed by members of terrorist organization that is why two of

investigation, so mere delay in trial that too pertaining to grave offences as the one involved cannot
be urged as a ground for granting of bail. At the cost of repetition, the appellants have not been able
to persuade us to take a contrary view than the one taken by the trial court. We neither find any kind
of perversity in the order impugned nor any mitigating factor to warrant a view of granting bail to
the appellants. Consequently, the appeals lack merits are therefore, dismissed leaving appellants
free to take chance afresh before the trial court, if advised so.
19. Disposed of. Record be returned.
