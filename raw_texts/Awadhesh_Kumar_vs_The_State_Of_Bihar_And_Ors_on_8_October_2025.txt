Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
Government of Bihar whereby as a result of lack of available
post, the prayer of the petitioner for absorption/regularisation of
Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025
2/18
his service on the post of Electrician was rejected. It has been
prayed that the respondents be directed to absorb/regularise the
service of the petitioner on the post of Electrician w.e.f.
30.11.2006
and to give benefit of Assured Career Progression (ACP) scheme to the petitioner as has been given
to similarly situated persons including those junior to him.
3. The case of the petitioner in brief is that he was appointed on 1.6.1980 as a daily wage worker in
the PHED on the post of Pump Operator. By order dated 14.3.1988, he was absorbed under the work
charge establishment w.e.f. 13.1.1988. Pursuant to the decision taken by the Establishment
Committee in its meeting held on 17.12.1996, the petitioner was appointed as Electrician and posted
in the Public Health Mechanical Sub Division, Pupri in the district of Sitamarhi.
4. It is further case of the petitioner that he was served with a show cause notice dated 13.4.2002
asking him as to why he not be reverted back as a daily wage worker from work charge
establishment. The petitioner moved the Patna High Court against the said notice in CWJC no.6370
of 2002 wherein this Court was pleased to pass an interim order dated 22.5.2002 directing the
respondents to file their counter affidavit and further ordered that in the meantime, no coercive
action Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 shall be taken against the
petitioner.
5. It is further case of the petitioner that inspite of the interim order of this Court dated 22.5.2002,
the respondents came out with an order dated 22.8.2002 reverting the petitioner as daily wage
worker w.e.f. 1.6.2002.
6. It is the case of the petitioner that in response to a letter from the department, the Executive
Engineer, Public Health Mechanical Division, Muzaffarpur furnished details of altogether 130
persons, the list having been brought on record as Annexure-6 to the writ application. While the
name of the petitioner figures at Sl. no.45, the name of Hari Kumar Patel is at Sl. no.66.
7. By order dated 30.11.2006, issued under the signature of the Executive Engineer, PHED,
Muzaffarpur, the petitioner was absorbed/regularised on the post of Pump Operator in the pay scale
of Rs.2,650-4,000, however, a perusal of the said letter would show that it was specifically
mentioned therein that the petitioner would continue to perform his work which he had been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48555551/ 2
Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
performing till then.
8. It is the case of the petitioner that he had been performing the work of an Electrician and thus
having wrongly been regularised on the post of Pump Operator, the petitioner Patna High Court
CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 moved this Court in CWJC no.6004 of 2007 which was
disposed of by order dated 20.12.2011 directing the Chief Engineer, PHED, Patna to consider the
case of the petitioner in light of the submission made by the learned Additional Advocate General-II
before the Division Bench on 10.5.2006. Pursuant to the aforesaid direction of this Court contained
in order dated 20.12.2011, the respondents considered the case of the petitioner and by the
impugned order dated 8.10.2012 rejected the prayer of the petitioner for his absorption on the post
of Electrician for the reason of non-availability of post. It is against this order that the instant writ
application has been preferred.
9. It is submitted by learned counsel appearing for the petitioner that ever since his appointment in
the year 1980, the petitioner has been performing the duty of an Electrician which would also be
evident from the order dated 31.12.1996 taken out pursuant to the meeting of the Establishment
Committee held on 17.12.1996. It is further submitted that though the respondents came out with an
order dated 13.4.2002 asking the petitioner to show cause as to why he be not reverted back from
work charge establishment to daily wage, however, by order dated 22.5.2002 (in CWJC no.6370 of
2002) itself, this Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 Court granted interim
relief in the petitioner's favour directing that no coercive action shall be taken against him. Further,
referring to the order dated 30.11.2006, it is submitted that though the petitioner was shown to have
been absorbed on the post of Pump Operator, however, taking into consideration that all along the
petitioner has been working as an Electrician, it was specifically mentioned therein that the
petitioner would continue to discharge work as before ie that of an Electrician.
10. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that on the petitioner challenging his order of
absorption on the post of Pump Operator, in CWJC no.6004 of 2007, this Court was also of the
opinion that the case of the petitioner for regularisation was required to be considered in light of the
submission made by the learned Additional Advocate General-II before the Division Bench on
10.5.2006 and it is for this reason that the matter was sent for consideration by the respondents.
Learned counsel submits that the respondents have erred in rejecting the case of the petitioner for
his absorption on the post of Electrician in view of the fact that from the list of employees enclosed
as Annexure-6 to the writ application, there remains no doubt that the petitioner happens to be
senior to Hari Kumar Patel and it is the petitioner who should have been absorbed Patna High Court
CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 prior to him. It is thus submitted that the order impugned
be set aside and the reliefs prayed for in the instant application be granted.
11. The application is opposed by learned Additional Advocate General-3 appearing for the State of
Bihar. It is submitted that from the records of the case, there remains no doubt that the petitioner
was appointed on daily wage and was taken in the work charge establishment as Pump Khalasi by
order dated 14.3.1988. The petitioner was regularised/absorbed as a Pump Operator vide order
dated 30.11.2006. With respect to the direction of this Court contained in the order dated 20.12.2011
passed in CWJC no.6004 of 2007 that the case of the petitioner be considered in light of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48555551/ 3
Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
submission made by the learned Additional Advocate General-II before the Division Bench on
10.5.2006, it is submitted by learned Additional Advocate General that a perusal of paragraph no.8
of the judgment in the case of Ram Tapeshwar Sah vs. State of Bihar; 2010 (3) PLJR 459 would
clearly show that the Government had taken a policy decision on 16.3.2006 and even paragraph no.
8(c) on which great stress has been laid by learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, learned
Additional Advocate General submits that the same also refers to persons fulfilling Patna High
Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 the criteria as per the Government's policy decision
dated 16.3.2006. The so called submission of the then learned Additional Advocate General-II as
recorded in paragraph no.8(c) of Ram Tapeshwar Sah (supra) that the inter se seniority will be fixed
on the basis of the initial entry in the work or service clearly being in teeth of the Government's
policy decision dated 16.3.2006 can in no way be binding on the State Government. It is thus
submitted that the order impugned having been passed after considering the case of the petitioner,
there is no error nor any illegality in the same and thus the instant application be dismissed.
12. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.
13. The relevant facts in brief are that the petitioner was appointed on daily wage on the post of
Pump Khalasi in the PHED on 1.6.1980. By order dated 14.3.1988, he was absorbed under the work
charge establishment on the post of Pump Khalasi w.e.f. 13.1.1988. Pursuant to the meeting of the
Establishment Committee held on 17.12.1996 and also in view of the contents of the letter no.5548
dated 20.10.1995 of the Finance Department, in view of the Pump Khalasi having I.T.I. (2 years)
Electrical trade together with the work experience, by Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013
dt.08-10-2025 order dated 31.12.1996 they were appointed on the sanctioned post of Electrician in
the scale of Rs.1200-30-1800. The petitioner who was described as a Pump Khalasi, PHED,
Muzaffarpur, was appointed as Electrician and posted at Pupri.
14. It subsequently transpires that on 13.4.2002, the respondents wrote a letter to the petitioner
asking the petitioner to reply as to why he be not reverted back from the work charge establishment
to daily wage. The petitioner moved this Court in CWJC no.6370 of 2002 wherein by order dated
22.5.2002 while directing the respondents to file counter affidavit, this Court ordered that in the
meantime, no coercive action shall be taken against the petitioner pursuant to the said show cause
notice.
15. The Executive Engineer, PHED, Muzaffarpur thereafter came out with an order dated
30.11.2006 absorbing the petitioner on the post of Pump Operator in the pay scale of
Rs.2,650-4,000. A perusal of the said order, brought on record as Annexure-7 to the writ
application, would show that the same clearly stated that the petitioner would continue to do the job
as he has been doing. It is the categorical case of the petitioner that since the very beginning the
petitioner had been doing the job of an Electrician and it is for this reason that pursuant to the
decision of the Establishment Committee that the respondents Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of
2013 dt.08-10-2025 had come out with an order as far back as on 31.12.1996 appointing the
petitioner on the post of an Electrician.

Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
16. The petitioner being affected by the action of the respondents regularising him on the post of
Pump Operator moved this Court in CWJC no.6004 of 2007 which was disposed of by the learned
Single Judge by order dated 20.12.2011 in the following terms:
"6. Having heard counsel for the petitioner and the State, I am of the view that the
case of the petitioner for regularization is required to be considered in the light of the
submission made by the learned Additional Advocate General No.-II before the
Division Bench on 10.5.2006 incorporated in paragraph 8 of the order dated
13.7.2006, Annexure-13 and appropriate order be passed by Respondent no.3
considering the policy decision of the State Government dated 16.3.2006 in
accordance with law, as early as possible, in any case within the same time, which has
been granted under order dated 2.12.2011 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 12230 of 2010.
7. In the light of the interim order dated 22.5.2002, Annexure-6 passed in the case of
the petitioner, petitioner shall be entitled for arrears of difference of salary of the post
of Electrician and the lower post for which he was paid during the period interim
order dated 22.5.2002 remained under operation within the same time, provided the
same has been paid to other similarly situate employees in whose case also similar
interim order was passed.
8. The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of."
Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025
17. In view of the above, the petitioner filed a representation before the respondents which came to
be decided by the Principal Secretary by the order impugned dated 8.10.2012.
18. It would be relevant to state here that great stress has been laid by learned counsel for the
petitioner on the judgment in the case of Ram Tapeshwar Sah vs. State of Bihar; 2010 (3) PLJR 459.
It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that paragraph 8(c) of the judgment clearly
spells out the submission of the learned Additional Advocate General-II made before the Division
Bench hearing the said batch of cases that the inter se seniority will be fixed on the post of the initial
entry in the work or service. It is thus submitted that while the petitioner entered his service on
1.6.1980, he was senior to Hari Kumar Patel whose date of entry in service is 1.1.1981 and thus the
petitioner should have been regularised as an Electrician prior to Hari Kumar Patel.
19. Before this Court deals with the above contention made on behalf of the petitioner, it would be
relevant to note that in the judgment of Ram Tapeshwar Sah (supra), this Court was dealing with a
batch of writ applications wherein the petitioners had challenged the legality and validity of the
Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 orders of the State of Bihar (PHED)
issued vide memo no.2322 dated 13.4.2002 directing the petitioners to show cause as to why their
appointments in the work charge establishment be not reverted back to daily wage as the same was
found to be illegal in view of the resolution of the Finance Department contained in memo no.6394
dated 23.10.1987. The writ application (CWJC no.6370 of 2002) filed by the petitioner was one of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48555551/ 5
Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
the applications in the batch of cases. In paragraph no.8 of the judgment in the case of Ram
Tapeshwar Sah (supra), this Court observed as follows:
"8. A reply to the counter affidavit has also been filed, but when the matter was finally
heard on 10.5.2006, learned Additional Advocate General-ll, on behalf of the
respondent-State Government made the following submissions:-
(a) The Government has taken a policy decision dated 16.3.2006 that any employee
of Class-IV having been appointed and having completed 240 days working as a daily
wager prior to 11th December, 1990 shall be entitled to be considered for
regularisation in the Public Health Engineering Department.
(b) The work charge employees of Class-III and IV who have been reverted to the status of daily
wager will be also entitled to be considered for the purpose of benefit of the said decision for
regularisation.
(c) The case of the petitioners who are fulfilling the eligibility criteria as per the aforesaid policy will
be considered and finalised on or before 30th September, 2006 and the inter se seniority will be
fixed on the basis Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 of the initial entry in the
work or service."
20. A perusal of paragraph no.8, quoted herein above, would show that the Additional Advocate
General-II appearing on behalf of the State Government in the said case mentions about a policy
decision dated 16.3.2006 having been taken by the Government with respect to regularisation of
daily wage Class IV employees. In paragraph no.8(c), the Court further notes the submission of the
learned Additional Advocate General to the effect that the case of the petitioner who are fulfilling the
eligibility criteria as per the aforesaid policy (of the date 16.3.2006) will be considered and finalised
on or before 30.9.2006 and the inter se seniority will be fixed on the basis of the initial entry in the
work or service.
21. Learned Additional Advocate General-3 submits that a copy of the Government policy dated
16.3.2006 has been brought on record in the instant application as Annexure-R/1 to the
supplementary counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos.1 to 5. A perusal of the
contents of the said resolution/policy and specially Clause 3(i) thereof would show that the inter se
seniority of the daily wage employees was to be fixed in the seniority list as per their age. It is thus
submitted that though not admitting, even if it is taken for the sake of argument that a submission
was made by the then Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 Additional
Advocate General-II as recorded in paragraph no.8(c) of the judgment reproduced herein above,
nevertheless the same being contrary to the resolution/policy decision of the Government dated
16.3.2006, it would not be binding on the State Government. This Court finds substance and merit
in the submissions made by learned Additional Advocate General-3.
22. It would be relevant to refer to the judgment in the case of Himalayan Cooperative Group
Housing Society v. Balwan Singh and others; (2015) 7 SCC 373 relied on by learned Additional
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48555551/ 6
Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
Advocate General-3 for the State of Bihar wherein in paragraph nos.31 and 32, Hon'ble Supreme
Court held as follows:
"31. Therefore, it is the solemn duty of an advocate not to transgress the authority
conferred on him by the client. It is always better to seek appropriate instructions
from the client or his authorised agent before making any concession which may,
directly or remotely, affect the rightful legal right of the client. The advocate
represents the client before the court and conducts proceedings on behalf of the
client. He is the only link between the court and the client. Therefore his
responsibility is onerous. He is expected to follow the instructions of his client rather
than substitute his judgment.
32. Generally, admissions of fact made by a counsel are binding upon heir principals
as long as they are unequivocal; where, however, doubt exists as to a purported
admission, the court should be wary to accept such admissions until and unless the
counsel or the advocate is Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025
authorised by his principal to make such admissions. Furthermore, a client is not
bound by a statement or admission which he or his lawyer was not authorised to
make. A lawyer generally has no implied or apparent authority to make an admission
or statement which would directly surrender or conclude the substantial legal rights
of the client unless such an admission or statement is clearly a proper step in
accomplishing the purpose for which the lawyer was employed. We hasten to add
neither the client nor the court is bound by the lawyer's statements or admissions as
to matters of law or legal conclusions. Thus, according to generally accepted notions
of professional responsibility, lawyers should follow the client's instructions rather
than substitute their judgment for that of the client. We may add that in some cases,
lawyers can make decisions without consulting the client. While in others, the
decision is reserved for the client. It is often said that the lawyer can make decisions
as to tactics without consulting the client, while the client has a right to make
decisions that can affect his rights."
23. It may be noted here that so far as the Government policy dated 16.3.2006 is concerned, the
same is not under challenge by the petitioner in the instant application. The same clearly provides
that so far as the seniority of the daily wage employees is concerned, the same would be arranged as
per their age. Besides Hari Kumar Patel not having been made a party respondent in the instant writ
application, as per the document annexed to the writ application itself, it is also not in dispute that
Hari Kumar Patel is elder to the petitioner herein, their respective date of birth being 1.12.1961 and
that of the Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 petitioner being 12.1.1962.
24. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, so far as the prayer of the petitioner of his
absorption in the post of Electrician over and above Hari Kumar Patel is concerned, the Court finds
no illegality in the rejection of the prayer of the petitioner by the respondents and the impugned
order dated 8.10.2012 so far as this prayer is concerned stands upheld.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48555551/ 7
Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
25. At this stage, it would be relevant to point out that it is also not in dispute that the petitioner had
been working as an Electrician after the meeting of the Establishment Committee led the
respondents to appoint the petitioner, a Pump Operator, on the post of Electrician by order dated
31.12.1996. Even the order of absorption of the petitioner dated 30.11.2006 (which was challenged
in CWJC no.6004 of 2007) would also show that though he was regularised as a Pump Operator, the
same categorically stated that he would continue to perform the work as before which was of an
Electrician. It has been the case of the petitioner and not denied by the respondents that he
continued to discharge the work of an Electrician till his retirement in the year 2022.
26. At this stage, it would also be relevant to refer Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013
dt.08-10-2025 to the resolution of the Finance Department, Government of Bihar contained in
memo no.10710 dated 17.10.2013 (Annexure-12 to the rejoinder of petitioner to the counter affidavit
of the respondents). Clause 4 (vi) clearly states that if no post is available in the regular
establishment then while converting the work charge employees in the regular establishment, the
post of work charge will be converted into regular establishment but such post will not be treated as
sanctioned post in the cadre but the same will be automatically abolished after superannuation of
the concerned employee or his death during the service period.
27. It would also be relevant to refer to the judgment dated 22.4.2016 of this Court in LPA no.1686
of 2010 (Pramila Devi vs. State of Bihar & Ors.) wherein this Court was pleased to hold/observe as
follows:
"3. The claim is simple, that the reason was made to officiate at a higher post with
higher responsibility was undisputed, made to officiate at higher post with higher
responsibility not for a short period adjustment or as a stop gap arrangement, but for
four long years. He was even otherwise qualified and competent to hold the post. In
such an event, he could not be deprived of full remuneration of the higher post.
4. State urges that in the notification itself, it was stated that he would not be entitled
to the benefits of the said higher post. Thus, all he could at best claim is Patna High
Court CWJC No.16357 of 2013 dt.08-10-2025 a deputation allowance and nothing
more. We are sorry, we cannot accept the stand of the State. It is now well settled,
where an officer competent to hold the higher post is made to officiate on a higher
post not for a short period or as a stop gap arrangement, but for a considerable long
period, the post being higher post and involving high duties and responsibilities, the
person would be entitled to full benefits of that post.
5. Taking any other view of the matter, would allow the government or employer to
take advantage of the situation, and make juniors work in senior post with
remuneration of junior pay scales. That would be completely arbitrary and grossly
discriminatory. No government can be permitted to take work of higher post to the
higher duties and responsibilities and not pay for it. A stipulation to that effect would
be clearly contrary to pubic policy and should also be arbitrary and violative of Article
14 of the Constitution."

Awadhesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 October, 2025
28. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case narrated herein above, the Government policy
dated 16.3.2006 not being under challenge, the Court finds no illegality in the order impugned so far
as not absorbing the petitioner over and above Hari Kumar Patel is concerned. However, in view of
the resolution dated 17.10.2013 brought on record by the petitioner together with the decision in the
case of Pramila Devi (supra), the Court holds that the petitioner is entitled to the financial benefits
which would accrue to him as a result of having discharged the duties of an Electrician from
31.12.1996 till the date of his retirement. The petitioner will be Patna High Court CWJC No.16357 of
2013 dt.08-10-2025 entitled to represent before the respondents for the grant of benefit of ACP
which shall be decided by the respondents within a period of four months.
29. In case the respondents find the petitioner to be entitled for the benefit under the ACP scheme,
the same shall be given to the petitioner within the aforesaid period. In case the petitioner is not
found entitled for the benefits thereof, a reasoned order shall be communicated to the petitioner
also within the same period.
30. All the financial benefits as a result of the entitlement of the petitioner having worked on the
post of an Electrician w.e.f. 31.12.1996 and deducting the amount already paid, the difference
thereof shall be paid to the petitioner within a period of four months.
31. The writ application stands partly allowed with the above observations and directions.
