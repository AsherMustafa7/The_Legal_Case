6. Learned counsel for the informant states informant has no objection in case the impugned first
information report is quashed. Learned AGA has also fairly submitted that as the matter is already
settled and the interim order was accorded, the impugned FIR may be quashed.
7. It is jointly submitted that this being an offshoot of a dispute, same has come to be amicably
resolved under the compromise dated 30.09.2024, duly verified by the concerned Judicial
Magistrate, pending proceedings would serve no purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in
the light of the judgements of the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of B.S. Joshi v. State of
Haryana and others, 2003(4) SCC 675 and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab, 2012(10) SCC 303.
Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court dated 16.9.2022 in
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.8510 of 2022 (Anuj Pandey v. State of U.P. & Ors.), wherein, it is
observed that the High Court has ample power under its inherent jurisdiction to quash the first
information report in which the parties have settled their disputes which are of private in nature and
have no any grave impact on the society. The time of courts as well as investigating agencies are very
precious which should not be wasted in any futile proceedings where the chance of conviction is
bleak.
8. Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra) has held in para-61 that;
"the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences Under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or
victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not
private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like
Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while
working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
and pre-dominatingly civil favour stand on different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary
to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."
9. The genesis of the dispute between the parties was of purely civil in nature. Neither it is involving
any moral turpitude nor is heinous in nature. Since the dispute between the parties have already
been settled amicably vide compromise dated 30.09.2024 and the same was also duly verified by the
concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate, therefore, under the changed circumstances, pending
proceedings would serve no purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in the light of the
aforesaid judgments.
10. The writ petition is allowed and the proceedings of First Information Report dated 14.06.2024
registered as case crime No.567 of 2024, P.S. Kavi Nagar, District Ghaziabad under Sections 420,
467, 468, 471 and 120B I.P.C. are quashed.
