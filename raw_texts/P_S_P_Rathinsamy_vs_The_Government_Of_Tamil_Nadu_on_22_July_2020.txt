2.According to the petitioner, he is in possession and owning the agricultural land in Survey
No.365/1A1B, measuring an extent of 1 Acre and 90 Cents, situated at Koodankulam Village,
Tirunelveli District. A paper publication was issued to acquire 90 cents of land in the said survey
number for extension, upgradation, widening and formation of bypass road. Thereafter, the
respondents sub-divided the property into Sub-Division No.365/4 from the original division of
S.No. 365/1A1B. In view of the said sub-division, the said property lost its fertileness and it is unfit
for further agricultural operation. Subsequently, the respondent confirmed the acquisition under
the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 and also issued the notification in the Gazette. Even after
taking over the possession of the petitioner's property, the respondents have not paid any
compensation to him. Further, according to the petitioner, the proceeding was initiated in the year
2014 and now, 6 years have lapsed. Therefore, appropriate direction may be given to the
respondents to conclude the proceedings so as to enable the petitioner to get compensation for the
lands acquired. http://www.judis.nic.in
3.A counter affidavit has been filed by the third respondent. In the said counter affidavit, it has been
stated as follows:-
''6. I submit that, after publication of 15(2) ''A'' Notification under Tamil Nadu
Highways Act, 2001, the 15(2) ''B'' Notification under Tamil Nadu Highways Act,
2001, was approved by the Land Acquisition Officer and the District Revenue Officer,
Tirunelveli, on 20.05.2014 and published in the English and Tamil dailies on
25.05.2014. It is to state that the Notification under Section 15(2) ''B'' details the
exact area of each field proposed to be acquired with other details.

P.S.P.Rathinsamy vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
The Land Acquisition proceedings are under progress and not yet completed. The
petitioner's land has been under his possession and enjoyment till this day.
7. I submit that, before publishing 15(2)''B'' Notification under the Tamil Nadu
Highways Act, 2001, the exact portion of each field which are covered in land
acquisition were assigned with new sub-division numbers by the survey authorities
only for notification purposes. The newly prepared sub-division records will be
approved only when the award is passed. I submit that it is true that the Punjai Lands
to be acquired in Koodankulam Village was published in G.O.No. 258, dated
27.11.2015 and the errors occurred were corrected http://www.judis.nic.in vide
G.O.No.210/2016, dated 14.10.2016. The same was also published in the Tamil Nadu
Gazette No.51 Part II Sec. 2 dated 23.12.2015. The details of wet lands to be acquired
were published in G.O.No.30/2018 dated 21.02.2018 and also published in the Tamil
Nadu Gazette No.12/2018 Part II Sec. 2 dated 21.03.2018.
8. I submit that after publication of 15(2)''B'' Notification by the Land Acquisition
Officer, it is an usual procedure to send the details of lands which are proposed to be
acquired to the Sub-Registrar to avoid registration of deeds in respect of the Survey
Numbers covered in acquisition to avoid multiplicity of proceeding. It cannot at all be
considered as an instance of encumbrance on the lands. It is just an information to
the concerned Sub-Registrar to avoid further registration.''
4.In the counter affidavit, it has been specifically stated by the third respondent that the land owners
have to surrender the ownership, possession and enjoyment of the land to the Land Acquisition
Officer on completion of the procedures as contemplated under the Land Acquisition Act. But,
actually, the land acquisition proceedings are under progress and not yet completed and the
petitioner is in possession http://www.judis.nic.in and enjoyment of the said land till date. After
completion of the land acquisition proceedings as contemplated under the Act, the compensation
will be awarded. The petitioner has approached this Court at the preliminary stage and therefore,
the relief sought for by him in the present Writ Petition cannot be considered at this stage.
5.Taking note of the averment made in the counter affidavit filed by the third respondent that the
land acquisition proceedings is still pending and the respondents have not concluded the same, this
Court is of the view that the petitioner has approached this Court at the preliminary stage, where the
award has not yet been passed. Therefore, the payment of compensation in the present case will not
arise at this stage. The petitioner has to make a request before the authority concerned for fair and
reasonable compensation at the time of enquiry.
6.In view of the above, the relief sought for by the petitioner in this Writ Petition cannot be granted
at this stage. Hence, this Writ Petition stands disposed of with a direction to the respondents to
http://www.judis.nic.in conclude the land acquisition proceedings as expeditiously as possible
without any further delay by following all the procedures as contemplated under the relevant Act.
No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
