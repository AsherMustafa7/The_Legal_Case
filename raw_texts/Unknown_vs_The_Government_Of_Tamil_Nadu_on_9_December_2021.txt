Taluk and District to an extent of 1350 sq.ft. by the registered sale deed dated 16.04.1987. The
Government of Tamil Nadu proposed to acquire the subject lands for Tamil Nadu Housing Board. In
this respect, the Special Tashildar (Land Acquisition), Unit-I Tamil Nadu Housing Board Scheme,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Nandanam, Chennai-35 was appointed as an Officer under
Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the Act', for short) in
G.O.Ms.No.49, Housing and Urban Development (HBS) Department, dated 05.02.1992 was issued
in that regard. The declaration under Section 6 of the Act, was published in G.O.Ms.No.328,
Housing and Urban Development Department, dated 26.04.1993. Further, some of the land owners
had challenged the land acquisition proceedings in W.P.No.16713 of 1993 and the same was
dismissed by this Court. Insofar as the deceased petitioner is concerned, he received notice on
15.03.1995 under Sections 9(3) and 10 of the Act, calling upon the petitioner to appear for
award-enquiry for fixing compensation and passing of an award. The award was passed in Award
No.1 of 1995 on 28.04.1995. Accordingly, the compensation was fixed at Rs.1,50,502/- for total
extent of 38 cents.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that they have not been paid any compensation
till today. In fact, the deceased petitioner had also sent his objections on 10.07.1995 for reference
under Section 18 of the Act for enhancement of the compensation. However,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the award amount has neither been deposited in the Competent
Court nor paid to the deceased petitioner. After passing the award, the deceased petitioner was
never tendered to receive the compensation as contemplated under Section 12(2) of the Act. The
deceased petitioner also filed a Writ Petition before this Court for re-conveyance of the said lands
and this Court directed the first respondent to consider his application for re-conveyance. However,
the same was rejected by an order dated 18.10.2005. The deceased petitioner filed an application
under Right to Information Act seeking information with regard to the details of compensation. On
receipt of the same, the deceased petitioner was informed that the compensation amount was
deposited in the Treasury as early as on 24.01.1997 and the revenue deposit had also expired on
31.03.2001 and by the communication dated 11.10.2007, they renewed the lapsed compensation
amount. Therefore, the entire land acquisition proceedings have been lapsed, in view of the proviso
to Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the New Act', for short). In
support of his contentions, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis learned counsel for the petitioners
relied upon the judgment of this Court reported in 2021 (2) CTC 300 in the case of (K.Saraswathi
-vs- State of Tamil Nadu).
“16. A close reading of all the above portions culled out from the judgment, clearly point out the fact
that drawing of Panchnama of taking possession is the correct mode of taking possession in land
acquisition cases, more particularly where the property acquired is a vacant land or a large tract of
land. Taking possession by adopting to this mode, gives a lot of authenticity to prove that the land
has been taken possession. Under the Transfer of Property Act, in cases of vacant land, possession
always follow title. However, in the land acquisition proceedings, it works the other way round and
here the title vests with the State only after taking possession. In other words, title follows
possession. This position is very clear on a bare reading of Section 16 of the 1894 Act.

29. It is clear from the above judgments that it is the duty of the Collector to make payment by
issuing proper notice to the concerned land owner and calling him to receive the compensation
amount. Unless this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis crucial step is followed, the land owner may
not even know whether it was deposited and if so, when the amount was deposited. Even if a
notified person or his representative participates in the Award proceedings, that will not amount to
a presumption that he has the notice of the compensation amount being readily available for
payment. That is why Section 12[2] of the 1894 Act specifically mandates issuance of such notice. If
the notice is issued and thereafter, the land owner refuses to receive the compensation or does not
come to the specified place to receive the compensation and the compensation amount gets
deposited in a Treasury account or the Court, as the case may be, the land owner cannot be
permitted to turn around at a later point of time and complain that the compensation amount was
not tendered/paid to him.
30. In the facts of the present case, the deposit made in the Court on 04.06.2000 by the Special
Tahsildar (LA), Housing Scheme Unit 1, Coimbatore, does not amount to a valid tender/payment of
Compensation. This finding is given not by finding fault in the procedure adopted in the deposit of
amount in the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Court, but based on the most crucial fact that there
was no notice issued to the Landowners after the Award Proceedings, under Section 12(2) of the
1897 Act and therefore, there was no valid tender/payment of the compensation to the Landowners.
The Judgments cited supra and the Judgment of the Constitution Bench clearly supports this
finding on the issue of valid tender/payment of Compensation.
37. Section 24(2) of the Act provides for a deemed lapse of the entire Acquisition proceedings where
the conditions stipulated therein are fulfilled. Such a deemed lapse happens by operation of law. In
other words, it does not require a specific declaration by the Court to declare that the Acquisition
proceedings has become bad unless the situation warrants. The Statute has created such a provision
contemplating deemed lapse on the coming into force of the 2013 Act where the conditions
stipulated under Section 24(2) of the Act are fulfilled, viz., not taking possession and non payment
of Compensation. In the present case, this Court has already held that the possession has not been
taken and Compensation has not been paid in the manner known to law. At the risk of repetition,
this Court again reiterates https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that this Court is not trying to pin point
some mistakes committed by the authorities while taking possession or paying/tendering
Compensation. This Court is holding that the possession, which has to be taken in a particular mode
and the payment of Compensation, which has to be tendered/deposited in a particular mode, has
not been done in the facts of the present case and therefore, there is no taking of possession and
payment/tendering of Compensation in the eye of law. Therefore, the deeming provision under
Section 24(2) of the Act automatically comes into play in favour of Petitioners by operation of law.”
4. The learned Standing Counsel appearing for the fourth respondent submitted that the fourth
respondent filed counter affidavit stating that after notice to the deceased petitioner, the award has
been passed on 28.04.1995 in Award No.1 of 1995. Thereafter, the deceased petitioner was duly
tendered to receive the compensation as contemplated under Section 12(2) of the Act on 10.05.1995
and the same was duly served on the deceased petitioner herein. Even then, the deceased petitioner
failed to come and collect the compensation and as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis such, the

respondents made a revenue deposit on 24.01.1997 itself. Since the revenue deposit was expired on
31.03.2001, it was renewed by the communication dated 11.10.2007. Thereafter, the award amount
was deposited in the Civil Court deposit as contemplated under Sections 30 and 31(2) of the Act.
Accordingly, the award amount has been deposited before the Sub Court, Kanchipuram. Insofar as
the possession of the subject property is concerned, it has been taken over as early as on 26.07.1996
and thereafter, the possession has been handed over to the Housing Board on 28.02.2002.
Thereafter, the entire revenue records have been mutated in the name of the Housing Board.
5. Heard Mr.S.Mohan, the learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.M.Muthusamy, learned
Government Advocate appearing for the respondents 1 to 3 and Mr.S.Vanchinathan, learned
Standing Counsel appearing for the fourth respondent.
6. As stated supra, initially the respondents made revenue deposit as early as on 24.01.1997 itself.
That apart, the deceased petitioner filed a Writ Petition in W.P.No.23777 of 2004 to consider his
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis request for re-conveyance of the lands and this Court directed the
first respondent to consider the request of the petitioner by an order dated 25.07.2005. The request
of the deceased petitioner was rejected by an order dated 18.10.2005 for the reason that after
awarding the award amount, the same has been deposited in the revenue deposit and thereafter,
deposited in the Court. The deceased petitioner also failed to file any objections for reference under
Section 18 of the Act. The subject lands are located in the middle of the lands already acquired and
the possession has been taken by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board and the lands are essentially
required for forming the comprehensive housing scheme. Therefore, they are not inclined to invoke
the provisions under Section 48-B of the Act.
7. Admittedly, the said order was not challenged by the deceased petitioner. After a period of 9
years, the present Writ Petition has been filed challenging the very acquisition proceedings under
the provisions 24(2) of the New Act, as if the entire land acquisition proceedings have been lapsed
for non payment of compensation and not taking of the possession of the property. Therefore, the
judgment cited https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis by the learned counsel for the petitioners is not
helpful to the case on hand.
8. In view of the above discussions, this Writ Petition is devoid of merits and is liable to be
dismissed. Accordingly, this Writ Petition stands dismissed. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous
petition is closed. No costs.
