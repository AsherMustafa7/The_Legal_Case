iii) For other writ, order or direction to which the petitioner is found by this Hon'ble Court may
kindly be issued."
3. The petitioner claims to have married deceased Biswa Ranjan Prasad, after the death of his first
wife in the year 2006. He superannuated while working as a Constable in Assam Rifles. The
husband of the petitioner died on 21.04.2012. The authorities have refused to pay family pension to
the petitioner on the ground that her husband had not got changes made in the Pension Payment
Order during his life time showing her to be the wife entitled for family pension.
Patna High Court CWJC No.24159 of 2019 dt.05-12-2019
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that out of the wedlock a male child was born who is
a minor and the petitioner is left in the lurch without any source of income for her or her child.
5. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that Rule 54 (16) of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972
which requires that retiral changes in the family of the employee has to be intimated to the
authorities in the lifetime of the employee.
6. Having considered the matter, what has been stated by learned counsel for the petitioner, for
which there is some evidence on record, the Court is persuaded to intervene in the matter. Though
there may be rules governing the field which are technical in nature, but if a right exists, the Rules
governing those rights cannot be so lightly read so as to frustrate the main claim, if the same is bona
fide and genuine. In the present case, it is a fact that the petitioner married the deceased after the
death of the first wife, just because of an omission by her late husband to intimate such change to
the authority concerned, cannot, in the considered opinion of the Court, be fatal for the claim
otherwise sustainable and due in law. Such would be a travesty of justice and is also inequitable.
7. For reasons aforesaid, the writ petition stands Patna High Court CWJC No.24159 of 2019
dt.05-12-2019 disposed off with a direction to the respondent no. 2 to get the matter verified from
the authorities, which includes the District Magistrate, Bhojpur, with regard to the veracity of the
claim of the petitioner. If the report is in favour of the petitioner, necessary orders with regard to
grant of family pension and also payment of the remaining retiral dues of her husband shall be made
to her within three months from the enquiry report being made available to the respondent no. 2.
8. As the matter is urgent, the Court deems it appropriate to direct the respondent no. 2 to refer the
matter for enquiry within one month from the date of production of a copy of this order before him.
Upon doing so, a direction is issued to the authority, to which such reference is made, to ensure that

respondent no. 2 shall also forward a copy of this order to the concerned authority while making

9. The Court would indicate that in enquiry, all aspects would be gone into as to who is still alive and
may have Patna High Court CWJC No.24159 of 2019 dt.05-12-2019 claim in family pension/retiral
