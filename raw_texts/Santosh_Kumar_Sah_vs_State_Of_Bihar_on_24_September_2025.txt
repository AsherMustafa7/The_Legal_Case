his sasural at Sonaili, demanded motorcycle but the informant
tried to convince him that he is not in a position to give

Santosh Kumar Sah vs State Of Bihar on 24 September, 2025
the present appellant the categorical finding has come by the Trial Court that case is based on
circumstantial evidence and I.O. (PW 5) has categorically narrated in his evidence that the Patna
High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.529 of 2003 dt.24-09-2025 appellant and his wife (deceased) was
living in two room house. There was no any fighting mark in the room. PW 5 has stated about
wound on the forehead of the deceased, but injury report has not been marked exhibit. He further
submits that the Trial Court has exonerated the appellant and not found case true under Section
304B of the Indian Penal Code and only on the basis of oral evidence of Pws.2, 4 and 5 has convicted
the accused under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. Counsel submits that from the record it
transpires that PW 2 is the father of the deceased, PW 3 is the brother of the deceased and PW 4 is
the mother of the deceased. He submits that admittedly death has been caused at the house of the
husband; whereas PWs.2, 3 and 4 were residing at the different place at all. They have also not
known about the death; rather only after information of the shop-keeper of informant's house
became aware about this occurrence. He submits that the appellate Court has unnecessarily relied
on the evidence of the relatives of the deceased. There is no single witness who came forward to
support the story of torture. Learned Counsel further submits that PWs.2, 3 and 4 are admittedly
the hearsay witness but Trial Court have convicted the accused only on this ground alone. Therefore,
according to him, the present case is fit to be Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.529 of 2003
dt.24-09-2025 allowed.
10. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the State-respondent, on the other
hand, submits that there is enough material that the Trial Court has committed error as the charge
has been framed under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code and even though the ingredient of
murder is not available, but the ingredient of suicide is available, then onus shifts on the accused to
defend under Section 113B of the Evidence Act as admittedly marriage took place within seven years.
11. After hearing the parties as well as upon perusal of the lower court records, it transpires that
there are in total six witnesses in the present case. PW 1 Ganga Prasad has proved his signature and
signature of Anil Kumar Sah on the inquest report of deceased Bijali @ Benita Devi, prepared by
I.O., marked as Exhibits-1 and 1/1. He also proved his signature as well as the signature of Jyotish
Lal Sah on the seizure-list, which are exhibited as Exts-1/2 and 1/3. PW 2 Shyam Nand Sah, PW 3
Shree Ram Sah and PW 4 Kamini Devi are the father, brother and mother of the deceased. PW 5 is
the I.O. of the case. PW 6 is the doctor, who has proved the post mortem report.

12. Before I come to the ocular evidence on record, this Court deem it fit to take note of the medical
evidence adduced by the prosecution. This Court noticed that according to the evidence of PW 6 Dr.
Manindra Kumar Manish, who deposed that he and Dr. Kuldip Mandal was posted at Sadar
Hospital, Katihar. As per the post mortem report Dr. Kuldip Mandal conducted post mortem

doctor, the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging. The doctor also found ligature mark around

13. PW 2 Shyam Nand Sah (informant) has proved the signature on the fardbeyan (Ext-1/4) and the
signature of Pratap Narayan Barnwal (Ext-1/5). He has re- narrated the prosecution case in his
examination-in-chief. He deposed that his daughter always expressed annoyance against her sasural
people. He deposed that the sasural people of her daughter used to demand rice and pulse from her
father and accused Santosh Sah demanded motorcycle and the witness showed their disability to
fulfill it. He deposed that Bijali (deceased) has stated to her brother (PW 3) on 28.01.93, a day
before the occurrence, about the dissatisfaction for the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.529 of
2003 dt.24-09-2025 behaviour of her sasural people. He deposed that on arrival he saw a big injury
on the forehead of his daughter (deceased). There were abrasion on her ear and ligature mark
around her neck.
In cross-examination, he deposed that accused Baijnath Sah had two sons. One Sudhir and other
one is accused Santosh and before marriage accused Santosh was residing at village Sonaili. He
deposed that accused Baijnath Sah was living separately from his son, accused Santosh, before one
month of the incident.
14. PW 3 Sri Ram Sah deposed that his sister used to say that the sasural people used to harass her
sister and demanded motorcycle. He deposed that on 28.01.93 also his sister (deceased) complained
against her sasural people.
15. PW 4 Kamini Devi deposed that the behavour of sasural people was cordial with her daughter
but her son-in-law (appellant Santosh) used to demand motorcycle.
16. After hearing the parties, this Court upon consideration of the documents and exhibits, finds that
the Trial Court has rightly convicted the accused under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code and
imposed sentence accordingly. The appeal has been preferred by the appellant to look into the Patna
High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.529 of 2003 dt.24-09-2025 ingredient of Section 498A of the Indian
Penal Code. The ingredient is available against the appellant or not as the State/prosecution has not
aggrieved by the said order. It is due to this reason, this Court is only confined to look into the
availability of the ingredients of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. Section 498A of the Indian
Penal Code states as follows:
"498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.-
Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to
cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall
also be liable to fine."
17. With a view to prove the torture, the evidence of the family members is paramount as it is a
dispute between the two families, where marriage of daughter of one family took place with the son
of another family and this Court is of the firm view that the relatives of the family members are the
most competent witness. Here in the present case, the mother of the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ)
No.529 of 2003 dt.24-09-2025 deceased has categorically stated that demand of motorcycle was
made. The brother, who had visited the house of his sister, had witnessed the behaviour of his

Santosh Kumar Sah vs State Of Bihar on 24 September, 2025
brother-in-law and father has also adduced in his evidence that how the demand of dowry in the
form of motorcycle used to be made by the appellant and by virtue of those ocular evidences, which
come on record from the mouth of PWs.2, 3 and 4, this Court reached on the conclusion that there is
sufficient material for ingredient under Section 498A and, therefore, this Court is not interfering in
the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 11.11.2003 passed by Additional Sessions
Judge-III, Katihar, in Sessions Trial No.254 of 1993.
18. In the result, the present appeal is devoid of merit and the same is dismissed. The accused is
hereby directed to surrender within six weeks from today and the Trial Court shall proceed
accordingly.
19. Let the Lower Court Records be sent back to the learned Trial Court with a copy of this judgment
and order.
