Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
The petitioners in this case are candidates, applied in
pursuance of Advertisement No. 22/99. They have made a prayer for
issuance of writ of mandamus directing the respondent to appoint the
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 2
petitioners who were empanelled candidates in pursuance of result
dated 29.5.2002 published by Bihar Public Service Commission (in
short "the Commission") for appointment to the post of Assistant in
Secretariat and its attached offices in the light of the liberty granted to
the petitioners by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated 22.4.2013
passed in Civil Appeal No. 3289-3290 of 2012.
The short fact of this case is that the Bihar Public Service
Commission issued an advertisement being Advt. No. 22/99 inviting
application for appointment to the post of Assistant in the Bihar
Secretariat and its attached offices. In the advertisement, it has been
mentioned the number of vacancy as 331 posts and in pursuance
thereof, the petitioners along with others applied for the post of
Assistant. The petitioners appeared in the written test and finally,
result was published on 29.5.2002. All the petitioners are from general
category candidate, they came within 330 short listed candidates.
Accordingly, the result was published on 29.5.2002, recommendation
was made on 4.7.2002 but in the meantime, the Bihar Re-organization
Act, 2000 came into force with effect from 15.11.2000. In such
circumstances, the aforesaid recommendation remained hanging in
air. The Government took decision on 6.6.2003, directed the
Commission to send recommendation of 2/3rd candidates out of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 2
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
earlier recommended list for the appointment. The Commission, in the
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 3
initial stage, refused to send fresh recommendation by changing the
reservation policy saying that result was already published and
recommendation has already been sent. The Deputy Secretary cum
Secretary of the Commission vide letter dated 25.8.2003 sent fresh
recommendation of 221 candidates as per the new reservation policy.
The recommendation was for the 2/3rd of the number of vacancy
advertised which led to filing of the writ application vide CWJC No.
11175 of 2003 particularly for quashing the order dated 25.8.2003 as
claiming that, the recommendation should be of 330 posts and it
should not be only 2/3rd, the ground was taken that as sufficient
number of vacancies were available in the State of Bihar. The said
writ application was disposed of vide order dated 13.10.2004 giving
direction to the Government to consider the empanelled candidates for
the post of L.D.C. clerk on the said 2/3rd vacancies. The same was
challenged in Letters Patent Appeal being LPA No. 109 of 2002
directed to consider the entire exercise within a period of two months.
The contempt application, MJC No. 2815 of 2004 with a review
application being Civil Review No. 184 of 2004 was filed which was
dismissed as not maintainable in view of pendency of the review
application. Accordingly, the contempt application was disposed of
vide order dated 26.10.2005 and the review application was
withdrawn. Further a contempt application was filed being MJC No.

Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
3187 of 2005 which was also disposed of vide order dated 29.11.2006
in view of the fact that 2/3rd vacancies falling in the share of State of
Bihar were already filled up. The petitioners have again approached
this Court in CWJC No. 1812 of 2009 for a direction to the State to
fill up all vacancies of 330 and the same was dismissed vide order
dated 8.7.2009 as not maintainable on the principle of resjudicata
since the same was adjudicated and decided. The petitioners have also
filed LPA No. 1298 of 2010 but the same was dismissed vide order
dated 23.11.2011. It has been stated in the writ application that the
petitioner no.1, namely, Dhirendra Kumar Singh filed an application
under the Right to Information Act seeking an information of joining
of 221 candidates who were declared successful in response it
transpired that only 180 candidates have joined the post and
remaining 26 posts are still lying vacant. The present petitioners
moved before the Apex Court in Civil Appeal Nos. 3289-3290 of
2012, the same was disposed of giving liberty to approach the High
Court for redressal of the grievance. It will be relevant to quote
relevant portion of the order ,which reads as follows:-
"The appellants have placed on record the order dated
12.09.2006
whereby the candidates appointed as Lower Division Clerk have been appointed to the post of
Assistant. We have been told that few of the appellants who were earlier appointed as Lower
Division Clerk have not been appointed as Assistants. However, no details have been Patna High
Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 5 In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to give
any direction in this regard.
However, we give liberty to such of the Lower Division Clerks to approach the High Court for the
redressal of their grievances. In such a grievance is made, the High Court shall examine the same on
merit in accordance with law. We have also been told that despite the direction of the High Court,
some of the empanelled candidates have not been appointed. No details thereof have been given. If
that be so, they are also given liberty to approach the High Court for the appropriate relief. In case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 4
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
they do so, the High Court shall examine the same on merit in accordance with law."
From the counter affidavit which was filed by the State, there is no challenge to the fact that out of
206 vacancies, 180 have joined the post and 26 posts could not be filled up as the recommended
candidates did not turn up.
Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the present petitioners should be adjusted
against the vacancies which the State has vehemently opposed on account of long lapse of time, the
vacancies which remained vacant have already consumed, at the same time much water has flown
during the long period, in such view of the matter, the petitioners cannot claim their appointment
against the vacancies which were not filled up on account of non-joining of the recommended
candidates. From the records, it appears that the petitioners have been making all efforts for their
entry in service but Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 6 the question would
arise when certain persons did not join, can this Court exercise its power and give direction to the
State to allow the petitioners to join the said post. It is also a fact that the petitioners were not within
216 recommended candidates but they were as per their claim falling under the 330 candidates who
were originally recommended for the appointment.
Learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance in the case of A.P. Aggarwal Vs. Government
of National Capital Territory of Delhi & Anr. reported in AIR 2000 S.C. 205, Jai Narain Ram Vs.
State of U.P. and Ors. reported in (1996) 1 SCC 332, Surinder Singh & Ors. etc. Vs. State of Punjab &
Anr. reported in AIR 1998 SC 18, Ashutosh Kumar Vinayak & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.
reported in 2000(3) PLJR 495, Asha Kaul & Anr. Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir & Ors. reported
in (1993) 2 SCC 573 and Dr. Surendra Kumar & Anr. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in
2005(4) PLJR 478, Learned counsel for the State has placed reliance in the case of Subodh Kumar
Vs. The Sate of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2012(2) PLJR 647, Kulwinder Pal Singh & Anr. Vs. State of
Punjab & Ors. reported in (2016) 6 SCC 532 and order passed in CWJC No. 11090 of 2006
(Annexure-C to the counter affidavit).
The issue involved in the present case has come across many occasions by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court as well as this Court with regard to status of panel and persons whose names are standing
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 7 in the panel. It has repeatedly been held
that the persons who have been empanelled does not have the indefeasible right for appointment.
The question came for consideration in Shankarsan Dash vs Union Of India reported in AIR 1991 SC
1612. In this case, the petitioner was selected in the combined civil services examination held by the
Union Public Service Commission for the appointment of several service including Indian Police
Service, a combined merit list was published for I.P.S. and Police Services, Group-B which included
the name of the petitioner. The position of the petitioner in the merit list was below, was offered for
appointment to the Delhi Andman and Nicobar Police Services which he accepted. On account of
selected candidates allotted to police service, Group-B did not join, the position of the petitioner
improved and ultimately he came at the top in the list. Fourteen posts in the I.P.S. remained vacant
on account of non-joining in the services, he filed representation making prayer that in view of
non-joining of the fourteen candidates and the vacancy remained standing, he should be allotted
one post but the request was turned down, the writ was filed, the same was dismissed. The matter
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 5
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
reached to the highest court, claim was made that since several vacancies in general category of the
I.P.S. remained unfilled, he was entitled to be appointed in one of them and the authorities were not
right in rejecting the representation. The Court held that it is not correct to say Patna High Court
CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 8 that if a number of vacancies are notified for appointment
and adequate number of candidates are found fit, the successful candidates acquire an indefeasible
right to be appointed which cannot be legitimately denied. Ordinarily the notification merely
amounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to apply for recruitment and on their selection they
do not acquire any right to the post. Unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate, the State is
under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies but it does not mean that the State has the
licence of acting in an arbitrary manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken
bona fide for appropriate reasons but if the vacancies or any of them are filled up, the State is bound
to respect the comparative merit of the candidates, as reflected in the recruitment test, and no
discrimination can be permitted. It has further been held that it is open to the government not to fill
up all the vacancies for a valid reason, but the selection cannot be arbitrarily restricted to a few
candidates notwithstanding the number of vacancies and the availability of qualified candidates and
there must be a conscious application of mind by the Government. It has further been held that the
existence of vacancies does not give a legal right to a selected candidate for appointment. It would be
relevant to quote paragraph nos. 7 & 8 of the said judgment which reads as follows:-
"7. It is not correct to say that if a number of vacancies Patna High Court CWJC
No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 9 are notified for appointment and adequate number
of candidates are found fit, the successful candidates acquire an indefeasible right to
be appointed which cannot be legitimately denied. Ordinarily the notification merely
amounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to apply for recruitment and on their
selection they do not acquire any right to the post. Unless the relevant recruitment
rules so indicate, the State is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies.
However, it does not mean that the State has the licence of acting in an arbitrary
manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken bona fide for
appropriate reasons. And if the vacancies or any of them are filled up, the State is
bound to respect the comparative merit of the candidates, as reflected at the
recruitment test, and no discrimination can be permitted. This correct position has
been consistently followed by this Court, and we do not find any discordant note in
the decisions in State of Haryana v. Subhash Chander Marwaha and Others, [1974] 1
SCR 165: (AIR 1973 SC 2216); Miss Neelima Shangla v. State of Haryana and Others,
[1986] 4 SCC 268 : (AIR 1987 SC 169), or Jitendra Kumar and Others v. State of
Punjab and Others, [1985] 1 SCR 899 : (AIR 1984 SC 1850).
8. In State of Haryana v. Subhash Chander Marwaha, (AIR 1973 SC 2216) (supra) 15
vacancies of Subordinate Judges were advertised, and out of the selection list only 7,
who had secured more than 55% marks, were appointed, although under the relevant
rules the eligibility condition required only 45% marks. Since the High Court had
recommended Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 10 earlier, to
the Punjab Government that only the candidates securing 55% marks or more should
be appointed as Subordinate Judges, the other candidates included in the select list
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 6
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
were not appointed. They filed a writ petition before the High Court claiming a right
of being appointed on the ground that vacancies existed and they were qualified and
were found suitable. The writ application was allowed. While reversing the decision
of the High Court, it was observed by this Court that it was open to the Government
to decide how many appointments should be made and although the High Court had
appreciated the position correctly, it had ``somehow persuaded itself to spell out a
right in the candidates because in fact there were 15 vacancies''. It was expressly ruled
that the existence of vacancies does not give a legal right to a selected candidate.
Similarly, the claim of some of the candidates selected for appointment, who were
petitioners in Jitendra Kumar and Others v. State of Punjab, (AIR 1984 SC 1850),
was turned down holding that it was open to the Government to decide how many
appointments would be made. The plea of arbitrariness was rejected in view of the
facts of the case and it was had that the candidates did not acquire any right merely
by applying for selection or even after selection. It is true that the claim of the
petitioner in the case of Miss Neelima Shangla v. State of Haryana, (AIR 1987 SC
169) was allowed by this Court but, not on the ground that she had acquired any right
by her selection and existence of vacancies. The fact was that the matter had been
referred to the Public Service Commission Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013
dt.19-09-2016 11 which sent to the Government only the names of 17 candidates
belonging to the general category on the assumption that only 17 posts were to be
filled up.
The Government accordingly made only 17 appointments and stated before the Court
that they were unable to select and appoint more candidates as the Commission had
not recommended any other candidate. In this background it was observed that it is,
of course, open to the Government not to fill up all the vacancies for a valid reason,
but the selection cannot be arbitrarily restricted to a few candidates notwithstanding
the number of vacancies and the availability of qualified candidates; and there must
be a conscious application of mind by the Government and the High Court before the
number of persons selected for appointment is restricted. The fact that it was not for
the Public Service Commission to take a decision in this regard was emphasised in
this judgment. None of these decisions, therefore, supports the appellant."
Similar issue came for consideration in the case of Asha Kaul (supra). The advertisement was
published for the appointment of Judicial Officer, the examination was conducted, interview was
held, the Government received complaints against the manner of holding the competitive
examination and on that account, the Government did not move for the appointment of candidates
prepared by the Public Service Commission but as there was need of judicial offices, the
Government on the request of the High Court, approved the names of Patna High Court CWJC
No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 12 thirteen persons. As seven persons who were not recommended
approached the High Court, ultimately the matter went to the Supreme Court where it has been held
that mere inclusion of name of candidates in the select list does not confer upon the candidate an
indefeasible right for appointment but it is obligation of the Government to act fairly. It has further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 7
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
been held that the Commission issued a notification to hold written test, conducted the interview,
prepared select list, communicated to the Government, the Government cannot, for good and valid
reason, nullify the whole exercise and tell the candidate when they complain that they have no legal
right to appointment. It has further been held that they do not have any legal right for appointment.
It has again been held that the Government is the appointing authority of the Munsiff but it is
misleading to assert that in the matter of selection and appointment, the Government has an
absolute power. Such an argument violates the constitutional scheme in view of independent
constitution of Public Service Commission as provided under the Constitution. Every appointment
has to be made after consultation of the Public Service Commission. It has further been held that the
Government cannot approve a part of the list and disapprove the balance. They cannot appoint
certain person from the said list and without any reason leave the person from appointment.
Though the Government on a Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 13
reasonable ground can refuse the appointment such as non-availability of the vacancy or on account
of lapse of life of the panel. It would be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 7 & 8 of the said judgment
which reads as follows:-
"7. Construed in the above light, Rule 39, in our opinion, does not confer an absolute
power upon the government to disapprove or cancel the select list sent by the public
service commission. Where, however, the government is satisfied, after due enquiry
that the selection has been vitiated either on account of violation of a fundamental
procedural requirement or is vitiated by consideration of corruption, favourtism or
nepotism, it can refuse to approve the select list. In such a case, the government is
bound to record the reasons for its action, and produce the same before a Court, if
and when summoned to do so, apart from placing the same before the Legislature as
required by clause (2) of Article 323. Indeed, clause (2) of Article 323 obliges the
Governor of a State to ray a copy of the annual report received from the commission
before the Legislature "together with a memorandum explaining, as respect the cases,
if any, where the advice of the commission was not accepted (and) the reasons for
such non-acceptance." Evidently, this is meant as a check upon the power of the
government. This provision too militates against the theory of absolute power in the
government to disapprove or reject the recommendations of the commission. For the
same reason, it must be held that the government Patna High Court CWJC No.23417
of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 14 cannot pick and choose candidates out of the list. Of course,
where in respect of any particular candidate any material is discovered disclosing his
involvement in any criminal activity, the government can. always refuse to appoint
such person but this would not be a case touching the select list prepared and
recommended by the commission. It is equally not open to the government to
approve a part of the list and disapprove the balance. In this case, it may be
remembered that the government itself had asked for a list of twenty and the
commission had sent a list of twenty. (we are not concerned with the waiting list sent
by the commission, at this stage). It could not have been approved in part and
rejected in part. The number of vacancies available on the date of approval and
publication of the list is not material. By merely approving the list of twenty, there
was no obligation upon the government to appoint them forthwith. Their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 8
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
appointment depended upon the availability of vacancies. A reading of Rule 41 makes
this aspect clear. The list remains valid for one year from the date of its approval and
publication. If within such one year, any of the candidates therein is not appointed,
the list lapses and a fresh list has to be prepared. In this case, no doubt, a number of
complaints appears to have been received by the government about the selection
process. We have seen the note file placed before us. It refers to certain facts and
complaints. But if the government wanted to disapprove or reject the list, it ought to
have done so within a reasonable time of the receipt of the select list and for reasons
to be recorded. Not having Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016
15 done that and having approved the list partly (thirteen out of twenty names) the\
cannot put forward any ground for not approving the remaining list. I indeed, when it
approved the list to the extent of thirteen, it ought to have approved the entire list of
twenty or have disapproved the entire list of twenty. The objection, the government
have pertains to the very process of selection i.e., to the entire list, and not
individually to any of the remaining seven candidates.
8. It is true that mere inclusion in the select list does not confer upon the candidates
included therein an indefeasible right to appointment State of Haryana v. Subhash
Chandra Marwaha AIR 1973 SC6; Mani Subrat Jain v. State of Haryana A.I.R. 1977
S.C. 276 and State of Kerala v. A. Lakshmikutty A.I.R. 1987 S.C. 1 but that is only one
aspect of the matter. The other aspect is the obligation of the government to act fairly.
The whole exercise cannot be reduced to a farce. Having sent a requisition/request to
the commission to select a particular number of candidates for a particular category,
in pursuance of which the commission issues a notification, holds a written test,
conducts a notification, holds a written test, conducts interviews, prepares a select
list and then communicates to the government-the government cannot quietly and
without good and valid reasons nullify the whole exercise and tell the candidates
when they complain that they have no legal right to appointment. We do not think
that any government can adopt such a stand with any Patna High Court CWJC
No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 16 justification today. This aspect has been dealt
with by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Shankarsan Dash v. Union of India
(1991) 3 S.C.C.47 where the earlier decisions of this court are also noted. The
following observations of the court are apposite:
(SCC pp.50-51, para 7) "It is not correct to say that if a number of vacancies are
notified for appointment and adequate number of candidates are found fit, the
successful candidates acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed which cannot be
legitimately denied. Ordinarily the notification merely amounts to an invitation to
qualified candidates to apply for recruitment and on their selection they do not
acquire any right to the post. Unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate, the
State is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies. However, it does not
mean that the State has the licence of acting in an arbitrary manner. The decision not
to fill up the vacancies has to he taken bona fide for appropriate reasons. And if the
vacancies or any of them are filled up, the State is bound to respect the comparative
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 9
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
merit of the candidates, as reflected at the recruitment test, and no discrimination
can be permitted. This correct position has been consistently followed by this Court,
and we do not find any discordant note in the decisions in State of Haryana v.
Subhash Chander Marwahs, Neelima. Shangla v. State of Haryana or- Patna High
Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 17 Jatendra Kumar v. State of Punjab."
(Underlining for emphasis) In the case of Surinder Singh (supra), the Government appointed excess
to the vacancies mentioned in the advertisement. The High Court declared that the excess
appointment as well as the notified vacancies will be illegal and one person from the selected
candidate within the post advertised had not joined, the claim was made that as the person did not
join, the petitioner could be appointed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court refused to grant relief on the
ground of delay and laches. While deciding this issue, a question arose as with regard to status of
wait list candidate in the panel. The selected person did not join the post. The Court has held that a
candidate in the waiting list in the order of merit has a right to claim that he may be appointed if one
or the other selected candidate does not join but when the selected candidate join, no vacancy arise
due to resignation or any other reason within the period the list is to operate under the rules or
within reasonable period and where no specific period is provided than the candidate from the
waiting list has no right to claim appointment to any future vacancy which may arise unless the
Selection of the candidate was held for it. He has no vested right except to the limited extent or
when the appointing authority acts arbitrarily and makes appointment from the waiting list by pick
and Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 18 choose method for extraneous
reasons. A waiting list prepared does not furnish a source of recruitment for future vacancy. It only
operates for the contingency that if any of the selected candidates does not join then the person from
the waiting list may be pushed up and be appointed in the vacancies so caused or if there is some
extreme exigency, the Government may as a matter of policy decision pick up persons in order of
merit from the waiting list. The waiting list cannot be used as a perennial source of recruitment
filling up the vacancies not advertised. It will be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 13, 14 and 15 of the
said judgment which reads as follows:-
"13. --------- A candidate in the waiting list in the order of merit has a right to claim
that he may be appointed if one or the other selected candidate does not join. But
once the selected candidates join and no vacancy arises due to resignation etc. or for
any other reason within the period the list is to operate under the rules or within
reasonable period where no specific period is provided than candidate from the
waiting list has no right to claim appointment to any future vacancy which may arise
unless the Selection was held for it. He has no vested right except to the limited
extent, indicated above, or when the appointing authority acts arbitrarily and makes
appointment from the waiting list by picking and choosing for extraneous reasons.
A waiting list prepared in an examination Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013
dt.19-09-2016 19 conducted by the Commission does not furnish a source of
recruitment. It is opera-tive only for the contingency that if any of the selected
candidates does not join then the person from the waiting list may be pushed up and
be appointed in the vacancies so caused or if there is some extreme exigency the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 10
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
Government may as a matter of policy decision pick up persons in order of merit
from the waiting list. But the view taken by the High Court that since the vacancies
have not been worked out properly, therefore, the candidates from the waiting list
were liable to be appointed does not appear to be sound. This practice, may result in
depriving those candidates who become eligible for competing for the vacancies
available in future. If the waiting list in one examination was to operate was an
infinite stock for appointments, there is a danger that the State Government may
resort to the device of not holding an examination for years together and pick up
candidates from the waiting list as and when required. The constitutional discipline
requires that this Court should not permit such improper exercise of power which
may result in creating a vested interest and perpetrate waiting list for the candidates
of one examination at the cost of entire set of fresh candidates either from the open
or even from service."
14. Prem Singh case [1996] 4 SCC 319 was decided on the facts of that case and those facts do not
hold good in the present case. In the case of Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013
dt.19-09-2016 20 Gujarat State Dy. Executive Engineers Association [1994] Supp. 2 SCC 591, this
Court has explained the scope and intent of a waiting list and how it is to operate in service
jurisprudence.
It cannot be used as a perennial source of recruitment filling up the vacancies not advertised. The
Court also did not approve the view of the High Court that since vacancies had not been worked out
properly, therefore, the candidates from the waiting list were liable to be appointment. Candidates
in the waiting list have no vested right to be appointed except to the limited extent that when a
candidate selected against the existing vacancy does not join for some reason and the waiting list is
still operative.
15. It is in no uncertain words that this Court has held that it would be improper exercise of power to
make appointments over and above those advertised. It is only in rare and exceptional
circumstances and in emergent situation that this rule can be deviated from. It should be clearly
spelled out as to under what policy such a decision has been taken. Exercise of such power has to be
tested on the touch stone of reasonableness. Before any advertisement is issued, it would, therefore,
be incumbent upon the authorities to take into account the existing vacancies and anticipated
vacancies. It is not as a matter of course that the authority can fill up more posts than advertised."
(Underlining for emphasis) Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 21 Similar
issue came for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of A.P. Aggarwal (supra).
In this case, an advertisement was published for appointment of Member of Sales Tax Appellate
Tribunal, one M.L. Sahni was appointed but later on he was selected in the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal and Mr. A.P. Aggarwal was the next person in the panel was not appointed but the
Government has embarked fresh process of selection by issuing advertisement in the newspaper.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court has interpreted a memorandum considering the contingency of
preparation of panel but in a case when the vacancies are not filled up or certain persons resigns or
did not join, it was pointed out that the post could not be remained vacant for a long period. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 11
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
matter was examined by the Government in consultation with the UPSC, it was decided that the
reserve seats will be operated in case where vacancy is created by a candidate resigning the post or
in the event of death within a period of six months from the date of joining the post subject to the
condition that such an operation of the lists should be limited in respect of statutory post and those
of scientific, technical, academic or medical nature or other similar nature where it may not be
possible to keep the post vacant till the completion of fresh recruitment or to make local
arrangements. In such a situation, the Supreme Court has directed the appointment of Mr. A.P.
Aggarwal. The Supreme Court while giving Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013
dt.19-09-2016 22 direction for appointment has held that a person selected in panel does not have a
vested right to be appointed to the post for which he was selected has a right for reconsideration for
appointment and at the same time, the appointing authority cannot ignore the select panel or
decline to make an appointment on its whims and capricious. It would be relevant to quote
paragraph no.12, 13, 14 and 15 of the judgment which reads as follows:-
"12. It is well settled that every State action, in order to survive, must not be
susceptible to the vice of arbitrariness which is the crux of Article 14 of the
Constitution and basic to the rule of law, the system which governs ns. (vide
Shrilekha Vtdyarthi versus_State.of U.P. ((1991) I S.C.C. 212): (AIR 1991 SC 537).
13. Learned Additional Solicitor General referred to the judgment of this Court in
Madan Lal and Others versus State of J -& K and Others ( (1995) 3 S.C.C. 486 : (1995
AIR SCW 1109: AIR 1995 SC 1088)) and placed reliance on Paragraph 23 of the
judgment at Page 502 (of SCC para 22) (at p. 1123 of AIR). That ruling has no
relevance in the present case. The advertisement was for applications to the post of
Munsif. According to the advertisement, there were 11 vacancies to be filled up and
the requisition to the Public Service Commission was to select II persons for filling up
the said seven vacancies. While sending the list of selected candidates, die Public
Service Commission sent a list containing more names than I Patna High Court
CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 23 I. That was obviously with a view to fill up
the vacancies, if any of the 11 candidates according to their merit did not join., from
among the 11 candidates in the waiting list according to their merit. The Bench held
that once the 11 candidates who were selected joined the post, the list got exhausted
and the waiting list could not be used for any purpose thereafter. That principle will
not apply in the present case in view of the facts already set out by us.
14. ------------ The Bench observed that though a person on the select panel has no
vested right to be appointed to the post for which he has been selected has a right to
be considered for appointment and at the same time the appointing authority cannot
not ignore the select panel or decline to make an appointment on its whims. The
Court said that when a person has been selected by the Selection Board and there is a
vacancy which can be offered to him, keeping in view his merit position, ordinarily
there is no justification to ignore him for appointment and that there has to be a
justifiable reason to decline to appoint a. person who is on the select panel. ----------

696: (1999 AIR SCW 1327: AIR 1999 SC 1701). The Haryana Service Commission
advertised 12 posts of Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch). On completion of
selection final list was published. Some of the selected candidates did not join and the
appellant Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 24 contended
that they should have been considered against die vacancies so arising, depending
upon the ranking obtained by the appellants in the competitive examination.
--------------------."
Another latest judgment is in the case of Kulwinder Pal Singh (supra). In this case, the matter
relates to appointment of judicial officer. Altogether 52 posts were advertised, 27 posts for the
general category, 25 posts for the reserved category which include 3 posts for ex-servicemen; 2 posts
for physically handicapped, 10 posts for scheduled castes, 3 posts for backward class ex-serviceman
and 1 post for backward classes, 1 post for backward class ex-servicemen and 1 post for sports
person. 27 candidates of general category, 10 candidates of scheduled castes and 5 candidates from
backward classes were declared successful and they accordingly joined and eights posts were
de-reserved. Against that, 7 candidates from the general category and 1 candidate from backward
classes were offered appointment. However, three candidates at serial nos. 1, 5 and 32 did not join
the service. A writ application was filed where a pleading was made that three persons did not join
and they should be appointed. The High Court refused to grant relief as having held that 27
vacancies which were notified for general candidate were filled up and no vacancy is available for
them. The matter went to the Supreme Court where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has refused to grant
relief as Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 25 having been held that the
Select list cannot be treated as a reservoir for the purpose of appointment, that vacancy can be filled
by up taking the names from the list as and when it is so required. A person whose name appears in
the select list does not acquire any indefeasible right of appointment. Empanelment at the best is a
condition of eligibility for the purpose of appointment and by itself does not amount to selection or
create a vested right to be appointed. The vacancies have to be filled up as per the statutory rules
and in conformity with the constitutional mandate. The appointment made beyond number of
vacancy advertised is without jurisdiction, violative of Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India
and thus nullity, in- executable and unenforceable in law. The moment the vacancy stands filled up,
the process of selection comes to an end and unexhausted waiting list becomes meaningless and
cannot be pressed in service in any manner. It is relevant to quote paragraph nos. 10, 11, 12 and 13 of
the said judgment which reads as follows:-
"10. It is fairly well-settled that merely because the name of a candidate finds place in
the select list, it would not give him indefeasible right to get an appointment as well.
The name of a candidate may appear in the merit list but he has no indefeasible right
to an appointment (vide Food Corporation of India v. Bhanu Lodh,(2005) 3 SCC 618;
All India SC & ST Employees' Assn. v. A. Arthur Jeen (2001) 6 SCC 380 and UPSC v.

11. This Court again in the case of State of Orissa v.
Rajkishore Nanda. (2010) 6 SCC 777, held as under:
"14. A person whose name appears in the select list does not acquire any indefeasible
right of appointment. Empanelment at the best is a condition of eligibility for the
purpose of appointment and by itself does not amount to selection or create a vested
right to be appointed. The vacancies have to be filled up as per the statutory rules and
in conformity with the constitutional mandate.
* * *
16. A select list cannot be treated as a reservoir for the purpose of appointments, that vacancy can be
filled up taking the names from that list as and when it is so required..."
12. In Manoj Manu v. Union of India 2013 (10) SCALE 204: (2013) 12 SCC 171, it was held that
merely because the name of a candidate finds place in the select list, it would not give the candidate
an indefeasible right to get an appointment as well. It is always open to the government not to fill up
the vacancies, however such decision should not be arbitrary or unreasonable. Once the decision is
found to be based on some valid reason, the court would not issue any mandamus to government to
fill up the vacancies. As noticed earlier, because twenty two other candidates were declared
successful by the Supreme Court pertaining to the selection of the years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001
as Civil Judges (Junior Division), they were to be accommodated, as Patna High Court CWJC
No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 27 rightly resolved by the Administrative Committee in the meeting
dated 06.07.2011. The three resultant vacancies of the year 2007-2008 stood consumed with the
joining of the said seventeen candidates and the same could not be filled up from the select list of
that year. The decision of the Administrative Committee observing that the three resultant vacancies
stood consumed is based on factual situation arising there and cannot be said to be arbitrary.
14. As noticed earlier, as against twenty seven posts of general category advertised for the year
2007-2008, thirty one general category candidates have joined and are working. In Rakhi Ray v.
High Court of Delhi (2010) 2 SCC 637, observing that the vacancies cannot be filled up over and
above the number of vacancies advertized, recruitment of the candidates in excess of the notified
vacancies would amount to denial of equal opportunity to eligible candidates, this Court held as
under: (SCC pp. 642- 43, paras 12-13) "12. In view of above, the law can be summarised to the effect
that any appointment made beyond the number of vacancies advertised is without jurisdiction,
being violative of Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution of India, thus, a nullity, inexecutable and
unenforceable in law. In case the vacancies notified stand filled up, the process of selection comes to
an end. Waiting list, etc. cannot be used as a reservoir, to fill up the vacancy which comes into
existence Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 28 after the issuance of
notification/ advertisement. The unexhausted select list/ waiting list becomes meaningless and
cannot be pressed in service any more.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 14
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
13. In the instant case, as 13 vacancies of the general category had been advertised and filled up, the
selection process so far as the general category candidates is concerned, stood exhausted and the
unexhausted select list is meant only to be consigned to record room."
In the case of Jai Narain Ram (supra), the issue came for consideration of waiting list of candidates
in scheduled caste category who were selected but did not join with respect to the appointment of
Treasury Officers cum Accounts Officers in the U.P. Finance and Accounts Services, Sales Tax
Officers and Regional Audit Officers. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if certain selected
person did not join the services, the next person cannot be refused their appointment. It would be
relevant to quote paragraph ns. 4, 6 and 7 of the said judgment which reads as follows:-
"4. In paragraph 11 of the special leave petition, a specific stand has been taken in
paragraph 11 that the four candidates selected by the PSC, namely, Ram Bodh, Roll
No.22142, Serial No.13, Lolark Ram, Roll No.442, Serial No. 23, Ram Daras
Chandrahas, Roll No.2301, Serial No.24, and Raja Ram, Roll No. 1787, Serial No.30,
though selected and recommended for appointment in the first category, did not join
in the Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 29 service. As a
consequence, 4 posts were left vacant and required to be filled up by the reserved
candidates. Since the appellant is the fourth candidate among the candidates who
were standing in the order of merit, rejection of the appellant's claim for appointment
is illegal and unconstitutional.
6. It is not in dispute that the appellant is a reserved candidate belonging to
Scheduled Castes. In view of the admitted position that four posts were reserved in
the Finance Department in Category 1 mentioned earlier and 4 selected candidates
appeared to have not joined in the service, as asserted in paragraph 11 of the SLP and
not specifically denied by the respondents sin the counter-affidavit in paragraph 6 as
referred to earlier, it is clear that the appellant also is the fourth candidate in the
order of merit and would have been selected, had there been a requisition by the
State Government for appointment of the reserved candidates.
7. Right to seek appointment to a post under Article 14 read with Articles 16(1) and
(4) is a constitutional right to equality. The State failed to perform its constitutional
duty to requisition the P.S.C. to recommend the next qualified persons to the posts
reserved for scheduled castes. Under these circumstances, the denial of appointment
to the appellant and three others above him is unconstitutional, Therefore, the
respondents are not justified in denying the claim of the appellant for the
appointment to the above post."
An identical issue came for consideration before this Court on a number of occasions and one of
such cases is the case of Ranjit Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 30 Kumar
Singh Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 1997(2) PLJR 960 where the matter relates to
appointment of Judicial Officer related to 24th Judicial Service Examination, 245 posts were
notified and from that few selected candidates did not join the post, writ was filed for appointment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 15
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
of persons from waiting list, the State took a plea that in view of Circular dated 17.6.1977 and
resolution dated 29.10.1988 which provides that the vacancy remained unfilled due to non-joining
the post or for any reason, shall be carried forward to next year. The Court has discussed the 1977
circular and gave a finding that the Government has merely relied the aforesaid circular that the
unfilled vacancy on account of non-joining of the candidates are to be carried forward to the next
year but not acted upon in terms of the said resolution The Court has considered the large number
of judgments of Supreme Court specially the judgment passed in the case of Bhogeshwarudu Vs.
Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission reported in 1989(4) Judgments Today 130 where the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has said that if out of the names recommended for appointment, some
candidates did not join, whether the vacancies remaining unfilled should or should not be filled up
from out of the remaining successful candidate. It has been held that there is no justification in the
stand of Public Service Commission that instead of filing up the vacancies by recommending the
candidates next in order of merit out of the present Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013
dt.19-09-2016 31 list but to go for fresh selection should be made. Ultimately, the Court has directed
the Public Service Commission to send recommendation and make appointment against the 9
vacant posts. It is relevant to quote paragraph nos. 11 & 12 of the said judgment which reads as
follows:-
"11. In view of the decision in Shankarsan Dash (supra) I wanted to know from the
counsel for the State/BPSC as to whether any decision had been taken to close the
selection/recruitment process on the basis of 24th Judicial Service Examination by
including the unfilled vacancies in the advertisement for the next examination i.e.
25th Judicial Service Examination. The counsel for the State in no uncertain terms
that this has not been done. As a matter of fact, they merely relied on the above said
circular dated 17th June 1977 that unfilled vacancies on account of non-joining of the
candidates "are to be" carried forward to the next year. The supplementary counter
affidavit of the State also merely states that "the vacancies available due to
non-joining of candidates are to be carried forward to the next year." The fact of the
matter is that this has not been done so far.
12. In Bhogeshwarudu vs. Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission [1989(4)
Judgments Today 130] the Supreme Court directed that unfilled vacancies on
account of non-joining of selected candidates be filled up out of the list of successful
candidates of the concerned examination. It would be useful to quote the following
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 32 observations from the
aforesaid judgment:-
"The only point which requires consideration is as to whether if out of the names
recommended for appointment, some candidates do not join, whether the vacancies
remaining unfilled should or should not be filled up from out of the remaining
successful candidates. We see no justification in the stand of the State Public Service
Commission that instead of filling up the vacancies by recommending the candidates
next in order of merit out of the present list why a fresh selection should be made."

In Asha Kaul vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir [(1993) 2 SCC 573] after noticing Shankarsan Dash
case, the Supreme Court observed, that though mere inclusion in the select list does not confer upon
the candidate any indefeasible right to appointment, but that is only one aspect of the matter. The
other aspect is the obligation of the Government to fill up all the posts for which requisition was
given and advertisement was made. In Jai Narain Ram vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (AIR 1996
Supreme Court 1703), relied upon by counsel for the petitioner, 15 posts of Treasury
Officers-Accounts Officers in the U.P. Finance and Accounts Service, amongst others, were
advertised. The Commission recommended as many candidates. No waiting list was prepared. 4
selected candidates did not join. The petitioner claiming to be the 4th candidate in waiting in order
of merit filed a writ petition Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 33 which was
dismissed. The Supreme Court held that the State had failed to perform its constitutional duties to
requisition the Commission to recommend the next qualifying candidate to the post reserved for the
particular reserved category and directed the Commission to recommend the name of the petitioner
and, in turn, the State to issue order of appointment within time-frame."
In the case of Ashutosh Kumar Vinayak (supra), a similar issue came for consideration related to
appointment of APP, the APP panel was prepared and exhausted, certain vacancy was created in
view of the creation of new Munsiff Courts whereas the strength of APP was not matching with the
number of increased courts (courts), writ was filed for giving direction to the State to send
requisition for appointment of APP from the old panel prepared but the Court refused to grant relief
on the ground that all the appointments as was notified has already been made and, as such, the list
stood exhausted and held that the waiting list cannot be used as a perennial source of recruitment.
The candidates in the waiting list have no vested right to be appointed except to the limited extent
that when a candidate selected against the existing vacancy does not join for some reason and the
waiting list would remain operative for the purpose aforesaid. The candidates included in the
waiting list cannot claim appointment on the ground that the vacancies were not worked out
properly. It will Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 34 be relevant to quote
paragraph nos. 12, 15, 16 and 17 which reads as follows:-
"12. ----------- In cases of non-joining of any candidates appointed against notified
vacancies, a person from the said panel which becomes waiting list is to be appointed,
but no appointment can be made from the said panel or writing list in excess of the
posts advertised unless so or the State Government takes a policy decision to meet
certain extreme or urgent situation.-------.
15. The Same principle has been reiterated by the Apex Court in the case of Surinder
Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and another, (1997) 8 Supreme Court Cases 488)
and it has been held that waiting list cannot be used as a perennial source of
recruitment for filling up the vacancies not advertised. The candidates in the waiting
list have no vested right to be appointed except to the limited extent that when a
candidate selected against the existing vacancy does not join for some reason and the
waiting list is still operative. The candidates included in the waiting list cannot claim
appointment on the ground that the vacancies were not worked out properly.

Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
16. Reference in this connection may also be made to the judgments of the Supreme
Court reported in (1997) 4 Supreme Court Cases 283 (Sanjoy Bhatacharjee vs. Union
of India and others), (1997)5 Supreme Court Cases 171 (Hindustan Steel Works
Construction Ltd. vs. State of Kerala and others), (1997)6 Supreme Court Cases 255
(State of Haryana and others vs. Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013
dt.19-09-2016 35 Ajaywalla (Ms).
17. Thus the law is well settled that in case the vacancies are notified in the
advertisement then the appointment from the select list is to be made to the extent of
vacancies notified in the advertisement and no appointment is to be made in excess
of the post advertised except to fill up the posts available due to non-joining or some
exceptional or emergent situation as stated above.------"
In the case of Dr. Surendra Kumar (supra), the Court has also reiterated the position of law that the
recommended candidate has no legal right to be appointed on the post but, in such a situation, the
State is required to give reason for not appointing the recommended candidates. It is relevant to
quote paragraph no.12 of this judgment which reads as follows:-
"12. Having appreciated the rival submission, I do not find any substance in the
submission of Govt. Pleader No.1 and the point is not res integra. This Court had the
occasion to consider this question in the case of Jonoon Sangi vs. The State of Bihar
& Ors. 2002(2) PLJR 577 in which it has been held that the recommendation made
by the Commission shall not be infructuous necessitating de novo selection on
account of reorganization of the State. Para-5 of the said judgment which is relevant
for the purpose reads as follows:-
"5. It is well known that recommendee has no legal right to be appointed on the post
but in such a situation the State is required Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of
2013 dt.19-09-2016 36 to give reason for not appointing the recommended
candidates. In view of Section 71 of the Bihar Reorganization Act, 2000 read with
Article 315(2) of the Constitution of India recommendation made by B.P.S.C. would
not be binding on the State of Jharkhand but it does not mean that recommendation
would not be given effect and it shall be made infructuous necessitating de novo
selection. The Government of Bihar has allocated two third post in the State of Bihar
other than the post of Forest Department. Therefore, I find substance in the
submission of learned counsel for the petitioner that out of 81 vacancies 54 vacancies
advertised by Advertisement No. 88/98 were meant for the State of Bihar. However,
the Court accepts the stand of the respondents with respect to recalculation but that
cannot be a ground for de novo selection on the basis of fresh requisition. Therefore,
stand of the respondents, in my opinion, is not reasonable. In similar situation a
Bench of this court in the case of Subhas Chandra Yadav & Ors. vs. The State of Bihar
& Ors. C.W.J.C. No. 11491/2001 disposed of on 8.10.2001 has directed the
respondents to consider the recommended persons against available vacancies after
identifying and calculating the vacancies. In the circumstances, I feel no hesitation in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 18
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
issuing Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 37 writ directing
the respondents to consider the recommendation of B.P.S.C. and appoint the
petitioner against available vacancies after calculating the vacancies."
In the case of Subodh Kumar (supra), the issue was raised of right of a person in the panel in the
event the selected candidate did not join. The State has taken a plea that in view of Circular of 1977
and reiterated in 2007 provides that in case a person appointed does not report for duty, the
resulting vacancy is required to be carried forward. In corollary, the person whose name standing in
the panel, vacancy created in such manner, will not get any chance for his appointment in the post.
The Court has discussed large number of cases. It has been held that once the selection process in
respect of number of vacancies so notified comes to an end, it is no more open to give offer of
appointment to person from the unexhausted list. The purpose of making list of double of the
vacancies notified is to offer the appointment to the persons from the waiting list in case the persons
who are offered appointment do not join but it does not give any vested right in favour of the
candidates whose names appeared therein. The court has placed reliance on a circular dated
17.6.1977 which provides that the remaining unfilled vacancies due to candidates not joining the
post or for any other reason shall be carried forward to the next year and the court held that the
judgment in the Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 38 matter of Niraj Kumar
Singh & Anr. reported in 2007(3) PLJR 702 does not set out the correct law and has been declared
per incurium. It is relevant to quote paragraph nos. 19, 20, 21 and 23 of this judgment which reads
as follows:-
"19. In view of the aforesaid policy of the State Government, the settled law discussed
hereinabove and the binding precedents of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the
Division Bench of this Court, we must hold that the judgment in the matter of Niraj
Kumar Singh & Anr. (supra) does not set out the correct law and is per incurium the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the matter of Bihar State Electricity Board (supra).
The finding that the 17th June 1977 Circular (sic: Memorandum) was never followed
is not supported by the facts on record and is erroneous. Anyway, in view of the
subsequent judgments of the Division Bench, it is not a good law.
20. In view of the binding instructions issued by the State Government to carry
forward the unfilled vacancy to the next recruitment process, the relief sought for by
the petitioner cannot be granted. Further, since the recruitment pursuant to the
Advertisement No. 4 of 2007, the Commission has already commenced the next
recruitment process by holding the Preliminary Test preceding the 53rd to 55th
Common Combined Competitive Examination.
21. The contention that a panel once prepared is operative till the next panel is
prepared is equally Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 39
misconceived, contrary to the aforesaid Memorandum of 1977 and the Resolution of
2007 and has no legs to stand on. Although neither the Memorandum of 1977 nor the
Resolution of 2007 specifically provides for how long the panel shall be operative.
However, clause (xi) of the Memorandum of 1977 specifically provides that the

Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
recommendation made by the Commission shall correspond to the number of actual
vacancies. The same reads as under:-
"(xi) The number of candidates recommended by the Commission for appointment
out of the merit list thus drawn up shall correspond to the number of actual
vacancies."
22. In our opinion, the conjoint reading of the above referred clauses (xi) and (xiv) of
the Memorandum of 1977 coupled with the settled law that not more than advertised
vacancies can be filled in pursuant to a selection process, establish by necessary
implication that once the Commission makes the recommendation for the vacancies
advertised, the merit list stands exhausted. No further appointment can be made
from such merit list.
23. In our view the claim made by the petitioner is misconceived. The relief prayed
for by him cannot be granted."
An identical issue came for consideration in the case of Manoj Manu & Anr. Vs. Union of India &
Ors. reported in 2013(4) PLJR 88 (SC). In this case, Manoj Manu was working as an Assistant in the
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 40 Central Secretariat Service (CSS),
appeared in the Limited Departmental Competitive Examination for the next promotion to the post
of Section Officer's Grade in that service. There are two channels of promotion, one by way of
seniority and other fast track in the form of Limited Departmental Competitive Examination. Manoj
Manu appeared in the said examination conducted by the UPSC, on the requisition for 184
candidates in two lots, first lot of 141 candidates were found to be suitable candidate for the said
post whereas second lot of 43 successful candidates were recommended for appointment. Out of
them 6 candidates did not join. Later on, requisition was made of three candidates from the
reserved list, two candidates from the merit list were refused appointment, Manoj Manu approached
to the Tribunal alleging arbitrary act of UPSC in denying him to get his appointment. The hon'ble
Supreme Court placing reliance in the case of Ms. Neelima Shangla Vs. State of Haryana reported in
(1986)3 SCR 785 and State of Haryana Vs. Subash Chander Marwaha reported in AIR 1973 SC 2216
has held that the person whose name is included in the select list does not acquire any right to be
appointed. The Government may decide not to fill up the vacancy for the valid reasons. The reasons
should be not arbitrary or unreasonable and must be based on sound and rational reason. If it is
found that the decision of the Government is based on some valid reason, the Court would refuse to
issue any Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 41 mandamus to the
Government to fill up the vacancies. It will be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 14 and 17 of his
judgment which reads as follows:-
"14. It is, thus, manifest that though a person whose name is included in the select list, does not
acquire any right to be appointed. The Government may decide not to fill up all the vacancies for
valid reasons. Such a decision on the part of the Government not to fill up the required/advertised
vacancies should not be arbitrary or unreasonable but must be based on sound, rational and
conscious application of mind. Once, it is found that the decision of the Government is based on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 20
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
some valid reason, the Court would not issue any Mandamus to Government to fill up the vacancies.
17. This Court in Sandeep Singh vs. State of Haryana & Anr. (2002) 10 SCC 549 commended that the
vacancies available should be filled up unless there is any statutory embargo for the same. In
Virender S. Hooda & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana & Anr. AIR 1999 SC 1701, 12 posts for direct
recruitment were available when the advertisement for recruitment was made which was held in the
year 1991. Some of the selected candidates did not join in this batch almost similar to the present
case, the Court held that the appellant's case ought to have been considered when some of the
candidates for reasons of the non- appointment of some of the candidates and they ought to have
been appointed if they come within the range of selection."
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 42 This Court has also considered an
identical issue in CWJC No. 236 of 2016 (Manjeet Kumar Vs. State of Bihar) reiterating the same
principle, a direction was given to appoint the person in case of non-joining of the selected
candidates. On conspectus of the principles of law laid down that has been delineated by the
Supreme Court and this Court, it emerges that mere appearance of the name in the select list does
not create indefeasible right but equally important that the Government must act reasonably,
properly, not in whim and capricious but must be based on sound reasoning and so much so that
when certain selected candidates does not join, in such circumstances, on the valid reason, the
appointment can be refused but normally benefit of appointment must be conferred on the person
whose name is standing next in the list of selected candidate so long the panel remained statutorily
valid. In the present case, applying the principles with regard to making appointment of the persons
whose name stands in the waiting list can be accommodated in case certain persons did not join the
post. It is also a principle of law that the waiting list cannot be used as reservoir for the future
appointment. The moment the number of vacancies notified is filled up will be treated to have been
exhausted. No future vacancy will be filled up from the panel of waiting list.
In the present case, the selection was initiated in the year Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013
dt.19-09-2016 43 1999, at the relevant time 331 posts of Assistant were advertised, result was
published in the year 2002 but in the meantime, the Bihar Re-organization Act, 2000 came into
effect on 15.11.2000, created a confusion as to whether a selection is to be made to 331 posts or
2/3rd candidates in view of old reservation rule or the amended rule. Ultimately, the issue was
resolved, it was held that the selection has to be made on 2/3rd vacancy, inasmuch as, it was also
decided that the selection would be made in terms of old reservation rule. The 221 persons i.e. 2/3rd
of the total vacancy notified out of which 15 vacancy falling under the scheduled tribe category were
dropped, finally it was decided to fill up 206 vacancy of successful candidates. Out of 206
candidates, 180 candidates joined and 26 posts remained vacant on account of non-joining of the
selected candidates.
Normally, this Court would have directed for filling up of the post on account of non-joining of the
25 candidates but a question would arise, after lapse of such a long period about 16 years, would it
be advisable to issue mandamus for appointment of the petitioners on account of non-joining 25
candidates as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the panel of waiting list candidates
cannot be used for the reservoir for filling up of the future vacancy. At the same time, this Court in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161155849/ 21
Dhirendra Kumar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 19 September, 2016
the case of Subodh Kumar (supra) considered the 1977 resolution as well as 2007 resolution and
after considering of the Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 44 same, it has
been held that the life of panel is one year, if any vacancy left out on account of non-joining, the
same would be carry forward for the next year of the selection. Even keeping aside the resolution, as
it has been argued that major portion of the resolution has not been followed but merely because it
has been mentioned that he life of the vacancy is one year and any vacancy remained unfilled will be
carry forward, the situation will not improve in the sense that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
repeatedly held that either in the case of Subash Chander Marwaha (supra) wherein a caution has
been given that the power should not be exercised in an arbitrary in whim and capricious manner
but must be based upon sound reason as well as in the case of Manoj Manu (supra), the Court has
also held that in normal circumstances, the Government is bound to fill up the vacancy except a
decision is based on good reasoning, not suffering from whims and capricious as has been held by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.G. Jaisinghani Vs. Union of India & Ors. reported in AIR
1967 SC 1427 that absence of arbitrariness is essential part of rule of law. If a decision is taken
without principle or without any rule of unpredictable, such decision is antithesis of decision taken
in accordance with rule of law. It would be relevant to quote paragraph no.14 of the said judgment
which reads as follows:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 45 "(14) In this context it is
important to emphasize that the absence of arbitrary power is the first essential of the
rule of law upon which our whole constitutional system is based. In a system
governed by rule of law, discretion, when conferred upon executive authorities, must
be confined within clearly defined limits. The rule of law from this point of view
means that decisions should be made by the application of known principles and
rules and, in general, such decisions should be predictable and the citizen should
know where he is. If a decision is taken without any principle or without any rule it is
unpredictable and such a decision is the antithesis of a decision taken in accordance
with the rule of law.
(See Dicey-"Law of the Constitution"-Tenth Edn., Introduction cx). "Law has reached its finest
moments,". stated Douglas, J. in United States v. Wunderlick, (1951) 342 US 98, "when it has freed
man from he unlimited discretion of some ruler........ Where discretion is absolute, man has always
suffered". It is in this sense that the rule of law may be said to be the sworn enemy of caprice.
Discretion, as Lord Mansfield stated it in classic terms in the case of John Wilkes(1770) 4 Burr 2528
at p. 2539 "means sound discretion guided by law. It must be governed by rule, not by humour: it
must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful."
The plea of Government that on account of the long lapse of time and so much so that as those
vacancies have merged with the subsequent advertisement cannot be said suffering arbitrariness. In
Patna High Court CWJC No.23417 of 2013 dt.19-09-2016 46 such view of the matter, this Court
cannot issue a writ of mandamus after delay of long lapse of times for the appointment of these
petitioners.

Thus, this court does not find any merit in this writ application and the same is, accordingly,
dismissed but without any costs.
