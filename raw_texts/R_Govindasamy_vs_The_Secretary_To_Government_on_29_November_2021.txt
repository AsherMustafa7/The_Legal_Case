ORDER
This writ petition is filed to issue a Writ of Declaration declaring that the proceedings initiated
under Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in respect of the petitioner's land measuring 1 acre in S.No.17/1,
present S.No.17/9, A Reddyhalli Village, Dharmapuri Taluk and District stands lapsed by virtue of
Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
2. The petitioner challenged the acquisition proceedings in respect of the land measuring 1 acre in
S.No.17/1, present S.No.17/9, A Reddyhalli Village, Dharmapuri Taluk and District under the Right
to Fair https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 on the ground that the compensation has not been paid
and the possession has not been taken over so far. The petitioner's father owned land measuring 1
acre comprised in survey no.17/1A at present 17/9 of A Reddyhalli Village, Dharmapuri. Out of 1.95
acres of dry land acquired under sale deed dated 07.04.1964 registered vide document No.1922 on
the file of the Joint II Sub Registrar Office, Dharmapuri. While being so, the second respondent
issued notice under Sections 9(1) and 10 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. However, the said
acquisition proceedings was challenged by his father in WP.No.1314 of 1970 and the same was
dismissed by this Court by order dated 24.04.1970 itself. After completion of all procedures, award
was passed on 31.07.1969 in award No.4/1969- 1970 by the third respondent. Thereafter, list of
beneficiaries was prepared by the third respondent and also duly approved by the District
Adidravidar and Tribal Welfare Officer, Dharmapuri. House site pattas were also distributed to all
the beneficiaries. In fact, the petitioner filed suit in OS.No.120 of 2006 for seeking permanent
injunction on the file of the District Munsif Court, Dharmapuri and the same was also dismissed
against https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the respondents 2 and 3 herein. Insofar as the
compensation is concerned, it was deposited before the District Court, Dharmapuri as BR.No.99
dated 12.09.1969 in OP.No.63 of 1969 also in Diary No.4061 dated 30.06.1969.

Therefore, the grounds raised by the petitioner that the physical possession of the land was not
taken and the compensation has not been paid are not available for the petitioner herein.
3. The grounds raised by the petitioner in this Writ Petition have already been settled by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the judgment reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129 in the case of Indore
Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors etc., which held as follows :-
“366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis period covered by an interim order of the court,
then proceedings shall continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013
under the Act of 1894 as if it has not been repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of authorities for
five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has
not been taken nor compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession
has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly, if
compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not
include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is
provided in proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to
majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of
notification for land https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis acquisition under Section 4 of
the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of
the Act of 2013. In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of
1894 has not been fulfilled, interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted.
Non-deposit of compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land
acquisition proceedings. In case of non-
deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation under the Act
of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date of notification for land acquisition under
Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the Act
of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to
non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183699078/ 3
R.Govindasamy vs The Secretary To Government on 29 November, 2021
tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or
who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not part of
Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is
by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession
under Section 16 of the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section
24(2).
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case
authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years
or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with
concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has
to be excluded in the computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis give rise to new cause
of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to
a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive
stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to
question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of
compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.”
4. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India settled all proposition of law in the above judgment
including the grounds raised by the petitioner. That apart, the acquisition proceedings have been
completed and the subject land was taken over by the government and the same was handed over to
the requisition body. Further the requisition body also deposited the compensation as awarded by
the Land Acquisition Officer. Therefore, the petitioner failed to satisfy the twin requirements under
Section 24 (2) of the New Act, i.e., the physical possession of the land was not taken and the
compensation has not been paid/tendered/deposited in accordance with law.
In view of the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis issues raised by the petitioner were settled and therefore, the
acquisition proceedings have not been lapsed by operation of law under Section 24 (2) of the new
Act i.e., Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013. In view of the settled position of law, the writ petition is devoid of merits
and liable to be dismissed.
5. In the result, the Writ Petition stands dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition
is closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
