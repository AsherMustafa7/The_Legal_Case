taking over of the charge and later it was discerned that the materials worth Rs. 5,00,000/- was
found short at Sheikhpura Section-2 where the husband of the petitioner was posted.

4. When the process of recovery of the aforesaid amount was initiated by the Department, a Bench
of this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 7951 of 2006 directed the Engineer- Patna High Court CWJC No.1295
of 2019 dt.23-01-2019 in-Chief of the Department to conduct regular enquiry by giving opportunity
to the husband of the petitioner to defend himself and the order, directing for recovery of the
amount, was stayed.
5. Later, in a slipshod manner, a punishment in the nature of recovery of Rs. 5,00,682/- from the
salary of the petitioner was passed by order dated 28.10.1998.
6. The husband of the petitioner, therefore, challenged the aforesaid order before this Court, but the
same was permitted to be withdrawn for filing a statutory appeal, which was directed to be disposed
off within a stipulated period of three months.
7. Since the statutory appeal which was filed by the husband of the petitioner could not be disposed
off as directed by a Bench of this Court, the husband of the petitioner again approached this Court
vide C.W.J.C. No. 14157 of 2004, wherein this Court, after quashing the punishment/recovery order
dated 28.10.1998, directed the Department to deposit Rs. 5,00,682/- in a term deposit scheme in
any Nationalized Bank within a period of one Patna High Court CWJC No.1295 of 2019
dt.23-01-2019 month from the date of passing of the order and, thereafter, subject the husband of
the petitioner to an enquiry under Rule 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)
Rules, 1930.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that though this order was complied with,
but with a delay and only after a contempt petition was filed by the husband of the petitioner.
Thereafter, charges were framed against the husband of the petitioner, but the enquiry could not be
concluded as the husband of the petitioner died during the pendency of the proceedings.
9. In the aforesaid circumstances, the petitioner, who is the wife of the deceased employee, has
approached this Court for a direction to the respondent authorities to return the aforesaid amount,
which was deposited by the Department in a Nationalized Bank with the interest which has accrued
up-till-date and for other benefits which would have accrued to the deceased employee.
10. Some of the prayers made in the writ petitions are relatable to post retiral benefits for which this
Patna High Court CWJC No.1295 of 2019 dt.23-01-2019 Court is not holding the roster;
nonetheless, considering the fact that the primary demand of the petitioner is for return of the
amount which was deposited by the Department pending conclusion of the departmental
proceeding against the employee and such departmental proceeding not being completed because of
the death of such employee, the amount, so deposited, ought to be returned to the next kith and
kin/heir of the deceased employee, this Court is of the view that a decision in that regard ought to be
taken by the authorities without any delay.
11. This Court has further been informed that several representations have been filed before the
Principal Secretary, Road Construction Department, Govt. of Bihar, Patna (respondent No. 1) but till
date, no order has been passed and the representations of the petitioner have not been paid heed to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36464393/ 3

or acted upon.
12. In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court directs that in the event of the petitioner filing a fresh
representation within a period of four weeks from today with all facts along with the copy of this
present order, Patna High Court CWJC No.1295 of 2019 dt.23-01-2019 respondent No. 1, viz., the
Principal Secretary, Road Construction Department, Govt. of Bihar, Patna shall dispose off such
representation after looking into the entire aspect of the matter within a period of six weeks from
the date of filing of such representation.
13. In case, the petitioner feels aggrieved by the order passed by the respondent No. 1, she will have
the liberty to approach this Court again.
14. With respect to other retiral benefits accruing to the deceased employee which have been
claimed in the present writ petition, the petitioner has the liberty to agitate the same in a separate
petition before an appropriate forum.
15. With the aforesaid direction, the writ petition stands disposed off.
