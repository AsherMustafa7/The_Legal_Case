2. Heard the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and the learned
Additional Advocate General assisted by the learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the
respondents.
3. The case of the petitioner is as follows :
(i) The properties in S.No.33 measuring an extent of acres 34.54 cents, Padiyanallur
Village, Ponneri Taluk, Tiruvallur District were originally owned by one
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179555699/ 2
R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
Mr.Venkatagopal Rao. He died in 1943 leaving behind him his wife and two sons as
surviving legal heirs. Thereafter, the said properties were subdivided into S.Nos.33/3
and 33/4 measuring acres 16.44 cents and acres 18.10 cents respectively. Patta was
also issued in favour of the wife of the said Mr.Venkatagopal Rao.
(ii) Later, the said properties were sold by the owners through various sale deeds
executed from the years 1955 to 2001. The last three purchasers namely one
Mr.Jagaram, one Mr.Mohanlal and one Mr.Dharamveer took steps to develop the
properties purchased by them measuring acres 8.28 cents. Hence, their power agents
approached the fourth respondent for the issuance of patta based on the sale deeds.
But, they were informed that the subject properties namely acres 8.28 cents have
been classified as Government Wet https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) Anaadheenam in the A register as early as 1962.
(iii) In view of the same, on 20.5.2011, the three owners of the subject properties
applied for ryotwari patta before the fifth respondent under the Tamil Nadu Estates
(Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (for short, the Act). However,
vide proceedings dated 12.6.2011, the fifth respondent rejected the claim made by the
last purchasers of the subject properties on the ground that such a claim was made
after a long lapse of time.
(iv) As a consequence, the proceedings of the fifth respondent dated 12.6.2011 was
put to challenge before this Court by filing W.P. No.15175 of 2011 and it was allowed
by order dated 30.6.2011 by holding that there was no limitation for the fifth
respondent for granting patta under Section 11 of the Act, the order dated 12.6.2011
was set aside and the matter was remitted back to the fifth respondent to take a
decision on merits.
(v) Pursuant to the said direction of this Court, an inquiry was conducted by the
revenue officials, an inspection was also conducted and a report was also submitted.
As a follow up, the fifth respondent, vide proceedings dated 19.9.2011, directed the
issuance of patta to the last purchasers under the Act. Subsequently, patta No.3688
also https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm )
came to be issued. Thereafter, the last three purchasers sold the entire extent of acres
8.28 cents in favour of one M/s.Vidushi Wires Private Limited vide sale deed dated
30.11.2011 registered as doc.No.13875 of 2011 on the file of the Sub-Registrar, Red
Hills and patta was transferred in its name vide patta No.3805 dated 11.1.2012.
(vi) Later, the said M/s.Vidushi Wires Private Limited sold the subject properties to
the petitioner vide sale deed dated 12.6.2014 registered as doc.No.6030 of 2014 for a
valid sale consideration.
Subsequent to the purchase, patta was also issued in the name of the petitioner in patta No.5902 on
25.11.2014 by the fourth respondent. Thereafter, the chitta and adangal were also issued in the name
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179555699/ 3
R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
of the petitioner, who was in possession and enjoyment of the subject properties.
(vii) A complaint dated 18.8.2018 came to be filed by one Mr.K. Natarajan before the third
respondent. Pursuant to the said complaint, the third respondent, vide proceedings dated 18.2.2019,
cancelled the patta, which was already issued to the petitioner. Aggrieved by that, the petitioner filed
W.P.No.5648 of 2019. When the said writ petition was entertained, an interim order was passed
directing the revenue authorities to maintain status quo. Ultimately, the said writ petition
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) was allowed by order
dated 16.9.2019 directing the first respondent to exercise his revisional powers under Section 7 of
the Act and to pass appropriate orders within a time frame.
(viii) Pursuant to the said order dated 16.9.2019, the first respondent conducted an inquiry and
issued the impugned proceedings dated 27.11.2021 whereby the order passed by the fifth respondent
dated 19.9.2011 was set aside, the patta granted in favour of the petitioner was cancelled and a
further direction was given to restore the subject properties as Government Nanjai Anaadheenam in
the revenue records. Hence, the petitioner was constrained to file this writ petition.
4. The first respondent filed a counter affidavit for himself and on behalf of the other respondents
wherein they took the following stand:
The subject properties were recorded as Government Wet Anaadheenam before and
after the UDR scheme. The order dated 19.9.2011 was passed by the fifth respondent
without any power or jurisdiction. As per G.O.Ms.No.714 Commercial Taxes &
Religious Endowments Department dated 29.6.1987, the claim was barred and the
fifth respondent did not have power or jurisdiction to condone the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) delay in
such a time barred application. The first respondent exercised his powers under
Section 7(c) of the Act and found that the order dated 19.9.2011 passed by the fifth
respondent was irregular and accordingly, it was set aside. Ultimately, the
respondents sought for dismissal of this writ petition.
5. When the matter came up for hearing on 19.2.2025, this Court, after hearing the learned Senior
Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, passed the following order :
"This writ petition has been filed challenging the impugned proceedings of the 1st
respondent dated 27.11.2021 and for a consequential direction to the respondents to
restore the subject property as a Ryotwari patta land.
2. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that
initially, the property was owned by one Mohanlal and two others and they had
sought for issuance of Ryotwari patta under the Tamil Nadu Estate (Abolition and
Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 26 of 1948. The same came to be rejected by the
Assistant Settlement Officer [North] through proceedings dated 12.06.2011 on the
ground that such application is time barred under G.O.Ms.No.

R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) 714
dated 29.06.1987. This proceedings of the Assistant Settlement Officer was put to
challenge in WP.No.15175 of 2011 and this Court by an order dated 03.06.2011
allowed the writ petition and remitted the matter back to the file of the Assistant
Settlement Officer for passing appropriate orders. Pursuant to the said order, the
Assistant Settlement Officer through proceedings dated 19.09.2011 issued Ryotwari
patta in favour of G.Mohanlal and two others. It was submitted that this order passed
in the writ petition has become final inter partes and it was also complied with by
passing appropriate orders.
3. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the original owners thereafter
dealt with the property and the subsequent purchaser also obtained Ryotwari patta
and necessary mutation was made in the revenue records. Ultimately, the petitioner
purchased the property through a registered sale deed dated 12.06.2014. After the
purchase of the property, the revenue records were mutated in the name of the
petitioner and Ryotwari patta was issued in Ryotwari patta No.5902.
4. The DRO, Tiruvallur passed an order dated 18.02.2019, cancelling the Ryotwari
patta issued in favour of the petitioner. The same was put to challenge before this
Court in WP.No.5648 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025
02:15:09 pm ) of 2019. This writ petition was disposed of by an order dated
16.09.2019 and the relevant portions relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel are
extracted hereunder:
'7. This Court, considering the fact holds that the petitioner ought to have been given
an opportunity before cancelling the patta. He was not given opportunity before
cancellation of patta though the manner in which patta issued in his name may be
under cloud. Hence, without adverting to the other merits of the case, the order
passed by the District Revenue Officer, on 18.02.2019, which is impugned in this
Writ Petition is hereby set aside. The order passed by the 1st respondent/Assistant
Settlement Officer, dated 19.09.2011 and the complaint given by Mr.K. Natarajan/6th
respondent, which has triggered the enquiry proceedings and culminated in issuance
of impugned order shall be taken into consideration by Commissioner of Land
Reforms in exercise the power under Section 7 of the Tamil Nadu Estate (Abolition
and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948.
The Commissioner of Land Acquisition, shall scrutinise the order passed by the Assistant Settlement
Officer/1st respondent and pass appropriate order, in accordance with law, within a period of 60
days, from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, after affording opportunity to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) the petitioner and if
necessary, the complainant Mr.K.Natarajan/6th respondent.
8. In the result, the Writ Petition is disposed with direction that the impugned order in Na.Ka.
19491/2018/A3, dated 18.02.2019 is hereby quashed. The Commissioner of Land Acquisition, shall

R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
consider the order passed by the 1st respondent/Assistant Settlement Officer, dated 19.09.2011 by
exercising its revisional power under Section 7 of the Tamil Nadu Estate (Abolition and Conversion
into Ryotwari) Act, 1948, and pass appropriate orders within a period of 60 days, from the date of
receipt of a copy of this Order. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are
closed.'
5. Pursuant to the above order, the 1st respondent through the impugned proceedings dated
27.11.2021 has rejected the claim made by the petitioner.
6. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner primarily raised the following grounds :
(a) The 1st respondent has relied upon G.O.Ms.No.714, dated 29.06.1987 as one of
the reason for rejecting the claim made by the petitioner and such findings of the 1st
respondent goes contrary to the earlier order passed by this Court in WP.No.15175 of
2011, dated 30.06.2011, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) wherein this Court had interfered with the decision taken
by the Assistant Settlement Officer when the claim for Ryotwari patta was rejected by
placing reliance upon very same G.O. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that this
judgement passed in WP.No.15175 of 2011, is binding on both the parties and in fact
the said judgement was acted upon and Ryotwari patta was issued by the Assistant
Settlement Officer and hence the same ground cannot once again be revived; and
(b) The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the 1st respondent proceeded
to exercise his suo motu power under Section 7(c) of Act 26 of 1948 and such suo
motu power cannot be exercised in the instant case. To substantiate this submission,
the learned Senior Counsel relied upon the judgement of the Division Bench in
Rajathi and another v. The Principal Secretary & Commissioner of Land
Administration and another reported in 2013 2 CTC 129. The learned Senior Counsel
also relied upon the recent judgement passed by this Court in WP.No.3267 of 2023
dated 05.02.2025. Even though this judgement was passed under the Act 30 of 1963,
it will equally apply even insofar as the suo motu proceedings initiated under Act 26
of 1948.
7. The learned Special Government Pleader appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) that he is led by the
learned Additional Advocate General and sought for sometime.
8. Post this writ petition under the caption 'part heard cases' on 27.02.2025."
6. On the contrary, the learned Additional Advocate General appearing on behalf of the respondents
has submitted that the fifth respondent cannot condone the delay in view of the said Government
Order. To substantiate this submission, he relied upon a common judgment of a Division Bench of
this Court in the case of Tmt.Durab Zaman Begam & Others Vs. Director, King Institute of
Preventive Medicine & Research, Chennai-32 [W.A.Nos.271 & 272 of 2014 dated 06.12.2023]. He
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179555699/ 6
R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
further contended that such time barred claims cannot be entertained as the period has been
prescribed under the said Government Order.
7. In so far as the second issue that was captured in the earlier order dated 19.2.2025 is concerned,
the learned Additional Advocate General appearing on behalf of the respondents has submitted that
such suo motu powers are available to the first respondent under Section 7(c) of the Act and that
this power, which is available, has https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025
02:15:09 pm ) been further confirmed by a judgment of the Full Bench of this Court in the case of
Special Commissioner & Director of Survey & Settlement, Chennai-5 Vs. M.Arumugam [reported in
2007 (4) CTC 538]. He also submitted that this Full Bench judgment was subsequently followed in
various orders passed by this Court.
8. This Court has carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel on either side and
perused the materials available on record and more particularly the impugned order.
9. The fifth respondent passed the order dated 19.9.2011 granting ryotwari patta to the last three
purchasers namely the said Mr.Jagaram, the said Mr.Mohanlal and the said Mr.Dharamveer in
respect of the properties in S.No.33/4 by changing the classification to the extent of 3-35-5 hectares.
Thereafter, patta was issued in their names in patta No.3688 by the fourth respondent vide
proceedings dated 18.10.2011. The subject properties were thereafter sold on 30.11.2011 in favour of
the said M/s.Vidushi Wires Private Limited, which resulted in the issuance of patta in their name.
The said M/s. Vidushi Wires Private Limited, in turn, sold the subject properties in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) favour of the petitioner
vide sale deed dated 12.6.2014. Further, the patta was also issued in the name of the petitioner in
patta No.5902. The name of the petitioner was included in the chitta and adangal.
10. The entire problem started when the said Mr.K.Natarajan sent his complaint dated 18.8.2018 to
the third respondent objecting to the patta granted in favour of the petitioner. Based on that,
initially the patta was cancelled by the third respondent vide proceedings dated 18.2.2019. By order
dated 16.9.2019, this order was interfered by this Court in W.P.No.5648 of 2019 filed at the instance
of the petitioner and the matter was remanded to the file of the first respondent to exercise his
revisional power under Section 7 of the Act and to pass appropriate orders.
11. The first respondent mainly assigned two reasons for cancelling the patta issued in favour of the
petitioner. The first reason is that the fifth respondent had entertained a time barred application
and that G.O.Ms.No.714 dated 29.6.1987 has been issued barring any authority to condone the delay
in respect of the time barred applications.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm )
12. The first reason assigned by the first respondent is unsustainable. In the first round of litigation,
when the fifth respondent passed the order dated 12.6.2011 rejecting the claim made for the
issuance of patta on the ground of delay, this Court interfered with the said order dated 12.6.2011 in
W.P.No.15175 of 2011 by order dated 30.6.2011 and directed the fifth respondent to pass appropriate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179555699/ 7
R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
orders on merits. This Court also gave a specific finding that there is no prohibition for the fifth
respondent to condone the delay. This observation was made based on the earlier order passed in
W.P.No. 11593 of 2011 dated 29.4.2011. This order has become final and it was never put to
challenge by the respondents. Thus, the order is binding inter partes and the parties cannot be
allowed to wriggle out of the same.
13. The Additional Advocate General has relied upon the common judgment rendered by the
Division Bench of this Court in the case of Tmt.Durab Zaman Begam to substantiate his submission
that such time barred application should not be entertained. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm )
14. In the considered view of this Court, the order, which has become final between the parties,
cannot be effaced by showing a subsequent judgment that has been passed in the year 2023. The
order passed by this Court in W.P.No.15175 of 2011 dated 30.6.2011 is binding on the respondents
and it cannot be ignored by citing a subsequent judgment rendered much later. In the light of the
above findings, the first reason assigned by the first respondent in the impugned order to cancel the
patta that was issued by the fifth respondent in favour of the predecessors in title of the petitioner by
placing reliance upon G.O.Ms.No.714 dated 29.6.1987 has to necessarily fail.
15. The second reason that has been assigned by the first respondent in the impugned order is that
the first respondent has sufficient powers to invoke the suo motu revisional powers provided under
Section 7(c) of the Act.
16. There is no denial of the fact that such power is vested with the first respondent. However, the
question is as to whether the first respondent could have exercised such a power in the present case.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm )
17. The law on this issue was discussed by the First Bench of this Court in the case of Rajathi
wherein the relevant portions are extracted as hereunder :
"10. In the decision reported in M.Veeraswamy v. Special Commissioner &
Commissioner of L.A., etc., 1996 Writ L.R. 554, the question that arose for
consideration was, whether suo motu Revision under Section 7(c) of the Act can be
exercised without an Application for revising the order of the Lower Authority. The
Division Bench of this Court, in the said decision, has held that the said Proviso does
not contemplate any specific Application and the Board could exercise its Revisional
power under clause
(c) of Section 7 of the Act without an Application by any one.
11. The matter in question came up before the Full Bench of this Court since in the
decision reported in Director of Survey and Settlement v. R. Ramadoss, 1992 (2) LW
265, a Division Bench of this Court has held that Director of Settlement has no suo
motu power of Revision against the order of the Assistant Settlement Officer without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179555699/ 8
R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
an Application for such Revision and in the latter decision reported in
M.Veeraswamy v. Special Commr. & Commr. of L.A., etc., 1996 Writ L.R. 554,
another Division Bench of this Court has held https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) that such power can be exercised under
Clause (c) of Section 7 of the Act even without an Application for revising the order of
the Lower Authority. In view of the conflicting decisions found thereon, a Full Bench
was constituted and the Full Bench of this Court, in the decision reported in Special
Commissioner & Director of Survey & Settlement v. M. Arumugam, 2007 (4) CTC
538 (FB), has affirmed the view taken by the Division Bench in the judgment
reported in 1996 Writ L.R. 554, that is to say, that the Full Bench has held that the
view taken by the Division Bench in the said decision that the power can be exercised
even without an Application for revising the order of the Lower Authority, has been
upheld.
12. But, however, in the case on hand, it is not the case of the petitioners that suo
motu revision cannot be taken by the First Respondent exercising the power under
Clause (c) of Section 7 of the Act without an Application before him. The point that
has been canvassed by the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that such
power could be exercised in a case other than an Appeal remedy is available. In order
to appreciate the said contention, it would be useful to extract Clause (c) of Section 7
of the Act and the same is extracted hereunder:
'7. Powers of control of the Board of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm )
Revenue:-
(a) …
(b) …
(c) to cancel or revise any of the orders, acts or proceedings of any Settlement Officer
other than those in respect of which an appeal lies to be Tribunal or of any managers;
and
(d) …' The said provision clearly contemplates that the Board of Revenue shall have
the power to cancel or revise any of the orders, acts or proceedings of any Settlement
Officer other than those in respect of which an Appeal lies to the Tribunal or of any
managers. That means, if the remedy of Appeal is provided under the Act to challenge
the order of the Assistant Settlement Officer, the suo motu Revision cannot be taken
up exercising power under clause (c) of Section 7 of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179555699/ 9
R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
13. In the given case on hand, it is not the case of the Respondents that there is no
Appeal remedy against the order of the Assistant Settlement Officer, Dharapuram.
Section 15 of the Act clearly spells out that against the decision of the Settlement
Officer, an Appeal will lie before the Government. It would be, therefore useful to
extract the said provision and the same is extracted hereunder:
‘15. Determination of lands in which the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded
on: 20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) landholder is entitled to ryotwari patta under
foregoing provisions.— (1) The Settlement Officer shall examine the nature and
history of all lands in respect of which the landholder claims a Ryotwari Patta under
Sections 12, 13 or 14 as the case may be, and decide in respect of which lands the
claim should be allowed.
(2)(a) Against a decision of the Settlement Officer under sub-section (1), the
Government may, within one year from the date of commencement of the Tamil
Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Amendment Act, 1954, or
from the date of the decision, whichever is later, and any person aggrieved by such
decision may, within two months from the date, appeal to the Tribunal:
Provided that the Tribunal may, in its discretion, allow further time not exceeding six
months from the filing of any such Appeal:
Provided further that the Tribunal may, in its discretion, entertain an Appeal by the
Government at any time if it appears to the Tribunal that the decision of the
Settlement Officer was vitiated by fraud or by mistake of fact.
(b) The decision of the Tribunal on any such appeal shall be final and not be liable to
be questioned in any Court of Law.’ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm )
14. A reading of clause (c) of Section 7 of the Act coupled with Section 15 of the Act
will make it amply clearly that suo motu Revision could be entertained by the First
Respondent, if there is no Appeal remedy available to challenge the order of the
Assistant Settlement Officer. In the case on hand, since the Appeal remedy is
available as provided under Section 15 of the Act, in our considered view, as rightly
contended by the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners, the suo motu
Revision will not lie before the First Respondent.
15. We may add that the power given to an authority under an Act or Rule has to be
exercised strictly only in accordance with the mode provided therein. It cannot be
denied that the power clothing with an authority through the legislation has to be
exercised within the four corners of its conferment. It cannot be travelled beyond
that.

R.Muniyandi (A) Chandran vs The Commissioner Of Land on 27 November, 2021
The language employed in the provisions of an Act can be interpreted only if there is any ambiguity
and the Courts have no power to enter into the field of presumption or assumption. Absolutely there
is no possibility to travel beyond what has been set out in the provisions to a statue.
Therefore, in our considered view, when clause (c) of Section 7 of the Act clearly spells out that suo
motu Revision could be exercised for cancelling or https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/03/2025 02:15:09 pm ) revising the order passed by the Settlement Officer other than those in
respect of which an Appeal lies before the Tribunal, leaving the remedy available under Section 15 of
the Act, which envisages an Appeal, the First Respondent has no legal right to entertain suo motu
Revision, that too, after nearly 11 years from the date of the order of the Assistant Settlement Officer,
Dharapuram.”
18. The First Bench of this Court in the decision in the case of Rajathi was dealing with the Act and
the scope of power under Sections 7(c) and 15 of the Act. The First Bench also took note of the Full
Bench judgment of this Court in the case of M.Arumugam that was relied upon by the learned
Additional Advocate General wherein the Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case of
M.Veeraswamy Vs. Special Commissioner & Commissioner of L.A. [reported in 1996 Writ L.R. 554]
was affirmed and held that a suo motu revision can be entertained by the Commissioner of Land
Administration, if there is no appeal remedy available to challenge the order of the Assistant
Settlement Officer. However, such an appeal remedy is available under Section 15 of the Act.
Therefore, the suo motu power cannot be exercised by the first respondent.

19. It is true that this Court directed the first respondent to exercise the revisional powers under
Section 7 of the Act. However, while issuing such directions, this Court cannot confer any power or
jurisdiction, which is not otherwise available under the Act. The first respondent is a creature of the
Statute and he can exercise powers only within the four corners of the Act and certainly cannot
traverse beyond it. This judgment of the First Bench of this Court in the case of Rajathi will squarely
apply to the facts of the present case.
20. This Court also places reliance upon the earlier order passed by me in the case of
R.Jayachandran & another Vs. State of Tamil Nadu & another [W.P.No.3267 of 2023 dated
05.2.2025] wherein I had an opportunity to deal with an in pari materia provision available under
Section 6(c) the Tamil Nadu Minor Inams (Abolition & Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1963 and I
placed reliance upon the above First Bench judgment in the case of Rajathi and the earlier order
passed by me in the case of R.Jeyachandran Vs. State of Tamil Nadu [W.P.No.35303 of 2007 dated
15.7.2022] and held that where an appeal remedy is available, such suo motu revision power cannot
be exercised.

21. In the light of the above discussions, the second reason that was assigned by the first respondent
is also liable to be interfered by this Court.
