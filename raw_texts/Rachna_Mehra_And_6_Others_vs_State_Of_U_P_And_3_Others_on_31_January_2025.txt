as financial creditors and it consequently disposed of the petitions as follows: -
"16. In view of the aforesaid legal position, we are of the opinion that the Insolvency
and Bankruptcy Code, being a complete Code in itself, with sufficient checks and
balances remedial avenues and appeals, any interference by the High Court in
exercise of its extraordinary powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, which may
have the effect interdicting the CIRP, would not be permissible as a matter of course.
17. Having regard to the aforesaid and in particular, taking note of the fact that the
petitioners have already filed their claims in the pending CIRP proceedings, we are
not inclined to entertain the writ petitions, in respect of the reliefs sought, at this
stage.
18. It would be open to the petitioners to seek appropriate legal remedies as may be
available under the law.
19. The writ petitions are, accordingly, disposed of."

U.P. RERA and Sri Rohan Gupta, learned counsel appearing for respondent no. 3, also submitted
that the same order may be passed in the instant case.
4. Accordingly, the instant petition also stands disposed of in terms of the order quoted above in
Writ - C No. 38488 of 2024 and other connected matters.
