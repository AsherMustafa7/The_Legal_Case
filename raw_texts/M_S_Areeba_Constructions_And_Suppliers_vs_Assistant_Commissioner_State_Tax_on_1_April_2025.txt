4. Challenging the said order, learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the delay
occurred in filing the appeal was beyond the control of the petitioner, inasmuch as the Proprietor of
the petitioner firm was suffering from serious ailment and his Charted Accountant was looking after
his case. It is contended that after acquiring the knowledge about the order cancelling Registration
of U.P. Goods and Service Tax, the petitioner preferred an appeal against the order of cancellation.
It is submitted that the delay in filing the appeal was bonafide and sufficient cause has been shown
for the delay in filing the appeal, therefore, the Appellate Authority should have taken a liberal view
in deciding the appeal.
5. Learned Standing Counsel would contend that since there is inordinate delay of 52 days in filing
the appeal, therefore, the Appellate Authority has not committed any error in rejecting the appeal.
6. Be that as it may, there was delay of 52 days in filing the appeal and the ground for the delay in
filing the appeal was that the Proprietor of the petitioner firm was suffering from serious ailment,
and as soon as he acquired knowledge of cancellation of Registration of U.P. Goods and Service Tax,
he approached his Charted Accountant and filed the appeal.
7. In the opinion of the Court, the delay in filing the appeal is not inordinate and sufficient
explanation has been given by the petitioner for the delay in filing the appeal. In such view of the
fact, the impugned order passed by the First Appellate Authority dated 21.12.2024 in Appeal
No.2425 ABLY001515/2024 is set aside. The matter is remitted to the First Appellate Authority i.e.
respondent no.2-Additional Commissioner, Grade-2(Appeal), State Tax, Sector-4, Bareilly to decide
the appeal of the petitioner on merit expeditiously preferably within a period of one month from the
date of production of a certified copy of this order.
8. The writ petition is disposed of subject to the observations made above.
