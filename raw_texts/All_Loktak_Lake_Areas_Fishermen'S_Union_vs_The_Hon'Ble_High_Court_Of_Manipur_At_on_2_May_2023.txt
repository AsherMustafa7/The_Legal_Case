JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(CAV)
(M.V. Muralidaran, Acting CJ)
Review Petition No.6 of 2021 has been filed by the
petitioners to review the order dated 12.10.2020 passed in MC
(PIL) No.16 of 2019 in PIL No.24 of 2017 and modify it to the
extent of setting aside the order, thereby staying the NIT for the
Loktak Ecotourism Project and the Inland Waterways Project.
2. Pending review petition, the petitioners have filed
M.C.No.1 of 2022 under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to
condone the delay in filing the review petition and M.C.No.2 of
2022 to admit the Review Petition No.6 of 2021.
3. The review petition and the miscellaneous cases
are interlinked with each other. Therefore, the review petition
and the miscellaneous cases were heard together and disposed
of by this common order.
4. In view of the filing of MC Nos.1 and 2 of 2022 to
grant leave and to condone the delay in filing the revision petition,
let us consider the miscellaneous cases first.
5. Mr. M. Rakesh, the learned counsel for the
petitioners submitted that the petitioners have filed Review

No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
Page |8
Petition No.6 of 2021 to review the order dated 12.10.2020
passed in MC No.16 of 2019 in PIL No.24 of 2017 and the
limitation for filing the review petition would have expired on
11.11.2020. While calculating the limitation period in respect of
all judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, the period between
15.3.2020 till 28.2.2022 remains excluded as per the decision of
the Apex Court in in the case of In Re: Cognizance for Extension
of Limitation, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 27. The learned counsel for
the petitioners would submit that since the limitation period for
filing the review petition expired within 15.3.2020 to 2.10.2021,
the extended limitation period is 90 days from 3.10.2021 till
2.1.2022 and the present review petition filed on 30.8.2021 was
within the limitation period. Therefore, the delay in filing the
review petition may be condoned.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioners further
submitted that the interest of the petitioners is affected by the
order dated 12.10.2020 passed in MC No.16 of 2019 and
pursuant to the aforesaid order if the NIT for the projects on
ecotourism and inland waterways are allowed without
consultation of the petitioners and other affected communities,
the fishing communities, who are dependent on Loktak Lake, will
suffer irreparable harm.

7. Arguing further, the learned counsel submitted that
the Integrated Management Plan (IMP) for Loktak Lake, based
on which the impugned order was passed, was prepared without
seeking any input or comment from the local communities and
the only consultation that had taken place was in terms of
directions of this Court dated 5.2.2018 issued in PIL No.24 of
2017. In fact, the petitioners will have no opportunity to secure
their rights unless this Court considers the review petition.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioners would
submit that when the petitioners came to know about the IMP,
they had begun preparation for impleadment as party in the
proceedings in PIL No.24 of 2017 in order to bring the fisherfolks
concerns about the IMP and the proposed developmental
projects to the notice of this Court. However, on 11.10.2020, the
petitioners were shocked to learn that the hearing date was
advanced to 12.10.2020 from 24.11.2020 and due to paucity of
time and imposition of Covid-19 related lockdown on 11.10.2020,
the petitioners have submitted a representation to the Court
highlighting the non-consultation of the fisher folks in the villages
and the non-impleadment of NHPC as necessary party in PIL
No.24 of 2017.

9. The learned counsel for the petitioners urged that
the right of third parties to seek review of an order passed by the
High Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India is permissible and since the rights of the
petitioners have been adversely affected by the order dated
12.10.2020, the petitioners sought leave of this Court to file the
review petition.
10. The learned counsel next submitted that the
petitioners prayed for an opportunity to explain their grievances
by way of impleadment as a party in the proceedings before any
decision was taken that would directly affect the fundamental
rights of the fisher folks and other communities dependent on the
Loktak Waterland Region. He would further submit that the order
dated 12.10.2020 in MC No.16 of 2019 did not consider that the
preparation of the IMP does not amount to preparation of brief
documents under Rule 7 of the Guidelines for Implementing
Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 and it is
a matter of fact that the brief documents have not been adduced
before this Court till date despite the directions to that effect were
issued vide orders dated 24.5.2018, 15.1.2020, 19.2.2020 and
4.3.2020.

11. The learned counsel then submitted that while
passing the impugned order dated 12.10.2020, this Court relied
upon the submission of the learned Solicitor-General of India that
the amount sanctioned for the Inland waterways Project by the
Ministry of Shipping (IWT Section), Government of India and
those sanctioned for the Ecotourism Project by the Asian
Development Bank were likely to lapse if the NIT process for the
respective projects was not allowed to proceed further.
However, the Asian Development Bank has since clarified vide
its communication dated 25.2.2021that the Department of
Economic Affairs, Government of India has posed the ecotourism
project for Asian Development Bank financing on 24.2.2021 and
that the Asian Development Bank will examine the project
proposal as per standard procedure.
12. Arguing so, the learned counsel for the petitioners
submitted that if the NIT for the projects on ecotourism and inland
waterways are allowed to proceed without due consultation with
the petitioners and other affected communities, the members of
the fishing communities who are dependent on Loktak Lake for
sustenance will suffer serious prejudice to their fundamental right
to life and livelihood guaranteed under Article 21 of the
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-

Constitution of India. Therefore, the order dated 12.10.2020
passed in MC No.16 of 2019 needs to be reviewed.
13. Per contra, Mr. H. Kenajit, the learned counsel
appearing for the respondent Loktak Development Authority
submitted that the affidavit in MC No.1 of 2022 filed to condone
the delay in filing the review petition is bereft of material
particulars and the delay has not been properly calculated and
explained by the petitioner with sufficient reasons. Therefore, on
this ground MC No.1 of 2022 is liable to be dismissed.
14. The learned counsel contended that the prayer in
MC No.2 of 2022 differs from cause-title and the prayer portion.
Since the prayer in MC No.2 of 2022 is not clear, on the sole
ground the said miscellaneous case is liable to be dismissed.
15. With regard to the review petition, the learned
counsel argued that the Project Director of Loktak Development
Authority filed MC No.16 of 2019 for allowing to initiate necessary
process for executing the project namely "Loktak Inland
Waterways Improvement Project" which was approved by the
Ministry of Shipping (IWT Section), Government of India and, this
Court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case,
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017

permitted the applicants in MC No.16 of 2019 to proceed with the
NIT.
16. The learned counsel further submitted that the
review petition is not maintainable as the petitioners were neither
parties in MC No.16 of 2019 nor in PIL No.24 of 2017 and the
petitioners are no way affected by the order dated 12.10.2020
passed in MC No.16 of 2019. Since the order dated 12.10.2020
passed in MC No.16 of 2019 was implemented and it was done
in the larger public interest in order to conserve, preserve and
development of wetlands of the State, no review would be
maintainable. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the
review petition.
17. We have considered the rival submissions and also
perused the materials available on record.
18. At the outset, it is to be pointed out that PIL No.24
of 2017 has been taken on file pursuant to the direction of the
Hon'ble Apex Court considering the fact that the Loktak Lake is
a Ramsar site. In order to ascertain the progress in regard to the
preservation of the Loktak Lake, this Court, by the order dated
17.7.2019, issued the following directions:
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)

details as to how the money has been
and is being utilized by them.
19. Thereafter, the matter was listed from time to time
and on 28.9.2020, when the PIL was taken up for hearing, this
Court passed the following order:
"In terms of the order dated 27.8.2020 of this
Court, the State Government has forwarded
the Integrated Management Plan for Wise
Use of Loktak Lake, Manipur (2020-2025) to
the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change, Govt. of India on
14th September, 2020. A copy of this letter
along with the enclosures namely
Proceedings of the Manipur State Wetlands
Authority has been forwarded to the Ministry
concerned of the Union of India also.
Awaiting response, list the matter again on
24.1.2020."
20. While this Court monitoring the process pending
PIL, the Project Director of Loktak Development Authority,
Manipur, has filed MC No.16 of 2019 seeking permission of the
Court to initiate the process of NIT to implement Loktak Inland
Waterways Improvement Project. Similarly, the
Commissioner/Secretary of the Department of Tourism,
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)

Government of Manipur has also filed MC No.47 of 2020 to allow

Lake, Bishnupur District with a condition that all necessary prior
permissions and approvals of appropriate authorities be taken
by the State before proceeding with the said Loktak Lake Eco-
Tourism Project in the interest of justice, fair play and enquiry as
well as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings.
21. Both MC No.16 of 2019 and MC No.47 of 2020 were
taken up together and by the order dated 12.10.2020, this Court
allowed both the miscellaneous cases. The operative portion of
the order reads thus:
"[11] Subject to condition that all the
necessary statutory clearance will be
obtained from all departments concerned,
more particularly, from the Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change,
Govt. of India, we permit the applicants in
both the Misc. Application No.6 of 2019 and
No.47 of 2020 to proceed with the NIT. Both
the Misc. Applications stand ordered as
above."
22. Now the petitioners, who are stated to be the All
Loktak Lakes Areas Fisherman's Union, Manipur and its
Executive Members, seek to review the order dated 12.11.2020
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 17
passed in MC Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020 on the grounds of
(i) non-submission of brief documents and (ii) non-sanction of
funds by the Asian Development Bank, which are discovery of
new and important matter or evidence which were not within the
knowledge of the petitioners and could not have been produced
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 15
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
by them earlier.
23. Before dealing with the grounds on which review of
the order dated 12.10.2020 is sought, let us first consider the
miscellaneous cases, being M.C. Nos.1 and 2 of 2022, filed by
the petitioners to condone the delay in filing the review petition
and leave to file the review petition.
24. The order under review was passed on 12.11.2020
and review petition was filed on 30.8.2021 (as stated by the
petitioners). It is to be pointed out that the petitioners who are
third parties to the proceedings in MC No.16 of 2019 and MC
No.47 of 2020 have filed Review Petition No.6 of 2021 without
application for condonation of delay and without application to
grant leave to file review petition. Only after the office numbered
the review petition and the objection having been made by
learned counsel for the respondent authorities, the petitioners
have filed MC Nos.1 and 2 of 2022. Filing of review petition by
third parties to the proceedings without obtaining leave from the
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 18
Court is normally not entertained. In this case, as stated supra,
it is apparent that the petitioners have not obtained any leave
before filing the review petition. Thus, the act of the petitioners
is "putting the cart before the horse" and they have done things
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 16
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
in wrong order, which cannot be appreciated by this Court.
25. With regard to MC No.1 of 2022 (petition for
condonation of delay), the learned counsel for the petitioners, by
placing on record the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, supra,
submitted that though the limitation period for filing the review
petition expired on 11.11.2020, the period from 15.3.2020 till
28.2.20202 was excluded for the purpose of limitation and since
the review petition was filed on 30.8.2021 within the limitation
period as stipulated by the Hon'ble Apex Court, the delay may be
condoned.
26. It is apposite to mention that the act of the
petitioners in not filing application to condone the delay along
with the review petition cannot be appreciated. The direction of
the Apex Court excluding the period i.e. from 15.3.2020 till
28.2.2022 is only for the purpose of calculating the period of
limitation for new cases and not for the cases like the one before
us. The decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court does not speak
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 19
about the condonation of the said period of delay after filing
cases.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 17
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
27. When the petitioners come forward to file review
petition, they ought to have calculated the number of days delay
and stated so in their affidavit filed in support of the petition.
However, in the case on hand, the petitioners have failed to state
even the number days delay and they simply prayed to condone
the delay. Such drafting of affidavit is not appreciable and it is
the bounden duty of the petitioners to aver clearly in the affidavit
qua the number of days delay to be condoned by the Court with
due calculation. Considering the lethargic attitude adopted of the
petitioners in not stating the correct number of days delay, we
are of the view that the petitioners cannot seek the aid of the
decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of In Re:
Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, supra. That too, the
consideration of application to condone the delay will arise only
after granting leave by this Court to the petitioners to file review
petition against the order dated 12.11.2020 in MC No.16 of 2019,
as the petitioners are third parties to the said proceedings.
28. As rightly argued by the learned counsel for Loktak
Development Authority, a contrary prayer has been made by the
petitioners in MC No.2 of 2022. In fact, in the cause title, the
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 20
petitioners have stated "... for allowing the petitioners to file the
Review Petition No.6 of 2021 ...", whereas, in the prayer portion,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 18
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
it has been stated "allow the instant miscellaneous application
and admit the Review Petition No.6 of 2021". Thus, the prayer
in MC No.2 of 2022 is not so clear.
29. The argument of the learned counsel for the
petitioners is that the petitioners are major stakeholders of the
Loktak, inasmuch as the livelihood of the rural population around
the lake is dependent to a great extent upon the fish of the lake
and this fact was reflected in the information on Loktak Lake
submitted to the Ramsar Convention by the Government of India
and the petitioners are very much affected by the order dated
12.10.2020 passed in M.C.Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020 and,
therefore, they may be granted leave to file review petition to
review the said order, cannot be countenanced for the reason
that prima facie the petitioners are not affected by the order dated
12.10.2020 passed in MP Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020.
Nothing has been produced by the petitioners to show how they
are prejudiced by the order dated 12.10.2020.
30. Considering the fact that the prayer of the
petitioners in MC No.2 of 2022 is to grant leave to them to file the
review petition, we are of the view that leave cannot be granted
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 21
to the petitioners, as the order dated 12.10.2020 in MC No.16 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 19
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
2019 and MC No.47 of 2020 was passed in the larger public
interest in order to conserve, preserve and development of
wetlands of the State. That apart, before filing review petition,
the petitioners ought to have sought leave of the Court.
However, in the case on hand, the petitioners have failed to do
so. Filing petition to grant leave to file review petition after filing
and number of the review petition is a bad procedure adopted by
the petitioners and, we are of the view that the same cannot be
endorsed by this Court.
31. Insofar as the review petition is concerned, the
petitioners sought to review the order dated 12.10.2020 in MC
Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020 on the following grounds:
(i) The consideration of the IMP as brief
documents under Rule 7(1) in the impugned
order is an error apparent on the face of the
record. This Court, vide orders dated
24.5.2018, 15.1.2020, 19.2.2020 and
4.3.2020 in the PIL proceedings, has made it
abundantly clear that the requirements of
Rule 7 need to be satisfied in order to
proceed with developmental works on Loktak
Lake, which states as under:
"7. Delegation of powers and functions to the State
Governments and Union Territory
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)

for notification, providing:-
(a) Demarcation of wetland boundary supported

shall make recommendations to the State

MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 23
exceeding 240 days from the date of
recommendation by the Authority."
32. Drawing our attention to Rule 7(1), the learned
counsel for the petitioners argued that Rule 7(1) requires
preparation of brief documents that lay down the essential
characteristics of the wetland including its boundaries and zone
of influence, pre-existing rights and privileges and also activities
to be prohibited and regulated. Rule 7(2) and (3) envisage the
brief documents to be the basis on which a draft notification is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 21
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
issued, which is finalized after public consultation. All the
directions issued by this Court for preparation of a wise use plan
or brief documents can be traced back to prior directions to
comply with Rule 7. However, this Court vide the order dated
12.10.2020 accepted the preparation of the IMP as sufficient
compliance with Rule 7, eventhough the IMP meets none of the
requirements under Rule 7(1)(a) to (g) or Rule 7(2) and 7(3) and
has been prepared unilaterally by the Loktak Development
Authority and Wetlands International South Asia, without any
consultation with the public, including the affected communities,
in other words, in absolute secrecy and in gross variance to the
letter and spirit of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,
Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)

and ILO Convention No.107 concerning the Protection and
Integration of Indigenous and Other Tribal and Semi-Tribal
Populations in Independent Countries, to which India is a party.
33. The aforesaid submission of the learned counsel for
the petitioners cannot be gone into in the review jurisdiction as
the petitioners are trying to re-argue the main matter. On a
perusal of the order dated 12.10.2020 passed in MC Nos.16 of
2019 and 47 of 2020, we are of the view that upon considering
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 22
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
the facts and circumstances of the case and having considering
the submissions made by learned counsel appearing on either
side, including the learned Solicitor-General of India, this Court
permitted the applicants in MC Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020 to
proceed with NIT. The operative portion of the order reads thus:
"[10] .... Accordingly, on the persuasion of
the Court, Integrated Plan for Wise Use of
Loktak Lake (2020-2025) has been
prepared and submitted to the Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change,
Govt. of India on 14.9.2020, a copy of which
has been placed before the Court. It is for
the Ministry of Environment, Forest and
climate Change, Govt. of India to review the
Management Plan and give its approval or
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 25
suggestions, if any, on its merit. We hope
and trust that the Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change, Govt. of India
will take all necessary action in this regard
and also inform the State if there is any
other requirement to be complied with
before the Integrated Management Plan of
Wise Use of Loktak Lake is approved.
Subject to this condition, the reason for
permitting the State authorities, namely,
Loktak Development Authority and the
Toursim department to proceed with the
NIT can be considered as reasonable
request because they have complied with
the basic requirement of providing the
Integrated Management Plan of Wise Use
of Loktak Lake (2020-2025). This will
enable the Union Government and other
authorities to assess the nature of the
project and guide the two departments of
the State Government in a proper manner.
On pragmatic assessment of the issue,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 23
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
necessary guidelines for Wise Use of
Loktak Lake in relation to Loktak Inland
Waterways Improvement Project as well as
Eco Tourism project will have to be issued
by the various Departments of the Union of
India. It is a decision they have to take on
the merits of the proposal keeping in mind
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 26
the environment and ecology of the Ramsar
site."
34. The aforesaid being the findings of this Court while
allowing MC No.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020, no review will lie at
the hands of the petitioners who were not the affected parties. If
at all anybody is aggrieved by the said order, they will have to
challenge the same in the manner known to law and it appears
that nobody has challenged the said order dated 12.10.2020
before the higher Court and allowed the said order to attain
finality.
35. At this juncture, it is to be pointed that pursuant to
the order, on 5.4.2023 a meeting to discuss the issues related to
Integrated Management Plan of Loktak Lake and a project
proposal on sustainable tourism was held and in the said meeting
all the stakeholders were participated. A copy of the Minutes of
Meeting was produced before us. On a perusal of the same, we
find that after a detailed deliberation on various issues, the
following decisions were taken in the meeting:

b) LDA shall submit a revised IMP for
consideration of the Ministry under the

36. When the aforesaid being the decisions taken in the
meeting held on 5.4.2023 qua the issues related to IMP of Loktak

Lake in Manipur pursuant to the order dated 12.10.2020 passed
in MC Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020, if any order is passed
contrary to the said order and/or if modification is made, the same
would affect the said project. The merits of the project cannot be

MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 29
gone into under the garb of review petition. Taking into account
the various facts and circumstances including the ground reality,
the authorities have taken decisions highlighted above, which
cannot be interfered and/or disturbed by this Court under review
jurisdiction. More importantly, the very locus of the petitioners to
seek review of the order dated 12.10.2020 in MC Nos.16 of 2019
and 47 of 2020 has not been established. That apart, the non-
submission of brief documents and the non-sanction of funds by
the Asian Development Bank for the Ecotourism project
canvassed by the petitioners as grounds to the discovery of new
and important matter or evidence which were not within the
knowledge of the petitioners and could not have been produced
by them earlier are not the good grounds for reviewing the order
dated 12.10.2020 passed in MC Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020
and only for the purpose of fling review petition, the petitioners
have invented the said grounds.
37. In State of West Bengal and Others v. Kamal
Sengupta and another, (2008) 8 SCC 612, the Hon'ble Apex
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 27
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
Court emphasized the requirement of the review petitioner who
approaches a Court on the ground of discovery of a new matter
or evidence, to demonstrate that the same was not within his
knowledge. In paragraph 21, the Hon'ble Apex Court held thus:
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 30
"21. At this stage it is apposite to observe that
where a review is sought on the ground of
discovery of new matter or evidence, such
matter or evidence must be relevant and must
be of such a character that if the same had been
produced, it might have altered the judgment. In
other words, mere discovery of new or
important matter or evidence is not sufficient
ground for review ex debitojustitiae. Not only
this, the party seeking review has also to show
that such additional matter or evidence was not
within its knowledge and even after the exercise
of due diligence, the same could not be
produced before the court earlier."
38. As could be seen from the materials available on
record, the petitioners herein are watching the proceedings from
the beginning and having kept silent for all these years, now they
cannot try to stall the project. Moreover, under the larger public
interest, when the NIT for the projects on ecotourism and inland
waterways are allowed to proceed further with consultation of the
stakeholders, the petitioners under the garb of review cannot stall
the said project and no fundamental right to life and livelihood
guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India was
affected by the issuance of NIT. Only after considering the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 28
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
ground reality and in accordance with law, this Court permitted
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 31
the applicants in MC Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020 to proceed
with the NIT. Therefore, we find no error in the order dated
12.10.2020 in MC Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020.
39. Under Order 47, Rule 1 CPC, a judgment may be
open to review, inter alia, if there is mistake or an error apparent
on the face of the record. An error which is not self-evident and
has to be detected by a process of reasoning can hardly be said
to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the
Court to exercise its power of review under Order 47, Rule 1
CPC. In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47, Rule 1 CPC,
it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and
corrected. A review petition, it must be remembered has a limited
purpose and cannot be allowed to be an appeal in disguise.
40. Time and again, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that
review is not appeal in disguise. It follows, therefore, that the
power of review can be exercised for correction of a mistake but
not to substitute a view. Such powers can be exercised within
the limits of the statute dealing with the exercise of power. The
review cannot be treated like an appeal in disguise.

are not by way of an appeal and have to be
strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order
47, Rule 1, while dealing with similar jurisdiction
available to the High Court while seeking to
review the orders under Article 226 of the
Constitution, this Court in Aribam Tuleshwar
Sharma v. Aribam Pishak Sharma, (1979) 4
SCC 389 speaking through Chinnappa Reddy,
J. has made the following pertinent
observations:
"It is true there is nothing in Article 226
of the Constitution to preclude the
High Court from exercising the power
of review which inheres in every court
of plenary jurisdiction to prevent
miscarriage of justice or to correct
grave and palpable errors committed
by it. But, there are definitive limits to
the exercise of the power of review.
The power of review may be exercised
on the discovery of new and important
matter or evidence which, after the
exercise of due diligence was not
within the knowledge of the person
seeking the review or could not be
produced by him at the time when the
order was made; it may be exercised
where some mistake or error apparent
on the face of the record is found, it

may also be exercised on any
analogous ground. But, it may not be
exercised on the ground that the
decision was erroneous on merits.
That would be the province of a court
of appeal. A power of review is not to
be confused with appellate power
which may enable an appellate court
to correct all manner of errors
committed by the subordinate court.""
42. In the case of Lily Thomas v. Union of India,
(2000) 6 SCC 224, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed and held
that the power of review can be exercised for correction of a
mistake but not to substitute a view. Such powers can be
exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the exercise
of power.
43. In the case of Col. Avatar Singh Sekhon v. Union
of India and Others, 1980 Supp SCC 562, the Hon'ble Apex
Court observed that a review of an earlier order cannot be done
unless the Court is satisfied that the material error which is
manifest on the face of the order, would result in miscarriage of
justice or undermine its soundness. In paragraph 12, the Apex
Court held thus:
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-

"12. A review is not a routine procedure. Here
we resolved to hear Shri Kapil at length to
remove any feeling that the party has been hurt
without being heard. But we cannot review our

earlier order unless satisfied that material error,
manifest on the face of the order, undermines
its soundness or results in miscarriage of
justice. In Sow Chandra Kante and Another v.
Sheikh Habib, (1975) 1 SCC 674, this Court
observed :
'A review of a judgment is a serious step
and reluctant resort to it is proper only
where a glaring omission or patent
mistake or like grave error has crept in
earlier by judicial fallibility. ... The present
stage is not a virgin ground but review of
an earlier order which has the normal
feature of finality.' "
44. In Parsion Devi and others v. Sumitri Devi and
others, (1997) 8 SCC 715, stating that an error that is not self-
evident and the one that has to be detected by the process of
reasoning, cannot be described as an error apparent on the face
of the record for the Court to exercise the powers of review, the
Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:
"7. It is well settled that review proceedings
have to be strictly confined to the ambit and
scope of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. In
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)

Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Govt. of A.P.
1964 SCR (5) 174this Court opined:
'11. What, however, we are now
concerned with is whether the statement
in the order of September 1959 that the
case did not involve any substantial
question of law is an 'error apparent on the
face of the record'. The fact that on the
earlier occasion the Court held on an
identical state of facts that a substantial
question of law arose would not per se be
conclusive, for the earlier order itself might

be erroneous. Similarly, even if the
statement was wrong, it would not follow
that it was an 'error apparent on the face
of the record', for there is a distinction
which is real, though it might not always be
capable of exposition, between a mere
erroneous decision and a decision which
could be characterized as vitiated by 'error
apparent'. A review is by no means an
appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous
decision is reheard and corrected, but lies
only for patent error.'
8. Again, in MeeraBhanja v. NirmalaKumari
Choudhury(1995) 1 SCC 170while quoting with
approval a passage from AribamTuleshwar
Sharma v. AribamPishak Sharma15 this Court
once again held that review proceedings are not

No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-

P a g e | 36
by way of an appeal and have to be strictly
confined to the scope and ambit of Order 47
Rule 1 CPC.
9. Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may
be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake
or an error apparent on the face of the record.
An error which is not self-evident and has to be
detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly
be said to be an error apparent on the face of
the record justifying the court to exercise its
power of review under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. In
exercise of this jurisdiction under Order 47 rule
1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous
decision to be 'reheard and corrected'. A review
petition, it must be remembered has a limited
purpose and cannot be allowed to be 'an appeal
in disguise'".
45. It is also settled law that in exercise of review
jurisdiction, the Court cannot re-appreciate the evidence to arrive
at a different conclusion even if two views are possible in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 33
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
matter. In Kerala State Electricity Board v. Hitech
Electrothermics & Hydropower Ltd. and others, (2005) 6 SCC
651, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as follows:
"10. ....In a review petition it is not open to this
Court to re-appreciate the evidence and reach
a different conclusion, even if that is possible.
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 37
Learned counsel for the Board at best sought to
impress us that the correspondence exchanged
between the parties did not support the
conclusion reached by this Court. We are afraid
such a submission cannot be permitted to be
advanced in a review petition. The appreciation
of evidence on record is fully within the domain
of the appellate court. If on appreciation of the
evidence produced, the court records a finding
of fact and reaches a conclusion, that
conclusion cannot be assailed in a review
petition unless it is shown that there is an error
apparent on the face of the record or for some
reason akin thereto. It has not been contended
before us that there is any error apparent on the
face of the record. To permit the review
petitioner to argue on a question of appreciation
of evidence would amount to converting a
review petition into an appeal in disguise."
46. Thus, an application for review would lie if the order
has been passed on account of some mistake. As stated supra,
we find no mistake in the order dated 12.10.2020 passed in MC
Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020.Therefore, under the aid of
review, now the petitioners cannot sought to the review the order
dated 12.10.2020, as power of review can be exercised for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 34
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
correction of a mistake, but not to substitute a view.
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 38
47. What can be said to be an error apparent on the
face of the proceedings has been dealt with and considered by
the Hon'ble Apex Court in number of decisions. An error is an
error which is a patent error and not a mere wrong decision. An
order or decision or judgment cannot be corrected merely
because it is erroneous in law or on the ground that a different
view could have been taken by the Court on a point of fact or law.
In any case, while exercising the power of review, the Court
concerned cannot sit an appeal over its judgment.
48. We are, therefore, of the view that no ground as
envisaged under Order 47, Rule 1 CPC has been made out for
the purpose of reviewing the order dated 12.10.2020 in MC
Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020. Further, in view of the scope as
discussed above, if the submissions of the learned counsel for
the petitioners are tested in the light of the materials available on
record including from the perusal of the order dated 12.10.2020
passed in MC Nos.16 of 2019 and 47 of 2020, it would indicate
that while deciding the matter, all aspects of the matter has been
duly considered by the Court and findings have been given.
49. The grounds and the decisions relied upon by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 35
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
learned counsel for the petitioners do not relate to the scope of
review. The order under review has been passed by the Court
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 39
considering the facts, law and the arguments made and also
materials available on record. Therefore, there is no error
apparent on the face of record could be pointed out by the
learned counsel for the petitioners to exercise the review
jurisdiction.
50. As stated supra, under the garb of filing a review
petition, a party cannot be permitted to repeat old and overruled
arguments for reopening the conclusions arrived at in a
judgment. The power of review is not to be confused with the
appellate power which enables the Superior Court to correct
errors committed by a subordinate Court. This point has been
elucidated in Jain Studios Ltd. V. Shin Satellite Public Co.
Ltd., (2006) 5 SCC 501,where itwas held thus:
"11. So far as the grievance of the applicant on
merits is concerned, the learned counsel for the
opponent is right in submitting that virtually the
applicant seeks the same relief which had been
sought at the time of arguing the main matter
and had been negatived. Once such a prayer
had been refused, no review petition would lie
which would convert rehearing of the original
matter. It is settled law that the power of review
cannot be confused with appellate power which
enables a superior court to correct all errors

MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-

committed by a subordinate court. It is not
rehearing of an original matter. A repetition of
old and overruled argument is not enough to
reopen concluded adjudications. The power of
review can be exercised with extreme care,
caution and circumspection and only in
exceptional cases.
12. When a prayer to appoint an arbitrator by
the applicant herein had been made at the time
when the arbitration petition was heard and was
rejected, the same relief cannot be sought by an
indirect method by filing a review petition. Such
petition, in my opinion, is in the nature of
'second innings' which is impermissible and
unwarranted and cannot be granted."
51. After discussing a series of decisions on review
jurisdiction in Kamlesh Verma v. Mayawati and others, (2013)
8 SCC 320, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed that review
proceedings have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit
of Order XLVII Rule 1, CPC. As long as the point sought to be
raised in the review application has already been dealt with and
answered, parties are not entitled to challenge the impugned
judgment only because an alternative view is possible. The
principles for exercising review jurisdiction were succinctly
summarized in the said case as under:
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.)
No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-

MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017
P a g e | 41
"20. Thus, in view of the above, the following
grounds of review are maintainable as
stipulated by the statute:
20.1. When the review will be maintainable:
(i) Discovery of new and important matter
or evidence which, after the exercise of
due diligence, was not within knowledge of
the petitioner or could not be produced by
him;
(ii) Mistake or error apparent on the face of
the record;
(iii) Any other sufficient reason. The words
"any other sufficient reason" has been
interpreted in Chajju Ram vs.Neki, AIR
1922 PC 112 and approved by this Court
in Moran Mar Basselios Catholicos vs.
Most Rev. Mar Poulose Athanasius &
Ors., 1955 SCR 520 to mean "a reason
sufficient on grounds at least analogous to
those specified in the rule". The same
principles have been reiterated in Union of
India v. Sandur Manganese & Iron Ores
Ltd. & Ors., (2013) 8 SCC 337.
20.2. When the review will not be maintainable:
-
(i) A repetition of old and overruled argument is not enough to reopen concluded adjudications.
MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.) No. 2 of 2022
[Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017 P a g e | 42
(ii) Minor mistakes of inconsequential import.
(iii) Review proceedings cannot be equated with the original hearing of the case.
(iv) Review is not maintainable unless the material error, manifest on the face of the
order, undermines its soundness or results in miscarriage of justice.
(v) A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is
re-heard and corrected but lies only for patent error.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 38
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
(vi) The mere possibility of two views on the subject cannot be a ground for review.
(vii) The error apparent on the face of the record should not be an error which has to
be fished out and searched.
(viii) The appreciation of evidence on record is fully within the domain of the
appellate court, it cannot be permitted to be advanced in the review petition.
(ix) Review is not maintainable when the same relief ought at the time of arguing the
main matter had been negatived."
52. As can be seen from the above exposition of law, it has been consistently held by Hon'ble Apex
Court in several judicial pronouncements that the Court's jurisdiction of review, is MC (Review.
Pet.) No. 1 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.) No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet.
No. 6 of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017 P a g e | 43 not the same as that of an
appeal. Ajudgment can be open to review if there is a mistake or an error apparent on
the face of the record, but an error that has to be detected by a process of reasoning,
cannot be described as an error apparent on the face of the record for the Court to
exercise its powers of review under Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC. In the guise of
exercising powers of review, the Court can correct a mistake but not substitute the
view taken earlier merely because there is a possibility of taking two views in a
matter. A judgment may also be open to review when any new or important matter of
evidence has emerged after passing of the judgment, subject to the condition that
such evidence was not within the knowledge of the party seeking review or could not
be produced by it when the order was made despite undertaking an exercise of due
diligence. There is a clear distinction between an erroneous decision as against an
error apparent on the face of the record. An erroneous decision can be corrected by
the Superior Court, however an error apparent on the face of the record can only be
corrected by exercising review jurisdiction. Yet another circumstance referred to in
Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC for reviewing a judgment has been described as "for any
other sufficient reason". The said phrase has been MC (Review. Pet.) No. 1 of 2022
[Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6 of 2021], MC (Review. Pet.) No. 2 of 2022 [Ref:- Rev. Pet. No. 6
of 2021] and Review. Pet. No. 6 of 2021 (Ref:-
MC(PIL) No. 16 of 2019, PIL No. 24 of 2017 P a g e | 44 explained to mean "a reason
sufficient on grounds, at least analogous to those specified in the rule".
53. The petitioners herein are trying to seek a re- hearing of the main case which is not within the
scope of review. As stated supra, the learned counsel for the petitioners could not point out any error
apparent on the face of the record and the submissions made do not fall within the parameters of
Section 114 read with Order 47, Rule 1 CPC.Given the above facts and circumstances, we are of the
firm view that the instant review petition was nothing short of an abuse of the process of the Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66945036/ 39
All Loktak Lake Areas Fishermen'S Union vs The Hon'Ble High Court Of Manipur At ... on 2 May, 2023
and ought to have been rejected as not maintainable. Having considered the matter, we find that no
grounds of review is made out. The revision petition is absolutely devoid of merits.
54. For all the reasons stated above, MC (Rev.Petn.) Nos.1 and 2 of 2022 and Review Petition No.6
of 2021 are dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
