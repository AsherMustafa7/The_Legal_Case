[3] The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner
submitted that the petitioner is a certified ISO 9001-2015
engineering company delivering heavy EPC projects and significant
importance and national repute for the past two decades. On
09.03.2021, the third respondent issued e-tender notice inviting
composite bids in two bids system from eligible contractors for
construction of capital complex (Civil Secretariat Component) at
Mantripukhri, Imphal (balance work). Pursuant to the said notice,
the petitioner participated in the e-tender process. The petitioner,
being the lowest bidder having fulfilled all terms and conditions of
the tender, allotted the said work. The third applicant/respondent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 3
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
issued an acceptance letter dated 27.05.2021 awarding the said
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 3
work to the petitioner at the negotiated amount of Rs.
1,67,40,96,700/- which is inclusive of 12% GST of civil works, 18%
GST for IEL works and 15 labourcess which is 2% reduction from
the originally quoted amount of Rs. 170,82,61,939.22. In the said
letter, the respondent/petitioner was required to submit
performance guarantee of Rs. 5,02,22,901/- amounting to 3% the
tendered value of the work. The petitioner had also executed the
performance security bank guarantee for the said amount in favour
of the third applicant/respondent. Pursuant to the acceptance for
the work order and letter of acceptance, an agreement dated
08.06.2021 was executed between the respondent/petitioner and
the third applicants/respondents and the period for completion of
work was fixed as 12 months (02.06.2021 to 01.06.2022). The
petitioner executed 17 bank guarantees in favour of the third
applicants/respondents and the same was also communicated to the
applicants/respondents. According to the regulations, the site must
be handed over with complete construction-ready plans
encompassing the tendered scope of project. The work was initially
awarded to M/s Simplex Projects Limited in October, 2010.
However, the said company was not able to complete the project
within the stipulated period and, therefore, the contract was
terminated on 02.11.2019. Thereafter, the applicants/respondents
issued notice inviting tender on 28.12.2019, which was challenged
by M/s. Simplex Projects Limited, which went to filing of WA No. 39
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 4
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
of 2020 and, this Court, on 13.01.2021, directed the parties to have
a final joint measurement and after completion of the joint
measurement, liberty was given to the applicants/respondents State
to proceed with construction of the Civil Secretariat Complex by
following the required formalities and procedures. Thereafter, the
remaining work was awarded to the respondent/petitioner.
[4] The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner
submitted that the respondent/petitioner was compelled to execute
the work in compliance with the modifications and enhancements
made to the specifications and branding from multiple perspectives
leading to delays and missed milestones. In fact, the department
disposed of numerous profitable products, for example CCTV, data
network system and the aforesaid changes necessitated a re-
thinking of the department's strategies, which had to be adjusted to
accommodate the changing environment. The learned counsel
would further submit that the site was handed over in a deplorable
condition with a great deal of thick jungle and debris and in a
disorderly fashion. The removal and correction works caused huge
amount of money and time to the respondent/petitioner and the
said extra work amount has not yet been paid to the
respondent/petitioner till date. He further submitted that the work
was awarded during pre and post-first Covid eras and the work did
not begin until after Covid pandemic was under control. When the
respondent/petitioner decided to re-start the work, the second wave
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 5
began and the respondent/petitioner was not able to start the work
and, in fact, the respondent/petitioner wrote several letters to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 5
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
applicants/respondents stating Covid issues, he further submitted
that as instructed by the Department concerned, number of extra
items have been completed at the site and, in this regard, the
respondent/petitioner had submitted a detailed estimate during
September, 2021. After deliberation and reviews by various
departmental personnel, the department approved certain items,
leaving around sixty items pending for approval.
[5] The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner
submitted further that the respondent/petitioner had problems in
procuring the granite of particular colour and after addressing
several letters to the applicants/respondents, the
applicants/respondents approved the substitute colour. The
respondent/petitioner had also submitted TDS and rate analysis for
various civil and MEP extra items and change of specification
substitute items, which was also discussed. That apart, the
respondent/petitioner had various problems qua UPVC windows, SS
railing, tiles, lifts, DG set, street lamp post, sanitary works, STP
functions and landscape design which contributed to further delay in
completion of the work and the applicants/respondents officials are
lethargic in solving the said problems. The learned counsel added
that the respondent/petitioner has already taken steps to start the
work and, on 06.11.2021, the respondent/petitioner addressed a
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 6
letter to the authorities of PWD bringing the unfortunate situation to
light. Further, contrary to the agreement, the
applicants/respondents authorities descoped the work of data
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 6
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
networking and CCTV cabling at the site and put pressure on the
respondent/petitioner to complete the work earlier than the
stipulated time period.
[6] The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner then
submitted that in the mean while the newly elected Government
which came to power had given pressure on the
respondent/petitioner to complete the project prior in time for
inauguration. Even then, the applicants/respondents authorities did
not take steps to facilitate such faster rate of work by the
respondent/petitioner. On 24.05.2022, the third
applicant/respondent granted provisional time extension of the said
work up 30.09.2022 without prejudice to the right of the
Government to recover liquidated damages in accordance with the
provisions of Clause 5 of the MPWD General Conditions of Contract,
2020 of the agreement dated 08.06.2021. On 04.06.2022, the
respondent/petitioner addressed a letter to the third
applicant/respondent giving details of various factors which had led
to the delay in project completion, even after making best efforts to
complete the work inspite of hindrances faced by the
respondent/petitioner, to the shock and surprise, the third
applicant/respondent sent intimations to the respondent/petitioner
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 7
for slow progress of work and the said letters were suitably replied
by the respondent/petitioner.
[7] The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner
further submitted that the respondent/petitioner had continue to
execute the work within the extension period and beyond also which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 7
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
was within the knowledge of the department and RA bills were also
paid during the said period. In fact, the last RA bill was paid on
06.12.2022. The respondent/petitioner was diligently carrying on
works at the site and about 95% of the works at the site are
complete. Out of the total bill of Rs. 100.78 crore submitted by the
respondent/petitioner, the department has only paid Rs. 69.11 crore
and there is outstanding of Rs.31.67 crore due. That apart, the
respondent/petitioner had also sought approval on a large number
of deviation items, which have still not been considered by the
department and remains actionable at the end of Public Works
Department.
[8] The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner
further submit that the respondent/petitioner was served show
cause notices in respect of the work and the respondent/petitioner
has submitted its reply to the show cause notices. The delay in
completing the balance work was a subject matter of public interest
litigation in PIL No. 34 of 2022 and the said PIL was disposed of by
this Court on 04.04.2023. While so, on 11.04.2023, the third
applicant/respondent issued the impugned order terminating the
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 8
agreement dated 08.06.2021 executed between the
respondent/petitioner and the third applicant/respondent. The
respondent/petitioner submitted reply dated 13.04.2023 stating that
the department had not fulfilled its fundamental obligations and had
committed fundamental breach of agreement. However, there was
no response from the third applicant/respondent, which necessitated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 8
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
the respondent/petitioner in filing the present writ petition. Thus, a
prayer has been made to set aside the impugned termination order
and to allow the respondent/petitioner to continue with the
execution of the work allotted to the respondent/petitioner, coupled
with a prayer not to vacate the interim order dated 19.04.2023
granted by this Court. However, vide order dated 01.08.2023 this
Hon'ble Court vacated the order dated 19.04.2023 by passing the
following order.
"46. As stated supra, the third respondent decided to
conduct a joint measurement of the work done by the
petitioner. In the factual scenario put forth by the
respective parties, if joint measurement is conducted, no
prejudice would be caused to the petitioner and if joint
measured is conducted, it will be helpful for the Court to
know about the exact work executed at the ground level by
the petitioner and based on the report, further steps can be
taken in this matter. Moreover, the third respondent has
every right to conduct joint measurement to assess the
work executed by the contractor at the site. The aforesaid
observation of this Court is only in the interest of both
parties and for the welfare of the public scheme and the
public money involved for construction of Civil Secretariat.
Therefore, keeping the writ petition pending, the
respondent authorities are directed to conduct joint
measurement in order to assess the construction work and
the other work done and executed by the petitioner at the
site. For the purpose of conducting joint measurement, the
interim order dated 19.4.2023 needs to be vacated enabling
the respondent authorities to carry out the joint
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 9
measurement. Therefore, in the interest of justice and
without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the
respective parties in the main writ petition, this Court is
inclined to vacate the interim order dated 19.4.2023
passed in the writ petition.
47. For the reasons stated supra, the interim order dated
19.4.203 granted by this Court in the writ petition stands
vacated. The respondent authorities are directed to conduct
the joint measurement as stated in the impugned order
dated 11.04.2023 and file a report before this Court before
the date of hearing on 04.09.2023."

Again on the same day this Hon'ble Court passed
another interim order and the same is extracted hereunder;
"3. After delivering the order by this Court, Mr. T. Momo,
learned counsel for the petitioner represented that till the
joint measurement is taken place, both the parties may be
directed to maintain the status quo as on today.
4. Therefore, till the joint measurement is taken place, both

ground that there is question of disputed facts that the same may
be allowed to deal in accordance with the Arbitration clause as per
the Contract Agreement thereby allowing the Government to
complete the project by itself in view of the public necessity involved
in the project, with the following prayer:
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 10
"i) to vacate/modify the interim orders dated

direction(s) which the Hon'ble Court may deem fit
and proper in the facts and circumstances of the
Case."
During the course of hearing, the prayers No. 1 & 2
are taken up for consideration of passing appropriate order as prays
for by the learned counsel for the applicants/respondents and as
agreed to by the learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner.
[10] On 19.04.2023, when the writ petition was taken up
for admission, this Hon'ble Court granted interim order directing the
applicants/respondents not to make joint measurement. The said
interim order was extended from time to time and the State
applicants/respondents are seeking to vacate the said interim order.
[11] The applicant/respondent Nos. 2 & 3 have filed a
preliminary affidavit dated 25.04.2023 stating that the interim order
is not called for in the writ petition and the applicant/respondent
State may be allowed to complete the work and prayed for
modification of the interim order dated 19.04.2023, with supporting
documents annexed as Annexures -B/1 to B/43. Thereafter, Joint
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 11
Measurement Report was submitted and an affidavit in that regard
was also filed on 27.09.2023. The applicant craves the leave of this
Hon'ble Court to rely upon those affidavits, documents/annexures at
the time of hearing of the present application.
[12] On 01.08.2023, the Hon'ble Court was pleased to hear
the matter [WP(C)No. 358 of 2023] at length and after hearing the
submission made by the parties, the Hon'ble Court was inclined to
vacate the interim order dated 19.04.2023 passed in the writ
petition in the interest of justice thereby directing the

applicants/respondents authorities to conduct the joint
measurement as stated in the impugned order dated 11.04.2023
and file a report before this Hon'ble Court before the next date of
hearing.
Further, it is also stated that after delivering the order
by this Hon'ble Court, learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner
prayed that till the joint measurement is taken place, both the
parties may be directed to maintain the status quo as on that day.
In view of the prayer made, this Hon'ble Court, vide another order
dated 01.08.2023, was pleased to order that "till the joint
measurement is taken place, both the parties are directed to
maintain the status quo as on today".
[13] In the said order dated 01.08.2023, the Hon'ble Court
was pleased to observe as follows:-
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 12
".....In the factual scenario put forth by the respective
parties, if joint measurement is conducted, no prejudice
would be caused to the petitioner and if joint measurement

the respondent authorities are directed to conduct joint

the other work done and executed by the petitioner at the
site. For the purpose of conducting joint measurement, the
interim order dated 19.04.2023 needs to be vacated

The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
[14] The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents
submitted that the Joint Measurement for the work "Construction of
Capital Complex (Civil Secretariat Component) at Mantripukhri" was
conducted as per the direction of this Hon'ble High Court's order
dated 01.08.2023. Thereafter, the Joint Measurement Report, as
furnished by the Department vide letter dated 27.09.2023, was
submitted to this Hon'ble Court through the Registrar (Judl.) vide
forwarding letter dated 27.09.2023 through the office of the
Advocate General, Manipur. It is also pertinent to mention herein
that the petitioner refused to sign in some of the items in list of
items in the Joint Measurement and the same was indicated
while submitting the report before this Hon'ble Court.
[15] The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents
also submitted that on 09.10.2023, the petitioner filed an
affidavit with objection to the Joint Measurement Report dated
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 13
27.09.2023. In the said objection affidavit, the
respondent/petitioner has clearly mentioned that the representative
of SACIL had refused to sign against some of the items in the list of
items in the Joint Measurement due to the factual dispute
between writ petitioner and the State authorities. On 09.10.2023,
owing to the filing of objection affidavit and seeking time for filing
counter affidavit in MC(WP(C)) No. 140 of 2023 by the
respondent/petitioner, the matter could not be heard and adjourned
thereby extending the earlier interim order dated 01.08.2023 till the
next date.

The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
[16] The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents
submitted that the matter clearly involves disputed question of facts
and admitted by the writ petitioner in the objection affidavit dated
09.10.2023. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in catena of cases had held
that disputed questions of facts fall outside the writ jurisdiction of
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court in "Shubhas Jain - versus - Rajeshwari Shivam &
Ors. (2021 SCC Online SC 562)"held as follows:
"26. It is well settled that the High Court exercising its
extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, does not adjudicate hotly disputed
question of facts. It is not for the High Court to make a
comparative assessment of conflicting technical reports and
decide which one is acceptable."
Therefore, the disputed questions of facts cannot be
decided by the Writ Court and as such the present writ petition may
be dismissed in limine by this Hon'ble Court.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 14
[17] The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents
also submitted that the writ petition is also not maintainable as per
the Arbitration Clause 25 of the Work Agreement (annexed as
Annexure A/5 in the writ petition) which states as follows:
"Clause 25 - Settlement of Dispute & Arbitration -

[18] The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents
further submitted that since the matter is regarding the disputed
question of facts and Contract Agreement with Arbitration Clause,
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 17
where the legal question does not arise, for the stated reason the
Clause 25 of the Contract Agreement may be invoked. It is worth
mentioning that since the matter is relating to the Contract
Agreement and concerning disputed facts, the writ Court may not be
the appropriate forum and the parties may be referred to
Arbitration or before Ld. Civil Court. As such, the matter be
referred to the DRC/ Arbitration invoking the provision of Clause 25
of the Contract Agreement. Moreover, in para No. 45 of the order
dated 01.08.2023, the Hon'ble Court observed as follows:
"45. As could also be seen from the general conditions of
the contract, particularly Clause 25 provides settlement of
dispute and arbitration of the conditions of the contract
agreement to settle any dispute or grievances, if any. In
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 17
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
view of the factual questions involved in the writ petition
and in the absence of detailed counter-affidavit filed by the
respondents resisting the allegations set out in the writ
petition, the merits of the termination of the agreement
dated 08.06.2021 cannot be gone into at this stage."
[19] The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents
also submitted that the work "Construction of Capital Project (Civil
Secretariat Component) at Mantripukhri" is a highly prestigious
project which is of great importance to the State and its people i.e.,
public utility. The present work has become a prestige issue for the
State Government in front of Central leadership and the Government
of Manipur has decided to complete the work on departmental basis.
It is pertinent to mention herein that after the completion of the
Project the same is awaited to be inaugurated by the Highest
Official of the Central Government as it is actually the project of
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 18
National importance. As such, speedy completion of the project is
the need of the hour in public interest. And the Government may be
allowed to complete the project.
[20] The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents
submitted that the delay in executing the work is not the result of
the non-payment of bills to the petitioner and, in fact, up-to-date bill
amounts have been settled to the petitioner. As far as the pending
bills are concerned, the department checked those bills and found to
be heavily exceeding than the actual work done and, therefore, the
same was returned to the petitioner for correction.
[21] The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner has

The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
submitted affidavit-in-opposition on behalf of the
respondent/petitioner by denying almost all the submission and the
prayers put forth in the miscellaneous application by the
applicant/respondent and submitted that the contents of the
paragraphs are matter of records.
1. Submitted that the present application is not maintainable
as a writ petition can be maintained in a contractual
matter despite existence of an arbitration clause as the lis
involves a public law character and the alternative forum
chosen by the parties would not be in-a-position to grant
appropriate relief. The present action of the state in
terminating the present agreement in question is
arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the constitutional
rights of the petitioner. Therefore, the present writ
petition is maintainable. Hence, this Hon'ble Court was
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 19
please to pass the interims orders in the present writ
petition.
2. Further submitted that the representatives of the
respondent-company had refused to sign against the list
of items in the Joint measurements dated 27.09.2023 for
the following reasons:
(i) The records of the measurements of the
some of the said items were not provided
to the representatives of SACIL by PWD.
(ii) The records of the measurements of the
some of the said items were provided to
the representatives of SACIL by PWD but
without sufficient time to verify and cross-
check the measurements.
(iii) The details of the work done regarding the
said items were not measured by PWD.
3. Further submitted that the present action of the State in
terminating the present agreement in question is
arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the Constitutional
rights of the petitioner and this Hon'ble Court under writ
jurisdiction is competent to decide the present dispute. It
is settled law that the need to deal with disputed
questions of fact, cannot be made a smokescreen to
guillotine a genuine claim raised in a writ petition, when
actually the resolution of a disputed question of fact is
unnecessary to grant relief to the writ applicant. The
case-laws cited by the applicants in the present
paragraph are not applicable to the present case.
4. Further submitted that it is settled law that a writ petition
can be maintained in a contractual matter despite
existence of an arbitration clause in the following

The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
alternatives scenarios:
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 20
(i) Where the lis involves a public law
character or requires a judicial
determination in rem;
(ii) The alternative forum chosen by the
parties would not be in a position to grant
appropriate relief;
(iii) A statutory contract is in question or the
action of a state or its instrumentality is
demonstrably arbitrary, unreasonable or
violative of the fundamental rights of a
party;
(iv) The matter does not relate only to the
interpretation of a contract which is within
the domain of an arbitrator.
It is also submitted that the present action of
the State in terminating the present agreement in question is
arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the constitutional
rights of the petitioner and this Hon'ble Court under writ
jurisdiction is competent to decide the present dispute. It is
settled law that the need to deal with disputed questions of
fact, cannot be made a smokescreen to guillotine a genuine
claim raised in a writ petition, when actually the resolution of
a disputed question of fact is unnecessary to grant relief to
the writ applicant, therefore, the present writ petition is
maintainable.
5. The respondent no. 1 craved leave of this Hon'ble
Court to file an additional affidavit and documents to
supplement the present affidavit-in-opposition, if required at
a later stage.

11. That it is most respectfully begs to state that the State Applicants argued that interim order dated

vacated in view of the public necessity involved in the project as the work
"Construction of Capital Project (Civil Secretariat Component) at Mantripukhri" is a
highly prestigious project which is of great importance to the State and its people i.e.,
public utility.
(b) That there is question of disputed facts/ false submission of fact.

MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 26
12. That with regards the vacation of interim order dated 1.8.2023 and its subsequent
extension orders, it is submitted that the work, "Construction of Capital Project (Civil
Secretariat Component) at Mantripukhri" is a highly prestigious project which is of
great importance to the State and its people i.e., public utility. The present work has
become a prestige issue for the State Government in front of Central leadership and
the Government of Manipur has decided to complete the work on departmental basis.
It is pertinent to mention herein that after the completion of the Project the same is
awaited to be inaugurated by the Highest Functioning of the Country as it is actually
the project of National importance. As such, speedy completion of the project is the
need of the hour in public interest. And the State Government may be allowed to
complete the project departmentally. Further, it is submitted that the delay in
executing the work is not the result of the non-
payment of bills to the petitioner and, in fact, up-to-date bill amounts have been settled to the
petitioner. As far as the pending bills are concerned, the department checked those bills and found
to be heavily exceeding than the actual work done and, therefore, the same was returned to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 24
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
petitioner for correction. It may be pertinent to mention herein that effective functioning of the
State Government Departments is being curtailed as the infrastructure developed for the public i.e.,
the present work, could not be completed owing to the existence of interim orders. In this regard, in
catena of cases, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has decided not to stop the work project of public
importance.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in NG Project Limited -versus- Vinod Kumar Jain and Others. (2022) 6
SCC 127- Para Nos. 19, 20 & 21 held as follows:
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 27 "19. The Specific Relief Act, 1963 was amended by Central Act
18 of 2018 when clause (ha) was inserted in Section 41 of the said Act to say:
"41. (ha) if it would impede or delay the progress or completion of any infrastructure
project or interfere with the continued provision of relevant facility related thereto or
services being the subject-matter of such project."
20. Such amendment was in pursuance of the report submitted on 20-6-2016 of the Expert
Committee. The report is as under:
"The Expert Committee set on examining the Specific Relief Act, 1963 submits its
Report to Union Law & Minister recommends modifications for ensuring ease of
doing business.
The Expert Committee set on examining the Specific Relief Act, 1963 today submitted
its Report to Union Law & Justice Minister Shri DV Sadananda Gowda here in New
Delhi. In its report the committee has recommended modifications in the Specific
Reliefs Act, 1963 for ensuring the ease of doing business.
In the context of tremendous developments which have taken place since 1963 and
the present changed scenario involving contract based infrastructure developments,
public private partnerships and other public projects, involving huge investments;
and changes required in the present scheme of the Act and so that specific
performance is granted as a general rule and grant of compensation or damages for
non-performance remains as an exception, the committee decided -
(i) To change the approach, from damages being the rule and specific performance
being the rule and specific performance being the exception, to specific performance
being the rule, and damages being the alternate remedy.
(ii) To provide guidelines for reducing the discretion granted to courts and tribunals
while granting performance and injunctive reliefs.
(iii) To introduce provisions for rights of third parties (other than for government
contracts).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 25
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
(iv) To consider addressing
unconscionable contracts, unfair
contracts, reciprocity in contract, etc., and implied terms.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 28 The committee observed that there is a need to
classify diverse public utility contracts as a distinct class recognising the inherent
public interest/ importance to be addressed in the Act. Any public work must
progress without interruption. This requires consideration whether a court's
intervention in public works should be minimal. Smooth functioning of public works
projects can be effectively managed through a monitoring system and regulatory
mechanism. The role of courts in this exercise is to interfere to the minimum extent
so that public works projects will not be impeded or stalled."
21. Since the construction of road is an infrastructure project and keeping in view the intent of the
legislature that infrastructure projects should not be stayed, the High Court would have been well
advised to hold its hand to stay the construction of the infrastructure project. Such provision should
be kept in view even by the writ court while exercising it jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India."
13. That it is most respectfully begs to state that in the Affidavit-in-Opposition dated 16th October,
2023 of the Respondent (M/s Avantika) filed in MC(WP(C)) No. 140 of 2023 Ref.: WP(C) No. 358 of
2023 it is stated that - (i) at para No. 5 (page No. 3), it is stated as -
"It is submitted that the respondent-company has executed 95% of the work and so
far submitted bills of Rs. 100.78 Crores."
at para No. 14 (page No. 7), it is also stated as follows -
"It is submitted that the respondent-company has executed 95% of the work, whereas
the Department had stated that the respondent- company has completed 53.73% of
the work."
"As per the Joint-measurement report the percentage of work done by the
respondent- company is 49%, whereas according to the respondent-company the
percentage of work done is 97.61% after the Jont-measurement."
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 29 at para No. 16 (page No. 11), it is stated and
admitted that -
"It is submitted that as explained in the above- mentioned paragraph the percentage
of 95% of the work being completed by the respondent- company is correct,
therefore, the respondent- company has not made any false statement before this
Hon'ble Court. Moreover, the percentage of work done by the respondent-company is
disputed and not yet determined by this Hon'ble Court."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 26
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
As such, the work done by the petitioner is not 95% but only 45.27% i.e., Rs. 88.91 cr. or otherwise
only 53.73% as per the claims received by the Department. If the 95%, which is stated by the
petitioner in the writ petition, is correct, the value of work will be of Rs. 184.78 cr. And such amount
of bill is never received by the Department. It is further to state that the Bills are to be paid on
measurable and completed works. Hence, the disputed question of facts is clearly involved herein.
(ii) With regards the false statement made by the petitioner, the law settled by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court i.e., (2022) 12 SCC 815 (K. Jayaram & Ors -vs- Bangalore Development Authority & Ors.)
(para 13-14) is relied by the State Applicants. Relevant portion of the same are being reproduced
hereunder -
(cid:128) (2022) 12 SCC 815 -Para 13 (False Statement) (K. Jayaram & Ors -vs- Bangalore Development
Authority &Ors.) "13. In K.D. Sharma v. SAIL [K.D. Sharma v. SAIL, (2008) 12 SCC 481], it was held
thus: (SCC pp. 492-93, paras 34-
39) "34. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and of the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution is extraordinary, equitable and discretionary. Prerogative writs mentioned
therein are issued for doing substantial justice. It is, therefore, MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 30
of utmost necessity that the petitioner approaching the writ court must come with clean hands, put
forward all the facts before the court without concealing or suppressing anything and seek an
appropriate relief. If there is no candid disclosure of relevant and material facts or the petitioner is
guilty of misleading the court, his petition may be dismissed at the threshold without considering
the merits of the claim.
35. The underlying object has been succinctly stated by Scrutton, L.J., in the leading case of R. v.
Kensington Income Tax Commissioners [R. v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners, (1917) 1 KB
486 : 86 LJKB 257 : 116 LT 136 (KB & CA)] in the following words : (KB p.
514) '... it has been for many years the rule of the court, and one which it is of the greatest
importance to maintain, that when an applicant comes to the court to obtain relief on an ex parte
statement he should make a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts--it says facts, not law. He
must not misstate the law if he can help it--the court is supposed to know the law. But it knows
nothing about the facts, and the applicant must state fully and fairly the facts; and the penalty by
which the court enforces that obligation is that if it finds out that the facts have not been fully and
fairly stated to it, the court will set aside any action which it has taken on the faith of the imperfect
statement.'
36. A prerogative remedy is not a matter of course. While exercising extraordinary power a writ
court would certainly bear in mind the conduct of the party who invokes the jurisdiction of the
court. If the applicant makes a false statement or suppresses material fact or attempts to mislead the
court, the court may dismiss the action on that ground alone and may refuse to enter into the merits
of the case by stating, 'We will not listen to your application because of what you have done.' The
rule has been evolved in the larger public interest to deter unscrupulous litigants from abusing the
process of court by deceiving it.

37. In Kensington Income Tax Commissioners [R. v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners, (1917)
1 KB 486: 86 LJKB 257 : 116 LT 136 (KB & CA)] , Viscount Reading, C.J. observed :
(KB pp. 495-96) MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 31 '... Where an ex parte
application has been made to this Court for a rule nisi or other process, if the Court
comes to the conclusion that the affidavit in support of the application was not
candid and did not fairly state the facts, but stated them in such a way as to mislead
the Court as to the true facts, the Court ought, for its own protection and to prevent
an abuse of its process, to refuse to proceed any further with the examination of the
merits. This is a power inherent in the Court, but one which should only be used in
cases which bring conviction to the mind of the Court that it has been deceived.
Before coming to this conclusion, a careful examination will be made of the facts as
they are and as they have been stated in the applicant's affidavit, and everything will
be heard that can be urged to influence the view of the Court when it reads the
affidavit and knows the true facts. But if the result of this examination and hearing is
to leave no doubt that the Court has been deceived, then it will refuse to hear
anything further from the applicant in a proceeding which has only been set in
motion by means of a misleading affidavit.'
38. The above principles have been accepted in our legal system also. As per settled law, the party
who invokes the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 or of a High Court under
Article 226 of the Constitution is supposed to be truthful, frank and open. He must disclose all
material facts without any reservation even if they are against him. He cannot be allowed to play
"hide and seek" or to "pick and choose" the facts he likes to disclose and to suppress (keep back) or
not to disclose (conceal) other facts. The very basis of the writ jurisdiction rests in disclosure of true
and complete (correct) facts. If material facts are suppressed or distorted, the very functioning of
writ courts and exercise would become impossible. The petitioner must disclose all the facts having
a bearing on the relief sought without any qualification. This is because "the court knows law but not
facts".
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 32
39. If the primary object as highlighted in Kensington Income Tax Commissioners [R. v. Kensington
Income Tax Commissioners, (1917) 1 KB 486 : 86 LJKB 257 :
116 LT 136 (KB & CA)] is kept in mind, an applicant who does not come with candid
facts and "clean breast" cannot hold a writ of the court with "soiled hands".
Suppression or concealment of material facts is not an advocacy. It is a jugglery,
manipulation, manoeuvring or misrepresentation, which has no place in equitable
and prerogative jurisdiction. If the applicant does not disclose all the material facts
fairly and truly but states them in a distorted manner and misleads the court, the
court has inherent power in order to protect itself and to prevent an abuse of its
process to discharge the rule nisi and refuse to proceed further with the examination
of the case on merits. If the court does not reject the petition on that ground, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 28
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
court would be failing in its duty. In fact, such an applicant requires to be dealt with
for contempt of court for abusing the process of the court."
14. That it is humbly submitted that the matter clearly involves disputed question of
facts as admitted by the writ petitioner in the objection affidavit dated 9.10.2023. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court in catena of cases has held that disputed questions of facts
fall outside the writ jurisdiction of Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India.
The State Applicants also relied on the following settled position of law decided by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India -
(cid:128) (2021 SCC Online SC 562) - para 25 (Disputed question of fact) (Shubhas Jain - versus -
Rajeshwari Shivam & Ors.) "25. It is well settled that the High Court exercising its extraordinary
writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, does not adjudicate hotly disputed
questions of facts. It is not for the High Court to make a comparative assessment of conflicting
technical reports and decide which one is acceptable."
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 33
(cid:128) (2005) 12 SCC 725 -Paras 7, 8, 9, 10
(Disputed question of fact)(Orissa Agro Industries Corpn. Ltd. & Ors. -vs- Bharati Industries & Ors.)
"7. A bare perusal of the High Court's judgment shows that there was clear non-application of mind.
On one hand the High Court observed that the disputed questions cannot be gone into a writ
petition. It was also noticed that the essence of the dispute was breach of contract. After coming to
the above conclusions the High Court should have dismissed the writ petition. Surprisingly, the
High Court proceeded to examine the case solely on the writ petitioner's assertion and on a very
curious reasoning that though the appellant Corporation claimed that the value of articles lifted was
nearly Rs 14.90 lakhs no details were specifically given. From the counter-affidavit filed before the
High Court it is crystal-clear that relevant details disputing claim of the writ petitioner were given.
Value of articles lifted by the writ petitioner is a disputed factual question. Where a complicated
question of fact is involved and the matter requires thorough proof on factual aspects, the High
Court should not entertain the writ petition. Whether or not the High Court should exercise
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution would largely depend upon the nature of dispute
and if the dispute cannot be resolved without going into the factual controversy, the High Court
should not entertain the writ petition. As noted above, the writ petition was primarily founded on
allegation of breach of contract. Question whether the action of the opposite party in the writ
petition amounted to breach of contractual obligation ultimately depends on facts and would
require material evidence to be scrutinised and in such a case writ jurisdiction should not be
exercised. (See State of Bihar v. Jain Plastics & Chemicals Ltd. [(2002) 1 SCC 216])
8. In a catena of cases this Court has held that where the dispute revolves round questions of fact,
the matter ought not to be entertained under Article 226 of the Constitution. [See State Bank of
India v. State Bank of India Canteen Employees' Union [(1998) 5 SCC 74 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1270]
and Chairman, Grid Corpn. of Orissa Ltd. (GRIDCO) v. Sukamani Das [(1999) 7 SCC 298] .]

9. In the instant case the High Court has itself observed that disputed questions of fact were
involved and yet went on to give directions as if it was adjudicating the money claim in a suit. The
course is clearly impermissible.
(See G.M., Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Ltd. v. Satrughan Nishad [(2003) 8 SCC 639] and Rourkela
Shramik Sangh v. Steel Authority of India Ltd. [(2003) 4 SCC 317 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 456]
10. In National Highways Authority of India v. Ganga Enterprises [(2003) 7 SCC 410] it was
observed by this Court that the question whether the writ petition was maintainable in a claim
arising out of a breach of contract should be answered first by the High Court as it would go to the
root of the matter. The writ petitioner had displayed ingenuity in its search for invalidating
circumstances; but a writ petition is not an appropriate remedy for impeaching contractual
obligations. (See Har Shankar v. Dy. Excise and Taxation Commr. [(1975) 1 SCC 737: AIR 1975 SC
1121] and Divisional Forest Officer v. Bishwanath Tea Co. Ltd. [(1981) 3 SCC 238 : AIR 1981 SC
1368])"
15. That it is most respectfully begs to submit that as disputed question of fact is
clearly involved beyond any doubt, the writ is not maintainable and, in this regard
the State Applicants relied upon the following settled position of law decided by the
Hon'ble Supreme of Court of India -
(cid:128) (1996) 6 SCC 623-Para 19 (Maintainability) (TK Lanzxthika -vs- Seth Karsandas
Jamnadas) "19. As the third proviso to Section 11(3) disentitles a landlord from
applying for eviction of the tenant before the expiry of the quarantine period, the
petition filed by the landlord in this case has to be dismissed only on that ground.
Any observation made on this case in the proceedings based on such a
non-maintainable petition must stand erased from judicial notice. If the present
landlord filed a new petition must stand erased from judicial notice. If the present
landlord files a new petition for eviction under the Act, as the ban period is over, the
same has to be considered and disposed of uninfluenced by any of the observations
made by the High Court or the courts below thereto."
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 35
(cid:128) (2023) 7 SCC 740 - Paras 23, 39
(Maintainability)(S. Narahari & Ors. -vs- SR Kumar & Ors.) "23. We are of the
considered opinion that only after the issue of maintainability is decided upon, can
this Court enter into the merits of the case. The issue of maintainability of special
leave petition is akin to a rite of passage, and only after it is deemed that special leave
petition is maintainable, can an entry be taken into the merits of a dispute."
"39. Therefore, in light of the abovementioned observations, we are of the opinion
that to put a quietus to such an issue, it is necessary for the same to be adjudicated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 30
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
and deliberated upon by a larger Bench of this Court. Further, since only after such a
preliminary objection is decided, can the merits of the present case be entered into,
the same is to be placed before an appropriate Bench after the question of law is
decided by the larger Bench."
(cid:128) (2002) 1 SCC 475 - Para 6 (Maintainability) (Gagandeep Pratishthan Pvt. Ltd. &
Ors. - vs- Mechano & Anr.) "6. In view of the peculiar facts of this case without going
into the merits of the contentions raised by the counsel for the appellants, we think it
is just and fair that we should not at this point of time interfere with the impugned
order though the High Court could have avoided passing such orders in proceedings
where the maintainability itself was being seriously questioned, be that as it may, we
at this stage think it appropriate that the High Court should consider the question of
condonation of delay and the objection of the appellants herein in regard to
maintainability of the appeal first, before proceeding with the appeal any further. We
also think it to be just and proper that any further interim orders if necessary in the
appeal before the High Court in regard to the suit property should be made only after
deciding the question of delay and maintainability of the appeal and the order already
made should be confined to the appointment of a Receiver and filing of his report
only, meaning thereby that the impugned order be confined to the appointment of
Receiver for the purpose of filing his report as directed by the Court and nothing
beyond that, at this stage."
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 36
(cid:128) (2003) 7 SCC 410 - Para 6
(Maintainability) (National Highways Authority of India -vs- Ganga Enterprises &
Anr.) "6. The respondent then filed a writ petition in the High Court for refund of the
amount. On the pleadings before it, the High Court raised two questions viz.: (a)
whether the forfeiture of security deposit is without authority of law and without any
binding contract between the parties and also contrary to Section 5 of the Contract
Act; and (b) whether the writ petition is maintainable in a claim arising out of a
breach of contract. Question (b) should have been first answered as it would go to the
root of the matter. The High Court instead considered Question (a) and then chose
not to answer Question (b). In our view, the answer to Question (b) is clear. It is
settled law that disputes relating to contracts cannot be agitated under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India. It has been so held in the cases of Kerala SEB v. Kurien E.
Kalathil [(2000) 6 SCC 293], State of U.P. v. Bridge & Roof Co. (India) Ltd. [(1996) 6
SCC 22] and Bareilly Development Authority v. Ajai Pal Singh [(1989) 2 SCC 116].
This is settled law. The dispute in this case was regarding the terms of offer. They
were thus contractual disputes in respect of which a writ court was not the proper
forum. Mr Dave, however, relied upon the cases of Verigamto Naveen v. Govt. of A.P.
[(2001) 8 SCC 344] and Harminder Singh Arora v. Union of India [(1986) 3 SCC
247]. These, however, are cases where the writ court was enforcing a statutory right
or duty.These cases do not lay down that a writ court can interfere in a matter of
contract only. Thus, on the ground of maintainability the petition should have been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 31
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
dismissed."
(cid:128) (2006) 11 SCC 696 - Para 42 (Maintainability)(Union of India & Ors. -vs- Ranbir
Singh Rathaur & Ors.) "42. On a bare reading of the High Court's order and the
averments in the writ petitions, one thing is crystal clear that there was no definite
allegation against any person who was responsible for the so- called manipulation. It
is also not clear as to who were the parties in the writ petitions filed. In the grounds
indicated in the writ petitions it was stated MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 37 that
there is no bar or impediment on the High Court reviewing the petitioner's case as
also connected cases to enquire into the validity of the acts done against the writ
petitioner. Therefore, it was an accepted position that the writ petitioners wanted
review of the High Court's order, which is clearly impermissible. No ground for
seeking such review apparently was made out. In any event we feel that the High
Court's approach is clearly erroneous. The present appellants in the counter-affidavit
filed had raised a preliminary objection as regards the maintainability of the writ
petitions and had requested the High Court to grant further opportunity if the
necessity so arises to file a detailed counter-affidavit after the preliminary objections
were decided. The High Court in fact in one of the orders clearly indicated that the
preliminary objections were to be decided first. But strangely it did not do so. It
reserved the judgment and delivered the final judgment after about three years.
There is also dispute as to whether the relevant documents were produced. What
baffles us is that in the High Court, records with original documents were shown to it
and the Bench wanted the copies to be filed. In the impugned judgment the High
Court proceeded on the basis as if only a few pages of the files were shown. If that was
really the case, there was no necessity for the High Court to direct the present
appellants to file copies. If after perusal of the documents the High Court felt that
these were not sufficient the same would have been stated. But that does not appear
to have been done. The High Court also had not discussed as to how the matters
which stood concluded could be reopened in the manner done. No sufficient grounds
have been even indicated as to why the High Court felt it necessary to do so. To say
that though finality had been achieved, justice stood at a higher pedestal is not an
answer to the basic question as to whether the High Court was competent to reopen
the whole issue which had become concluded. The persons whom the High Court felt
were responsible for alleged manipulation or persons behind false implication were
not impleaded as parties. Newspaper reports are not to be considered as evidence.
The authenticity of the newspaper reports was not MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page
38 established by the writ petitioners. Even otherwise, this could not have been done
in a writ petition, as disputed questions of fact were apparently involved. The matters
which the High Court found to have been established were really not so. The
conclusions were based on untested materials, and the writ petitioners had not
established them by evidence. Since the High Court has not dealt with the matter in
the proper perspective we feel that it would be proper for the High Court to rehear
the matter. The High Court shall first decide the preliminary objections raised by the
present appellants about the non-maintainability of the writ petitions. Normally such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 32
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
a course is not to be adopted. But in view of the peculiar facts involved, it would be
the appropriate course to be adopted in the present case. Therefore, we remit the
matter to the High Court for fresh hearing. We make it clear that whatever we have
observed should not be treated to be the conclusive findings on the subject-matter of
controversy. The appeals are allowed without any order as to costs. Since the matter
is pending since long, we request the High Court to dispose of the matter as early as
practicable, preferably within four months from the date of receipt of the judgment.
No costs."
16. That it is most respectfully begs to submit that in addition to the above disputed question of
facts, there is a breach of trust and violation of the terms of the Contract Agreement and the same is
to be settled as per Clause No. 25 of the Contract Agreement dated 8.6.2021 (Annexure A/5 to the
writ petition) which states as follows:
"Clause 25 - Settlement of Disputes & Arbitration - Except where otherwise provided
in the contract, all questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the
specifications, design, drawings and Instructions here-In-before mentioned and as to
the quality of workmanship or materials used on the work or as to any other
question, claim, right, matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising out of or
relating to the contract, designs, drawings, specifications, estimates, instructions,
orders or these conditions or otherwise concerning the works or the execution or
failure to execute the same whether arising during the progress of the work or after
the cancellation, MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 39 termination, completion or
abandonment thereof shall be dealt with as mentioned hereinafter.
I. If the contractor considers any work demanded of him to be outside the
requirements of the contract, or disputes any drawings, record or decision given in
writing by the Engineer-in- Charge or if the Engineer-in-Charge considers any act or
decision of the contractor on any matter in connection with or arising out of the
contract or carrying out of the work, to be unacceptable and is disputed, such party
shall promptly within 15 days of the arising of the disputes request the chief Engineer
or where there is no Chief Engineer, the Additional Director General (CE/ADG) who
shall refer the disputes to Dispute Redressal Committee (DRC) within 15 days along
with a list of disputes with amounts claimed if any in respect of each such dispute.
The Dispute Redressal Committee (DRC) give its decision within a period of 60 days
extendable by 30 days by consent of both the parties from the receipt of reference
from CE/ADG. The constitution of Dispute Redressal Committee (DRC) shall be as
indicated in Schedule 'F'.
Provided that no party shall be represented before the Dispute Redressal Committee by an
advocate/legal counsel etc. The DRC will submit its decision to the Concerned ADG/SDG for
acceptance. ADG/SDG in a time limit of 30 days from receipt of DRC decision will convey
acceptance or otherwise on the said decision. If the Dispute Redressal Committee (DRC) fails to give
its decision within the aforesaid period or the ADG/SDG fails to give his decision in the aforesaid

arbitrator on prescribed proforma as per Appendix XVII under intimation to the other party.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 40 It is a term of contract that each party invoking arbitration
must exhaust the aforesaid mechanism of settlement of claims/disputes prior to invoking
arbitration.
The CE/ADG/DG shall in such case appoint the sole arbitrator or one of the three arbitrators as the
case may be within 30 days of receipt of such a request and refer such disputes to arbitration.
Wherever the Arbitral Tribunal consists of three Arbitrators, the contractor shall appoint one
arbitrator within 30 days of making request for arbitration or of receipt of request by Engineer-in-
Charge to CE/ADG/DG for appointment of arbitrator, as the case may be, and two appointed
arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator who shall act as the Presiding Arbitrator. In the event of
-
a. A party fails to appoint the second Arbitrator, or b. The two appointed Arbitrators fail to appoint
the Presiding Arbitrator, then the Chief Engineer, Manipur PWD shall appoint the second or
Presiding Arbitrator as the case may be.
II. Disputes or difference shall be referred for adjudication through arbitration by a Tribunal having
sole arbitrator where claimed amount is Rs. 20 crore or less. Where claimed value is more than Rs.
20 crore, Tribunal shall consist of three Arbitrators as above. The requirements of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) and any further statutory modifications or re- enactment
thereof and the rules made there under and for the time being in force shall be applicable.
It is a term of this contract that the party invoking arbitration shall give a list of disputes with
amounts claimed, if any, in respect of each such dispute along with the notice for appointment of
arbitrator and giving reference to the decision of ADG/SDG on the finding / recommendation of
DRC.
It is also a term of this contract that any member of the Arbitration Tribunal shall be a Graduate
Engineer with experience in handling public works engineering and further he shall have earlier
worked at a level not lower than Chief Engineer/ equivalent (i.e. Joint Secretary level of Government
of India). This shall be treated as a mandatory qualification to be appointed as arbitrator.

Subject to provision In the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) as amended in 2015
whereby the counter claims if any can be directly filed before the arbitrator without any requirement
of reference by the appointing authority, the arbitrator shall adjudicate on only such disputes as are
referred to him by the appointing authority and give separate award against each dispute and claim
referred to him and in all cases where the total amount of the claims by any party exceeds Rs.
1,00,000/-, the arbitrator shall give reasons for the award.
It is also a term of the contract that fees payable to the arbitral tribunal shall be as approved by Chief
Engineer, PWD, Manipur. This fee shall be shared equally by parties.
The place of arbitration shall be as mentioned in Schedule F. In case there is no mention of place of
arbitration, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the place of arbitration.
The venue of the arbitration shall be such place as may be fixed by the Arbitral Tribunal in
consultation with both the parties. Failing any such agreement, then the Arbitral Tribunal shall
decide the venue."
It is further humbly begged to submit that in this regard, the State Applicants relied upon the
decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India &Ors. -vs- Puna Hinda reported
in (2021) 10 SCC 690 - Para 24, which reads as follows -
"24. Therefore, the dispute could not be raised by way of a writ petition on the
disputed questions of fact. Though, the jurisdiction of the High Court is wide but in
respect of pure contractual matters in the field of private law, having no statutory
flavour, are better adjudicated upon by the forum agreed to by the parties. The
dispute as to whether the amount is payable or not and/or how much amount is
payable are disputed questions of facts. There is no admission on the part of the
appellants to infer that the amount stands crystallised. Therefore, in the absence of
any acceptance of joint survey report MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 42 by the
competent authority, no right would accrue to the writ petitioner only because
measurements cannot be undertaken after passage of time. Maybe, the resurvey
cannot take place but the measurement books of the work executed from time to time
would form a reasonable basis for assessing the amount due and payable to the writ
petitioner, but such process could be undertaken only by the agreed forum i.e.
arbitration and not by the writ court as it does not have the expertise in respect of
measurements or construction of roads."
17. That the State Applicants most respectfully begs to submit that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
catena of Cases has decided that the judgments passed by Courts without jurisdiction is nullify. The
State Applicants relied upon the case of Harshad Chiman Lal Modi -versus- DLF Universal Ltd. &
Anr reported in (2005) 7 SCC 791 Para No. 33. Relevant portion is being reproduced hereunder -

"33. In Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan [(1955) 1 SCR 117 : AIR 1954 SC 340] this
Court declared :
(SCR p. 121) "It is a fundamental principle well established that a decree passed by a
court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever
and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution
and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction ... strikes at the very
authority of the court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by
consent of parties."
(emphasis supplied)
18. In the fact and circumstances, there is disputed question of fact involved in the present case and
this Hon'ble Court has no jurisdiction to deal the same. On the other hand, the question of breach of
Contract Agreement is also involved herein and the same has to be dealt under the Clause 25
provided in the Contract Agreement. And importantly, the work involved herein is of public
importance and the interim order dated 1.8.2023 and its subsequent orders are liable to be vacated/
modified.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 43 In conclusion, the interim Order dated 1.8.2023 and its

of 2023 against the respondents herein and this Hon'ble Court vide order dated 22.11.2023 was

MC (Rev. Pet.) No. 01 of 2024.
4. That, this Hon'ble High Court after hearing the Parties, had at this juncture had confined itself in
adjudicating the following 2 (two) questions which are set out below:
I. Whether the present writ petition is maintainable or not due to the disputed
question of facts involved in the present case? II. Whether the interim orders dated
01.08.2023, 09.10.2023 and subsequent extension orders passed in the instant writ
petition i.e., W.P.(C) No. 385 of 2023 ought to be vacated/modified or not?
III. Whether the present writ petition is maintainable or not due to the disputed question of facts
involved in the present case?
5. The present writ petition does not challenge any disputed questions of facts nor does it involve
any such disputes. The petitioner solely challenges the legality and validity of the termination letter
dated 11.04.2024, through which the respondent terminated the agreement dated 08.06.2021.The
said termination letter is also violative of the direction in the judgment and order dated 04.04.2023
passed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in Para 25(iv).
6. The termination of the agreement dated 08.06.2021 is alleged to be driven by malafide intentions,
infringing upon the rights of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 14, 19(1)(g), and 21 of the
Constitution of India. Despite the obligation to act with fairness, reasonableness, and in accordance
with the law, the respondent authorities acted capriciously, thereby causing prejudice to the
petitioner's rights.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 49
7. Additionally, the present writ petition incorporates a public law element in public law field that
encompasses the interest of the public at large. It is a well-established legal principle that when an
individual is aggrieved by the violation of fundamental rights and the cardinal principles of natural
justice committed by a statutory authority, the remedy in the form of a writ under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India cannot be denied. Reliance is placed on Cube Construction Engineers v. State
of Gujarat &Ors., SCA No. 11486 of 2021, whereby on relying on the ABL International Ltd. v.
Export Credit Guarantee Corporation on India, (2004) 3 SCC 553, held that it is the obligation of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 39
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
High Court under Article 226, to enforce the statutory duty of the state. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
vide order dated 31-7-2023 in SLP (C) Diary No. 24511/2023 was please to dismiss the SLP filed
against the said judgment.
8. That, having an arbitration clause in the agreement, does not bar the petitioner from invocation
of the writ jurisdiction. In the case of Harbanslal Sahnia & Anr. v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd &Ors.,
(2003) 2 SCC 107, the Hon'ble Supreme Court emphasized that the High Court can entertain a writ
petition despite the availability of an alternate remedy if certain conditions are met, including: i)
enforcement of fundamental rights; ii) failure of principles of natural justice; iii) the impugned
order being wholly without jurisdiction; or iv) challenging the vires of the act. That the said
judgment was also upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India &Ors. v.
Tantia Constructions, (2011) 5 SCC 697, U.P. Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. v. CG Power and
Industrial Solutions Ltd., (2021) 6 SCC 15, Unitech Limited &Ors. v. Telangana State Industrial
Infrastructure Corporation, (2021) 16 SCC 35, and M.P. Power Management Company Ltd. v. Sky
Power Southeast Solar India Private Ltd. &Ors., (2023) 2 SCC 703.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 50
9. In the present case, the action taken by the Respondent Department suffers from manifest,
arbitrariness and violates the cardinal principals of natural justice. That the Petitioner herein is
seeking the enforcement of rights under Article 14, 19(1)(g), and 21, citing a violation of the
principles of natural justice.
10. That relief sought by the Petitioner through the instant writ petition falls outside the scope and
jurisdiction of arbitration. Consequently, the alternative forum would not be capable of providing
the appropriate relief, specifically the invocation of the writ of certiorari and mandamus against the
respondent State. Reliance is placed on the Hon'ble Supreme Court judgment titled as Sanajana M.
Wig v. Hindustan Petro Corporation Ltd. (2005) 8 SCC
242.
11. It is respectfully submitted that the writ petitioner had relied upon the various judgments of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, where it was held that a writ petition can be maintained in a
contractual manner in the following alternative scenarios, despite existence of an arbitration
clauses:
a) The lis involves a public law character or requires a judicial determination in rem;
b) The alternate forum chosen by the parties
would not be in a position to grand
appropriate relief;
c) A statutory contract is in question or the
action of a State or its instrumentality is demonstrably arbitrary, unreasonable or
violative of the fundamental rights of a party;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 40
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 51
d) The matter does not relate only to the
interpretation of a contract, which is within the domain of an arbitrator.
12. Hence, in light of the aforesaid submission, the present petition is maintainable under Article
226 of the Indian Constitution whereby, petitioner is seeking an enforcement of a fundamental right
and the lis involves public law character.
I. Whether the interim orders dated 01.08.2023, 09.10.2023 and subsequent extension orders
passed in the instant writ petition i.e., W.P.(C) No. 385 of 2023 ought to be vacated/modified or
not?
II. It is respectfully submitted that interim order in the present matters was passed based on the
settled principles taking into account the three basic grounds i.e., prima facie case, balance of
convenience and irreparable loss in the particular facts and circumstance of the case. III. In the
instant case, firstly prima facie case favors the petitioner, given the substantial completion of a
significant portion of the work. Moreover, this Hon'ble Court, through a judgment and final order
dated 04.04.2023, disposed of PIL No. 34 of 2022 after hearing both parties and considering the
specific facts of the case. In this order, the Hon'ble Court directed the respondent State and the
petitioner herein to complete the work within a period of 3 (three) months. Despite these explicit
directions, the Department arbitrarily and unlawfully terminated the work on 11.04.2023 within a
week. The present writ is filed to enforce a fundamental right, and considering the public law
character of the MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 52 dispute, it was admitted as a prima facie case
was established from the outset.
IV. Secondly, the balance of convenience distinctly favors the petitioner, considering the substantial
time and financial resources already invested in executing the work, which is now approaching
completion. The arbitrary and illegal termination of the Civil Secretariat Balance work not only
poses significant financial loss to the petitioner but also further delays in the project's completion,
leading to additional losses to the public exchequer. Moreover, it is emphasized that if the interim
order is vacated, the present matter would become infructuous. Therefore, the balance of
convenience leans in favor of the Petitioner.
V. Thirdly, petitioner is poised to suffer irreparable loss due to the arbitrary and illegal termination,
evident in the idleness of its machinery and materials at the work site. This idle period has caused
further delays in the ongoing works and, additionally, impacts other projects of the petitioner. The
potential irreparable loss, which cannot be fully compensated in monetary terms, necessitated the
granting of the interim order. Consequently, this Hon'ble Court, recognizing the urgency and
potential harm to the petitioner, passed an interim order dated 01.08.2023 in favor of the
petitioner. This interim relief not only addresses the immediate concerns but also contributes to
securing the final relief sought by the petitioner in the writ petition.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 53 VI. Therefore, the three cardinal principles i.e., prima facie
case; balance of convenience; and irreparable injury, which are required to be considered in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 41
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
proper perspective in the facts and circumstances of a particular case for granting the interim relief,
lies in the favor of the Petitioner.
VII. That the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Zenit Mataplast (P) Ltd vs State of
Maharashtra, (2009)10 SCC 388 and Benedict Denis Kinny v. Tulip Brian Miranda & Ors., (2021) 12
SCC 780, held that the interim relief is passed as a temporary arrangement to preserve the status
quo till the matter is decided finally, to ensure that the matter does not become either infructuous or
a fait accompli before the final hearing. Therefore, the object of granting interim relief is, to protect
the petitioner against injury by violation of his right for which he could not be adequately
compensated in damages recoverable in the action.
VIII. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention here that the order dated 01.08.2023, instructing
both the petitioner and Respondent No. 3 to uphold the status quo, was issued in public interest.
Additionally, failure to grant the status quo by this Hon'ble Court would allow the Respondent
department to establish third- party rights, leading to substantial delays in the completion of the
said project.
IX. Furthermore, the judgment and final order dated 04.04.2023 passed by the Division Bench of
this Hon'ble Court has not been challenged by the respondent before the Hon'ble Supreme Court
and thereby it has attained finality. Hence, the Single Bench of this Hon'ble should MC(WP(C)) No.
357 of 2023 Page 54 maintain the judicial discipline and cannot bypass the judgment and final order
dated 04.04.2023, passed by the larger bench. Reliance is placed on Official Liquidator v.
Dayanand, (2008) 10 SCC 1, passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.
X. That recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of N.G. Projects Ltd. v. Vinod Kumar
Jain&Ors., (2022) 6 SCC 127 ("NG Projects"), while adjudicating the similar issue, set aside the
termination by the State and directed the state to allow the contractor to resume and complete the
work by excluding the period spent in the stay of execution of the contract. Relevant excerpt of the
judgment is reproduced herein below:
"25. In view thereof, we find that the action of the respondent in setting aside the
letter of acceptance granted to the appellant suffers from manifest illegality and
cannot be sustained. Consequently, the appeal is disposed of with a direction to the
respondent State to allow the appellant to resume and complete the work by
excluding the period spent in the stay of execution of the contract."
XI. Therefore, the relief of status quo vide order dated 01.08.2023, was granted by this Hon'ble
Court after relying on the above said three cardinal principles, which lies in favour of the petitioner
herein. Therefore, the interim orders dated 01.08.2023, 09.10.2023 and subsequent extension
orders passed in the instant writ petition i.e., W.P.(C) No. 385 of 2023, cannot be vacated or
modified.
Conclusions/Relief: In the light of the above submissions, it is respectfully submitted that the
instant writ petition is maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 42
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
petitioner has satisfied the three cardinal principles, upon which this Hon'ble Court has MC(WP(C))
No. 357 of 2023 Page 55 granted the interim relief. Therefore, miscellaneous application bearing
MC(W.P.(C)) No.357 of 2023, may be dismissed and the instant writ petition bearing W.P.(C) No.
358 of 2023, may be heard on merits for final disposal.
Furthermore, it is essential to note here that, three cardinal principles strongly support the
petitioner's case and as per the directions passed in NG Project Supra, the termination letter dated
11.04.2023 should be quashed. Additionally, the Respondent must be directed to allow the
Petitioner to resume work and complete the project in the broader interest of the public and without
infringing upon the Petitioner's fundamental rights".
Learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner relied upon the following Hon'ble Supreme Court
judgments in support of his case;
(cid:128) SCA No. 11486 of 2021 (Cube construction Engineers Vs. State of Gujarat &Ors.) SLP (C) Diary
No. 24511 of 2023 (The Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Gujarat vs Cube Construction
Engineering Ltd. &Ors., SLP (C) Diary NO. 24511 of 2023, Vide order dated 31.07.2023 dismiss
SLP.) (cid:128) (2003) 2 SCC 107 - (HarbanslalSahnia and AnrVs. Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. &Ors).
"7. So far as the view taken by the High Court that the remedy by way of recourse to
arbitration clause was available to the appellants and therefore the writ petition filed
by the appellants was liable to be dismissed is concerned, suffice it to observe that the
rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative remedy is a rule
of discretion and not one of compulsion. In an appropriate case, in spite of
availability of the alternative remedy, the High Court may still exercise its writ
jurisdiction in at least three contingencies: (i) where the writ petition MC(WP(C)) No.
357 of 2023 Page 56 seeks enforcement of any of the fundamental rights; (ii) where
there is failure of principles of natural justice; or (iii) where the orders or proceedings
are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged. (See Whirlpool
Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade Marks.) The present case attracts applicability of the first
two contingencies. Moreover, as noted, the petitioners' dealership, which is their
bread and butter, came to be terminated for an irrelevant and non-existent cause. In
such circumstances, we feel that the appellants should have been allowed relief by the
High Court itself instead of driving them to the need of initiating arbitration
proceedings."
(cid:128) (2011) 5 SCC 697 - (Union of India & Ors. Vs Tantia constructions).
"33. Apart from the above, even on the question of maintainability of the writ petition
on account of the arbitration clause included in the agreement between the parties, it
is now well established that an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to the
invocation of the writ jurisdiction of the High Court or the Supreme Court and that
without exhausting such alternative remedy, a writ petition would not be
maintainable. The various decisions cited by Mr. Chakraborty would clearly indicate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 43
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
that the constitutional powers vested in the High Court or the Supreme Court cannot
be fettered by any alternative remedy available to the authorities. Injustice, whenever
and wherever it takes place, has to be struck down as an anathema to the rule of law
and the provisions of the Constitution."
(cid:128) (2021) 6 SCC 15 - U.P. Power Transmission Corpn. Ltd Vs CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd.)
"66. Even though there is an arbitration clause, the petitioner herein has not opposed the writ
petition on the ground of existence of an arbitration clause. There is no whisper of any arbitration
agreement in the counter- affidavit filed by UPPTCL to the writ petition in the High Court. In any
case, the existence of an arbitration clause does not debar the court from entertaining a writ
petition."
(cid:128) (2021) 16 SCC 35 - (Unitech Limited & Ors. Vs Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure
Corporation) MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 57 "38. Much of the ground which was sought to be
canvassed in the course of the pleadings is now subsumed in the submissions which have been urged
before this Court on behalf of the State of Telangana and TSIIC. As we have noted earlier, during the
course of the hearing, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Telangana and
ISIIC informed the Court that the entitlement of Unitech to seek a refund is not questioned nor is
the availability of the land for carrying out the project being placed in issue. The learned Senior
Counsel also did not agitate the ground that a remedy for the recovery of moneys arising out a
contractual matter cannot be availed of under Article 226 of the Constitution. However, to clear the
ground, it is necessary to postulate that recourse to the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution is not excluded altogether in a contractual matter. A public law remedy is available for
enforcing legal rights subject to well- settled parameters.
39. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corpn. of
India Ltd. 14 [ABL International] analysed a long line of precedent of this Court is to conclude that
writs under Article 226 are maintainable for asserting contractual rights against the State, or its
instrumentalities, as defined under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution.
39.1. Speaking through N. Santosh Hegde, J. the Court held: (ABL International casela, SCC p. 572,
para 27) "27.... the following legal principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:
(a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a State or an instrumentality of a
State arising out of a contractual obligation is maintainable.
(b) Merely because some disputed questions of fact arise for consideration, same
cannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases as a matter of
rule.
(c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief of monetary claim is also
maintainable."

The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
This exposition has been followed by this Court, and has been adopted by the three-Judge Bench
decisions of this Court in State of U.P. v. Sudhir Kumar Singh and Popatrao Vyankatrao Patil v.
State of Maharashtra.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 58 39.2. The decision in ABL International, cautions that the
plenary power under Article 226 must be used with circumspection when other remedies have been
provided by the contract. But as a statement of principle, the jurisdiction under Article 226 is not
excluded in contractual matters.
39.3. Article 23.1 of the development agreement in the present case mandates the parties to resolve
their disputes through an arbitration. However, the presence of an arbitration clause within a
contract between a State instrumentality and a private party has not acted as an absolute bar to
availing remedies under Article 226, 39.4. If the State instrumentality violates its constitutional
mandate under Article 14 to act fairly and reasonably, relief under the plenary powers of Article 226
of the Constitution would lie. This principle was recognised in ABL International14: (ABL
International case, SCC p. 572, para
28) "28. However, while entertaining an objection as to the maintainability of a writ petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the fact that the power to
issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited
by any other provisions of the Constitution. The High Court having regard to the facts of the case,
has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon itself
certain restrictions in the exercise of this power. (See Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade Marks.)
And this plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by
the Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless such action of the State or its
instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate of Article
14 or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for which the Court thinks it necessary to exercise the
said jurisdiction."
39.5. Therefore, while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226, the Court is entitled to enquire
into whether the action of the State or its instrumentalities is arbitrary or unfair and in consequence,
in violation of Article 14. The jurisdiction under Article 226 is a valuable constitutional safeguard
against an arbitrary exercise of State power or a misuse of authority.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 59 39.6. In determining as to whether the jurisdiction should be
exercised in a contractual dispute, the Court must, undoubtedly eschew, disputed questions of fact
which would depend upon an evidentiary determination requiring a trial. But equally, it is well
settled that the jurisdiction under Article 226 cannot be ousted only on the basis that the dispute
pertains to the contractual arena. This is for the simple reason that the State and its
instrumentalities are not exempt from the duty to act fairly merely because in their business
dealings they have entered into the realm of contract. Similarly, the presence of an arbitration clause
does (sic not) oust the jurisdiction under Article 226 in all cases though, it still needs to be decided
from case to case as to whether recourse to a public law remedy can justifiably be invoked.

The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
39.7. The jurisdiction under Article 226 was rightly invoked by the Single Judge and the Division
Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in this case, when the foundational representation of the
contract has failed. TSIIC, a State instrumentality, has not just reneged on its contractual obligation,
but hoarded the refund of the principal and interest on the consideration that was paid by Unitech
over a decade ago. It does not dispute the entitlement of Unitech to the refund of its principal.
40. In the present case, the basic postulate underlying the contract between the parties was the
availability of the land which comprised the project site. The LoA dated 28-11- 2007 stated that the
allotment of land was subject to the outcome of the pending appeal before the High Court of Andhra
Pradesh. The dispute over the title of the Government of Andhra Pradesh was the subject of the
pending litigation. At the same time, the LoA mandated that Unitech must pay the amount
stipulated including the purchase price of Rs. 145 crores for the land as well as the project
development expenses. A failure to do so would constitute a significant event of default resulting in a
forfeiture of the earnest money deposit. Acting on the LoA, Unitech did in fact comply with its
obligation to pay, having paid a total amount of Rs. 165 crores towards the purchase price, besides
the earnest money deposit and project development expenses. The development agreement which
was executed between APIIC and Unitech contains specific representations to the effect that APIIC
was authorised to transfer and deliver the project site admeasuring 350 acres on an outright sale
basis. Under the development agreement, APIIC was to sell and transfer the land absolutely together
with its right, title and interest, free from all encumbrances by executing a sale agreement. The
terms of the agreement were to prevail in the event of any conflict with any other document which
formed a part of the MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 60 bidding process. The terms of the
agreement were placed on the pedestal of the highest priority for interpretation, as compared to
other documents, including the LoA. Under the terms of the development agreement, APIIC was
obligated to sell and transfer the land together with its right, title and interest free from all
encumbrances "forthwith upon payment of the last instalment of the total purchase price by the
developer". That Unitech paid the total purchase price is not in dispute. The obligation assumed by
APIIC to hand over possession together with title upon the payment of the last instalment of the
purchase price unequivocally emerges from Article 3.1 and Article 4.1 of the development
agreement. The fulfilment of the terms of the agreement was postulated on the availability of the
land.

framed:
82.1. It is, undoubtedly, true that the writ jurisdiction is a public law remedy. A
matter, which lies entirely within a private realm of affairs of public body, may not
lend itself for being dealt with under the writ jurisdiction of the Court.
82.2. The principle laid down in Bareilly Development Authority that in the case of a
non-statutory contract the rights are governed only by the terms of the contract and
the decisions, which are purported to be followed, including Radhakrishna Agarwal,
may not continue to hold good, in the light of what has been laid down in ABL and as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 46
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
followed in the recent judgment in Sudhir Kumar Singh.
82.3. The mere fact that relief is sought under a contract which is not statutory, will
not entitle the respondent State in a case by itself to ward off scrutiny of its action or
inaction under the contract, if the complaining party is able to establish that the
action/inaction is, per se, arbitrary.
82.4. An action will lie, undoubtedly, when the State purports to award any largesse
and, undoubtedly, this relates to the stage prior to the contract being entered into
(see Ramana Dayaram Shetty). This scrutiny, no doubt, would be undertaken within
the nature of the judicial review, which has been declared in the decision in Tata
Cellular v. Union of India.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 61 82.5. After the contract is entered into, there
can be a variety of circumstances, which may provide a cause of action to a party to
the contract with the State, to seek relief by filing a writ petition.
82.6. Without intending to be exhaustive, it may include the relief of seeking
payment of amounts due to the aggrieved party from the State. The State can, indeed,
be called upon to honour its obligations of making payment, unless it be that there is
a serious and genuine dispute raised relating to the liability of the State to make the
payment. Such dispute, ordinarily, would include the contention that the aggrieved
party has not fulfilled its obligations and the Court finds that such a contention by the
State is not a mere ruse or a pretence.
82.7. The existence of an alternate remedy, is, undoubtedly, a matter to be borne in
mind in declining relief in a writ petition in a contractual matter. Again, the question
as to whether the writ petitioner must be told off the gates, would depend upon the
nature of the claim and relief sought by the petitioner, the questions, which would
have to be decided, and, most importantly, whether there are disputed questions of
fact, resolution of which is necessary, as an indispensable prelude to the grant of the
relief sought. Undoubtedly, while there is no prohibition, in the writ court even
deciding disputed questions of fact, particularly when the dispute surrounds
demystifying of documents only, the Court may relegate the party to the remedy by
way of a civil suit.
82.8. The existence of a provision for arbitration, which is a forum intended to
quicken the pace of dispute resolution, is viewed as a near bar to the entertainment of
a writ petition [see in this regard, the view of this Court even in ABL1Q explaining
how it distinguished the decision of this Court in State of U.P. v. Bridge & Roof Co.
(India) Ltd., by its observations in SCC para 14 in ABL].
82.9. The need to deal with disputed questions of fact, cannot be made a
smokescreen to guillotine a genuine claim raised in a writ petition, when actually the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 47
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
resolution of a disputed question of fact is unnecessary to grant relief to a writ
applicant.
82.10. The reach of Article 14 enables a writ court to deal with arbitrary State action
even after a contract is entered into by the State. A wide variety of circumstances can
generate causes of action for invoking Article 14. The Court's approach in dealing
with the same, would be guided by, undoubtedly, the overwhelming need to obviate
arbitrary State action, in cases where the writ remedy MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023
Page 62 provides an effective and fair means of preventing miscarriage of justice
arising from palpably unreasonable action by the State.
82.11. Termination of contract can again arise in a wide variety of situations. If for
instance, a contract is terminated, by a person, who is demonstrated, without any
need for any argument, to be the person, who is completely unauthorised to cancel
the contract, there may not be any necessity to drive the party to the unnecessary
ordeal of a prolix and avoidable round of litigation. The intervention by the High
Court, in such a case, where there is no dispute to be resolved, would also be
conducive in public interest, apart from ensuring the fundamental right of the
petitioner under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. When it comes to a challenge
to the termination of a contract by the State, which is a non-statutory body, which is
acting in purported exercise of the powers/rights under such a contract, it would be
over simplifying a complex issue to lay down any inflexible rule in favour of the Court
turning away the petitioner to alternate fora. Ordinarily, the cases of termination of
contract by the State, acting within its contractual domain, may not lend itself for
appropriate redress by the writ court. This is, undoubtedly, so if the Court is duty-
bound to arrive at findings, which involve untying knots, which are presented by
disputed questions of facts. Undoubtedly, in view of ABL, if resolving the dispute, in a
case of repudiation of a contract, involves only appreciating the true scope of
documentary material in the light of pleadings, the Court may still grant relief to an
applicant. We must enter a caveat. The Courts are today reeling under the weight of a
docket explosion, which is truly alarming. If a case involves a large body of
documents and the Court is called upon to enter upon findings of facts and involves
merely the construction of the document, it may not be an unsound discretion to
relegate the party to the alternate remedy. This is not to deprive the Court of its
constitutional power as laid down in ABL. It all depends upon the facts of each case
as to whether, having regard to the scope of the dispute to be resolved, whether the
Court will still entertain the petition.
82.12. In a case the State is a party to the contract and a breach of a contract is
alleged against the State, a civil action in the appropriate forum is, undoubtedly,
maintainable. But this is not the end of the matter. Having regard to the position of
the State and its duty to act fairly and to eschew arbitrariness in all its actions, resort
to the constitutional remedy on the cause of action, that the action is arbitrary, is
permissible (see in this regard Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P.). However, it must
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 48
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
be made clear that every case involving breach of contract by the State, MC(WP(C))
No. 357 of 2023 Page 63 cannot be dressed up and disguised as a case of arbitrary
State action. While the concept of an arbitrary action or inaction cannot be cribbed or
confined to any immutable mantra, and must be laid bare, with reference to the facts
of each case, it cannot be a mere allegation of breach of contract that would suffice.
What must be involved in the case must be action/inaction, which must be palpably
unreasonable or absolutely irrational and bereft of any principle. An action, which is
completely mala fide, can hardly be described as a fair action and may, depending on
the facts, amount to arbitrary action. The question must be posed and answered by
the Court and all we intend to lay down is that there is a discretion available to the
Court to grant relief in appropriate cases.
82.13. A lodestar, which may illumine the path of the Court, would be the dimension
of public interest subserved by the Court interfering in the matter, rather than
relegating the matter to the alternate forum.
82.14. Another relevant criteria is, if the Court has entertained the matter, then, while
it is not tabooed that the Court should not relegate the party at a later stage,
ordinarily, it would be a germane consideration, which may persuade the Court to
complete what it had started, provided it is otherwise a sound exercise of jurisdiction
to decide the matter on merits in the writ petition itself.
82.15. Violation of natural justice has been recognised as a ground signifying the
presence of a public law element and can found a cause of action premised on breach
of Article
14. (See Sudhir Kumar Singh).
88. Here we must understand the words "first milestone" as fulfillment of the
conditions subsequent. In regard to fulfillment of said milestone for which there was
a delay of 16 days in the case of Renew Clean Energy, there was a delay of 54 days in
the case of the first respondent. It is further noticed by the High Court that there was
an order passed in favour of Renew Clean Energy setting aside the termination of the
contract in the said petitioner's case as confirmed by this Court. Next the High Court
went on to record that there is a dispute as to whether the respondent had
commissioned the power project in the present case.
We notice that an attempt was made by the appellant to justify the termination on the basis that the
respondent had not commissioned the power project within the time fixed. The High Court proceeds
to notice that the aspect of commissioning the project was not the basis for terminating the contract.
Relying on Mohinder Singh Gill, the appellants were not permitted to supplement the reasons for
termination. Finally, the High Court has proceeded to find MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 64 that
since the similar reason for termination of the agreement in the communication dated 11-8-2017
was not found justified in Renew Clean Energy, the impugned communication dated 11-8-2017 was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 49

set aside. It is thereafter that the liberty was given to the appellants to pass fresh orders in terms of
the PPA in accordance with law."
(cid:128) (2005) 8 SCC 242 - Sanajana M. Wig Vs. Hindustan Petro Corpn. Ltd.) "13. However, access to
justice by way of public law remedy would not be denied when a lis involves public law character
and when the forum chosen by the parties would not be in a position to grant appropriate relief.
18. It may be true that in a given case when an action of the party is dehors the terms and conditions
contained in an agreement as also beyond the scope and ambit of the domestic forum created
therefore, the writ petition may be held to be maintainable; but indisputably therefore such a case
has to be made out. It may also be true, as has been held by this Court in Amritsar Gas Service and
E. Venkatakrishna that the arbitrator may not have the requisite jurisdiction to direct restoration of
distributorship having regard to the provisions contained in Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act,
1963; but while entertaining a writ petition even in such a case, the court may not lose sight of the
fact that if a serious disputed question of fact is involved arising out of a contract qua contract,
ordinarily a writ petition would not be entertained. A writ petition, however, will be entertained
when it involves a public law character or involves a question arising out of public law functions on
the part of the respondent...."
(cid:128) (2009) 10 SCC 388 - (Zenit Mataplast (P) Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra) "27. Every action of the
State or its instrumentalities should not only be fair, legitimate and above-board but should be
without any affection or aversion. It should neither be suggestive of discrimination nor even
apparently give an impression of bias, favouritism and nepotism. The decision should be made by
the application of known principles and rules and in general such decision should be predictable and
the citizen should know where he is, but if a decision is taken without any principle or without any
rule, it is unpredictable and such a decision is antithesis to the decision taken in accordance with the
rule of law (vide S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India, AIR p. 1434, para 14 and Haji T.M. Hassan
Rawther v. Kerala Financial Corpn.).
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 65
30. Interim order is passed on the basis of prima facie findings, which are tentative. Such order is
passed as a temporary arrangement to preserve the status quo till the matter is decided finally, to
ensure that the matter does not become either infructuous or a fait accompli before the final
hearing. The object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by
violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in
the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial (vide Anand Prasad Agarwalla v.
Tarkeshwar Prasad, and State of Assam v. Barak Upatyaka D.U. Karmachari Sanstha).
31. Grant of an interim relief in regard to the nature and extent thereof depends upon the facts and
circumstances of each case as no straitjacket formula can be laid down. There may be a situation
wherein the respondent-defendant may use the suit property in such a manner that the situation
becomes irretrievable. In such afact situation, interim relief should be granted (vide M. Gurudas v.
Rasaranjan and Shridevi v. Muralidhar). Grant of temporary injunction is governed by three basic
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 50
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
principles i.e. prima facie case; balance of convenience; and irreparable injury, which are required to
be considered in a proper perspective in the facts and circumstances of a particular case. But it may
not be appropriate for any court to hold a mini-trial at the stage of grant of temporary injunction
[vide S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. and Anand Prasad Agarwalla, SCC p. 570, para 6]."
(cid:128) (2021) 12 SCC 780 - Benedict Denis Kinny Vs. Tulip Brian Miranda &Ors.) "36. The Delhi High
Court judgment's conclusion in para 33(d) was set aside. The Delhi High Court in para 33(d), which
judgment was impugned before this Court had laid down:
(Anur Kumar Jain case, SCC OnLine Del) "33. In view of our aforesaid discussion, we
proceed to answer the reference on the following terms:
(d) Even if a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or a writ
petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is entertained by the High
Court under no circumstances an order of stay should be passed regard being had to
the prohibition contained in Section 19(3)(c) of the 1988 Act."
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 66
37. Nariman, J., ultimately after referring the judgment of L. Chandra Kumar has set
aside the conclusion of the Delhi High Court in para 33(d). The above judgment,
thus, laid down that despite restraint in Section 19(3)(c) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue an interim order is not
precluded. This Court in the above case has dealt with a situation when a statutory
provision i.e. Section 19(3) (c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act creates a specific
bar in passing a stay order. When despite the aforesaid statutory bar, the High Court
was held to have jurisdiction to pass an interim order, in the present case, we are
concerned in a statutory scheme where there is no express or implied bar in passing
an interim order by the High Court.
38. As per Section 5-B, a candidate belonging to reserved category, who has made an
application to the Scrutiny Committee for issuance of validity certificate prior to date
of filing of nomination is obliged to submit the certificate within six months from the
date of election (now substituted by twelve months), failing which his election shall
be deemed to have been terminated retrospectively. The second proviso to Section
5-B creates a deeming fiction, which operates when a person failed to produce the
validity certificate within a period of six months/twelve months from the date of his
election. The present is a case where before expiry of period of six months from the
date of election i.e. 23-2-2017, the Caste Scrutiny Committee has rejected the claim of
the respondent and a writ petition was filed by the respondent before expiry of period
of six months and the High Court also granted an interim order on 18-8- 2017 i.e.
within a period of six months, after expiry of which the deeming fiction was to come
into existence. The interim order was passed by the High Court before a deeming
fiction of termination of election retrospectively came into operation. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 51
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
consequence of non-filing of validity certificate within a period of six months was
postponed, rather interdicted, by the interim order of the High Court. The
jurisdiction of the High Court to pass the above interim order dated 18-8-2017 is
questioned by the appellants. Caste Scrutiny Committee, which is a statutory
authority constituted under the State enactment to verify the caste claimed by
citizens, in event, illegally rejects the claim of citizen, does the citizen have no right to
seek judicial remedy? Can the illegal rejection of caste claim of a citizen is a fait
accompli after expiry of period of six months? When a citizen has right to judicial
review against any decision of statutory authority, the MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023
Page 67 High Court in exercise of judicial review had every jurisdiction to maintain
the status quo so as to by lapse of time, the petition may not become infructuous. The
interim order can always be passed by a High Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction to
maintain the status quo so that at the time of final decision of the writ petition, the
relief may not become infructuous.
39. We are conscious of the fact that the High Court has to exercise jurisdiction under
Article 226 with due regard to the legislative intent manifested by provisions of
enactment. A nine-Judge Constitution Bench in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v.
Union of India 16 had laid down such proposition in para 108 in the following words: (SCC p. 635)
"108.... (x)... So far as the jurisdiction of the High Court's under Article 226 of the Constitution or of
this Court under Article 32 - is concerned, it remains unaffected by the provisions of the Act. Even
so, the Court would, while exercising the jurisdiction under the said articles, have due regard to the
legislative intent manifested by the provisions of the Act. The writ petition would naturally be
considered and disposed of in the light of and in accordance with the provisions of Section 11-B. This
is for the reason that the power under Article 226 has to be exercised to effectuate the regime of law
and not for abrogating it. Even while acting in exercise of the said constitutional power, the High
Court cannot ignore the law nor can it override it. The power under Article 226 is conceived to serve
the ends of law and not to transgress them."
(cid:128) (2008) 10 SCC 1 - (Official Liquidator Vs Dayanand) "78. There have been several instances of
different Benches of the High Court not following the judgments/orders of coordinate and even
larger Benches. In some cases, the High Courts have gone to the extent of ignoring the law laid down
by this Court without any tangible reason. Likewise, there have been instances in which smaller
Benches of this Court have either ignored or bypassed the ratio of the judgments of the larger
Benches including the Constitution Benches. These cases are illustrative of non-adherence to the
rule of judicial discipline which is sine qua non for sustaining the system. In Mahadeolal Kanodia v.
Administrator General of W.B. this Court observed:
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 68 "19......If one this is more necessary in law than any other
thing, it is the quality of certainly. That quality would totally disappear if Judges of coordinate
jurisdiction in a High Court start overruling one another's decisions. If one Division Bench of a High
Court is unable to distinguish a previous decision of another Division Bench, and holding the view
that the earlier decision is wrong, itself gives effect to that view the result would be utter confusion.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 52
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
The position would be equally bad where a judge sitting singly in the High Court is of opinion that
the previous decision of another Singly Judge on a question of law is wrong and gives effect to that
view instead of referring the matter to a larger Bench. In such a case lawyers would not know how to
advise their clients and all courts subordinate to the High Court would find themselves in an
embarrassing position of having to choose between dissentient judgments of their own High Court"
....
83. In Pradip Chandra Parija v. Pramod Chandra Patnaik the Constitution Bench
noted that the two learned Judges denuded the correctness of an earlier Constitution
Bench judgment in Bharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. V. Mumbai Shramik Sangha and
reiterated the same despite the fact that the second Constitution Bench refused to
reconsider the earlier verdict and observed:
"3. We may point out, at the outset, that in Bharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. V. Mumbai
Shramik Sangha a Bench of five Judges considered a somewhat similar question. Two
learned Judges in that case doubted the correctness of the scope attributed to a
certain provision in an earlier Constitution Bench judgment and, accordingly,
referred the matter before them directly to a Constitution Bench. The Constitution
Bench that then heard the matter took the view that the decision of a Constitution
Bench bids a Bench of two learned Judges and that judicial discipline obliges them to
follow it, regardless of their doubts about its correctness. At the most, the Bench of
two learned Judges could have ordered that the matter be heard by a Bench of three
learned Judges.
***
4. The learned Attorney General submitted that a Constitution Bench judgment of
this Court was binding on smaller Bench and a judgment of three learned Judges was
binding on Benches of two learned Judges
- a proposition that learned counsel for the appellants did not dispute. The learned
Attorney General drew our attention to the judgment of a Constitution Bench in
Sub-committee of Judicial Accountability v. Union of MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023
Page 69 India where it has been said that 'no coordinate Bench of this Court can even
comment upon, let alone sit in judgment over, the discretion exercised or judgment
rendered in a cause or matter before another coordinate Bench-. The learned
Attorney General submitted that the appropriate course for the Bench of two learned
Judges to have adopted, if it felt so strongly that the judgment in NityanandaKar was
incorrect, was to make a reference to a Bench of three learned Judges. That Bench of
three learned Judges, if it also took the same view of NityanandaKar, could have
referred the case to a Bench of five learned judges.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 53
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
6. In the present case the Bench of two learned Judges has, in terms, doubted the
correctness of a decision of a Bench of three learned Judges. They have, therefore,
referred the matter directly to a Bench of five Judges. In our view, judicial discipline
and propriety demands that a Bench of two learned Judges should follow a decision
of a Bench of three learned Judges. But if a Bench of two learned Judges concludes
that an earlier judgment of three learned Judges is so very incorrect that in no
circumstances can it be followed, the proper course for it to adopt is to refer the
matter before it to a Bench of three learned Judges setting out, as has been done here,
the reasons why it could not agree with the earlier judgment. If, then, the Bench of
three learned judges also comes to the conclusion that the earlier judgment of a
Bench of three learned judges is incorrect, reference to a Bench of five learned Judges
is justified."
86. In Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community v. State of Maharasthra the Constitution Bench
interpreted Article 141, referred to various earlier judgments including Bharat Petroleum Corpn.
Ltd. V. Mumbai Shramik Sangha and Pradip Chandra Parija v. Pramod Chandra Patnaik and held
that the law laid down in a decision delivered by a Bench of larger strength is binding on any
subsequent Bench of lesser or co-equal strength and it would be inappropriate if a Division Bench of
two Judges starts overruling the decisions of Division Benches of three Judges. The Court further
held that such a practice would be detrimental not only to the rule of discipline and the doctrine of
binding precedents but it will also lead to inconsistency in decisions on the point of law; consistency
and certainty in the development of law and its contemporary status- both would be immediate
casualty (Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community Case, SCC p.682, paras 12 & 10)."
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 70 [25] On perusal of the case dossier, it is seen and evident that
this Court passed series of interim as well as vacation orders. And orders of the same are extracted
herein below:
Operative portion of Interim order dated 19.04.2023 (1st Interim order)-
"1. Heard Mr. Tayenjam Momo Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.
Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General who takes notice for the respondents.
2. Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General seeks time for filing counter affidavit.
3. Mr. Tayenjam Momo Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner represented that
impugned order 11.04.2023 has been passed by the Respondent No. 3 thereby
terminating the agreement of the petitioner dated 08.06.2021 and therefore, the
petitioners would be suffered a great loss by the impugned order.
4. Mr. Tayenjam Momo Singh also represented that as per the impugned order dated
11.04.2023 the Respondents are directed for joint measurement of the constructed
building. Therefore, he prayed this Court to grant an interim order.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 54
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
5. Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General is strongly opposing for granting any
interim order and seeks time for filing counter and documents.
6. Therefore, post the matter on 25.04.2023 in the motion list. Till such time, the
respondents are directed not to make joint measurement.
7. Interim order for stay of the impugned order will be considered on the next date of
hearing."
[26] The vacation of the above interim order is extracted herein below:
Operative portion of order dated 01.08.2023 (vacation of interim order)-
"44. The Division Bench of this Court directed the State and the petitioner to comply
with their contractual obligations qua the completion of the construction of Civil
Secretariat Work. According to the respondents, the petitioner has violated the
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 71 terms and conditions of the agreement and
therefore the third respondent has rightly terminated the agreement dated
08.06.2021.
45. As could also be seen from the general conditions of the contract, particularly
Clause 25 provides settlement of dispute and arbitration of the conditions of the
contract agreement to settle any dispute or grievances, if any. In view of the factual
questions involved in the writ petition and in the absence of detailed
counter-affidavit filed by the respondents resisting the allegations set out in the writ
petition, the merits of the termination of the agreement dated 08.06.2021 cannot be
gone into at this stage.
46. As stated supra, the third respondent decided to conduct a joint measurement of
the work done by the petitioner. In the factual scenario put forth by the respective
parties, if joint measurement is conducted, no prejudice would be caused to the
petitioner and if joint measured is conducted, it will be helpful for the Court to know
about the exact work executed at the ground level by the petitioner and based on the
report, further steps can be taken in this matter. Moreover, the third respondent has
every right to conduct joint measurement to assess the work executed by the
contractor at the site. The aforesaid observation of this Court is only in the interest of
both parties and for the welfare of the public scheme and the public money involved
for construction of Civil Secretariat. Therefore, keeping the writ petition pending, the
respondent authorities are directed to conduct joint measurement in order to assess
the construction work and the other work done and executed by the petitioner at the
site. For the purpose of conducting joint measurement, the interim order dated
19.4.2023 needs to be vacated enabling the respondent authorities to carry out the
joint measurement. Therefore, in the interest of justice and without prejudice to the
rights and contentions of the respective parties in the main writ petition, this Court is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 55
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
inclined to vacate the interim order dated 19.4.2023 passed in the writ petition.
47. For the reasons stated supra, the interim order dated 19.4.203 granted by this
Court in the writ petition stands vacated. The respondent authorities are directed to
conduct the joint measurement as stated in the impugned order dated 11.04.2023
and file a report before this Court before the date of hearing on 04.09.2023.
48. It is made clear that the observation made by this Court in this order shall be
confined only for the purpose of considering the interim order and it shall not be
taken as final opinion of this Court."
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 72
[27] This Court on the same day after vacation of the
previous injunction order passed another interim order and the same is extracted
herein below:
Operative portion of order dated 01.08.2023 (2nd interim order) "3. After delivering
the order by this Court, Mr. T. Momo, learned counsel for the petitioner represented
that till the joint measurement is taken place, both the parties may be directed to
maintain the status quo as on today.
4. Therefore, till the joint measurement is taken place, both the parties are directed to
maintain the status quo as on today."
[28] As aggrieved, the State applicant filed the present miscellaneous application for
vacation/modification of the above referred interim orders.
As admitted by both parties, that the present subject matter i.e. the Construction of Capital Complex
(Civil Secretariat Component) at Mantripukhri, the parties executed a contract agreement and the
relevant portion of which both the parties are relying upon and the same is extracted herein below:
Clause 3 and clause 25 of contract agreement (08.06.2021):
"Clause 3 - When Contract can be Determined - Subject to other provisions contained
in this clause, the Engineer-in- Charge may, without prejudice to any other rights or

[32] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2022) 6 SCC 127 at Para No. 19, 20 & 21
observed that "19. The Specific Relief Act, 1963 was amended by Central Act 18 of
2018 when clause (ha) was inserted in Section 41 of the said Act to say:
"41. (ha) if it would impede or delay the progress or completion of any infrastructure
project or interfere with the continued provision of relevant facility related thereto or
services being the subject-matter of such project."
20. Such amendment was in pursuance of the report submitted on 20.06.2016 of the Expert
Committee. The report is as under:
"The Expert Committee set on examining the Specific Relief Act, 1963 submits its
|Report to Union Law & Justice Minister recommends modifications for ensuring
ease of doing business.
The Expert Committee set on examining the Specific Relief Act, 1963 today submitted
its Report to Union Law & Justice Minister Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda here in New
Delhi. In its report the committee has recommended MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023
Page 89 modifications in the Specific Relief Act, 1963 for ensuring the ease of doing
business.
In the context of tremendous developments which have taken place since 1963 and
the present changed scenario involving contract based infrastructure developments,
public private partnerships and other public projects, involving huge investments;
and changes required in the present scheme of the Act so that specific performance is
granted as a general rule and grant of compensation or damages for
non-performance remains as an exception, the committee decided -
To change the approach, from damages being the rule and specific performance being
the exception, to specific performance being the rule, and damages being the
alternate remedy.

To provide guidelines for reducing the discretion granted to courts and tribunals
while granting performance and injunctive reliefs.
To introduce provisions for rights of third parties (other than for government
contracts).
To consider addressing unconscionable contracts, unfair contracts, reciprocity in
contracts, etc. and implied terms.
The committee observed that there is a need to classify diverse public utility contracts
as a distinct class recognizing the inherent public interest/importance to be
addressed in the Act. Any public work must progress without interruption. This
requires consideration whether a court's intervention in Public Works would be
minimal. Smooth functioning of public works projects can be effectively managed
through a monitoring system and regulatory mechanism. The role of courts in this
exercise is to interfere to the minimum extent so that public works projects will not
be impeded or stalled.
21. Since the construction of road is an infrastructure project and keeping in view the intent of the
legislature that infrastructure projects should not be stayed, the High Court would have been well
advised to hold its hand to stay the construction of the infrastructure project. Such provision should
be kept in view even by the writ court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India."
[33] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2021)20 SCC 454 at Para No. 25 observed that "25. It is well
settled that the High Court exercising its extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, does not adjudicate hotly disputed questions of facts. It is not for the High
Court to make a MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 90 comparative assessment of conflicting
technical reports and decide which one is acceptable."
[34] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2005) 12 SCC 725 at Para No. 7, 8, 9 & 10 observed that "7. A
bare perusal of the High Court's judgment shows that there was clear non-application of mind. On
one hand the High Court observed that the disputed questions cannot be gone into a writ petition. It
was also noticed that the essence of the dispute was breach of contract. After coming to the above
conclusions the High Court should have dismissed the writ petition. Surprisingly, the High Court
proceeded to examine the case solely on the writ petitioner's assertion and on a very curious
reasoning that though the appellant Corporation claimed that the value of articles lifted was nearly
R. 14.90 lakhs no details were specifically given. From the counter-affidavit filed before the High
Court it is crystal-clear that relevant details disputing claim of the writ petitioner were given. Value
of articles lifted by the writ petitioner is a disputed factual question. Where a complicated question
of fact is involved and the matter requires thorough proof on factual aspects, the High Court should
not entertain the writ petition. Whether or not the High Court should exercise jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution would largely depend upon the nature of dispute and if the dispute
cannot be resolved without going into the factual controversy, the High Court should not entertain
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 69
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
the writ petition. As noted above, the writ petition was primarily founded on allegation of breach of
contract. Question whether the action of the opposite party in the writ petition amounted to breach
of contractual obligation ultimately depends on facts and would require material evidence to be
scrutinized and in such a case writ jurisdiction should not be exercised. [see State of Bihar V. Jain
Plastics & Chemicals Ltd.]
8. In a catena of cases this Court has held that where the dispute resolves round questions of fact,
the matter ought not to be entertained under Article 226 of the Constitution [see State Bank of India
V. State Bank of India Canteen Employees Union and Chairman, Gird Corpn. Of Orissa Ltd.
(GRIDCO) V. Sukamani Das]
9. In the instant case, the High Court has itself observed that disputed questions of fact were
involved and yet went on to give directions as if it was adjudicating the money claim in a suit. The
course is clearly impermissible. [see G.M., Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Ltd. V. Satrughan Nishad and
Rourkela Shramik Sangh V. Steel Authority of India Ltd.] MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 91
10. In National Highways Authority of India V. Ganga Enterprises, it was observed by this Court that
the question whether the writ petition was maintainable in a claim arising out of a breach of
contract should be answered first by the High Court as it would go to the root of the matter. The writ
petitioner had displayed ingenuity in its search for invalidating circumstances; but a writ petition is
not an appropriate remedy for impeaching contractual obligations. [see Har Shgakar V. Dy. Excise
and Taxation Commr. and Divisional Forest Officer V. Bishwanath Tea Co. Ltd.]"
[35] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2021) 10 SCC 690 at Para No. 24 observed that
"24. Therefore, the dispute could not be raised by way of a writ petition on the
disputed questions of fact. Though, the jurisdiction of the High Court is wide but in
respect of pure contractual matters in the field of private law, having no statutory
flavor, are better adjudicated upon by the forum agreed to by the parties. The dispute
as to whether the amount is payable or not and / or how much amount is payable are
disputed questions of facts. There is no admission on the part of the appellants to
infer that the amount stands crystallized. Therefore, in the absence of any acceptance
of joint survey report by the competent authority, no right would accrue to the writ
petitioner only because measurements cannot be undertaken after passage of time.
Maybe, the resurvey cannot take place but the measurement books of work executed
from time to time would form a reasonable basis for assessing the amount due and
payable to the writ petitioner, but such process could be undertaken only by the
agreed forum i.e. arbitration and not by the writ court as it does not have the
expertise in respect of measurement or construction of roads."
[36] Perusal of the record, it is evident that there exists the dispute of fact between the two parties in
respect of the work as the petitioner/respondent (M/s Avantika) in their affidavit-in-opposition
dated 16.10.2023 filed in Misc. Case No. 140 of 2023 wherein the respondent/petitioner submitted

MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 92 "at para No. 5 (page No. 3), it is stated as -
It is submitted that the respondent-company has executed 95% of the work and so far submitted
bills of Rs. 100.78 crores."
at para No. 14 (page No. 7), it is also stated as follows-
"It is submitted that the respondent-company has executed 95% of the work, whereas
the Department had stated that the respondent-company has completed 53.73% of
the work."
As per the Joint-measurement report the percentage of work done by the respondent-company is
49% whereas according to the respondent-company the percentage of work done in 97.61% after the
Joint- measurement."
at para No. 16 (page No. 11), it is stated and admitted that -
"It is submitted that as explained in the above- mentioned paragraph the percentage
of 95% of the work being completed by the respondent-company is correct, therefore
the respondent-company has not made any false statement before this Hon'ble Court.
Moreover, the percentage of work done by the respondent-company is disputed and
not yet determined by this Hon'ble Court."
[37] Per contra, the learned counsel for the applicant/ respondent submits that the work done by the
respondent/petitioner was not 35% but only 45.27% i.e. Rs. 88.91 crores or otherwise only 53.73 as
per the claim received by the Department. But, if the 35% which was stated by the petitioner in the
writ petition is correct, the value of work will be of Rs. 184.78 crores but, such amount of bill are
never received by the Department. Further, it is clarified by the learned counsel that the bills are to
be paid on MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 93 measurement uncompleted works. Accordingly, the
learned counsel submitted that there exists disputed question of fact.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2022) 12 SCC 815 at para No. 13 observed that "13. In K.D. Sharma
V. SAIL [K.D. Sharma V. SAIL, (2008) 12 SCC 481], it was held that (SCC pp. 492- 93, paras 34 -
39).
"34. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and of the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution is extraordinary, equitable and discretionary.
Prerogative writs mentioned therein are issued for doing substantial justice. It is,
therefore, of utmost necessity that the petitioner approaching the writ court must
come with clean hands, put forward all the facts before the court without concealing
or suppressing anything and seek an appropriate relief. If there is candid disclosure
of relevant and material facts or the petitioner is guilty of misleading the court, his
petition may be dismissed at the threshold without considering the merits of the
claim.

35. The underlying object has been succinctly stated by Scrutton, L.J., in the leading
case of R.v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners [R.v. Kensington Income Tax
Commissioners, (1971) 1 KB 486 : 86 LJKB 257 : 116 LT 136 (KB & CA) in the
following words:
'.............. it has been for many years the rule of the court, and one which it is of the
greatest importance to maintain, that when an applicant comes to the court to obtain
itself on an ex parte statement he should make a full and fair disclosure of all the
material facts - it says facts, not law. He must not misstate the law if he can help it -
the court is supposed to know the law. But it knows nothing about the facts, and the
applicant must state fully and fairly the facts;
and the penalty by which the court MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 94 enforces
that obligation is that if it finds out that the facts have not been fully and fairly stated
to it, the court will set aside any action which it has taken on the faith of the imperfect
statement.'
36. A prerogative remedy is not a matter of course. While exercising extraordinary
power a writ court would certainly bear in mind the conduct of the party who invokes
the jurisdiction of the court. If the applicant makes a false statement or suppresses
material fact or attempts to mislead the court, the court may dismiss the action on
that ground alone and may refuse to enter into the merits of the case by stating. 'We
will not listen to your application because of what you have done.'The rule has been
evolved in the larger public interest to deter unscrupulous litigants from abusing the
process of court by deceiving it.
37. In Kensington Income Tax Commissioners [R. v. Kensington Income Tax
Commissioners, (1917) 1 KB 486 : 85 LJKB 257 : 116 LT 136 (KB & CA)], Viscount
Reading, C.J. observed : (KB pp 495 - 96) '.............. Where an ex parte application
has been made to this Court for a rule nisi or other process, if the court comes to the
conclusion that the affidavit in support of the application was not candid and did not
fairly state the facts, but stated them in such a way as to mislead the Court as to the
true facts, the Court ought, for its own protection and to prevent an abuse of its
process, to refuse to proceed any further with the examination of the merits. This is a
power inherent in the Court, but one which should only be used in cases which bring
conviction to the mind of the court that it has been deceived. Before coming to this
conclusion, a careful examination will be made of the facts as they are and as they
have been stated in the applicant's affidavit, and everything will be heard that can be
urged to influence the view of the court when it reads the affidavit and MC(WP(C))
No. 357 of 2023 Page 95 knows the true facts. But if the result of this examination
and hearing is to leave no doubt that the court has been deceived, then it will refuse
to hear anything further from the applicant in a proceeding which has only been set
in motion by means of a misleading affidavit.'

38. The above principles have been accepted in our legal system also. As per settled
law, the party who invokes the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article
32 or of a High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is supposed to be truthful,
frank and open. He must disclose all material facts without any reservation even if
they are against him. He cannot be allowed to play "hide and seek" or to "pick and
choose" the facts he likes to disclose and to suppose (keep back) or not to disclose
(conceal) other facts. The very basis of the writ jurisdiction rests in disclosure of true
and complete (correct) false. If material facts are suppressed or distorted, the very
functioning of writ courts and exercise would become impossible. The petitioner
must disclose all the facts having a bearing on the relief sought without any
qualification. This is because "the court knows law but not facts".
39. If the primary object as highlighted in Kensingston Income Tax Commissioners
[R.V. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners, (1917) 1 KB 486 : 86 LJKB 257 : 116
LT 136 (KB & CA) is kept in mind, an applicant who does not come with candid facts
and "clean breast" cannot hold a writ of the court with "soiled hands". Suppression or
concealment of material facts is not an advocacy. It is a jugglery, manipulation,
maneuvering or misrepresentation, which has no place in equitable and prerogative
jurisdiction. If the applicant does not disclose all the material facts fairly and truly
but states them in a distorted manner and misleads the court, the court has inherent
power in order to protect itself and to prevent an abuse of its process to discharge the
rule nisi and refuse to proceed further with the examination of the case on merits. If
the court does not reject the petition on that ground, the court MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of
2023 Page 96 would be failing in its duty. In fact, such an applicant requires to be
dealt with for contempt of court for abusing the process of the court."
[38] It is a fact that the contract between the applicants/respondents and respondent/petitioner
entered into a contract for the construction of remaining work amounting to Rs.
133,38,53,287.00 for Construction of Capital Complex (Civil Secretariat component) at
Mantripukhri and the agreement was executed between the respondent/petitioner and
applicant/respondent No. 3 on 08.06.2021. The agreement was made in the following terms -
(a) For agreement of Rs. 167.40 Crores : 12 months
(b) For revised Agreement amount of Rs. 194.49 Crores : 14 months It is also evident that the
contract work was initially awarded to M/s Simplex Projects, but due to non-completion of the work
within the stipulated time between the M/s Simplex Projects Limited and the
applicants/respondents, the contract was terminated on 09.11.2019. Thereafter, the present
respondent/petitioner was awarded to execute the remaining work within the above mentioned
stipulated time. It is also evident that the extension of the work was granted to the
respondent/petitioner 3 (three) times due to various factors and reasons. Lastly, the
respondent/petitioner by a letter dated 18.07.2022 requested the MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page
97 State applicant for extension of 240 (two hundred and forty) days time and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 73
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
applicants/respondents wrote letters for the delay of completion of work to the
respondent/petitioner and at the same time, the respondent/petitioner replied explaining various
reasons for the delay of completion of the work.
It is also seen and evident that the bill payment for the portion of completed work as claimed by the
respondent/petitioner and also claim made by the applicants/respondents and, paid by the
applicants/respondents are disputed fact, as per the respondent/petitioner's contention/assertion,
out of total bill amount of Rs. 100.78 crores, the applicants/respondents paid only a sum of 69.11
crores and 31.67 crores is due. On 26.12.2022, 20.01.2023 and 21.01.2023 the
applicants/respondents sent show cause notices for the said work. The respondent/petitioner
replied the said notices by putting the reasons of delay on 30.12.2022 and 24.01.2023.
It is also seen and evident that in connection with delay in completion of the work, PIL 34 of 2022
was filed before this Hon'ble Court for directing the respondents and petitioners to complete the
remaining work so that the existing Manipur Secretariat may be shifted to the new building and with
the said direction, this Hon'ble Court disposed of the PIL No. 34 of 2022. The Division Bench of this
Hon'ble High Court after hearing the respective parties while disposing the said PIL issued the
following directions:
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 98 "Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
larger public interest involved, the PIL No. 34 of 2022 is disposed of with the following directions:
(i) The respondent State is directed to decongest the traffic on the National Highway
in front of the Old Manipur Secretariat by making arrangements for proper park of
vehicles on both sides.
Further, the respondent State is directed to strictly enforce the traffic rules to ensure illegal parked
vehicles are booked.
(ii) The respondent State and the fourth respondent are directed to comply with their contractual
obligations qua the completion of construction of Civil Secretariat work.
(iii) The respondent State is directed to pay the Outstanding dues as per the RA Bills raised by the
respondent No. 4 and also approve the rates of deviations and extra items regarding the Civil
Secretariat work at earliest.
(iv) The respondent State and the fourth respondent are directed to co-operate and work in the
concert with each other to ensure that the Civil Secretariat work is to be completed within a period
of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
(v) There will be no order as to costs."
But, the contract agreement was terminated by the applicants/respondents under clause (3) of the
agreement. As aggrieved, the respondent/petitioner filed the present writ petition.

The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
[39] It is also seen and evident that as per the direction of this Hon'ble High Court's order dated
01.08.2023, the joint measurement for the work for Construction of Capital Complex (Civil
Secretariat component) at Mantripukhri was carried out and joint MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page
99 measurement report was furnished by the applicants/respondents on 27.09.2023 through the
Registrar (Judicial). However, the respondent/petitioner refused to sign on some of the items in the
list of items in the joint measurement. Thereafter, on 09.10.2023 the respondent/petitioner filed an
affidavit with objection to the joint measurement, due to the factual dispute between the
respondent/petitioner and the applicants/respondents.
[40] The respondent/petitioner filed contempt case (C) No. 120 of 2023 praying for taking contempt
proceeding against the applicants/respondents no. 1 to 4 for their willful and deliberate
disobedience of the final judgment and order dated 04.04.2023 in PIL No. 34 of 2022 and the same
is pending before the Hon'ble Division Bench of this High Court.
[41] The applicants/respondents (State of Manipur through the Chief Secretary, Government of
Manipur) filed review petition being No. 11 of 2023 praying for review/modification of the
impugned judgment and order dated 04.04.2023 passed in PIL No. 34 of 2022 and to consider the
PIL on merit and the same is pending before Hon'ble Division Bench of this High Court.
[42] Further, it is also seen and evident that in the order dated 01.08.2023 this Hon'ble Court was
pleased to give directions to both the learned counsels to maintain status quo and portion of the said
order is extracted herein below:
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 100 "3. After delivering the order by this Court, Mr. T. Momo,
learned counsel for the petitioner represented that till the joint measurement is taken place, both
the parties may be directed to maintain the status quo as on today.
4. Therefore, till the joint measurement is taken place, both the parties are directed to maintain the
status quo as on today."
A perusal of the above paragraphs, it is seen and evident that the status quo order was given for
specific period of time i.e. status quo to maintain till the joint measurement takes place and as per
both the learned counsels and on facts as extracted earlier, it is admitted position of fact that the
joint measurement has already been taken place and the report of the same was submitted before
this Hon'ble Court and the same is placed on record. Point that needs to be underscored here is that
neither of the parties filed any appeals for revision against the above mentioned interim order.
[43] It is also seen and evident that the respondent/petitioner in one of the paragraphs of the
counter affidavit in reply to the present application of the applicants/respondents requested to give
opportunity to file an additional affidavit and documents to supplement the affidavit in opposition
and the same is extracted herein below:
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 101 "The respondent no. 1 craved leave of this Hon'ble Court to
file an additional affidavit and documents to supplement the present affidavit-in-opposition, if
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 75
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
required at a later stage."
[44] It is also an admitted fact that the pleas taken by the respondent/petitioner are that as the
present subject matter involved a public law character and the alternative forum chosen by the
parties would not be in a position to grant appropriate relief, the present action of the State
Government in terminating the present agreement in question is arbitrary, unreasonable and
violative of the constitutional right of the petitioner. Therefore, the respondent/petitioner
appropriately has taken step and filed the present writ petition and the maintainability issue raised
by the applicants/respondents is not maintainable.
[45] In support of this plea, the respondent/petitioner relied upon series of Apex Court's judgments
which are extracted herein above.
[46] On the other hand, the learned AG submitted that there is question of disputed facts in the
present litigation between the parties. There is breach of contract agreement and as such the matter
may be allowed to be dealt with according to Arbitration Clause (Clause 25) as per the contract
agreement entered between the two parties. Further, it is submitted by the learned AG that the
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 102 involvement of disputed question of facts was admitted by the
writ petitioner in the objection affidavit dated 9.10.2023. With these submissions, learned AG in
support of this cited several Hon'ble Apex Court's judgments which are extracted herein above.
[47] The learned AG, further, submitted that the respondent/petitioner filed the present writ
petition by concealing or suppressing the relevant and material facts and as such the Court may
dismiss the petition on this ground alone. In support of his plea, the learned AG relied upon the
Apex Court's judgments referred to in the preceding paragraphs.
[48] After taking into consideration of the aforesaid reasons and in view of the observations made
above and after hearing the learned counsel for the parties at length and also after going through the
pleas taken by the parties as reproduced earlier and on the basis of narration made regarding the
cases of the parties, this Court is of the view that it will be proper to hear both the parties at length
on merit in the writ petition being WP(C) No. 358 of 2023 and dispose of instead of dealing only
with the maintainability issue raised herein by the applicants/respondents.
[49] In the circumstances, both parties are directed to file their respective additional affidavits, if
any, if desired to do so, before the date of final hearing.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 103 But for the prayer No. (i) in the present miscellaneous
application i.e. "to vacate/modify the interim orders dated 01.08.2023 and dated 09.10.2023 and its
subsequent extension orders passed in the instant writ petition being WP(C) No. 358 of 2023."
[50] On perusal of the orders dated 01.08.2023 and 09.10.2023 of this Court which are extracted
earlier, it is seen and emerged that the said interim order dated 01.08.2023 was passed for the
specific purpose for specific period i.e. "till the joint measurement is taken place, both the parties
may be directed to maintain the status quo as on today. Therefore, till the joint measurement is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194918044/ 76
The State Of Manipur vs M/S Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd on 18 July, 2024
taken place, both the parties are directed to maintain the status quo as on today". But, the order
dated 09.10.2023 was just the extension of the said interim order dated 01.08.2023.
[51] As it is an admitted position of the fact that the joint measurement was already made and the
report has also already been filed and placed on record before this Court. As put out earlier, the said
order dated 09.10.2023 was just the extension of the order dated 01.08.2023. Accordingly, I am of
the considered view that the continuation of the status quo order i.e. order dated 01.08.2023 and its
subsequent extension orders are not called for. It is worth to mention herein that both the parties
did not file any appeal/revision against the said interim orders.
MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023 Page 104
[52] Accordingly, the status quo order dated 01.08.2023
and its subsequent extension orders are vacated.
[53] With the above observation and direction, this present miscellaneous application is disposed of.
[54] List the writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 358 of 2023 for final hearing on 01.08.2024.
