ORDER
N.KOTISWAR SINGH-CJ
1. The present application has been filed by the applicants/appellants for condoning the delay of
1367 days in filing appeal being LPA No. 26 of 2023 against an order dated 08.04.2019 passed by
the learned Single Judge in SWP No. 3001/2015 titled Abdul Khaliq and others vs. State and others,
wherein following direction has been issued:-
"In view of the above, this writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the
respondents to consider the case of the petitioners herein for their
regularization/adjustment as Patwaries in the light of the communication issued by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60264653/ 1
Union Territory Of J&K And Others vs Abdul Khaliq And Others on 10 August, 2023
the Financial Commissioner vide his NO.FC(NG-PTAI) 812- 1/2012 dated 16.08.2013
read with Section 5 of the Act of 2010 within a period of six weeks from the date a
certified copy of this order is served upon them. The respondents while considering
the cases of the petitioners shall also take note of the fact that the persons similarly
situated with the petitioners herein, who were writ petitioners in SWP No. 1462/2017
have already been adjusted as Patwaries on substantive basis. Let a similar order in
favour of the petitioners herein be also passed."
2. The case of the applicants/appellants is that purportedly in compliance of the aforesaid direction
dated 08.04.2019, the claim of the writ petitioners/respondents was considered and after
consideration, the same was rejected vide order dated 24.01.2020 by holding that the J&K Revenue
(Subordinate) Services Recruitment Rules, 2009 do not provide for appointment of settlement
Assistants as Patwaries. 3 Alleging non-compliance of the order dated 08.04.2019 passed by the
learned Single Judge in SWP No. 3001/2015 on the ground that the consideration order dated
24.01.2020 is not in consonance with the direction issued by the learned Single Judge, a contempt
petition being CCP(S) No. 506/2019 was filed by the writ petitioners/respondents, wherein the
Contempt Court vide order dated 22.12.2021 directed compliance of the Court's order dated
08.04.2019.
4. Pursuant to the aforesaid order dated 22.12.2021 passed by the Contempt Court in CCP(S) No.
506/2019 another order was passed by the authorities on 13.06.2022, again rejecting the claim of
the writ petitioners/respondents herein, on the ground that in the writ petition being SWP No.
1462/2017 which was relied upon by the writ petitioners and also referred to by the learned Single
Judge while disposing of the SWP No. 3001/2015, the Deputy Commissioner/Chief Executive
Officer, LAHDC, Kargil had regularized/adjusted the writ petitioners in SWP No. 1462/2017 as
Patwaries in contravention of the J&K Revenue (Subordinate) Services Recruitment Rules in vogue.
5. The aforesaid purported compliance order dated 13.06.2022 passed by the authorities was again
brought to the notice of the Contempt Court but the Court was not satisfied with the said order and
vide order dated 21.12.2022 passed by the Contempt Court, while granting further time directed the
authorities to pass a fresh consideration order, failing which the contemnors were directed to
remain present in person in the Court on the next date of hearing along with the record of the case.
6. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 21.12.2022 passed in CCP(S) No. 506/2019, an LPA
was preferred by the administration being LPA No. 12/2023, taking a plea that the claim of the writ
petitioners/respondents cannot be considered on the analogy of the writ petitioners in SWP No.
1462/2017 as the Deputy Commissioner/CEO, LAHDC, Kargil had taken an
independent/autonomous/sole decision by regularizing/adjusting the writ petitioners in SWP No.
1462/2017, which is contrary to the relevant service rules, as such, the action taken by the Deputy
Commissioner/CEO, LAHDC, Kargil cannot be taken as a precedence being against the mandate of
law.
7. The said LPA No.12/2013 filed against the order of learned Single Judge dated 21.12.2022 passed
in CCP(S) 506/2019 came to be dismissed vide order dated 03.02.2023, on the ground that same
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60264653/ 2
Union Territory Of J&K And Others vs Abdul Khaliq And Others on 10 August, 2023
was not maintainable as the same was filed against an interlocutory order passed by the Contempt
Court.
8. After passing of the aforesaid order, the matter was again considered by the authorities in
compliance of the order dated 21.12.2022 passed by the learned Single Judge. However, the claim of
the writ petitioners/respondents on consideration was found to be devoid of any merit. Hence, the
same was rejected vide order dated 27.02.2023.
9. The aforesaid order dated 27.02.2023 was again the subject matter of consideration in CCP(S)
506/2019 and vide order dated 03.03.2023, the contempt Court passed the following order:-
"Now by saying that the case of the petitioners in SWP no. 1462/2017 in terms of
their appointment as Patwari was an aberration, the contemnors in the present case
cannot escape from the legal obligation to act in compliance with the judgment of the
writ court in the present case even if that compliance has to be on the side of
aberration. It is for this Court to attend to grant of relief in case of the petitioners.
Relief granted even if factually or legally untenable so long as is not upset by the
superior court through its indulgence on the appellate side jurisdiction, compliance
to the relief so given cannot be excused on the part of the respondents who are
obliged to act in compliance. That is the name of the rule of law.
In view of the above, this Court is left constrained to act in furtherance of order dated
21.12.2022 direct personal appearance of Mr. Piyush Singla, Commissioner Secretary
Revenue Department to Government, J&K, Jammu and Mr. Shaleen Kabra,
Commissioner Revenue Government, UT of J&K in person before this Court on the
next date of hearing.
List on 06.03.2023.
Copy of this order be provided to Mrs. Monika Kohli, learned Sr. AAG under the seal
and signatures of the Reader of this Court."
10. After repeated rejection of the orders passed by the authorities purportedly in compliance to the
order dated 08.04.2019 passed by the learned Single Judge in SWP No. 3001/2015, the
applicants/appellants are seeking to challenge the original order dated 08.04.2015 passed in SWP
No.3001/2015 for which there is a delay of 1376 days in fling the LPA.
11. The applicants/appellants have sought condonation of delay by explaining that with the passing
of the consideration orders as many as on three occasions i.e. 24.01.2020, 13.06.2022 and
27.02.2023, the authorities were under a bonafide belief that they had duly complied with the
direction of the learned Single Judge issued on 08.04.2019 by taking a view that the claim of the
writ petitioners/respondents cannot be considered on the analogy of writ petitioners in SWP No.
1462/2017, as much as, the regularization/adjustment of the writ petitioners as Patwaries in the said
petition was done by the Deputy Commissioner/Chief Executive Officer, LAHDC, Kargil in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60264653/ 3
Union Territory Of J&K And Others vs Abdul Khaliq And Others on 10 August, 2023
contravention of living service rules and without any approval from the competent authority.
12. The case of the applicants/appellants is that however, the aforesaid purported compliances have
not been accepted by the learned Single Judge. Hence, there is no other option, but to challenge the
initial order of the learned Single Judge dated 08.04.2019 passed in SWP No. 3001/2015. It has
been stated that there was no deliberate negligence on the part of the applicants/appellants in
approaching the Court, but were bonafidely pursuing the matter by issuing different compliance
orders as discussed above. Accordingly, applicants/appellants pray for condonation of delay in filing
the appeal.
13. The instant condonation application has been vehemently opposed by the writ
petitioners/respondents by countering that the applicants/appellants were very much aware of the
passing of order dated 08.04.2019 and inspite of having knowledge of the same since then, they did
not challenge the order dated 08.04.2019, but kept on issuing different consideration orders
purportedly in compliance to the order passed by the learned Single Judge and now they cannot take
advantage of their own doings which caused the delay.
14. Mr. Abhinav Sharma, learned senior counsel for the writ petitioners/respondents in support of
his submission has relied on a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in case titled Office of
the Chief Post Master General and others vs. Living Media India Ltd. and another, reported in AIR
2012 SC 1506, wherein the Supreme Court has observed that the government departments are under
a special obligation to perform their duties with diligence and commitment and that condonation of
delay is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit, and without assigning any
cogent reason, delay cannot be condoned.
15. Learned senior counsel for the respondents has also relied upon a judgment titled Esha
Bhattacharjee vs. Managing Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy and others, reported in
2013 AIR SCW 6158 in which Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated the principles to be followed in
deciding the matters relating to condonation of delay. In Paras 15 and 16, it has been held as
follows:-
"15. From the aforesaid authorities the principles that can broadly be culled out are:
i) There should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice-
oriented, non- pedantic approach while dealing with an application for condonation of delay, for the
courts are not supposed to legalise injustice but are obliged to remove injustice.
ii) The terms "sufficient cause" should be understood in their proper spirit, philosophy and purpose
regard being had to the fact that these terms are basically elastic and are to be applied in proper
perspective to the obtaining fact- situation.
iii) Substantial justice being paramount and pivotal the technical considerations should not be given
undue and uncalled for emphasis.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60264653/ 4
Union Territory Of J&K And Others vs Abdul Khaliq And Others on 10 August, 2023
iv) No presumption can be attached to deliberate causation of delay but, gross negligence on the part
of the counsel or litigant is to be taken note of.
v) Lack of bona fides imputable to a party seeking condonation of delay is a significant and relevant
fact.
vi) It is to be kept in mind that adherence to strict proof should not affect public justice and cause
public mischief because the courts are required to be vigilant so that in the ultimate eventuate there
is no real failure of justice.
vii) The concept of liberal approach has to encapsule the conception of reasonableness and it cannot
be allowed a totally unfettered free play.
viii) There is a distinction between inordinate delay and a delay of short duration or few days, for to
the former doctrine of prejudice is attracted whereas to the latter it may not be attracted. That apart,
the first one warrants strict approach whereas the second calls for a liberal delineation.
ix) The conduct, behaviour and attitude of a party relating to its inaction or negligence are relevant
factors to be taken into consideration. It is so as the fundamental principle is that the courts are
required to weigh the scale of balance of justice in respect of both parties and the said principle
cannot be given a total go by in the name of liberal approach.
x) If the explanation offered is concocted or the grounds urged in the application are fanciful, the
courts should be vigilant not to expose the other side unnecessarily to face such a litigation.
xi) It is to be borne in mind that no one gets away with fraud, misrepresentation or interpolation by
taking recourse to the technicalities of law of limitation.
xii) The entire gamut of facts are to be carefully scrutinized and the approach should be based on the
paradigm of judicial discretion which is founded on objective reasoning and not on individual
perception.
xiii) The State or a public body or an entity representing a collective cause should be given some
acceptable latitude.
16. To the aforesaid principles we may add some more guidelines taking note of the present day
scenario. They are: -
a) An application for condonation of delay should be drafted with careful concern and
not in a half hazard manner harbouring the notion that the courts are required to
condone delay on the bedrock of the principle that adjudication of a lis on merits is
seminal to justice dispensation system.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60264653/ 5
Union Territory Of J&K And Others vs Abdul Khaliq And Others on 10 August, 2023
b) An application for condonation of delay should not be dealt with in a routine
manner on the base of individual philosophy which is basically subjective.
c) Though no precise formula can be laid down regard being had to the concept of
judicial discretion, yet a conscious effort for achieving consistency and collegiality of
the adjudicatory system should be made as that is the ultimate institutional motto.
d) The increasing tendency to perceive delay as a non- serious matter and, hence,
lackadaisical propensity can be exhibited in a non-challant manner requires to be
curbed, of course, within legal parameters."
16. On the other hand, Ms. Monika Kohli, learned Sr. AAG appearing on behalf of the
applicants/appellants in support of her contentions relying upon a judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in case titled O. P. Kathpalia vs. Lakhmir Singh, reported in AIR 1984 SC 1744
submits that while dealing with the application of condonation of delay, delay can be condoned if it
would otherwise result in gross miscarriage of justice.
17. Ms. Monika Kohli, learned Sr. AAG has also relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court rendered in case titled Collector Land Acquisition, Anantnag and another vs. Mst. Katiji and
others, reported in 1987 AIR 1353, in which it was held by the Supreme Court that the expression
"sufficient cause" employed by the legislature in Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963, is
adequately elastic to enable the Courts to do substantial justice to the parties by disposing of matters
on merits.
18. Further, Ms. Monika Kohli, learned Sr. AAG by relying upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case titled State of Nagaland vs. Lipok AO and others, reported in AIR 2005 SC 2191
submits that for condoning the delay, the State cannot be put on the same footing as an individual as
it would be unfair and unrealistic as certain amount of latitude is not impermissible.
19. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
20. In the present case, perusal of the impugned order dated 08.04.2019 passed by the learned
Single Judge in SWP No.3001/2015 which is sought to be challenged would show that the direction
issued to the applicants/appellants was to consider the claim of the writ petitioners/respondents in
the light of certain communications read with Section 5 of J&K Civil Services (Special Provision)
Act, 2010. It was further directed that while considering the claim of the writ petitioners/
respondents, the authorities will also take note of the fact that similarly situated persons who were
writ petitioners in SWP No. 1462/2017 have already been adjusted as Patwaries on substantive
basis.
21. Thus, from the above it is clear that the direction issued to the authorities was not to
appoint/adjust the writ petitioners/respondents as Patwaries on substantive basis, but to only
"consider" their claim for regularization.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60264653/ 6
Union Territory Of J&K And Others vs Abdul Khaliq And Others on 10 August, 2023
22. It is the specific plea of the applicants/appellants that on consideration of the claim of the writ
petitioners/respondents, the authorities found that service rules did not provide for regularization
of such persons who were appointed on consolidated basis and not against clear vacancies. Further,
the regularization of the writ petitioners in SWP No. 1462/2017 was done as per the orders issued by
Deputy Commissioner/Chief Executive Officer, LAHDC, Kargil without obtaining any approval from
the competent authority. The authorities have mentioned the said situation in the various
compliance orders issued from time to time by holding that the writ petitioners/ respondents herein
are not similarly situated as those of writ petitioners in SWP No. 1462/2017, and hence, they could
not be given regularization contrary to the statutory rules. However, it appears that the Contempt
Court did not accept the said plea of the authorities and instead directed the concerned officers to
pass order of regularization in favour of the writ petitioners/respondents.
23. The applicants/appellants inspite of passing three consideration orders have failed to convince
the Contempt Court. However, we do not wish to observe as to whether Contempt Court was correct
in rejecting the plea of the concerned officers that they had duly acted upon the directions issued by
the learned Single Judge on 08.04.2019 in SWP No. 3001/2015 or not, inasmuch as, it is not the
subject matter of consideration before this Court.
24. While examining the plea of the applicants/appellants that they have offered sufficient cause for
condoning the delay in filing the LPA, it would be necessary to keep in view the aforesaid sequence
of events in issuing various purported compliance orders on three dates i.e., on 24.01.2020,
13.06.2022 and 27.02.2023 as well as various orders passed by the Contempt Court. At this stage we
do not wish to make any observation as regards the plea taken by the applicants/appellants that the
claim of the writ petitioners/respondents was duly considered purportedly in compliance to the
orders passed by the learned Single Judge on 08.04.2019, and whether the course of action adopted
by the applicants/appellants is justified or valid, as this examination has to be undertaken by the
appropriate forum. However, with regard to the issue of condonation of delay, we are of the view
that the applicants/appellants cannot be said to be sleeping over the matter or were negligent or
they exhibited lack of bonafide.
25. The stand taken by the applicants/appellants that the present writ petitioners are not similarly
situated as that of writ petitioners in SWP No. 1462/2017 as their regularization was done by the
Deputy Commissioner/Chief Executive Officer, LAHDC, Kargil without approval from the
competent authority, and the provisions of J&K Revenue (Subordinate) Services Recruitment Rules,
2009 did not provide for any such regularization on substantive basis, is a matter which can be
examined in the appeal. The submission advanced by the learned counsel for the applicants/
appellants that regularization of the writ petitioners would be in violation of the statutory provisions
and in gross violation of the rules and hence if the delay is not condoned, it will cause serious
miscarriage of justice, cannot be brushed aside. However, if the condonation of delay sought by the
applicants/appellants is not allowed certainly it will cause serious miscarriage of justice as the
applicants/ appellants would not be in a position to contest the claim of the petitioners on merit.
26. In the decision of the Chief Post Master's case (supra) relied upon by Mr. Abhinav Sharma,
learned senior counsel for the writ petitioners, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed in Para 12
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60264653/ 7
Union Territory Of J&K And Others vs Abdul Khaliq And Others on 10 August, 2023
thereof that the Court was conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation delay when there is
no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bonafide, a liberal concession has to be adopted
to advance substantial justice and in Esha Bhattacharjee's case (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court
did not consider certain facts which were relevant about the knowledge of the order under challenge.
27. In the present case, as discussed above, it cannot be said that the applicants/appellants were
sleeping over the matter or were negligent or lacked bonafide, inasmuch as, the original direction of
the learned Single Judge was to "consider" the claim of the writ petitioners/respondents which the
authority claims to have considered. As to whether, such consideration can be said to be proper or
not is a subject matter which can be looked into in appropriate proceedings in the main appeal. But
it certainly would have a relevance in considering the application for condonation of delay.
28. In the present application, the applicants/appellants have stated that purportedly in compliance
of the direction dated 08.04.2019 of the learned Single Judge, the claim of the petitioners was
considered and after consideration the same was rejected vide order dated 24.01.2020. However,
the same was not accepted by the Contempt Court. Another compliance order was issued on
13.06.2022 which was also not accepted by the Contempt Court and thereafter, another order was
issued on 27.02.2023 but the said order was again not accepted by the Contempt Court on the
ground that the aforesaid order cannot be stated to be in compliance to the order passed by the
Contempt Court, and vide order dated 03.03.2023 the personal appearance of the concerned
officers was directed. It was only after the order passed by the Contempt Court on 03.03.2023, the
present LPA has been preferred challenging the order dated 08.04.2019.
29. Thus, the validity of the aforesaid three orders issued by the respondent-authority purportedly
in compliance of the order dated 08.04.2019 passed in SWP No.3001/2015 is required to be
examined by the Appellate Court in LPA No. 26 of 2023. However, if the delay is not condoned, the
same cannot be examined on merits. We are, accordingly, of the view that sufficient cause has been
made out for condoning the delay in filing the appeal.
30. Consequently, condonation application is allowed and delay in filing the appeal is condoned.
Admit.
Issue notice to the respondents. Mr. Abhimanyu Sharma accepts notice on behalf of the
respondents.
Registry to list the matter for further consideration on 4th September, 2023.
