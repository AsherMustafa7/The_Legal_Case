Officer, Hathua, Marhawra, vide Letter No. 05/06 4951 dated 20.12.2006, which was conducted by
Mr. R.K. Poddar, Dy. S.P. Vigilance, who submitted enquiry report on 13.04.2012 after more than
five years giving no clear information regarding disproportionate assets of the husband of the
petitioner, however, subsequent to the said report dated 13.04.2012, clubbing the petitioner's
income and her husband enquiry officer had again submitted another report after four months on
23.08.2012, in which, he has found that husband of the petitioner had disproportionate assets worth
Rs. 20,98,129/- to his known source of income. Record reveals that before the two enquiry reports
were submitted by Mr. R.K. Poddar, the Dy. S.P, Vigilance, Siwan, two more reports were submitted
by Mr. Satish Kumar, Dy. S.P. Vigilance, Siwan in the year 2006-07 and another enquiry was
conducted by Mr. Lakshmi Narayan Manjhi, Dy. S.P. Vigilance, Siwan, who had submitted his
report in the year 2010. Both the reports found no irregularities and gave clean chit to the husband
of the petitioner. However, based on the report, which was submitted by Mr. R.K. Poddar, Dy.S.P.
on 23.08.2012, the vigilance lodged an FIR being Vigilance P.S. Case No. 56 of 2013 on 03.09.2013
after delay of nearly one year under Sections 13(2) read with 13(1)(3) of Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the "P.C. Act") and Section 109 and 120(B) of the Indian Penal
Code. Upon investigation, charge-sheet no. 10/2015 dated 28.01.2015 was submitted and the
learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Muzaffarpur, took cognizance against the petitioner for the Patna
High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 offences under Sections Sections 13(2)
read with 13(1)(3) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 109 and 120(B) of the Indian
Penal Code vide order dated 16.04.2015 and only on 30.01.2023, the opposite party received the
police paper and since then, the said trial is pending. The petitioner has challenged the order taking
cognizance dated 16.04.2015 on account of inordinate delay in investigation and trial from the end
of the check period to the lodging of the FIR compounded by sluggish proceeding, which has caused
mental trauma and prejudice to the petitioner and secondly, that from the statement of the income
and expenditure of the husband of the petitioner and the petitioner, it cannot be said that the
income received is from unlawful sources.
ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that preliminary enquiry was
conducted on the basis of allegedly a complaint made by one Sudhanshu Kumar and the Lokayukta
directed for vigilance enquiry in which respect preliminary enquiry was firstly conducted by one
Satish Kumar, Dy. S.P. Siwan, in the year 2006- 07, who submitted his enquiry report having found
the husband of the petitioner to be innocent. Subsequent to the same, another preliminary enquiry
was also conducted by one Mr. Lakshmit Narayan Manjhi, Dy. S.P. Vigilance, Siwan, who had also
submitted enquiry report way back in the year 2010 in respect of the husband of the petitioner, who
was posted as Sub-Divisional Officer, Hathua, Marworha and no material was found against the
husband of the petitioner regarding unlawful source of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of
2018 dt.23-09-2025 income. Learned counsel submitted that after two preliminary enquiries and
after delay of nearly five and a half year, one another preliminary report was submitted on
13.04.2012 by Mr. R.K. Poddar, Dy. S.P. and subsequent to the preliminary enquiry, he submitted
another report dated 23.08.2012. Learned counsel submitted that even according to the preliminary
report submitted by Mr. R.K. Poddar, Dy.S.P. on 13.04.2012, no case of disproportionate asset was
found against the petitioner's husband, however, in the last enquiry report dated 23.08.2012, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 2
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
asset of the petitioner was clubbed together with her husband and a case of unknown source of
income leading to alleged disproportionate asset worth Rs. 20,98,129/- was submitted. Learned
counsel submitted that not only there is inordinate delay in conduct of the preliminary enquiry, one
after another by three Dy. Superintendent of Police, at the same time, after submission of the last
enquiry report dated 23.08.2012, after delay of more than one year, Vigilance P.S. Case No. 56/13
was lodged on 03.09.2013. No information has been given, as to why, even after obtaining sanction
from the government in respect of the husband of the petitioner, nearly after five and a half year,
preliminary enquiry was submitted and the FIR could only be lodged after one year i.e. on
03.09.2013 by the time, the petitioner has become very old. It has been submitted that prosecution
is liable to be quashed on the ground of delay in prosecution, which is not attributable to the
petitioner leading to denial of valuable constitutional right to speedy investigation and trial. The
entire criminal proceeding initiated against the petitioner is fit to be Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 quashed on this ground alone, without going into the merits of
the accusation against the petitioner and also considering the age. Learned counsel, in support, has
placed reliance upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in the case of Pankaj Kumar
vs. the State of Maharashtra reported in (2008) 16 SCC 117.
5. Learned counsel, otherwise also, on merits, submitted that the prosecution initiated against the
petitioner and her husband is malicious and with a pre-determined mind as no incriminating
material has been collected in course of investigation against the petitioner to show that a case as
alleged against the petitioner under Sections 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of the P.C. Act and Sections
109 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code is made out and she has abated her husband, who was
posted as a public servant, to bring a case of undisclosed income. Learned counsel submitted that
the investigation itself spanned nearly two years from the date of FIR and trial remained at an
incipient stage even after a decade, exacerbating the petitioner's ordeal. The petitioner, drawing
upon authoritative precedents, has mounted a multifaceted challenge to the impugned order. The
primary grounds are:
(i) The petitioner is the spouse of the accused public servant and has been implicated
primarily due to shared familial assets.
However, the prosecution's case hinges on an incomplete assessment that overlooks her substantial
contributions to the household's financial standing.
(ii) The Vigilance Department's computation of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018
dt.23-09-2025 disproportionate assets egregiously omitted the petitioner's independent income,
rendering the entire allegation flawed ab initio. Reliance is placed on income tax returns and
documentary evidence, substantiating her earnings from professional engagements, which
aggregated with her husband's income, negate any disproportion.
6. Learned counsel further submitted that the income of the petitioner is much more than the
alleged disproportionate asset of Rs. 20,98,120/-. The income of the petitioner has been duly
admitted even in the counter affidavit filed by the Respondent in Paragraph nos. 7 and 12. The
summary of income of the petitioner is as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 3
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
*Income from tuition and tailoring - Rs. 24,200/-
*Income from Fishery- Rs. 33,000/-
*Income from salary- Rs. 10,72,000/-
*Income from agriculture- Rs. 5,21,313/-
*Income from Taxi plying- Rs. 45,722/-
*Income from Land Acquisition- Rs. 2,10,000/-
*Income from Petrol Pump- Rs. 8,72,632/-
*Income from Indane Gas- Rs. 9,08,031/-
7. Therefore taking into account the total independent income of the petitioner, it cannot be said
that there was disproportionate asset. The income of the petitioner is much more than the alleged
disproportionate asset of Rs. 20,98,120/- This calculation demonstrates that the combined family
income, including the petitioner's verified Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018
dt.23-09-2025 earnings, exceeds the total asset value, thereby nullifying the foundational claim of
disproportion and highlighting a critical investigative oversight.
8. The above calculation demonstrates that the combined family income, including the petitioner's
verified earnings, exceeds the total asset value, thereby nullifying the foundational claim of
disproportion and highlighting a critical investigative oversight. During the investigation, the I.O.
has unauthorizedly increased the check period from 1983-84 to 2006-07 up to the Financial Year
2013-14 by increasing the alleged disproportionate assets which cannot be looked into in the present
case. FIR is based on the preliminary enquiry and during the said preliminary enquiry, learned
counsel submitted that, without entirety of the history of the case and considering that except the
statement, no other material has been collected to support the case of disproportionate assets to the
known source of income is made out.
9. Learned counsel submitted that in the Case of State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal reported in (1992)
Supp 1 SCC 335, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has categorically held that before a public servant is
charges with an act of dishonesty, which amounts to serious allegation and an FIR is lodged against
him, there must be some suitable allegation by a responsible officer. In the present case, four
preliminary enquiries were held in respect of the husband of the petitioner and in respect of three
enquiries submitted, no offence was made out under Sections Sections 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of
the P.C. Act, and Sections Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 109 and
120B of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioner. It is the fourth enquiry, clubbing the
independent income of the petitioner and her husband, a case of misappropriation has been made
out. Learned counsel further submitted that to substantiate the income of the petitioner, the
petitioner has relied upon the I.T.R. for the entire check period and, as such, it can not be said that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 4
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
as per the source information only, the disproportionate was assessed, therefore, the statement of
income and expenditure of the petitioner is nothing but arbitrary and erratic calculation, which
cannot be sustained. Learned counsel submitted that the order taking cognizance is not only
unsustainable on the basis of delay in lodging of the FIR, investigation and trial but also on the
manner the disproportionate asset to the investigating officer has been arrived.
ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
10. Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that on the basis of
several complaint against the husband of the petitioner Mr. Vijay Pratap Singh that he has amassed
assets disproportionate to his legal source of income, an enquiry was initiated. The enquiry revealed
the fact that Shri Vijay Pratap Singh has amassed assets worth Rs. 31,76,953/- in his name and in
the name of his wife Smt. Vijay Laxmi Singh in the check period from 1983-84 to 2006- 07,, while
their income was found to be Rs. 9,27,376/-. Thus, Disproportionate Assets came to the tune of Rs.
20,98,120/-. Therefore Vigilance P.S. case No. 56 of 13, dated 09.03.2013 u/s 13(2) r/w 13(1)(e) of
the P.C. Act and section 109,120(B) I.P.C. was registered against the Patna High Court CR. MISC.

of investigation of this case, I.O. examined all the evidence and documents for the check period from
1983-84 to August 2013 and found that their total income was Rs. 1,72,05,078/- while their total
assets and expenditure found to the tune of Rs. 2,98,93,179/-, therefore disproportionate assets
came to the tune of Rs. 1,26,88,101/-and accordingly charge-sheet no.-10/2015, dated 28.01.2015
u/s 13(2) r/w 13(1)(e) of P.C. Act and u/s 109/120B of I.P.C. against Shri Vijay Pratap Singh & Smt.
Vijay Laxmi Singh was submitted in the competent Court. The I.O. has given details about income
from different sources of the petitioner in paragraph nos. 189 & 190 of case diary, where the I.O. has

dt.23-09-2025 thoroughly examined the source of income of this petitioner Smt. Vijay Laxmi Singh
and he has given all benefits to the petitioner by adding it in income side. The I.O. has mentioned in
paras. 244 and 245 of Case diary that in course of investigation, I.O. has considered the income as

the cumulative income of the accused petitioner and her husband, delinquent public servant Shri
Vijay Pratap Singh, during the check period was only Rs.1,72,05,078/- (Rupees One Crore
Seventy-Two Lakh Five Thousand Seventy-Eight only), whereas the total value of their assets and
expenditure amounted to Rs.2,98,93,179/- (Rupees Two Crore Ninety-Eight Lakh Ninety-Three
Thousand One Hundred Seventy-Nine only), thereby resulting in disproportionate assets to the tune
of Rs.1,26,88,101/- (Rupees One Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025
Crore Twenty-Six Lakh Eighty-Eight Thousand One Hundred One only). The income of the accused
petitioner, as reflected in her income-tax returns, was only Rs.7,54,055/- (Rupees Seven Lakh
Fifty-Four Thousand Fifty-Five only) during the period 1985-1986 to 2006-2007, but thereafter,
during 2007-2014, her income suddenly increased to Rs.43,48,043/- (Rupees Forty-Three Lakh
Forty-Eight Thousand Forty- Three only), largely attributed to rent, gas agency, and petrol pump
business. Significantly, her investments in these three properties alone amounted to Rs.60,72,229/-
(Rupees Sixty Lakh Seventy-Two Thousand Two Hundred Twenty-Nine only). The accused
petitioner has failed to satisfactorily account for the lawful source of these investments. Cumulative

Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION
13. Heard the parties.
14. Petitioner is the wife of retired public servant Mr. Vijay Pratap Singh, who was posted as
Sub-Divisional Officer at the relevant point of time. The allegation against her is that she has abated
her husband Mr. Vijay Pratap Singh against whom, allegation is that he had amassed assets
disproportionate to his known and lawful source of income. On the basis of complaint made by one
Sudhanshu Kumar, the Lokayukta directed for preliminary enquiry vide Letter No. 05/06 1951
dated 20.12.2006. One preliminary enquiry report was submitted by Mr. Satish Kumar, Deputy
Superintendent of Police, Vigilance, Siwan in respect of the husband of the petitioner in the year
2006-07. Subsequent to the same Mr. Lakshmi Narayan Manjhi, Deputy Superintendent of Police,
Vigilance, Siwan, who was also directed to conduct preliminary enquiry, too submitted his enquiry
report in the year 2010. Both the preliminary enquiry report could not conclude to hold that
husband of the petitioner had amassed income disproportionate to his lawful source of income.
Thereafter, a preliminary enquiry report was submitted by one R.K. Poddar, Deputy Superintendent
of Police, Vigilance, Siwan, on 13.04.2012 and subsequent to same, by clubbing the income of the
petitioner along with her husband, he submitted another preliminary enquiry report on 23.08.2012.
The entire period till the FIR could be lodged based on the enquiry report dated 23.08.2012, on
03.09.2013, after delay of nearly six years from the date of complaint made by one Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 Sudhanshu Kumar and one year from the date of
submission of the enquiry report dated 23.08.2012, the FIR was instituted under Sections 13(2) read
with 13(1)(e) of the P.C. Act and Sections 109 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. The husband of
the petitioner, in the meantime, superannuated and the offence alleged against the petitioner, who is
an old lady is of abatement of the main offence against the public servant. The impact of abnormal
delay has caused colossal financial loss to the petitioner and the impact of it had shattered her
proportional, professional and business development of the members of the family. The
investigation could not be completed in accordance with the period prescribed under Chapter 36 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of the offences, which against the petitioner is punishable
with imprisonment upto seven years, but, being conscious of the law that the criminal proceeding
cannot be quashed on the ground that investigation consumed a period of nearly ten years resulting
into taking cognizance of the offences by the learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Muzaffarpur in
connection with Special Case No. 35/2013 arising out of Vigilance P.S. Case No. 56/2013 on
16.04.2015 and the police report has been received by the opposite party as recent as on 30.01.2023
and the trial is not likely to end within one year or two years even if the Special Court would strictly
adhere to the direction issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Raj Deo Sharma vs. The
State of Bihar reported in (1998) 7 SCC 507.
15. The Apex Court in similar circumstances, in the case of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544
of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 Seeta Hemchandra Shashittal & Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.
reported in (2001) 4 SCC 525 after analysing that there is need for speeding up investigation and
trial as undue delay in culminating the criminal proceedings is a antithesis to the constitutional
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 8
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
protection enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, observed that "the Court has to
view it from pragmatic perspective and the question of delay cannot be considered entirely from an
academic angle." The Apex Court dealing with the ground of delay to quash the criminal proceeding
held the delay to be unfair and unreasonable and quashed the prosecution against them, who had
allegedly abated the public servant to commit offence under Sections 13(2) of the P.C. Act. The Apex
Court faced with the question of prolong investigation and trial that can criminal proceeding
initiated against the accused considering the valuable constitutional right to speedy investigation
and trial enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, while dealing with the allegation
under Sections 13(1)(c)(d) read with Section 13(2) of P.C. Act, taking note of the unwarranted
prolonged investigation relating to financial irregularities considering the lackadaisical manner of
investigation quashed the criminal proceedings in the case of Pankaj Kumar vs. the State of
Maharashtra reported in (2008) 16 SCC 17.
16. In the facts of the said case, the alleged offence was committed sometime in the year 1981 and
FIR was lodged in the year 1987 and charge-sheet was submitted on 22.02.1991 and till that date, no
witnesses were examined by the prosecution too uphold the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544
of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 constitutional right enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India
without going into the merits of the accusation against the accused of the said case and also
questioning the age of the said accused at the time of commission of offence, has quashed the FIR.
Similar is the present case as the alleged offence had taken place in the year 2006 and based on the
preliminary enquiry report, FIR was lodged in the year 2013 and investigation was completed in the
year 2015 leading the learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Muzaffarpur to take cognizance on
16.04.2015 under Sections 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of the P.C. Act and Sections 109 and 120B of the
Indian Penal Code and till date, no witnesses have been examined, can this be also a rarest case,
calling for substantial justice to exercise inherent power conferred under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for
quashing the entire proceeding pending in the Court of learned Special Judge, Vigilance,
Muzaffarpur?
17. A few material facts necessary for disposal of the present application, which is reiterated that
four preliminary enquiry were held and finally action was taken on the basis of enquiry report dated
23.08.2012 and FIR was lodged on 03.0.2013. The materials which were collected in course of
investigation have summarily been brought on record by the opposite party no. 2 by way of filing
counter affidavit. The same have been summerised in the written argument submitted on behalf of
the opposite party no.2, which, inter alia, are as follows:
"On the basis of complaints made against the husband of the accused-petitioner,
namely Vijay Pratap Singh, alleging therein that he had amassed assets
disproportionate to his known and lawful sources of income, an enquiry was Patna
High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 initiated against him. The
said enquiry revealed that Shri Vijay Pratap Singh had acquired assets worth
Rs.31,76,003/- in the name of himself and his wife, the accused-petitioner Smt. Vijay
Laxmi Singh, during the check period 1983-84 to 2006-07, whereas their total lawful
income during the said period was found to be only Rs.9,27,215/-. Thus, the
disproportionate assets were quantified at Rs.20,38,120/-. Accordingly, Vigilance

Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
P.S. Case No. 56 of 2013, dated 09.03.2013, was registered under Section 13(2) read
with Section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Sections 109 and
120B of the Indian Penal Code, against the accused-petitioner and her husband,
namely Vijay Pratap Singh.
It is humbly submitted that the accused petitioner has five children four daughters
and one son. Out of them, three have pursued MBA courses, while two have
completed the MBBS medical degree. As per the representation of her husband, Shri
Vijay Pratap Singh (delinquent public servant), and his statement during
interrogation, the total expenditure on the education of all five children has been
calculated at Rs. 48,84,000/- (Rupees Forty-Eight Lakh Eighty-Four Thousand
only).
During the relevant check period, two daughters of the accused petitioner, namely Priyanka Vijay
and Kanupriya Vijay, were married in the years 2006 and 2010 respectively. On the basis of the
financial transactions of the accused petitioner and her husband, as well as the statements elicited
during the interrogation of the accused petitioner, the expenditure incurred on their marriages has
been reasonably assessed at Rs. 6,00,000/- (Rupees Six Lakh only). This assessment is considered
reasonable and proportionate, keeping in view the social and financial status of the accused
petitioner and her family.
From a perusal of the materials on record, it stands manifestly established that the cumulative
income of the accused petitioner and her husband, delinquent public servant Shri Vijay Pratap
Singh, during the check period was only Rs.1,72,05,078/- (Rupees One Crore Seventy-Two Lakh
Five Thousand Seventy-Eight only), whereas the total value of their assets and expenditure
amounted to Rs.2,98,93,179/- (Rupees Two Crore Ninety-Eight Lakh Ninety-Three Thousand One
Hundred Seventy-Nine only), thereby resulting in disproportionate assets to the tune of
Rs.1,26,88,101/- (Rupees One Crore Twenty-Six Lakh Eighty-Eight Thousand One Hundred One
only).
It is humbly and respectfully submitted that the income of the accused petitioner, as reflected in her
income- tax returns, was only Rs.7,54,055/- (Rupees Seven Lakh Fifty- Four Thousand Fifty-Five
only) during the period 1985-1986 to 2006-2007, but thereafter, during 2007-2014, her income
suddenly increased to Rs.43,48,043/- (Rupees Forty-Three Lakh Forty-Eight Thousand Forty-Three
only), largely attributed to rent, gas agency, and petrol pump business. Significantly, her
investments in these three properties alone amounted to Rs.60,72,229/- (Rupees Sixty Lakh
Seventy-Two Thousand Two Hundred Twenty-Nine only). The accused Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 petitioner has failed to satisfactorily account for the lawful source
of these investments.
Thus, even after due consideration of all claims advanced by the accused petitioner regarding her
own income and that of her husband, a clear case of disproportionate assets stands prima facie
established.

Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
The petitioner did not possess sufficient lawful sources of income at the time of acquisition, and it is
evident that her husband, delinquent public servant Vijay Pratap Singh, invested his illicit wealth in
her name. The accused petitioner has thereby abetted and conspired with him in amassing and
concealing such ill-gotten wealth.
Cumulative income of the accused petitioner and her husband, delinquent public servant Shri Vijay
Pratap Singh, during the check period was only Rs.1,72,05,078/- (Rupees One Crore Seventy-Two
Lakh Five Thousand Seventy- Eight only), whereas the total value of their assets and expenditure
amounted to Rs.2,98,93,179/- (Rupees Two Crore Ninety-Eight Lakh Ninety-Three Thousand One
Hundred Seventy-Nine only), thereby resulting in disproportionate assets to the tune of
Rs.1,26,88,101/- (Rupees One Crore Twenty-Six Lakh Eighty-Eight Thousand One Hundred One
only).
The learned Court below, upon a proper and judicious appreciation of the FIR, charge-sheet, case
diary, and other materials available on record, has rightly found a prima facie case under Section
13(2) read with Section 13(1)
(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, as well as Sections 109 and 120B of the Indian Penal
Code against the accused petitioner and others. Accordingly, cognizance of the aforesaid offences
was taken vide order dated 16.04.2015, which is not only proper and judicious but also fully in
conformity with the settled principles of law."
18. In the present case, the petitioner is challenging the order taking cognizance dated 16.04.2015 on
the basis of no material collected against her in course of enquiry. The question arises whether the
same constitutes no offence if the check period from 1983-34 to 2006-2007, during which period,
total income tax has been found to be Rs. 9,27,376/- and the disproportionate asset came to the tune
of Rs. 20,98,120/- and on the basis of the evidences and documents for the check period from
1983-84 to August, 2013, the total income tax of the petitioner and her husband was Rs.
1,72,05,078/- while the total assets Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025
and expenditure found to the tune of Rs. 2,99,88,864/-, therefore, disproportionate asset came to
the tune of Rs. 1,26,88,101/- and the income of the petitioner can be held to be independent of her
husband?
19. The law in respect of calculating the total income is well settled that income of wife (petitioner)
must be considered when both the petitioner and her husband filed the relevant income tax return
in order to show their respective income and assets. The respondents in paragraph no. 25 of the
counter affidavit have admitted that in course of investigation , the relevant documents to the
evidences, Income Tax Returns and Balance-Sheets etc. has been thoroughly examined by the
Investigating Officer but have not answered any query contrary to the materials collected in course
of investigation.
20. The petitioner has produced a copy of communication of the Income Tax Officer, Dewariya, in
respect of the petitioner answering certain queries vide Letter dated 06.11.2008 to Deputy
Superintendent of Police, Vigilance, Siwan informing that the petitioner had not filed return in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 11
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
respect of the Assessment Year 1985-88 and records available for ten years have been deemed to be
assessed in respect of Financial Year from 2005-06 to 2007-08 and information was given to the
Vigilance Investigation Bureau. The respective income tax return has not been denied in the counter
affidavit as has been admitted in paragraphs nos. 6 and 7 of the counter affidavit.
21. In such circumstances, whether the Income Tax Return Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544
of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 should be presumed to be true and correct. Upon consideration of the
income tax return of the petitioner and her husband for the check period of the year 1983-84 to
2006-07 Rs. 2,99,88,864/- which has been alleged to be more than Rs. 1,72,05,078/-, therefore,
taking into account the total independent income of the petitioner, can it be said that there was
disproportionate asset?
22. The offence under Sections 13(2) and 13(1)(e) of the P.C. Act, which prior to its amendment
through the amending Act 16 of 2018 with effect from 26 July, 2018, provided as follows:
"13. Criminal misconduct by a public servant.--
(1) A public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct,--
(e) if he or any person on his behalf, is in possession or has, at any time during the
period of his office, been in possession for which the public servant cannot
satisfactorily account, of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his
known sources of income. "
23. In the case of State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi reported in (2005) 1 SCC 568, Bharat
Parikh v. CBI reported in (2008) 10 SCC 109, Indu Jain v. State of M.P. reported in (2008) 15 SCC
341, Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency (P) Ltd. v. CBI, reported in (2018) 16 SCC 299, Apex Court
has defined "known sources of income" means income received from any lawful source and such
receipt has been intimated in accordance with the provisions of any law, rules or orders for the time
being applicable to a public servant. The ambit of the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of
2018 dt.23-09-2025 provision has been explained by the Apex Court in para no. 10 of the case of
Kedari Lal vs. State of M.P. reported in 2015 (14) SCC 505, which is reproduced hereinafter:
"10. The expression "known sources of income" in Section 13(1)(e) of the Act has two
elements, first, the income must be received from a lawful source and secondly, the
receipt of such income must have been intimated in accordance with the provisions of
law, rules or orders for the time being applicable to the public servant. In N.
Ramakrishnaiah [N. Ramakrishnaiah v. State of A.P., (2008) 17 SCC 83, while
dealing with the said expression, it was observed that "... Qua the public servant,
whatever return he gets from his service, will be the primary item of his income.
[Other income which can conceivably be] income qua the public servant, will be in
the regular receipt from (a) his property, or (b) his investment.'

Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
24. In case of Vishwanath Chaturvedi v. Union of India reported in (2007) 4 SCC
380, the Apex Court has observed that "submission of income tax returns and the
assessments orders passed thereon, would not constitute a foolproof defence against
a charge of acquisition of assets disproportionate to the known lawful sources of
income as contemplated under the PC Act and that further scrutiny/analysis thereof
is imperative to determine as to whether the offence as contemplated by the PC Act is
made out or not."
25. In similar circumstances, the acquisitions being reflected in income tax returns, the Apex Court
granted relief to the public servant in M. Krishna Reddy v. State [M. Krishna Reddy v. State reported
in (1992) 4 SCC 45, it was observed as follows:
"14. ... Therefore, on the face of these unassailable Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.
58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 documents i.e. the wealth tax and income tax returns,
we hold that the appellant is entitled to have a deduction of Rs 56,240 from the
disproportionate assets of Rs 2,37,842."
15. If the amounts in question, which were duly intimated and are reflected in the income tax return
are thus deducted, the alleged disproportionate assets stand reduced to Rs 37,605, which is less than
10% of the income of the appellant. In case of Krishnanand v. State of M.P. reported in(1977) 1 SCC
816 and in M. Krishna Reddy v. State reported in (1992) 4 SCC 45, the Apex Court Court had
granted benefit to the public servants in similar circumstances."
26. The Apex Court in case of Nirankar Nath Pandey vs. State of U.P. & Ors. (Criminal Appeal No.
5009 of 2024), Seeta Hemchandra Shashittal & Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. reported in
(2001) 4 SCC 525 and Pankaj Kumar Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. reported in (2008) 16 SCC 17
held that the cornerstone of a disproportionate assets case under Section 13(1)(e) of the P.C. Act is a
meticulous computation juxtaposing 'known sources of income against acquired assets. In Nirankar
Nath Pandey (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court, quashed an FIR where the Vigilance Department
failed to consider the wife's independent income from yoga teaching, agriculture, and rentals. The
Court held that the public servant's wife's income must be considered as well while calculating the
total income and assets. I find it apt of reproduce paragraph 9 of Nirankar Nath Pandey (supra)
which inter alia is as follows:
"9. We are of the view that the Appellant's wife's income must be considered as well
while calculating the total income and assets. Both the Appellant and his wife have
filed the relevant income tax returns in order to show their respective incomes and
assets. The Respondents in their Counter-Affidavit have not denied these income tax
returns or alleged them to be forged or fabricated. Therefore, when a public servant is
submitting his income tax returns, they should be presumed to be true and correct. If
you duly consider the income tax returns of the Appellant and his wife for the check
period Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 of the year
1996-2020, the total income is coming up to be Rs.1.21,06,268/-(Rupees One Crore
Twenty One Lakh Six Thousand Two Hundred Sixty Eight only) which is in fact more
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 13
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
than the assets amounting to Rs.1.16,02,669/- (Rupees One Crore Sixteen Lakh Two
Thousand Six Hundred Sixty Nine only) which is said to be the disproportionate
assets in question under the present FIR."
27. Applying the above ratio mutatis mutandis, the petitioner's independent income, evidenced by
income tax returns and unchallenged by the State, has been wholly ignored her earnings, when
clubbed, elevate the family's total income beyond the alleged assets. During the investigation, the
I.O., has unauthorizedly increased the check period from1983-84 to 2006-07 up to the Financial
Year 2013-14 by increasing the alleged disproportionate assets which cannot be looked into in the
present case. FIR cannot be said to be based only on the preliminary enquiry and the figures of
income and expenditure derived by the I.O. in absence of no material collected, no case of
disproportionate assets to the known source of income is made out, particularly in view of the fact
that I.O. has accepted the ITR for the period Financial Year 2006 upto Financial Year, 2013-14. This
omission vitiates the foundational allegation, as it contravenes the statutory mandate to consider all
'known sources'. Furthermore, this selective exclusion of investment in LIC, income from petrol
pump and gas agency, which is income received on account of commission from the Petrol Pump
and Gas Agency have been added. The independent income accrued to the petitioner have been
added to the income of her husband in view of the oil company has been taken in view of Letter of
Intent issued to the petitioner and commission Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018
dt.23-09-2025 earned, the initial investment is well accounted and in spite of accepting the same in
course of investigation has added as undisclosed expenditure, similarly, on account of marriage of
children of the petitioner, . The factor of inflation has also not been taken into account the I.O.
having arriving to include the expenditure incurred on the education of the children of the petitioner
has also been included as undisclosed income whereas by ignoring the income tax return filed
during the period since the children of the petitioner were attending their school and the institution
in which they were admitted. The check period is of more than 24 years. In such circumstances as
has been observed by the Apex Court in Nirankar Nath Pandey (supra), it must be taken into
account that over such a long period of time, there is inflation and natural progression in the
changing economy that affects the value of assets. A dynamic approach is required to assess the
individual income over span of more than two decades by adding the investment without
determining the same from the ITR filed in respect of the petitioner which is independent income
and expenditure of her husband, giving total value of asset and expenditure to Rs. 2,98,93,179/-
resulting into incorrectly arriving to assess the disproportionate asset of the petitioner to the tune of
Rs, 1,26,88,101/- if added with the total income of the husband of the petitioner, the assessment
made by the I.O. ignoring the relevant income tax return in order to show their respective income
and assets which the opposite party no. 2 has not denied in counter affidavit or have alleged that the
return is the forged and fabricated in that circumstances, the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.
58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 Apex Court in Nirankar Nath Pandey (Supra) has laid down that "
they should be presumed to be true and correct". Paragraph no. 4 is reproduced as under:
"... 10. Further, we have considered that the check period is from the year 1996 to
2020, which is almost twenty five years. It must be taken into account that over such
a long period of time, there is inflation and a natural progression in the changing
economy that affects the value of assets such as property. This can understandably
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 14
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
lead to discrepancies in declaring the value of assets over the years. Therefore, there
should be a more dynamic approach while considering an individual's income and
assets over the span of two decades, such as in the present case. The notion that the
declared value of an asset such as property or gold will remain static is flawed. This
has to be considered while examining an individual's assets and income while making
a determination regarding disproportionate assets. Such an examination needs to
reflect such adjustments and changes as is natural with the progression of time.
28. The delay from the check period's end (2007) to FIR (2013) exceeds six years, cognizance taken
on 16.04.2015 with trial languishing post-cognizance (2015). In Pankaj Kumar (supra), the Apex
Court, quashed a case with three-year investigative delay, emphasizing:
"Investigations dragged on for over three years. This appeal arises from the final
judgment seeking quashing of the charge-sheet." In Paragraph 18 of the judgment it
was observed:
"... 18. Tested on the touchstone of the broad principles, enumerated above, we are of
the opinion that in the instant case, appellant's constitutional right recognised under
Article 21 of the Constitution stands violated. It is common ground that the First
Information Report was recorded on 12th May, 1987 for the offences allegedly
committed in the year 1981, and after unwarranted prolonged investigations,
involving afore-stated three financial irregularities, the chargesheet was submitted in
Court on 22nd February, 1991. Nothing happened till April, 1999, when the appellant
and his deceased mother filed criminal writ petition seeking quashing of proceedings
before the trial court. Though, it is true that the plea with regard to inordinate delay
in investigations and trial has been raised before us for the first time but we feel that
at this distant point of time, it would be unfair to the appellant to remit the matter
back to the High Court for examining the said plea of the Patna High Court CR.
MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 appellant. Apart from the fact that it would
further protract the already delayed trial, no fruitful purpose would be served as
learned Counsel for the State very fairly stated before us that he had no explanation
to offer for the delay in investigations and the reason why the trial did not commence
for eight long years. Nothing, whatsoever, could be pointed out, far from being
established, to show that the delay was in any way attributable to the appellant.
Moreover, having regard to the nature of the accusations against the appellant,
briefly referred to above, who was a young boy of about eighteen years of age in the
year 1981, when the acts of omission and commission were allegedly committed by
the concerns managed by his parents, who have since died, we feel that the extreme
mental stress and strain of prolonged investigation by the Anti Corruption Bureau
and the sword of damocles hanging perilously over his head for over fifteen years
must have wrecked his entire career. Be that as it may, the prosecution has failed to
show any exceptional circumstance, which could possibly be taken into consideration
for condoning the prolongation of investigation and the trial. The lackadaisical
manner of investigation spread over a period of four years in a case of this type and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45232596/ 15
Vijay Laxmi Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Vigilance on 23 September, 2025
inordinate delay of over eight years (excluding the period when the record of the trial
court was in the High Court), is manifestly clear. Thus, on facts in hand, we are
convinced that the appellant has been denied his valuable constitutional right to a
speedy investigation and trial and, therefore, criminal proceedings initiated against
him in the year 1987 and pending in the court of Special Judge, Latur, deserve to be
quashed on this short ground alone.
29. Inordinate delay in the investigation and trial cannot be ignored. Applying the principle laid
down by the Seeta Hemchandra Shasheetal (Supra) and Pankaj Kumar (supra), the entire
proceeding can be quashed considering that the FIR was lodged on 03.09.2013 and cognizance
taken on 16.04.2015 yet the trial remains at a very nascent stage as on date which can be seen from
the order dated 30.01.2023, the police paper could be handed over to the opposite party no. 2 on the
said date the detail of which I have taken note in paragraph no. 14 of this order. It can be held that in
the present case, the delay of over more than two decades, from the check period the prosecution
against the petitioner can be quashed on account of unexplained undue delay. The sluggish
proceedings has caused mental trauma and prejudice to the petitioner.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No. 58544 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 Till date no witnesses have been
examined warranting quashing the entire proceeding to protect the Fundamental Right granted
under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. I find that the present is a rarest case, calling for
substantial justice to exercise inherent power conferred under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the order taking
cognizance dated 16.04.2015, passed by the learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Muzzafarpur, in
Vigilance P.S. Case No. 56 of 2013 along with the entire proceeding is hereby set aside and quashed.
30. Accordingly, the present application stands disposed of.
