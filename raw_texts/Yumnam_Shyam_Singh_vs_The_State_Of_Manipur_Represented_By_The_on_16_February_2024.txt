Announced."
[7] The I.O. of the case submitted bail objection report wherein it was stated that she herself visited
the JNIMS Hospital for taking injuries report with the OPD ticket enclosed by the said Th.
Pushparani Devi in her complaint. However, it was noticed that there is no record for treatment of
the complainant. In case the Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal looked into the said report, absolute
pre-arrest bail would have been granted but the said anticipatory bail application was rejected.
Hence, the present anticipatory bail application has been filed.
[8] The petitioners have filed affidavit in rejoinder to the objection affidavit filed by the respondents
that the respondents have been trying to mislead the Hon'ble Court by twisting the facts of the case.
[9] Heard both the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length.
[10] The allegation against the petitioners are that the petitioners assaulted the complainant, Th.
Pushparani Devi and outraged her modesty criminal intimidation and common intention. But, on
perusal of the anticipatory bail objection report (Annexure - A/9) submitted by the I.O. of the case to
the Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal, it is found that the I.O. requested to furnish a copy of the medical
report basing on one, Out Patient A.B. No. 38 of 2022 Page 4 Record certificate in which, it was
mentioned pain on the abdomen and referred to surgery. The staff of JNIMS Hospital, Porompat
refused to receive the injury report stating that there is no entry in the MNC Register of JNIMS
Hospital, Porompat for medical treatment of Th. Pushparani Devi on 05.07.2022.
[11] But, later on, the complainant produced one, "to whom it may concern" certificate issued by
one, Dr. N. Dwijamani Singh, Senior Consultant Physician of Advance Speciality Hospital and
Research Institute dated 11.07.2022. It is to mention herein that the incident of the alleged assault
was occurred on 03.07.2022 and as per the JNIMS Hospital out patient treatment record, the
complainant went to the JNIMS Hospital for treatment on 05.07.2022 and "to whom it may
concern" certificate issued by Dr. N. Dwijamani Singh was dated 11.07.2022.
[12] Considering these facts as meted out herein above, this Court is of the view that the injury, if at
all, is inflicted due to the assault made to the complainant by the accused. The nature of injury was
not a grievous one and on top of that, the incident occurred on 03.07.2022 and now it is February,
2024 i.e. more than 1 (one) year has passed and till date, the I.O. of the case failed to place on record
the nature of injury of the complainant. Considering the nature of offence, the nature of the facts,
put out by both the present petitioners as well as the complainant, seems to be civil in nature.
[13] In the case of Ram Das Vs State of West Bengal reported in AIR 1954 SC 711, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that:
"In the absence of any evidence as to any gesture made by the accused, the evidence
that he was staring with lustful eyes, had to be discarded as giving any indication to
his indication to his intention because such an impression is more psychological than
factual. In view of the fact, that a quarrel had preceded the push, and that the women
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120616984/ 4
Yumnam Shyam Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 16 February, 2024
were not alone but had male companions who had taken part in the quarrel, the
prosecution case as to the accused having attempted to outrage the women's modesty
had to be rejected, in the A.B. No. 38 of 2022 Page 5 absence of any clear and
unimpeachable evidence as to his intention to outrage their modesty, or as to his
knowledge that by his conduct he was likely to outrage their modesty."
[14] In view of the above provision of law assailed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, this Court does
not find any material for outraging the modesty of woman and mere assaulting which is purported
to be meted out to the complainant by the petitioners will not amount to outraging modesty of
woman.
[15] With the above discussion and findings, the interim bail is made absolute. The petitioners are
released on bail on their furnishing PR bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) each with surety of
like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Court with direction to the petitioners to appear
before the concerned District Court whenever required till the investigation is completed.
[16] Accordingly, the anticipatory bail is disposed of.
