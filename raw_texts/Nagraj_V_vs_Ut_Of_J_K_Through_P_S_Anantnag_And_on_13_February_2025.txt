Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 Official and is serving as a Major in Army and is posted in Khanabal area of
District Anantnag. It is also stated by petitioner that respondent No.2 approached petitioner
through his friend, who happens to be a Parliament Director, in the first week of August 2023 in
New Delhi and subsequently kept on insisting the petitioner to visit Kashmir as respondent no.2 was
posted in Anantnag. Petitioner came to Kashmir and since Amarnath Yatra was going on, he
performed Holy Amarnath Yatra. Respondent No. 2 informed petitioner that he enjoys good
standing in Anantnag District, in fact in the entire valley. Respondent No. 2 told petitioner that he
can help petitioner in investing in Pahalgam area, which is a tourist spot.
3. It is also assertion of petitioner that respondent no.2 in fact told him that he knew various
businessmen and land owners in Kashmir who would offer land to petitioner at reasonable rates
because of influence of respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 wanted petitioner to invest money here
and wanted to collaborate with petitioner for business purposes. Petitioner avoided to invest in the
Kashmir. Subsequently, respondent No.2 came to Chennai and wanted to invest in production house
of petitioner. Respondent No.2 was also time and again requesting petitioner for unreasonable
favours. After repeated requests and offers, the petitioner accepted the proposal of respondent No.2,
when Respondent No. 2 visited petitioner in Chennai around last week of October 2023.
4. It is also submission of petitioner that as per arrangement, respondent no.2 had to invest Rs.2.00
crores in the film production for which respondent No.2 was assured by petitioner that he would get
20% profit Page 2 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 from the earnings of film production. The money was being paid to the
artists including Mr. Samudra Kuni, who is a known actor/film star in the South Indian Film
Industry. Petitioner requested respondent No.2 for entering into a formal agreement with him but
Respondent No.2 refused the same citing the reason that he is a government official and cannot
officially do business as he will lose his job. Petitioner also states that he also did not press upon
signing of any agreement as respondent No.2 assured that there would be no problem from his end.
Respondent No.2 said that he would be wanting his share in the profits in cash to which the
petitioner did not agree. Subsequently, after initial investment of Rs.76.00 Lacs, respondent No.2
refused to invest further in film-production and was pestering petitioner for return of investment
made. Respondent No.2 visited petitioner in New Delhi at his rental accommodation in Defence
Colony. Respondent No.2 along with certain other people, whom petitioner did not know, forced
him to give blank cheques to him. Petitioner will be in a position to produce more details regarding
said transaction, once he is bailed out. In fact, during this period, one song was also produced and
directed by petitioner and the same is also available in Hindi version online on YouTube having
more than one million views. Petitioner thereafter assured respondent that petitioner would return
basic investment, i.e., Rs.76.00 Lacs minus the loss which petitioner had suffered due to acts of
respondent no.2, which irked respondent no.2, who was demanding crores of rupees from
petitioner. Respondent no.2 started misusing his official position and his status to coerce petitioner
to make payment to respondent no.2. Out of nowhere, on 26th April 2024, impugned FIR
No.77/7024 came Page 3 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 to be registered against petitioner on the complaint of respondent No.

2.
5. It is also contention of petitioner that he had good friendly relations with respondent No.2 until
starting of 2024, when respondent No.2 started blackmailing him and was asking for one favour or
the other keeping in view high reputation of petitioner in the society. Impugned FIR has been
registered at the behest of respondent No.2, using influence which the said officer is enjoying in
District Anantnag of UT of J&K. In fact, contents of impugned FIR would reveal that how the police
agency has been manipulated to serve the motives of respondent No.2 and to extort money from
petitioner. The impugned FIR was registered against petitioner under Section 420 IPC, in which
respondent No.2 has mentioned contradictory facts and has shown himself as some kind of land
broker/agent in Kashmir Valley. Respondent No.2 in the said FIR has alleged that he met petitioner
during Amarnath Yatra and that respondent No.2 accompanied him in Amarnath Yatra and was also
showing different places to petitioner for investment in the Kashmir, particularly Pahalgam Area.
6. It is being also stated by petitioner that respondent No. 2 on one hand, in impugned FIR has
alleged that he paid petitioner Rs.12.00 Lacs as petitioner had to meet President of India and on the
other hand, has said that respondent No.2 went to Delhi to discuss some property related matter
with the petitioner in Delhi and respondent No.2 allegedly entered into some agreement with
petitioner relating to the sale of property in New Delhi, on account of which respondent No.2
allegedly paid a certain amount to father of petitioner, petitioner and some other Page 4 CrlM
Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 person, namely, Ranjeet. It has further been alleged in the complaint that
the total amount which was credited in three different accounts by respondent No.2 was Rs.1.06
crores and petitioner could not deliver the property. It has been further alleged that petitioner tried
to repay respondent No.2 by issuing the cheque of Rs.1.00 Crore, which got bounced and then
issuing another cheque of Rs.2.00 crore (Rs.1.00 Crore as principal amount and Rs.1.00 Crore as
compensation), however, both cheques got bounced due to insufficient amount. In the
complaint/impugned FIR, it has been mentioned that petitioner paid Rs.5.25 Lacs to respondent
No.2 prior to registration of FIR, however for repaying the remaining amount, petitioner was asking
for time. Respondent No.2 has addressed this complaint to Shri G. V. Sundeep Chakarvarthy (IPS),
SSP Anantnag, J&K, and on his direction, SHO concerned registered impugned FIR. In impugned
FIR, respondent No.2 prays for recovery of money. Impugned FIR reveals that complaint has been
filed on 26th April 2024 before SSP concerned and impugned FIR has been registered on 26th April
2024, i.e., on the very same day without approaching SHO concerned. Petitioner was arrested on
9th May 2023 and the entire residence was searched without any search warrant. From 10th May
2024 to 16th May 2024, when petitioner was in custody of police, respondent no.2 while using his
influence and with the aid and assistance of police agencies, tortured petitioner and while
generating pressure upon him, made petitioner talk to his wife on phone viz WhatsApp of petitioner
and threatened the entire family of petitioner that petitioner would be booked in terrorist activity,
PSA would be slapped on him and petitioner would be killed by creating Page 5 CrlM
Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;

Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 fake documents and graphics against him as a terrorist. On 16 th May 2024,
petitioner was produced before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Anantnag, and remand was
presented before it, and remand was extended for further three days, but petitioner brought to the
knowledge of the court that torture being meted out to him in police custody at the behest of
complainant. On 24th May 2024, petitioner was again presented before the court, where petitioner
submitted that he was being physically and mentally tortured in police custody by giving electric
shocks to sensitive parts of the body of petitioner, applying burning and itching cream on skin and
by hitting petitioner on his chest. It was brought to the knowledge of the court that treatment was
being meted out to petitioner in police custody so as to pressurise him to transfer money into the
account of respondent no.2. Besides respondents forced him to sign blank stamp papers, green
papers and white papers while he was in police custody. Keeping in view the said treatment being
meted out to petitioner, the court ordered petitioner to be sent to judicial custody. Apart from the
above, respondent no.2 also used to talk to wife of petitioner via WhatsApp of petitioner in front of
petitioner, while petitioner was in police custody and also used to threaten petitioner, his wife and
his family to pay money to respondent no.2 or else the entire family would be arrested. The said calls
were made from two WhatsApp numbers of petitioner to the wife of petitioner and family from 10th
May 2024 to 16th May 2024, which phones are also in the police custody and respondent no.2 told
wife of petitioner that she too will be involved in alleged offence allegedly committed by petitioner.
Page 6 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024
7. Next submission of petitioner is that while pressure was being generated upon petitioner and his
family by respondent No.2 in league with respondent No.1, his father filed a bail application before
the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Anantnag, on 15th May 2024, which was listed on 16th May
2024 and police report was called and subsequently the matter was again listed several times.
Meanwhile, as the family of petitioner and his wife were being threatened constantly and
respondent No.2 was making constant demands to family of petitioner with the help of
respondent-police, the wife of petitioner transferred Rs.10.00 lacs through Bank RTGS to the
account of petitioner, whereafter Rs.4,99,900/- and Rs. 4,99,900/- were transferred immediately
from the account of the petitioner to the account of Respondent No.2 through online mode, while
petitioner was in police custody, by generating pressure upon him. Petitioner was forced to give
passwords to respondents for enabling the said payment. Thereafter, on 16th May 2024. again
Rs.4,99,900/- and Rs.50,000/- were transferred from the account of petitioner to the account of
respondent No.2 through online mode while petitioner was behind bars and both the phones of the
petitioner were also with respondent-police. On 17th May 2024, petitioner's father was also forced
to transfer Rs.14,50,000/- to the account of respondent No.2 through SBI Bank. The said amount
was being extorted from petitioner and his family by respondent No.2 in league with
respondent-police, while misusing his official position as respondent No.2 enjoys clout in UT of
J&K, particularly in Anantnag area. Fearing their arrest, wife of petitioner and his family members
also could not stay in UT of J&K. The matter was listed before CJM Page 7 CrlM Nos.1432/2024;
1433/2024;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 4
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 Anantnag on 15th, 16th, 28th and 29th May 2024, on 3rd, 5th, and 6th June
2024. Respondent no.2 on all dates used to remain present before the court. Police report was called
and prosecution also filed its objections.
8. It is being also submitted by petitioner that police report reveals that how respondent no.2 has
been unduly influencing respondent-police and Investigating Officer, and has been generating
pressure upon police for making out a case when there is none. According to petitioner, basic FIR,
which was registered against petitioner, was under Section 420 IPC; however, offences, like offence
under Section 487 IPC are not made out at all from the contents of impugned FIR, police report or
objections filed by respondent have also been added just to ensure that petitioner is not released on
bail.
9. Further contention of petitioner is that when matter was heard by CJM, Anantnag, on 3rd June
2024, the matter was posted for arguments on 5th June 2024, on which date matter was argued
through virtual mode and matter was posted for further arguments on 6th June 2024. However, on
said date, it came to knowledge of petitioner that CJM, Anantnag, recused from hearing the matter
and the matter was transferred to the court of Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (Munsiff), Anantnag,
which Court rejected the bail application vide order dated 12th June 2024. Thereafter, petitioner
filed an application for grant of bail before this Court, being Bail App. No.571/2024, which was
disposed of vide order dated 26th July 2024, with a direction to SSP concerned to supervise and
monitor investigation himself to ensure fair investigation. The IO was also reminded to not act as a
recovery agent Page 8 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 of complainant. The bail was not granted to petitioner by this Court as
respondent no.1 undertook to file charge sheet within ten days and also respondent claimed to have
recovered some allegedly forged document, the details whereof are even given in the order dated
26th July 2024. This Court granted liberty to petitioner to approach Trial Court after filing of
charge-sheet by respondent no.1 as investigation against petitioner would be completed by then.
Thereafter, respondent No.1 filed impugned chargesheet before CJM, Anantnag, (Trial Court) under
Sections 424, 120B, 467, 468, 471 and 419 IPC against petitioner. He filed another bail application
before Trial Court on 7th August 2024 in terms of the liberty granted to petitioner by this Court,
which was dismissed by the Trial Court vide order dated 3rd October 2024 on the count that
subsequent bail application filed by petitioner is not maintainable.
10.It is further assertion of petitioner that the bail application was filed in view of liberty granted by
this Court and the change in circumstances. However, Trial Court despite the said liberty has held
successive bail application not maintainable stating that mere filing of charge sheet is not change in
circumstance to file successive bail application. The Trial Court has even observed in para 18 of the
order dated 3rd October 2024 that counsel for applicant emphasized that accused is returning the
money to complainant by making payments at different intervals through his wife. As such cannot
be said to have cheated accused. However, the fact of the matter is that said submission was never
made before the Trial Court. In fact, in bail application which had been filed before Trial Court, it
has been specifically pleaded that respondent no.2 Page 9 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 5
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 has extorted money from petitioner by generating pressure upon petitioner
while he continues to languish in custody. Even the mode and manner in which the money was
extorted has been stated in the bail application along with the proof thereof, however, the Trial
Court has given above observation contrary to the record for the reasons best known to it. Not only
that, none of the submissions raised in the application have been considered while dismissing the
application filed by petitioner for grant of bail. The Trial Court has not even considered that this
Court has granted bail to co-accused in the matter vide order dated 6th September 2024 nor has the
Trial Court considered the fact that alleged forged sale deed does not form part of impugned charge
sheet, as such, petitioner has lost faith in the courts at Anantnag District.
11.Response/status report has been filed by respondent no.1. It is insisted that complainant
presented an application before SSP, Anantnag, against one person namely, Nagraj V., who had
fraudulently grabbed Rs.1.00 crore and Rs.6.00 Lacs from complainant on the name of fake
property. SSP, Anantnag forwarded complaint to police station Anantnag. Upon receipt of
complaint, FIR no.77/2024 was registered. Investigation was set into motion. During investigation,
IO recorded complainant's statement on 27th April 2024, which detailed the nature of fraud and
interactions with accused. Subsequent to this, police sought and received call details records (CDRs)
and bank transaction details from SBI, ICICI and Axis Bank, revealing multiple transaction totaling
Rs.1.00 crore and Rs.6.00 Lakhs to the accounts of Nagraj V. and his associates. Specifically,
Rs.44.00Lacs was transferred to petitioner; Rs.32.00 Lacs to his father, K. Vishnu Sagar, and
Rs.30.00 Page 10 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 Lacs to associate Ranjeet Surya Ganeshan, indicating a coordinate effort to
defraud complainant. It is also contention of respondent no.1 that on 9th May 2024, a movement
order was issued to apprehend petitioner in Delhi. A police team, comprising of I.O. and Head
Constables, successfully arrested petitioner/accused at his residence, D- 132, Defence Colony, New
Delhi, where they also recovered electronic devices and documents relevant to investigation.
Following his arrest, petitioner was presented before CJM, Anantnag, on 10 th May 2024, where a
remand for seven days was granted for further investigation. During course of investigation, it
became apparent that petitioner employed various fraudulent identities, possessing multiple Aadhar
cards and a passport with differing addresses, raising concerned regarding his identity and intent to
commit fraud.
12.Respondent no.1 also avers that involvement of co-accused, including K. Vishnu Sagar, who
received Rs.32.00 Lacs and Shweeta B, who actively assisted petitioner in orchestrating the fraud by
facilitating communications with complainant. Rajeev Surya Ganeshan, another key associate
received Rs.30.00 Lacs, solidifying their roles in the criminal enterprise. Evidence suggests that
petitioner operated within an organized crime syndicate, frequently changing residences to avoid
detection and defraud unsuspecting victims, with records indicating similar offences committed in
Tamil Nadu. On 18th May 2024, a request was forwarded to UIDAI for verification of Aadhar
numbers associate with petitioner due to discrepancies in address details. Additionally,
correspondence initiated with Sub Registrar Office, Lajpat Nagar, to verify authenticity of a sale
deed recovered during search operation on Page 11 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 6
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 15th June 2024, the Court issued a search warrant for D-132, Defence
Colony, New Delhi. The execution of this search on 10th July 2024 was conducted under the
supervision of local Executive Magistrate, resulting in recovery of documents that further
substantiated fraudulent activities. Throughout investigation, it became clear that petitioner lacks a
permanent address and continuously alters his identity, utilizing various addresses in government
issued documents to facilitate his crimes. As a result of amassed evidence, a charge sheet has been
prepared against petitioner and his associates under Section 420, 467, 468, 471, 419, and 120-B IPC,
detailing their involvement in fraudulent scheme and same has been produced before the competent
court of law.
13.Objections have also been filed by respondent no.2, in which he would contend that
petitioner/accused is involved in commission of serious offences of forgery, cheating and fraud in
conspiracy with his other aides particularly his father and his wife. Accused/petitioner has duped
complainant and his wife of their hard-earned money amounting to Rs 1.06 crore which they had
raised on loan from financial agencies/banks and has made the complainant and his wife to deliver
an amount of Rs.1.06 crores from time to time with dishonest and fraudulent intentions. ln order to
give effect to his dishonest intentions he, besides deceiving the complainant and making him to
deliver money to him has also forged the documents to ensure that his correct address is not
disclosed to anyone including the complainant. From the facts and circumstances of the case and
from contents of FIR it will be abundantly clear that petitioner had dishonest and fraudulent
intentions to cheat and deceive the complainant from the very inception and for Page 12 CrlM
Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 giving effect to his notorious designs he has also committed forgery of
valuable security. The accused is a habitual criminal and has a number of cases/FlRs of similar
nature pending against him at various places in the country. Petitioner has been fleeing from wings
of justice. He has been throwing dust in the eyes of law, enforcing agencies and has never been
cooperating with the investigating agencies or the Courts of law and has been absenting himself
from trial of the cases. He is wanted in various cases of similar nature and non-bailable warrants are
pending against him, so much so the High Court of Madras cancelled his bail in one of such cases.
The petitioner has been changing his addresses every now and then and giving wrong addresses and
it becomes difficult for the courts trying the offences against him, to procure his appearance. Even
the warrants of arrest issued by different courts are not being executed against accused/petitioner
for the reason that he has been changing his places of residence from time to time. According to
respondent no.2, the High Court of Madras while dealing with one of such cases against petitioner
has observed that considering the facts and circumstances of the case and also considering that
there are eight previous cases pending against petitioner herein and he did not comply with the
conditions imposed by the Sessions's court, this Court is inclined to cancel the bail granted to
petitioner.
14.It is also stated by respondent no.2 that petitioner is also guilty of offence of forgery under
section 467 IPC as he has forged valuable securities including Forged registry of D-132 Defence
colony New Delhi which he promised to sell to the complainant, Adhaar Cards, Passports and
Election Voter Card with the intention to cheat and Page 13 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 7
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 defraud the innocent victims. The petitioner has no permanent address and
has not still revealed his real address either before this Court or before investigating agencies. The
address given by accused in present application is also wrong and incorrect as the tenancy in respect
of the premises has since been terminated. Petitioner/accused has, thus, mislead this Court by
providing a fake address. Earlier when petitioner was living in a rented accommodation in Chennai,
he tried to sell out the said property by projecting himself as real owner of the same, as such, owner
of house filed an eviction suit against him and an order of eviction from the premises was passed by
the court of Small Causes, Chennai, on 25th July 2019.
15.It is also averred by respondent no.2 that he seeks to place on record the documents, viz. the
cancellation of bail by the High Court of Madras; copy of eviction order passed by the court of Small
Causes, Chennai as also the notice of termination of tenancy pertaining to premises, namely, D-132,
Ground Floor, Defence Colony, New Delhi. Moreover, in a case of similar nature, petitioner sought
an anticipatory bail from the court of Sessions in Chennai in respect of offences under Section 406,
420 IPC, which was rejected by the court vide its order dated 23rd January 2021. In another case
covered under FIR no.268/2021 of cheating of Rs.92.00 Lacs, anticipatory bail was rejected by the
High Court of Madras vide order dated 25th November 2021.
16.It is further submission of respondent no.2, that as regards misleading information being
furnished by petitioner, giving incorrect and inconsistent addresses, petitioner has been showing
different addresses in different documents. In Aadhar Card, his address is shown as Flat Page 14
CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 no.7, 2nd Floor, River View Apartment no.2/10, Boat Club Road, 3rd
Avenue, Raja Annamalaipuram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. In his Election voter, petitioner has shown
his address as 163/321, Triplicane High Road, Triplicane, Chennai, 80005. In his passport,
petitioner has shown his address as no.7, Gf, Ranimeyammai Towers, NRC, R.A.Puram, Chennai,
6000028. This goes to show that accused / petitioner has no permanent address and has been
furnishing fake addresses so as to escape the clutches of law enforcing agencies and flee from the
wings of justice. He has never been cooperating with investigating agencies/law enforcing agencies
and has been absenting himself from the court proceedings pending against him in different courts
of India. Petitioner has a track record of abusing and jumping over concession of bail wherever
granted to him by courts of law. He is a notorious conman and in case bail is granted to petitioner,
he will not be available either to investigating agencies or to the Court to face the trial. FIR
no.78/2014 of P/S District Crime Branch, Kaniya Kumari is a testament to the fat that petitioner is
habitual of committing the crimes of like nature and has defrauded of committing the crimes of like
nature and has defrauded the victim in said FIR for Rs.53.00 Lacs. The said FIR is lodged against
him, his father and sister. Further accused in conspiracy with his father and sister has also
committed a fraud within jurisdiction of police station CCB, Chennai, in which he defrauded and
cheated victim and made him to deliver an amount of Rs.79.30 Lacs; regarding which FIR
no.395/2017 was lodged, which is pending against him before the court of Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, in which besides petitioner, his sister and father are also arrayed as
Page 15 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 8
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 accused persons. FIR no.268/2021 is also registered against petitioner and
his father and sister, for defrauding victim in said FIR for making him to deliver an amount of
Rs.92.00 Lacs. A non-bailable warrant of arrest is also pending against accused in the court of
Metropolitan Magistrate for exclusive trial of CCB cases and CBCID Metro cases which fortifies the
contention that there is every likelihood of accused absconding in case he is released on bail. The
petitioner by impersonating as a businessman has cheated number of people while adopting the
same modus operandi as is evident from various FIRs. He has projected himself as a co-producer of
a Movie "Banu Bali". In another case, petitioner has projected himself as grandson of the Governor.
The accused is a threat to the society and if he is set at large there is no possibility of accused turning
up again to face the trial after getting the bail as his real address has not still been ascertained.
Petitioner has been making headlines about his involvement in criminal cases in the print media
also, particularly in Chennai. According to respondent no.2, as many as five FIRs are registered
against petitioner and non-bailable warrants are pending against petitioner.
17.I have heard learned counsel for parties and considered the matter. I have gone the record on the
file.
18.Petitioner seeks quashment of charge-sheet and FIR in exercise of inherent powers under Section
482 Cr.P.C. read with Section 528 of BNSS, to quash impugned FIR and charge-sheet filed by
respondent no.1 before the competent court of law. The scope of Section 482 Cr.P.C. (which is pari
materia to Section 528 of BNSS) is well defined and inherent powers could be exercised by the High
Court to give effect Page 16 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 to an order under the Code/Sanhita, to prevent abuse of the process of the
court; and to otherwise secure the ends of justice. This extraordinary power is to be exercised ex
debito justitiae. However, in exercise of such powers, it is not permissible for the High Court to
appreciate the evidence as it can only evaluate the material documents on record to the extent of its
prima facie satisfaction about the existence of sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused
and the court cannot look into materials, acceptability of which is essentially a matter for the trial.
19.Law on exercise of powers by the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash FIR/complaint
and parameters for exercise of such powers and scope and ambit of the power by the High Court
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. are required to be referred to as the very parameters which are required
to be applied while quashing FIR will also be applicable while granting interim stay/protection. The
Supreme Court in the case of R. P. Kapur v. State of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 866, while dealing with
inherent powers of the High Court under Section 561-A of the earlier Code (which is pari materia
with Section 482 Cr.P.C.), observed and held that inherent powers of the High Court cannot be
exercised in regard to the matters specifically covered by other provisions of the Code; the inherent
jurisdiction of the High Court can be exercised to quash proceedings in a proper case either to
prevent the abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice; ordinarily
criminal proceedings instituted against an accused person must be tried under the provisions of the
Code, and the High Court would be reluctant to interfere with the said proceedings at an
interlocutory stage. After observing this, thereafter the Supreme Court Page 17 CrlM
Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;

Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 then carved out some exceptions to the above-stated rule, which are as
under:
"(i) Where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or
continuance of the criminal proceeding in respect of the offence alleged. Absence of
the requisite sanction may, for instance, furnish cases under this category.
(ii) Where the allegations in the first information report or the complaint, even if they
are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the
offence alleged; in such cases no question of appreciating evidence arises; it is a
matter merely of looking at the complaint or the first information report to decide
whether the offence alleged is disclosed or not.
(iii) Where the allegations made against the accused person do constitute an offence
alleged but there is either no legal evidence adduced in support of the case or the
evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge. In dealing with this
class of cases it is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case where
there is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is manifestly and clearly
inconsistent with the accusation made and cases where there is legal evidence which
on its appreciation may or may not support the accusation in question. In exercising
its jurisdiction under Section 561-A the High Court would not embark upon an
enquiry as to whether the evidence in question is reliable or not. That is the function
of the trial Magistrate, and ordinarily it would not be open to any party to invoke the
High Court's inherent jurisdiction and contend that on a reasonable appreciation of
the evidence the accusation made against the accused would not be sustained."
20. The Supreme Court has observed and held that inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. do
not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or caprice; that
statutory power has to be exercised sparingly with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. In
the case of Kurukshetra University v. State of Haryana (1977) 4 SCC 451, the High Court had
quashed FIR filed by Kurukshetra University in exercise of inherent powers under Section 482
Cr.P.C. The Supreme Court noticed and observed that the High Court was not justified in quashing
FIR when police had not even commenced investigation into complaint filed by University and no
proceedings were at all pending before any Court in pursuance of the FIR.
Page 18 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024
21.The Supreme Court in the celebrated case of State of Haryana and others v. Bhajan Lal and
others, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 , has elaborately considered the scope and ambit of Section 482
Cr.P.C. and Article 226 of the Constitution of India in the background of quashing the proceedings
in the criminal investigation. After noticing the various earlier pronouncements, the Supreme Court
made certain categories of cases by way of the illustration, where the power under Section 482
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 10
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
Cr.P.C. can be exercised to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court or secure ends of justice.
Paragraph 102, which gives seven categories of cases where power can be exercised under Section
482 Cr. P.C. are reproduced as follows:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelized and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. (2) Where the
allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police
officers under 156 (1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the
purview of Section 155 (2) of the Code. (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations
made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do
not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155 (2) of the
Code.
Page 19 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and
inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that
there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where there is an express legal bar
engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is
a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance
of the aggrieved party. (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or
where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on
the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."
22. The Supreme Court in another case of State of Andhra Pradesh v. Golconda Linga Swamy,
reported in (2004) 6 SCC 522 , while dealing with inherent powers of the High Court under Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 11
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
482 Cr. P.C., has observed and held as under:
"5. Exercise of power under Section 482of the Code in a case of this nature is the
exception and not the rule. The Section does not confer any new powers on the High
Court. It only saves the inherent power which the Court possessed before the
enactment of the Code. It envisages three circumstances under which the inherent
jurisdiction may be exercised, namely, (i) to give effect to an order under the Code,
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and (iii) to otherwise secure the ends of
justice. It is neither possible nor desirable to lay down any inflexible rule which
would govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction. No legislative enactment dealing
with procedure can provide for all cases that may possibly arise. Courts, therefore,
have inherent powers apart from express provisions of law which are necessary for
proper discharge of functions and duties imposed upon them by law. That is the
doctrine which finds expression in the Section which merely recognizes and preserves
inherent powers of the High Courts. All courts, whether civil or criminal possess, in
the absence of any express provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such
powers as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of
administration of justice on the principle quando lex aliquid alique concedit,
conceditur et id sine quo res ipsa esse non potest (when the law gives a person
anything it gives him that without which it cannot exist). While exercising powers
under the Section, the Court does not function as a court of appeal or revision.
Inherent jurisdiction under the Section though wide has to be exercised sparingly,
carefully and with caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests
specifically laid down in the Section itself. It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do
real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone courts exist.
Authority of the court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to
abuse that authority so as to produce injustice, the court has power to prevent such
abuse. It would be an abuse of process of the court to allow any action which would
result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercises of the powers court
would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation or continuance of
it amounts to abuse of the Page 20 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 process of court or quashing of these proceedings would
otherwise serve the ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint,
the court may examine the question of fact. When a complaint is sought to be
quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the complainant
has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted
in toto.
xxxxxx
7. In dealing with the last category, it is important to bear in mind the distinction
between a case where there is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is
clearly inconsistent with the accusations made, and a case where there is legal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 12
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
evidence which, on appreciation, may or may not support the accusations. When
exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court would not
ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or not
or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation would not be sustained. That
is the function of the trial Judge. Judicial process no doubt should not be an
instrument of oppression, or, needless harassment. Court should be circumspect and
judicious in exercising discretion and should take all relevant facts and circumstances
into consideration before issuing process, lest it would be an instrument in the hands
of a private complainant to unleash vendetta to harass any person needlessly. At the
same time the Section is not an instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit
a prosecution and bring about its sudden death. The scope of exercise of power under
Section 482 of the Code and the categories of cases where the High Court may
exercise its power under it relating to cognizable offences to prevent abuse of process
of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice were set out in some detail by
this Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal (1992 Supp (1) SCC 335)......
xxxxxxx 8 As noted above, the powers possessed by the High Court under Section
482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great
caution in its exercise. Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this
power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should not be exercised to
stifle a legitimate prosecution. High Court being the highest Court of a State should
normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where the entire facts
are incomplete and hazy, more so when the evidence has not been collected and
produced before the Court and the issues involved, whether factual or legal, are of
magnitude and cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material.
Of course, no hard and fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in which the High
Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any
stage. (See : The Janata Dal etc. v. H.S. Chowdhary and others, etc. (AIR 1993 SC
892), Dr. Raghubir Saran v. State of Bihar and another (AIR 1964 SC 1)). It would not
be proper for the High Court to analyse the case of the complainant in the light of all
probabilities in order to determine whether a conviction would be sustainable and on
such premises, arrive at a conclusion that the proceedings are to be quashed. It would
be erroneous to assess the material before it and conclude that the complaint cannot
be proceeded with. In proceeding instituted on complaint, exercise of the inherent
powers to quash the proceedings is called for only in a case where the complaint does
not disclose any offence or is frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If the allegations set
out in the complaint do not constitute the offence of which cognizance has been taken
by the Magistrate, it is open to the High Court to quash the same in exercise of the
inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code. It is not, however, necessary that
there should be meticulous analysis of the case before the trial to find out whether the
case would end in conviction or acquittal. The complaint/F.I.R. has to be read as a
whole.
Page 21 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;

Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
2434/2024;2438/2024 If it appears that on consideration of the allegations in the
light of the statement made on oath of the complainant or disclosed in the F.I.R. that
the ingredients of the offence or offences are disclosed and there is no material to
show that the complaint/F.I.R. is mala fide, frivolous or vexatious, in that event there
would be no justification for interference by the High Court. When an information is
lodged at the police station and an offence is registered, then the mala fides of the
informant would be of secondary importance. It is the material collected during the
investigation and evidence led in Court which decides the fate of the accused person.
The allegations of mala fides against the informant are of no consequence and cannot
by itself be the basis for quashing the proceeding."
23. Even the Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Arun Gulab Gawali, (2010) 9 SCC
701, set-aside the order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, by which criminal
complaint/FIR was quashed on prayer made by complainant himself. While quashing and
setting-aside the order passed by the High Court, the Supreme Court in paras 13 and 27 to 29 has
observed and held as under:
"13. The power of quashing criminal proceedings has to be exercised very sparingly
and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases and the Court cannot
be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or
otherwise of allegations made in the F.I.R./Complaint, unless the allegations are so
patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach
such a conclusion. The extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer
an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act according to its whims or caprice.
However, the Court, under its inherent powers, can neither intervene at an uncalled
for stage nor it can `soft-pedal the course of justice' at a crucial stage of
investigation/ proceedings. The provisions of Articles 226, 227 of the Constitution of
India and Section 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter called as
'Cr.P.C.') are a device to advance justice and not to frustrate it. The power of judicial
review is discretionary, however, it must be exercised to prevent the miscarriage of
justice and for correcting some grave errors and to ensure that esteem of
administration of justice remains clean and pure. However, there are no limits of
power of the Court, but the more the power, the more due care and caution is to be
exercised in invoking these powers. (Vide State of W.B. v. Swapan Kumar Guha
[(1982) 1 SCC 561 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 283 : AIR 1982 SC 949] , Pepsi Foods Ltd. v.
Special Judicial Magistrate [(1998) 5 SCC 749 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 1400] , G. Sagar Suri

SCC 11 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 703] ) xxx xxxx xxxx Page 22 CrlM Nos.1432/2024;

Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
27. The High Court proceeded on the perception that as the complainant himself was
not supporting the complaint, he would not support the case of the prosecution and
there would be no chance of conviction, thus the trial itself would be a futile exercise.
Quashing of FIR/Complaint on such a ground cannot be held to be justified in law. Ordinarily, the
Court of Sessions is empowered to discharge an accused under Section 227 Cr.P.C. even before
initiating the trial. The accused can, therefore, move the Trial Court itself for such a relief and the
Trial Court would be in a better position to analyse and pass an order as it is possessed of all the
powers and the material to do so. It is, therefore, not necessary to invoke the jurisdiction under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. for the quashing of a prosecution in such a case. The reliance on affidavits by the
High Court would be a weak, hazy and unreliable source for adjudication on the fate of a trial. The
presumption that an accused would never be convicted on the material available is too risky a
proposition to be accepted readily, particularly in heinous offences like extortion.
28. A claim founded on a denial by the complainant even before the trial commences coupled with
an allegation that the police had compelled the lodging of a false FIR, is a matter which requires
further investigation as the charge is levelled against the police. If the prosecution is quashed, then
neither the Trial Court nor the Investigating Agency has any opportunity to go into this question,
which may require consideration. The State is the prosecutor and all prosecution is the social and
legal responsibility of the State. An offence committed is a crime against a society and not against a
victim alone. The victim under undue pressure or influence of the accused or under any threat or
compulsion may resile back but that would not absolve the State from bringing the accused to book,
who has committed an offence and has violated the law of the land.
29. Thus, while exercising such power the court has to act cautiously before proceeding to quash a
prosecution in respect of an offence which hits and affects the society at large. It should be a case
where no other view is possible nor any investigation or inquiry is further required. There cannot be
a general proposition of law, so as to fit in as a straitjacket formula for the exercise of such power.
Each case will have to be judged on its own merit and the facts warranting exercise of such power.
More so, it was not a case of civil nature where there could be a possibility of compromise or
involving an offence which may be compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C., where the Court could
apply the ratio of the case in Madhavrao Jiwaji Rao Scindia [(1988) 1 SCC 692 :
1988 SCC (Cri) 234 : AIR 1988 SC 709]."
24.As bare perusal of afore-quoted paragraphs of the ruling of the Supreme Court in
Arun Gulab Gawali (supra) would show that it was observed that the High Court in
the said case proceeded on the perception that since complainant therein had not
supported the complaint, he would Page 23 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 not support the case of prosecution and there would be no chance of
conviction, thus the trial itself would be a futile exercise. The Supreme Court held that quashing of
FIR/complaint on such a ground cannot be held to be justified in law. It was said by the Supreme
Court that ordinarily, the court of Sessions was empowered to discharge an accused under Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167970539/ 15
Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
227 Cr.P.C. even before initiating the trial. The accused could, therefore, move the Trial Court itself
for such a relief and the Trial Court would be in a better position to analyse and pass an order as it is
possessed of all the powers and the material to do so. It was, therefore, unnecessary to invoke
jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash a prosecution in such a case. The reliance on
affidavits by the High Court would be a weak, hazy and unreliable source for adjudication on the fate
of a trial and the presumption that an accused would never be convicted on the material available
was too risky. The Supreme Court further elaborated that a claim founded on a denial by
complainant even before trial commences coupled with an allegation that police had compelled
lodging of a false FIR, was a matter that required further investigation. If prosecution was quashed,
then neither Trial Court nor Investigating Agency had any opportunity to go into that question,
which might have required consideration. The State was the prosecutor and all prosecution was
social and legal responsibility of the State. The Supreme Court also went to say that an offence
committed is a crime against a society and not against a victim alone. The victim, under undue
pressure or influence of the accused or under any threat or compulsion, may resile back but that
would not absolve Page 24 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024 the State from bringing the accused to book, who has committed an offence
and has violated the law of the land.
25.Power of quashing criminal proceedings has to be exercised very sparingly and with
circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases. The Court cannot be justified in embarking
upon an enquiry about reliability or genuineness or otherwise of allegations made in the
F.I.R./Complaint, unless the allegations are so patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no
prudent person can ever reach such a conclusion.
26.The judicial conscience of the High Court should persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings
in exercise of the powers vested in it under Section 482 Cr.P.C., if answer to all the steps, as
enumerated herein after, is in affirmative, has been so said by the Supreme Court in Rajiv Thapar v
Madan Lal Kapoor, 2013 (3) SCC 330:-
"Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate the
following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashing, raised by an
accused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure:
i. Step one, whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable, and
indubitable, i.e., the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?
ii. Step two, whether the material relied upon by the accused, would rule out the
assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused, i.e., the material is
sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint, i.e.,
the material is such, as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn
the factual basis of the accusations as false.

Nagraj V vs Ut Of J&K Through P/S Anantnag And ... on 13 February, 2025
iii. Step three, whether the material relied upon by the accused, has not been refuted
by the prosecution/complainant; and/or the material is such, that it cannot be
justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant? iv. Step four, whether proceeding
with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court, and would not serve the
ends of justice?"
Page 25 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024
27.The Supreme Court in State of Telangana v. Habib Abdullah Jeelani, reported in 2017 (2) SCC
779, has held that the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. or under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India, to quash the FIR, is to be exercised in a very sparing manner as is not to be used to choke or
smother the prosecution that is legitimate. The inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary
jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or caprice. Such power has to be exercised
sparingly, with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. The inherent powers in a matter of
quashing FIR have to be exercised sparingly and with caution and only when such exercise is
justifying by the test specifically laid down in the provision itself. The power under Section 482
Cr.PC, is a very wide, but conferment of the wide power requires the Court to be more conscious. It
casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the Court.
28.It cannot be said that a complaint does not disclose commission of offence. Merely because
offence was committed during the course of a commercial transaction, would not be sufficient to
hold that the complaint does not warrant a trial. Whether or not allegations in complaint are true is
to be decided on the basis of evidence to be led at the trial in the complaint case. It certainly is not a
case in which criminal trial should be cut short inasmuch as quashing of complaint would result in
grave miscarriage of justice. The Supreme Court in Nagpur Steel & Alloys (P) Ltd v. P.
Radhakrishna, 1997 SCC (Cri) 1073 , after saying that restored the complaint and directed the
Magistrate to proceed with the complaint.
Page 26 CrlM Nos.1432/2024; 1433/2024;
2434/2024;2438/2024
29.The above settled position of law has also been reiterated by the Supreme Court in Priti Saraf &
anr v. State of NCT of Delhi & anr, (2021) 16 SCC 142, and it has been said that inherent power of
the High Court is an extraordinary power which has to be exercised with great care and
circumspection before embarking to scrutinize a complaint / FIR/ charge-sheet in deciding whether
the case is the rarest of rare cases, to scuttle the prosecution at its inception. It has also been held by
the Supreme Court whether allegations in the complaint are otherwise correct or not has to be
decided on the basis of evidence to be led during the course of trial.
30.Perusal of the instant petition and the contents contained therein require and demand full dress
trial and examination of facts by this Court as if this Court is in appeal and acting as an appellate

court and to draw its own conclusion vis-à-vis impugned FIR, complaint and proceedings emanating
therefrom including charge sheet presented before the court of competent jurisdiction. This is not
the aim and objective of the provisions of Section 482 Cr. P.C. (Section 528 of BNSS), particularly
when the petition on hand does not unveil any ground muchless cogent or material one, to indicate
that the inherent powers are to be exercised to prevent abuse of process of law and to secure the
ends of justice. The reference made by the learned counsel for the petitioner to the judgements are
distinct in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In that view of the matter, the impugned
FIR and charge sheet do not call for any interference and as a sequel thereof, petition in hand is
liable to be dismissed.

dismissed with connected CM(s). Interim direction, if any, shall stand vacated.
32.Needless to say that, petitioner shall be free to approach the Trial Court for grant of bail in
accordance with law.

proceeding in accordance with law.
