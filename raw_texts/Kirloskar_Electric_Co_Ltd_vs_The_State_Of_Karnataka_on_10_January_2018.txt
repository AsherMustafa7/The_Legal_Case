JUDGMENT
1. The present batch of writ petitions is being disposed of by a common judgment as they involve
common question of law.
2. The facts are illustratively taken from Writ Petition Nos.58917-928/2016 (M/s. Kirloskar Electric
Company Ltd. Vs. The State of Karnataka and another) and a reference is made to the Statement of
Objections filed by the Respondent State in Writ Petition Nos.26337-348/2017 (Micromatic
Grinding Technologies Ltd. Vs. The State of Karnataka and others).
3. Though the controversy in hand has been dealt with and the relevant provisions of Section 10(3)
of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, ("KVAT Act, 2003" for short) had come up for interpretation
before this Court Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters
Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
in some of the judgments rendered by this Court including the Division Benches, the controversy
does not appear to have died-down even with these judgments, as the Assessing Authorities of the
Respondent Department have continued to disallow the Input Tax Credit (ITC) under Section 10(3)
of the KVAT Act, 2003 on the ground that the claim of Input Tax Credit against the Output Tax
Liability of the assessees did not pertain to the same 'Tax period' for which Output Tax Liability and
Net Tax Liability was to be determined in accordance with Section 10(3) of the Act and assailing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56009484/ 57
Kirloskar Electric Co Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 10 January, 2018
these assessment/re-assessment orders, this batch of several writ petitions came to be filed before
this Court and after hearing both the sides, they are being disposed of by this common judgment.
4. The questions which arise are:
(i) Whether the claim of deduction or set off of Input Tax Credit against Output Date of Judgment
10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors.
Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
Tax Liability of the dealer can be restricted or denied on the ground of any time frame within which
such Sales Invoices on the basis of which ITC is claimed should pertain or information or record of
such ITC Invoices should be informed in the Returns to be filed, particularly if such time frame is
restricted to the period of 'Tax Period' which can be as short as a month or a quarter, or the period of
filing of Returns being 20 days from the end of month concerned or maximum six months from the
end of 'Tax period' even for filing of Revised Returns disclosing errors and omissions?
(ii) What is the true meaning and purport of Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003 vis-à-vis Section
35 of the same Act, 2003?
Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar
Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
5. The KVAT Act, 2003, in supersession of the earlier Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957 was brought
into force with effect from 01/04/2005 introducing the concept of Value Added Tax (VAT) to
replace the erstwhile Single Point Sales Tax System by levy of Multiple Point Taxation on the sale of
goods and to remove the cascading effect of the levy of sales tax at every point of sales, the concept
of giving Input Tax Credit (ITC) was introduced in the VAT law enacted by various States including
the State of Karnataka where under, against the Output Tax Liability in the hands of the assessee
purchaser, the credit or deduction of input tax of the tax paid by his selling Dealer could be claimed
as a deduction against his own Out put Tax Liability and only net of such tax liability was required to
be paid by him and this is how ultimately removing the cascading effect of the tax of such Multiple
Point Tax System under the VAT law, the ultimate consumer got the goods only with the net tax
liability at the hands of Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected
Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
the last seller in the chain of sales on the basis of value or sale price of such goods which he charges
from the customers.
6. The controversy in the present impugned assessment/re-assessment orders arose because of a
rather narrow and distorted interpretation of Section 10(3) put by the Authorities of the Respondent
- Commercial Taxes Department. The provisions of Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003 which was
amended in the year 2015 and again in the year 2016 as it stood prior and after these two
amendments is quoted below for ready reference.

10. The petitioner, M/s. Kirloskar Electric Company Limited engaged in the manufacture and sale of
Electrical Motors, Generators, Transformers, etc. purchased materials such as Steel, Copper,
Bearings and Consumables and other goods required from the local Registered Dealers as well as the

defined under Section 2(33) of the KVAT Act, 2003 as defined under Rule 37 of the Karnataka Value
Added Tax Rules, 2005, which in the case of present petitioners meant each calendar month as a
separate tax period.
Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar
Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
11. The Respondent Assessing Authority denied the Input Tax Credit (ITC) on the ground that the
ITC is deductible only in that 'Tax Period' during which the invoices of the selling Dealer is raised
and the accumulated VAT ITC available in the various months preceding the 'Tax Period' in
question, could not be used/given by way of Input Tax Credit against the Output Tax (OPT) for the
'Tax period' of a particular month.
12. The words "in that period" as employed in Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003, quoted above
has been thus interpreted by the Assessing Authority to mean that the concerned ITC invoices
should be of that very month or the 'Tax period'. The Respondent Assessing Authority has wholly
relied upon the observations of the Division Bench of this Court in the judgment rendered in the
case of State of Karnataka Vs. Centum Industries Private Limited, Bangalore Date of Judgment

and Penalty raised against the petitioners, the petitioners assessees directly filed these writ petitions
before this Court by-passing the remedy by way of a Regular Appeal under the provisions of Section
62 of the KVAT Act, 2003 against such orders.

16. Before coming to the arguments raised on behalf of the learned counsels for the Respondent
State, the contentions raised by the learned Senior Counsel, Mr.K.P. Kumar, on behalf of the
petitioners - assessees leading the arguments on behalf of the learned counsels for the petitioners
assessees may be noted as hereunder:-
17. Mr. K.P. Kumar, learned Senior Counsel urged that the claim of the Input Tax Credit cannot be
restricted and denied to the petitioners assessees merely on the ground that the Sale Invoice on the
basis of which ITC was claimed pertained to a month or a period prior to 'Tax Period' in question,
since Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003 prior to its amendment with effect from 01/04/2015 did
not provide any time limit within which the claim of deduction of such ITC has to be made against
the OPT of the particular 'Tax Period' in which such goods are sold and the Tax Periods and Date of
Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co.
Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
assessment period involved in all the present Writ Petitions are admittedly prior to 01/04/2015.
17.1. He submitted that the petitioner - Dealer records the purchases in question in his Books of
Accounts maintained in regular course of business as is mandated by Section 31 of the KVAT Act,
2003 itself on the date when the goods are delivered to the purchaser and upon verification are
found to be in order, in accordance with the Purchaser Order and are not liable to be returned to the
Selling Dealer and once the purchase is so recorded in the Accounts to be maintained in the ordinary
course of business, the ITC can be claimed as deduction against the Output Tax of any next 'Tax
period' for which such Output Tax and the same cannot be denied by the Assessing Authority.
17.2. Mr. Kumar also urged before the Court that the decision of the Division Bench in the case of
Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar
Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
Centum Industries Private Limited (supra) has not restricted the claim of ITC by saying that if the
ITC invoices did not pertain to that very 'Tax period', but on the facts of that case, where the Sale
Invoice pertained to the month of June 2006, but no ITC was claimed in the next month of July
2006, but was claimed only in the month of next February 2007, much after the lapse of the period
of six months, which is the outer limit for filing of even the Revised Returns under Section 35 of the
KVAT Act, 2003, the disallowance of such ITC made by the Department was upheld by the Division
Bench of this Court on the ground of delay in making such claim of ITC. But, he submitted that no
such facts exist in the present cases.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56009484/ 63
Kirloskar Electric Co Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 10 January, 2018
17.3. He urged that in the absence of any specific statutory time limit in Section 10 (3) of the KVAT
Act,2003, no such restriction for claiming the ITC in the next month itself could have been placed by
the Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar
Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
Respondent Department. He submitted that as soon as the purchases were duly recorded in the
Books of Accounts maintained by the petitioners Dealers as per the provisions of the KVAT Act,
2003, the information of ITC was duly given and claimed in the Returns filed under Section 35 of
the KVAT Act, 2003.
17.4. Mr. Kumar further submitted that ITC is nothing but CENVAT Credit under Excise law or ITC
on the basis of a valid Sale Invoice which goes to the pool of credit of tax, which can be claimed as
"deduction or set off against the Output Tax Liability of the Dealer upon the sales made by it during
a particular tax period irrespective of any time limit and there is no requirement of goods-to-goods
matching of ITC claim against OPT liability on sales of particular goods and that tax already having
been deposited by the Selling Dealers with the State, in discharge of their obligations under the law,
the same cannot be forfeited by the Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and
Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
State in violation of Article 265 of the Constitution of India, by disallowing such credit of the ITC in
the hands of the present Purchasing Dealers against their OPT liability. In other words, he
submitted that such disallowance of ITC would run absolutely contrary to the very concept of
removing the cascading effect of tax on the multiple points of Sales under VAT law and neither any
such statutory limitation could have been put nor it has been put in Section 10 (3) of the KVAT Act,
2003 and therefore such a restrictive interpretation cannot be put by the Respondent Assessing
Authorities and the impugned orders are in contravention of the said clear provisions of the KVAT
Act, 2003 and therefore deserve to be quashed and set aside by this Court.
17.5. Mr. Kumar relied upon the following decisions of this Court, a brief mention of which can be
made hereunder immediately:-
Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters

2005, July 2005, December 2005 and February 2006 paying tax at 4% under the
KVAT Act 2003 as claimed by the supplier, but subsequently, the supplier charged a
higher rate of tax at 12.5% and raising a Debit Note on 31/07/2006 which the
assessee paid as the differential tax amount to Selling Dealer and claimed the Tax
Rebate of that amount of differential Tax in the VAT Returns filed for the month of
December 2006, and the Division Bench of this Court allowed the said claim of the

Tax. The delay in putting forth the claims of Date of Judgment 10-01-2018

Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
such Rebate did not in any way affect his right to claim the said amount which was ultimately due to
him under the KVAT Act, 2003, nor it amounts to a contravention resulting in liability to pay tax,
interest and penalty, as was sought to be levied by the Assessing Authorities and the entire approach
of the Assessing Authorities and the first Appellate Authority was contrary to law and run counter to
the spirit of the KVAT Act, 2003.
(b) A similar view was expressed subsequently by another Division Bench of this Court later, in the
case of State of Karnataka Vs. Manyata Promotors Pvt. Ltd. decided on 30/09/2015 ( 2017 ) 97 VST
479 ( Kar ) and it was held by the Division Bench of this Court that under Section 10 (4) of the KVAT
Act, 2003, the Input Tax Credit can be claimed only when the Input Invoice is with the Registered
Dealer and nowhere in the KVAT Act, 2003, it has been specified that the Input Tax Credit (ITC)
should be claimed in the month Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and
Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
in which the date of invoice by the Supplier or Vendor falls or that the Purchasing Dealer has to
claim the Input Tax Credit in the same period in which the Bills have been raised by the Selling
Dealer.
The said ratio of the Division Bench judgment in fact clinches the issue in favour of the assessee
petitioners in the present cases as well.
The relevant portion from paragraph 11 of the said judgment in Manyata's case (supra) is quoted
below for ready reference.
"......Under section 10(4) of the Act, the input- tax credit can be claimed only when
the input invoice is with the registered dealer. Nowhere in the Act has it been stated
that the input-tax credit should be claimed in the month in which the date of the
invoice of the supplier/vendor falls Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. &
Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
or the purchasing dealer has to claim input-tax credit in the same period in which the
bills have been raised by the selling dealers. A reading of section 35 makes it very
clear that there is no requirement for the purchasing dealers to claim input-tax credit
in the same month in which the date of the invoice of the supplier or vendor falls.
Section 35(1) makes it clear that every registered dealer shall furnish the return in
such form and manner, and shall pay the tax due ( clearly the Net Tax = OPT

- ITC ) on such return within 20 days or 15 days after the end of preceding month.
Nowhere in the said section has it been contemplated that the purchasing dealer shall
claim input tax in the same month. Section 35(4) contemplates that any dealer
having furnished the return discovers any omission or incorrect statement therein, he
may furnish the revised return at any time within a period of six months from the end
of relevant tax period. The case on hand does not fall under section 35(4) of the
KVAT Act."

(c) In yet another judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Sonal
Apparel Private Limited Vs. State of Karnataka and another ( 2017 ) 97 VST 488 ( Kar ) decided on
29/03/2016, in a very lucid manner and even explaining and distinguishing the Division Bench
judgment in the case of Centum Industries Private Limited (supra), which is the sheet anchor of the
argument of the State before this Court even now, the learned Single Judge noted the contention of
the Revenue that, "if for any reason, Input Tax Credit could not be availed of in the month in which
purchase invoice was raised, the Dealer could have filed a Revised Return within a period of six
months under the provisions of Section 35 (4) with reference to the month in which the Seller's
invoice was raised" and this is precisely the contention raised before this Court even now, but
negativing the said contention, the learned Single Judge held in paragraph 20 that, Date of
Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co.
Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
"This contention is wholly impermissible, impracticable and opposed to all canons of business
accounting and commercial practices. Virtually every Dealer is liable to a Tax Audit and revising a
Return for the month in which the seller raises his invoice would be incompatible with the Dealer's
Accounts, as the purchases are accounted for in a later month. Any such action by the Dealers would
result in the rejection of the Dealer's Books of Accounts leading to best judgment assessments being
passed besides severe penal action." Upholding the claim of the Input Tax Credit of the assessees
and discussing the Scheme of the KVAT Act, 2003 and the provisions of Section 10(3) of the KVAT
Act, 2003, while distinguishing the observations of the Division Bench in the case of Centum
Industries Private Limited (supra), the learned Single Judge further held as under:-
Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters
Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
" 35. The Scheme of the KVAT Act being to provide for set off of all tax paid at the
earliest points of purchase against the tax payable by him on his sales, by compelling
a dealer to avail of credit of tax paid on purchases only in the month in which the
selling dealer raises invoices, the Scheme would be defeated and it may result in
double taxation.

Kirloskar Electric Co Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 10 January, 2018
36. Under the provisions of the erstwhile Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, tax was
leviable only at the stage of first sale of goods.
37. Under the KVAT Act, tax is leviable on every sale of goods, irrespective of whether
it is the first, second or third sale. However, in order to ensure that the Act does not
fall foul of the prohibition placed by the Constitution of India on double taxation, the
provisions of the Act permit a dealer to deduct the amount of tax paid by him on his
purchases while calculating his net tax liability. If the interpretation afforded by the
Revenue to the meaning of section 10(3) were to be Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. &
Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
accepted, the petitioners would be deprived of the benefit of availing credit of tax
paid on their purchases, it would result in tax being levied under the provisions of the
same Act on the same commodity at multiple stages.
38. In Centum Industries case [2015] 77 VST 117 (Karn); [2014] 80 KLJ 65, this
Court has interpreted section 10(3) to mean that a dealer is required to avail of credit
of input tax in the month in which the "input tax"
is paid by the purchasing dealer. The said decision does not however, support the proposition that
input tax must be availed of in the month in which the selling dealer raises his invoices. The
Revenue is hence not justified in seeking to apply the said decision in support of its reasoning."
Again repelling the contention of the Revenue based on the requirement of filing Revised Returns to
claim the Input Tax Credit for the tax period to which Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State
of Karnataka & Ors.
ITC invoice or Sale Invoice pertains, the learned Single Judge negatived the said construction by
holding that the same would amount to an absurd construction. To quote again, the learned Single
Judge held as follows:
" 40. A contention on behalf of the Revenue that a dealer is permitted to avail of
credit belatedly up to six months by revising the return under section 35(4) of the
KVAT Act, apparently drawing inspiration from the decision in Centum Industries
case [2015] 77 VST 117(Karn.); [2014] 80 KLJ 65, is not relevant. It would not be
possible to hold that section 10(3) first restricts availment of credit to the same
month as the month of purchase and then section 35(4) goes on to permit the same
by way of revision of return would be an absurd construction. Such an interpretation
would lead to the conclusion that the KVAT Act encourages availment of credit by the
dealer without ensuring the eligibility for the same, as delay in availment would
result in denial of Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and
Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka &

Ors.
credit altogether and thereafter rectifying any incorrect credit available by revising
the return. Such a view could not have been the intention of the Legislature as that
would lead to a situation where filing of a revised return under section 35(4) would
become a rule, rather than an exception. In other words, every dealer may be
necessarily required to file two returns for the same tax period, firstly an original
return reflecting incorrect credit and then a revised return availing the eligible credit.
A case can be found in favour of the petitioners in the alternative as well. In that, it is
not in dispute that from the inception of the KVAT Act, section 10(3) was consistently
interpreted by the Revenue to mean that a dealer is permitted to deduct the input tax
paid on his purchases irrespective of the month in which the purchases were effected.
Based on the understanding that section 10(3) did not require dealers to avail credit
only in the month in which the purchases were effected.
Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters
Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
They were held entitled to avail of such credit, as long as the claim of input-tax credit
was supported by the prescribed documents. The ambiguity as to the purport of
section 10(3) arose as a result of the Department's clouded interpretation of the
Centum Industries case [ 2015 ] 77 VST 117 ( Karn. ); [ 2014 ] 80 KLJ 65. The newly
substituted provision clears the air and puts to rest the ambiguity, it may hence be
said that the amendment to section 10(3) is clarificatory and therefore could be given
retrospective effect."
Against the said judgment of the learned Single Judge with which reasoning, this Court respectfully
agrees and endorses the said view, the Revenue is said to have preferred an intra-Court Appeal
namely, Writ Appeal No.3176/2016 which has been admitted by the Division Bench of this Court on
20/06/2017. However both the learned counsels fairly submitted that the prayer of the State for stay
of the operation of the Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected
Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
judgment of the learned Single Judge was not accepted by the Division Bench of this Court and no
interim order was granted, even after lengthy arguments made at the Bar.
Thus, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, Mr. Kumar submitted before the Court that the
impugned assessment/re-assessment orders passed in this batch of writ petitions to the extent they
take a restrictive interpretation of Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003 and deny the claim of the
Input Tax Credit merely on the ground that the ITC invoice did not pertain to that very 'Tax Period'
or the calendar month or that ITC was not claimed immediately in the Returns filed, even though in
that 'Tax Period', the purchases concerned were not even recorded in their Books of Accounts,
deserves to be quashed and set aside and for other points or issues in the said orders, the matter

passing of the fresh assessment orders in accordance with law.
18. On the other hand, the learned Additional Advocate General, Mr. A.S. Ponnanna and the learned
Additional Government Advocate, Mr. T.K. Veda Murthy, appearing for the Respondent State and
Commercial Taxes Department were at pains to support the impugned assessment orders passed by
the various Assessing Authorities solely relying upon the observations of the Division Bench of this
Court in the case of Centum Industries Private Limited (supra) headed by Hon'ble Justice N. Kumar
himself, in which taking a bit deviating route from the clear view earlier expressed by his lordships
in the case of K. Bond Polymers Private Limited (supra), in the peculiar facts of the case of Centum
Industries Private Limited (supra) before it, held that where the assessee paid the input tax for the
month of June 2006 but in the Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and
Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
Returns filed in July 2006, he did not put forth any ITC claim nor did he file any revised returns
within six months putting forth the said ITC claim and the period of six months prescribed under
Section 35(4) of the KVAT Act, 2003 had lapsed but such claim was made only in the next February
2007, after the expiry of the said period of six months, the Appellate Tribunal had wrongly allowed
the said ITC claim and while allowing the Revision Petition filed by the State, against the order of
the Tribunal in favour of the assessee and quoting the observations of the Appellate Tribunal in
para.14 of the judgment, the Division Bench observed in Centum's case as under:-
"14. In the instant case, the assessee paid input tax for the month of June 2006. In
the returns filed in July 2006 he did not put forth any claim. He also did not file any
revised return within 6 months putting forth the said claim. [ Thus Dealer did not
claim Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected
Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
ITC though purchases recorded in the Books for six months against his OPT ( Output
Tax ) Liability rendering his claim purportedly Stale or time barred ] That is the
period prescribed under law under Section 35(1) and 35(4) of the Act. It is only in the
return filed in the month of February 2007, after the expiry of the aforesaid period,
he put for the said claim. Therefore, the Assessing Authority as well as the First
Appellate Authority rightly held that the claim for input tax rebate put forth for the
first time in February 2007 for the period of June 2006 cannot be allowed. However,
the Tribunal without reference to the statutory provisions proceeds on the
assumption that allowing input tax is a statutory promise made to the dealer buying
the goods from the registered dealer by paying that tax mentioned in the tax invoice.
There is nothing in law stipulating that if input tax is not claimed during the month
succeeding the month in which purchase is effected, the dealer would forfeit his claim
to claim input tax. [ From the Date of Judgment 10-01-2018

words "allowing input tax is a statutory promise.....dealer would forfeit his claim to
claim input tax" are the observations of the Tribunal quoted by the Division Bench,
though not put the inverted commas, but then just following words... "On coming to
the said conclusion, the Tribunal has not applied its mind"...makes it clear and has
been verified by this Court as well from the order of the Tribunal ] In coming to the
said conclusion, the Tribunal has not applied its mind to sub-section(3) of Section 10
which is the provision which determines the net tax payable by a registered dealer in
respect of each tax period in arriving at tax liability the amount of output tax payable
by the assessee in that period less the input tax deductible by him as may be
prescribed in that period and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the
Act. If the assessee is not putting forth a claim for input tax deduction in the return
filed in July 2006 nor as he put forth such a claim in a revised claim which he could
have filed within 6 months there from Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. &
Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
his right to claim input deduction is lost. He cannot for the first time in the returns
filed in February 2007 put forth a claim for input tax deduction as the said return was
not related to the tax period during which the input tax was paid. [ Thus, it is not the
ratio decidendi, but an obiter by Division Bench while finding it to be a too belated a
claim of ITC, not because of any restriction in Section 10 (3) but because the claim
was made belatedly even after a reasonable period of six months, inferred as
reasonable by maximum period for filing Revised Returns under Section 35 (4) of the
KVAT Act, 2003. ] In that view of the matter, the Tribunal has not applied its mind to
the aforesaid provision and ignoring the mandate of law has allowed the said
deduction erroneously. Therefore, the said finding recorded by the Tribunal cannot
be sustained and accordingly it is hereby set aside. The question of law raised is
answered in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee."

aforesaid quote from the Division Bench decision in Centum Industries Private Limited case in the
light of the provisions of Section 10(3) and Section 35(4) of the KVAT Act, 2003, would reveal that
the claim of ITC was disallowed by the Division Bench not on the basis of an interpretation of the
substantive provisions contained in Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003, or any restriction of

period to be read therein but because of the belated claim made by the assessee much after the lapse
of a reasonable period viz., six months from the month of June 2006 in the month of February 2007
Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar
Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
and while referring to the belated claim beyond six months, the Division Bench referred to Section
35 of the KVAT Act, 2003, which prescribes 20 days period for filing of the Returns for the month
ended and in case of omissions or errors, the assessee is permitted to file a revised Return under
Section 35 (3) and (4) of the KVAT Act, 2003, within a period of six months from the end of relevant
tax period respectively.
20. In the aforequoted paragraph 14 of the judgment of the Division Bench in Centum Industries
Private Limited case, from the words "........ However, the Tribunal without reference to the statutory
provisions proceeds on the assumption that allowing input tax is a statutory promise made to the
dealer buying the goods from the registered dealer by paying that tax mentioned in the tax invoice.
There is nothing in law stipulating that if input tax is not claimed during the month succeeding the
month in which purchase is Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and

effected, the dealer would forfeit his claim to claim input tax" appear to be the quotation from the
order of the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal, though inverted commas (" - ") have not been used by
the Division Bench in the said Paragraph 14 of its judgment, but immediately thereafter, the
Division Bench says "In coming to the said conclusion, the Tribunal has not applied its mind to sub
Section (3) of Section 10 ..... " makes it obvious. Therefore it appears that what precedes these words
is the reasoning given by the Tribunal while deciding the Appeal in favour of the petitioner assessee
which, however, the Division Bench of this Court did not approve as aforesaid, mainly for the reason
of delay in making the claim of input tax credit beyond a period of six months. Though, with great
respects, there was no such time period restriction in the substantive provisions of Section 10(3) of
the KVAT Act, 2003 but on that aspect of the matter, this Court sitting singly cannot express a
different view due to the judicial Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and
Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
discipline. But the facts and context before Centum's case were entirely different and therefore that
judgment is of little help to the Revenue - Department in these cases.
21. The learned Additional Advocate General also contended before the Court that the amendments
were effected in Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003 in the year 2015 and 2016, though for the
period of assessments in question before this Court in the present batch of writ petitions are
admittedly and without any dispute from either side are much prior to these amendments in Section
10(3) and therefore the question of effect of these amendments upon the assessments in hand as
challenged before this Court need not be even gone into. However, the learned Additional Advocate
General pointed out that these amendments would only now after 01/04/2015 allow the Input Tax
Credit to the dealers, if the input tax Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and
Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.

Kirloskar Electric Co Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 10 January, 2018
pertains to a tax period of five months prior to the tax period in which such ITC is claimed, as how
an amendment beneficial to the interest of the assessees and realizing their practical difficulties, the
State has effected these amendments to facilitate the claim of the ITC after these amendments.
However, at the same time, the learned Additional Advocate General's argument is that, by
necessary implication therefore for the previous periods, it should be inferred that since there was
no such relaxation available to the assessees, therefore unless the ITC invoice pertains to the same
tax period, such ITC cannot be allowed.
This argument of the learned Additional Advocate General cuts the arguments of the learned AAG
himself, when he submits that the amendment was effected to facilitate the claim of ITC by the State
realizing the difficulties of the assessees. If the restrictive and narrow interpretation put forth by the
learned counsel Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters
Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
for the Respondents is accepted, the same would lead to absurd, impractical and totally unintended
results. While on the one hand, the Dealer is enjoined with the legal obligation to maintain the
Books of Accounts in the ordinary course of its business on a day-to-day basis as required under
Section 31(1) of the KVAT Act and well settled Accounting Principles and he would record the
purchases only when he purchases the goods and the goods are so received by him and depending
upon the terms of contract, the contract is finally executed completely by recording such purchase in
the Books of accounts, if on the other hand, the same is sought to be negatived and Dealer is called
upon to file a revised return to claim the ITC in the 'Tax period' to which ITC invoice or sale invoice
pertains, that would not only render the reversal of these entries illegal and wrong but against all
canons of the settled Accounting principles and would make the Books of Accounts a total mess,
while there is no good reason to interpret Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State
of Karnataka & Ors.
the provisions of Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003, in such a restrictive manner.
22. The substantive provision of Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003, did not lay down any such
restrictive time frame for allowing the deduction of ITC against the OPT in a particular tax period to
determine the net tax payable for that tax period and therefore there is no justification whatsoever
to accept such an interpretation put forth by the learned counsels for the Respondent State. Such
contentions had not only been negatived and with great respects, rightly so by the learned Single
Judge in the case of Sonal Apparel Private Limited case, but this Court is of the considered opinion
that the Respondent Department is taking an unnecessarily distorted view of the observations made
by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Centum Industries Private Limited, where the
Division Bench while disallowed the said Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016

claim of ITC made at a belatedly stage and observed simply as an obiter that the claim of ITC should
relate to the tax period in question. The Division Bench never said that the ITC Invoice or Sale
Invoice should also be pertaining to the same tax period, in which the credit of such ITC is claimed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56009484/ 72
Kirloskar Electric Co Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 10 January, 2018
by the Dealer.
23. The learned counsels for the Respondent State were at complete loss of words to the question
put by the Court as to, under what authority of law the State can retain the tax paid by the selling
Dealer to the State as collected under the Sale Invoice which is passed on to the purchasing Dealer
who are the assessees - petitioners before this Court, if ITC in respect of such sale invoice was to be
disallowed, contrary to the very concept of VAT law and the unrestricted language of Section 10(3)
of the KVAT Act, 2003 and in apparent violation of Article 265 of the Constitution of India, there
was simply no answer on Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected
Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
behalf of the Respondent State to this query of the Court, except relying on the aforesaid obiter from
the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Centum Industries Private Limited case, which
as explained above, does not support the case of the Revenue at all.
24. In the peculiar facts of the Centum Industries Private Limited case, the claim of ITC credit was
disallowed on the basis of the belated claim made by it and not while interpreting the substantive
provisions of Section 10(3) of the Act in a narrower way, as is sought to be canvassed by the
Respondent State before this Court even now.
25. The learned counsels for the Respondent State were again without any answer to the question of
the Court as to how the machinery provisions of filing of the returns under Section 35 of the KVAT
Act, 2003 for assessing the tax liability including the OPT, ITC and Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State
of Karnataka & Ors.
Net Tax liability under Section 10 of the KVAT Act, 2003, can be allowed to override the substantive
provisions of Section 10 of the KVAT Act, 2003, contained in chapter II of the said KVAT Act, 2003.
26. In the absence of any valid answer and submission on behalf of the Respondent State, this Court
can safely conclude that the machinery provisions cannot be allowed to override and defeat the
substantive claim of the Input Tax Credits under Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003, which
without any restriction of the time frame, allowed such deduction or credit of the ITC against the
OPT liability of the Dealer in question.
27. When the Assessing Authority could pass the impugned re-assessment order, Annexure C dated
29/04/2016 for the whole year in one go, disallowing the ITC claim illegally by restricting it on the
basis of Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters

monthly Tax Periods, what can be the justification for disallowing the same, without it being found
to be an unverified claim, not supported by valid Sales Invoices ? None - is the simple answer !

28. The Input Tax Credit under VAT law is pari- materia with the concept of CENVAT or MODVAT
under Excise Law and dealing with a similar problem, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Collector of Central Excise, Pune Vs. Dai Ichi Karkaria Ltd. 1999 ( 112 ) E.L.T.353 ( SC ) held in
paragraph 17 as under:-
"17. It is clear from these Rules, as we read them, that a manufacturer obtains credit
for the excise duty paid on raw material to be used by him in the production of an
excisable product immediately it makes the requisite declaration and obtains an
acknowledgement thereof. It is entitled to use the credit at any time thereafter when
making Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected
Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
payment of excise duty on the excisable product. There is no provision in the Rules
which provides for a reversal of the credit by the excise authorities except where it
has been illegally or irregularly taken, in which event it stands cancelled or, if
utilized, has to be paid for. We are here really concerned with credit that has been
validly taken, and its benefit is available to the manufacturer without any limitation
in time or otherwise unless the manufacturer itself chooses not to use the raw
material in its excisable product. The credit is, therefore, indefeasible. It should also
be noted that there is no co- relation of the raw material and the final product; that is
to say, it is not as if credit can be taken only on a final product that is manufactured
out of the particular raw material to which the credit is related. The credit may be
taken against the excise duty on a final product manufactured on the very day that is
becomes available."

Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
29. Thus the claim of credit of input tax is indefeasible as was the case of CENVAT under Excise law
and such credit of ITC under VAT law which is equivalent to tax paid in the chain of sales of the
same goods, cannot be denied on the anvil of machinery provisions or even provisions relating to
time frame which is law of limitation only bars the remedy rather than negativing the substantive
claims under the taxing statutes.
30. Both the questions framed above are therefore liable to be answered in favour of the petitioners
assessees. The claim of ITC cannot be restricted and denied on the stated grounds by Revenue. It
cannot be denied only because ITC claim is not made in respect of Sale Invoices which are not
pertaining to same Tax Period, nor it can be denied on the ground that such claim is not made
immediately in the month or months following the month of purchase Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State

of goods in question. The machinery provisions of filing of Returns under Section 35 of the KVAT
Act cannot defeat the substantive claims under Section 10(3) of the Act. The Revenue is entitled only

Kirloskar Electric Co Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 10 January, 2018
to verify that the Sale Invoices are genuine and valid and such ITC claim is not duplicate, fictitious
or bogus. Article 265 of the Constitution of India does not entitle the State to retain such tax paid by
Selling Dealers and deny the claim of ITC credit or set off in the hands of the Purchasing Dealers
who claim such ITC against their Output Tax Liability when they sell goods further, incurring such
Output Tax liability.
31. One wonders whether the subsequent amendments effected by the Respondent State in the year
2015 and 2016 though not applicable to the assessment period involved in this batch of writ
petitions presently being decided by this Court, is a 'relaxation' or a 'restriction' and whether it is for
the Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar
Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
benefit of the assessees as contended by the Respondent State or seeks to restrict and defeat the
claim of ITC in the period of assessment following such amendment. Be that as it may. Since that
amendment is neither applicable to the facts of the present case nor any of the sides has called the
same in question, this Court need not make any further analysis of these amendments.
32. This Court is, therefore of the considered opinion that the impugned assessment orders/re-
assessment orders passed by the Respondent - Assessing Authorities to this extent of denying the
claim of ITC to the petitioners assessees are illegal and unsustainable and deserve to be quashed and
set aside by this Court.
33. The writ petitions are accordingly allowed and the impugned orders are quashed and set aside.
The Date of Judgment 10-01-2018 W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar
Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State of Karnataka & Ors.
matters would stand restored to the file of the Respondent Assessing Authorities to pass fresh orders
in accordance with law as interpreted above as far as claim of Input Tax Credit is concerned.
34. This Court is of the further opinion that despite more than one judgment interpreting the
provisions of Section 10(3) of the KVAT Act, 2003, in favour of the assessees, the tendency on the
part of the Assessing Authorities of the Respondent Department to still keep on passing the orders
contrary to these judgments is in utter disregard of the judicial and hierarchical discipline which
they are bound to observe and it may also amount to a deliberate disobedience on their part and
may invite contempt action and therefore to prevent any such further unnecessary litigation on this
issue, at the behest of the different Authorities of the Department taking a contrary view, it is
directed that the Head of the Respondent Department, namely, Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State
of Karnataka & Ors.
the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes shall issue a Circular in terms of the various aforesaid
judgments of this Court in favour of assessees, for being followed by the Authorities through out the
State to avoid any further multiplicity of litigation before this Court and Appellate Forums.
Therefore, such a Circular shall be issued by the Respondent Commissioner of Commercial Taxes

and the Respondent - Departmental Authorities, including the Appellate Authorities under the Act
are cautioned that now onwards if any contrary view is found to be taken by such Authorities of the
Department on aforesaid issue, this Court would initiate suo motu contempt proceedings against the
Commissioner of Commercial Taxes as well as the concerned Authorities of the Respondent
Department.
35. With these observations and directions, these writ petitions are allowed. All the impugned
orders passed by the Assessing Authorities are set aside and Date of Judgment 10-01-2018
W.P.Nos.58917-58928/2016 and Connected Matters Kirloskar Electric Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. The State
of Karnataka & Ors.
the matters are restored to file of the respective Assessing Authorities, for passing fresh orders in
accordance with law, as interpreted above. No costs.
