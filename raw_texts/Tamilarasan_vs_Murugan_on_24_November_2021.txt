2. This case has arisen out of a private complaint filed by the respondent/complainant on the
allegations that the petitioner borrowed a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- on 13.11.2006, another sum of
Rs.5,00,000/- on 09.01.2007, Rs.4,00,000/- on 04.01.2007 and Rs.5,00,000/- on 09.01.2007,
totally Rs.19,00,000/- for his business purpose. After repaying a part amount, he had issued two
cheques dated 20.01.2007 and 05.02.2007 for the sum of Rs.6,90,000/- and Rs.8,99,000/-

respectively towards discharging the loan amount. The cheques were drawn on the Federal bank,
Pondicherry. The respondent/complainant presented the cheque for collection through his bank
ICICI, Puducherry and the same was returned on 30.01.2007 and on 06.02.2007 for the reason
'insufficient funds'. After having issued the statutory notice and complying the legal mandates, the
complainant has filed the private complaint against the accused for the offence under Section 138 of
Negotiable Instruments Act.
3. After the case was taken on file and after completing the legal formalities, on the side of the
complainant, he examined himself as PW.1 and marked 9 exhibits as Ex.P.1 to Ex.P9. On the side of
the accused, no witness was examined and no documents were marked.

4. At the conclusion of the trial and on consideration of the available material on record, the learned
trial Judge had found the accused guilty for the offence under Section 138 of N.I.Act, convicted and
sentenced the accused to undergo Simple Imprisonment for 2 years and ordered to pay a sum of
Rs.19,00,000/- as compensation. Aggrieved over that the accused had preferred the appeal before
the Sessions Court, Puducherry in C.A.No.40 of 2014. The appellate Court dismissed the appeal by
confirming the judgment of the trial Court. Now this criminal revision case has been filed
challenging the judgment of the appellate Court.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Courts below had not appreciated the
evidence in proper perspective. The complainant did not have sufficient means to lend a sum of
Rs.19,00,000/- to the accused; though the complainant has stated that he had arranged loan
amount by getting money from various persons, he has not chosen to examine them as witnesses;
according to the petitioner/accused he had borrowed loan only from his brother- in-law through
Balakrishnan; he had given the cheques for security and the complainant had misused the same. By
making such statements, it is prayed https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that the criminal revision
case should be allowed by setting aside the judgment of the appellate Court.
6. The learned counsel Amicus Curiae for the respondent submitted that the Courts below have
properly appreciated the evidence on record and convicted the accused and it has to be upheld.
7. The point for consideration is Whether the conviction and sentence of the accused for the offence
under Section 255(2) Cr.P.C., and 357(3) Cr.P.C., by the learned II Additional Sessions Judge basing
on the materials available on record is fair and proper?
8. The main ground on which the petitioner has challenged the judgment of the Courts below is that
the respondent/complainant did not have any means to lend Rs.19,00,000/- to the accused and that
too without getting any proper security and other documents. The complainant himself admitted
that he is working in Hindustan Unilever Company as an operator, his monthly salary Rs.13,000/-.
In the evidence of PW.1 (complainant) it is stated that the accused was known to him. The accused is
said to be running a lorry transport, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Tea shop, Xerox shop and
Courier Agency. The loan amount of Rs.19,00,000/- was given within a short period of 40 days. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125446646/ 2
Tamilarasan vs Murugan on 24 November, 2021
not the contention of PW.1, that he had the entire sum of Rs19,00,000/- in his hands in order to
lend it to the accused. His categorical submission is that he had raised the said amount, only by
borrowing from his friends Arun, Bahour Kurivinatham, Sagayaraj and his uncle Balakrishnan. He
has stated that his contribution towards the sum of Rs.19,00,000/- is only to the extent of
Rs.4,00,000/-.
9. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the accused is known to the uncle of the
complainant namely Balakrishnan, who is working in PRTC Depot and he had already lent a sum of
Rs.1,00,000/- to him on daily interest basis. He further submitted that the said loan was repaid, and
5 cheques issued to him as security had been misused for the purpose of filing this case. The learned
trial Judge has convinced himself to take the presumption available under Section 139 of Negotiable
Instruments Act and convicted the accused. The execution of the cheques by the accused is not
disputed. Once the execution is admitted as per Section 139 of N.I.Act., it has to be presumed that
the cheque was issued only and for discharging a legally enforceable debt. No doubt, the above
presumption is available to the respondent/complainant, since https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the
accused did not deny the execution of the cheques. But the initial presumption can become
conclusive only, if it is not rebutted by the defence. The specific stand of defence is that the
complainant did not have sufficient means to lend a huge sum of Rs.19,00,000/-. Even according to
his submissions, he did not have that much financial capacity. PW.1 has admitted that Balakrishnan
is his uncle, though he denied about the transaction between the accused and the Balakrishnan.
However, the complainant himself has stated that a portion of the amount lent to the accused was
contributed by the Balakrishnan as well.
10. In such circumstances, the complainant ought to have examined all his friends and relatives
namely Arun, Bahour Kurivinatham, Sagayaraj and Balakrishnan for the purpose of establishing
that the said persons had the capacity to lend him in lakhs in order to consolidate it and then give it
as a loan to the accused. Since the petitioner/accused had taken the defence that the complainant
did not have the means to lend a huge sum, he ought to have given with the benefit of cross
examining those persons, who alleged to have contributed towards the loan of Rs.19,00,000/-.
Withholding the said person from coming to the box would amount to withholding best evidence
available in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis favour of the complainant and that would earn an
adverse presumption against him. Since the complainant has stated that he did not possess
Rs.19,00,000/-at the relevant time, he has the duty to prove the same and make the presumption
under Section 139 of N.I.Act to become conclusive. It has been held time and again by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court that the action taken for debts on cheques is largely civil in nature, but only to
enforce the reliability of the cheques issued during business transaction, the criminal proceedings
have been given with legal sanction.
11. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that out of contention and the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in Basalingappa -vs- Mudibasappa reported in 2019 (5) SCC 418,
in order to support his submission that for rebutting the initial presumption the accused need not to
come to box and he is liberty to take his defence from the weakness and contradiction in the
evidence of the complainant and claim preponderance of probabilities in his favour. In the said
judgment, it is held as under:-

13. This Court in Bharat Barrel & Drum Mfg.
Co. v. Amin Chand Payrelal [Bharat Barrel & Drum Mfg. Co. v. Amin Chand Payrelal, (1999) 3 SCC
35] had occasion to consider Section 118(a) of the Act. This Court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
held that once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under Section 118(a)
would arise that it is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable and defendant
can prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a probable defence. In para 12, the
following has been laid down : (SCC pp. 50-51) “12. Upon consideration of various judgments as
noted hereinabove, the position of law which emerges is that once execution of the promissory note
is admitted, the presumption under Section 118(a) would arise that it is supported by a
consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable. The defendant can prove the non-existence of a
consideration by raising a probable defence. If the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial
onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same
was illegal, the onus would shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and
upon his failure to prove would disentitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the negotiable
instrument. The burden upon the defendant of proving the non-existence of the consideration can
be either direct or by bringing on record the preponderance of probabilities by reference to the
circumstances upon which he relies. In such an event, the plaintiff is entitled under law to rely upon
all the evidence led in the case including that of the plaintiff as well. In case, where the defendant
fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non-existence of the consideration, the
plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of presumption arising under Section 118(a)
in his favour. The court may not insist https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis upon the defendant to
disprove the existence of consideration by leading direct evidence as the existence of negative
evidence is neither possible nor contemplated and even if led, is to be seen with a doubt. The bare
denial of the passing of the consideration apparently does not appear to be any defence. Something
which is probable has to be brought on record for getting the benefit of shifting the onus of proving
to the plaintiff. To disprove the presumption, the defendant has to bring on record such facts and
circumstances upon consideration of which the court may either believe that the consideration did
not exist or its non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would, under the circumstances of
the case, shall act upon the plea that it did not exist.”
14. S.B. Sinha, J. in M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala [M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of
Kerala, (2006) 6 SCC 39 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 30] had considered Sections 118(a), 138 and 139 of the
Act, 1881. It was held that presumptions both under Sections 118(a) and 139 are rebuttable in
nature. Explaining the expressions “may presume” and “shall presume” referring to an earlier
judgment, the following was held in para 28 : (SCC p. 49) “28. What would be the effect of the
expressions “may presume”, “shall presume” and “conclusive proof” has been considered by this
Court in Union of India v. Pramod Gupta [Union of India v. Pramod Gupta, (2005) 12 SCC 1] , in the
following terms :
(SCC pp. 30-31, para 52) ‘52.…It is true that the legislature used two
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis different phraseologies “shall be presumed” and
“may be presumed” in Section 42 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act and furthermore
although provided for the mode and manner of rebuttal of such presumption as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125446646/ 4
Tamilarasan vs Murugan on 24 November, 2021
regards the right to mines and minerals said to be vested in the Government vis-à-vis
the absence thereof in relation to the lands presumed to be retained by the
landowners but the same would not mean that the words “shall presume” would be
conclusive. The meaning of the expressions “may presume” and “shall presume” have
been explained in Section 4 of the Evidence Act, 1872, from a perusal whereof it
would be evident that whenever it is directed that the court shall presume a fact it
shall regard such fact as proved unless disproved. In terms of the said provision, thus,
the expression “shall presume” cannot be held to be synonymous with “conclusive
proof”.’ ”
15. It was noted in M.S. Narayana Menon case [M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala, (2006) 6
SCC 39 :
(2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 30] , that the expression “shall presume” cannot be held to be
synonymous with conclusive proof. Referring to definition of words “proved” and
“disproved” under Section 3 of the Evidence Act, 1872 the following was laid down in
para 30 : (SCC p. 50) “30. Applying the said definitions of “proved” or “disproved” to
the principle behind Section 118(a) of the Act, the court shall presume a
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis negotiable instrument to be for consideration
unless and until after considering the matter before it, it either believes that the
consideration does not exist or considers the non-existence of the consideration so
probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to
act upon the supposition that the consideration does not exist. For rebutting such
presumption, what is needed is to raise a probable defence. Even for the said
purpose, the evidence adduced on behalf of the complainant could be relied upon.”

20. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa v. Sri Mohan [Rangappa v. Sri Mohan, (2010) 11
SCC 441 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 477 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 184] had occasion to elaborately consider the
provisions of Sections 138 and 139. In the above case, the trial court had acquitted the accused in a
case relating to dishonour of cheque under Section 138. The High Court had reversed [Mohan v.
Rangappa, 2005 SCC OnLine Kar 783] the judgment of the trial court convicting the accused. In the
above case, the accused had admitted signatures on the cheque. This Court held that where the fact
of signature on the cheque is acknowledged, a presumption has to be raised that the cheque
pertained to a legally enforceable debt or liability, however, this presumption is of a rebuttal nature
and the onus is then on the accused to raise a probable defence. In para 13, the following has been
laid https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis down : (SCC p. 446) “13. The High Court in its order [Mohan
v. Rangappa, 2005 SCC OnLine Kar 783] noted that in the course of the trial proceedings, the
accused had admitted that the signature on the impugned cheque (No. 0886322 dated 8- 2-2001)
was indeed his own. Once this fact has been acknowledged, Section 139 of the Act mandates a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125446646/ 5
Tamilarasan vs Murugan on 24 November, 2021
presumption that the cheque pertained to a legally enforceable debt or liability. This presumption is
of a rebuttal nature and the onus is then on the accused to raise a probable defence. With regard to
the present facts, the High Court found that the defence raised by the accused was not probable.”
11. In the case in hand, the petitioner/accused has consistently stated that the complainant did not
have sufficient funds and it is not possible or probable to presume that he had lent the huge sum to
the accused. Unless the cheques which were returned for 'insufficient funds' were proved to have
been issued for legally enforceable debt, the action taken under Section 138 of N.I.Act will fail. Since
the complainant did not prove that he had procured funds from his alleged friends and relatives by
way of examining them, that would shift the preponderance of probabilities in favour of the accused.
So it is unbelievable that the complainant had lent a huge sum in a short span of 40
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis days and that too to a person like the accused who is his casual
acquaintance. Since the Courts below have not properly appreciated the preponderance of
probabilities available in favour of the petitioner/accused, from the short falling evidence of the
complainant, I feel it is fit for interference.
12. In the result, the Criminal Revision Case is allowed and the judgment of the Sessions Court is set
aside. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
