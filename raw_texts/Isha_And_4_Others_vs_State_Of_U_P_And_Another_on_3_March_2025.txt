2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the entire proceedings
of Sessions Trial No.862 of 2021 (State Vs. Naushan and others), arising out of Case
Crime No. 549 of 2019, under Sections 498A, 323, 354, 354(Kha), 307, 506 I.P.C. and
3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station Kithaur, District Meerut, pending in the

Magistrate, Court No.3, Meerut, under Sections 498A, 323, 354, 354 (Kha), 307, 506

323, 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act against applicant no.5 in pursuance of
compromise deed dated 18.10.2024.
3. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the parties have amicably settled
their dispute and a compromise has been entered into between the parties and after
the aforesaid they have decided to live together. The copy of the said
compromise/mutual deed, filed before the court below, is annexed as Annexure No. 7
to this application. Therefore, continuance of proceedings against the applicant;;;s ;;;;
would be a futile exercise and wastage of time of the Court and will be abuse of
process of law. Hence, proceedings of the aforesaid case be quashed in the light of law
laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in
(2012) 10 SCC 303.
4. Learned AGA as well as learned counsel for opposite party no.2 also does not
dispute the correctness of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
applicants.
5. Whether a compromise has taken place or not can at best be ascertained by the
court, where the proceedings are pending, after ensuring the presence of the parties
before it.
6. In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with copy of compromise deed as well as a certified copy of this order within a
two week from today. It is expected that the trial court may fix a date for the
verification of the compromise and after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an
appropriate order with respect to the same in accordance with law, after hearing the
informant, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of four weeks from
today. While passing the order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall
also record the statement of the parties as to whether all the terms and conditions
mentioned in the original compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not?

9. Till then, no coercive measure shall be taken against the applicants in the aforesaid
case."

from the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Court No. 12, Meerut has been placed on record
along with the order dated 06.02.2025 vide which compromise has been verified, as is evident from
the office report dated 28.02.2025.
5. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that since the compromise entered between the
parties has been verified by the court concerned, the entire proceedings of the aforesaid criminal
case may be quashed by this Court.
6. Learned counsel appearing for the State states that since the parties have entered into a
compromise, he has no objection, if the proceedings in the aforesaid case are quashed.
7. Before proceeding further it shall be apt to make a brief reference to the following cases:-
1. B.S. Joshi and others Vs. State of Haryana and Another; (2003)4 SCC 675;
2. Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 677;

4. Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab; (2012); 10 SCC 303; and
5. Narindra Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab; ( 2014) 6 SCC 466,
8. In the aforesaid judgments, the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made
between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. Reference
may also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and Others Vs. State of U.P. &
Another; 2013 (83) ACC 278, in which the law expounded by the Apex court in the aforesaid cases
has been explained in detail.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as noted hereinabove, and also the
submissions made by the counsel for the parties, the court is of the considered opinion that no
useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the proceedings of the above mentioned criminal case
as the parties have already settled their dispute.
