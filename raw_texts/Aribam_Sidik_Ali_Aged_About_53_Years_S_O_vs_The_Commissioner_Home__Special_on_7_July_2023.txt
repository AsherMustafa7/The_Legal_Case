Th. Vashum, learned G.A. for respondent Nos. 1 & 2 and Mr. W. Darakishwar, learned Sr. PCCG for
respondent No. 3.
[5] Mr. Th. Jugindro, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that there is violation of mandatory
provisions of PIT-ND & PS Act, 1988 and inordinate delay on the part of the Central Government in
disposing of the representation. He prays that the detention order be set aside and the detenu be
released.
[6] Mr. Th. Vashum, learned G.A. for the State respondents, submits that there is no lapse on the
part of the State Government in dealing with the detention of the detenu. It is stated that the
grounds for detention of the detenu was furnished within the stipulated time and the representation
was disposed of within 4 (four) days and necessary information was furnished to the Central
Government expeditiously as possible. He prays that the writ petition be dismissed as being devoid
of merit.
[7] Mr. W. Darakishwar, learned Sr. PCCG for the Union of India, submits that the detention order
dated 09.12.2022 was received by the Central Government on 16.12.2022 within the stipulated

delay on the part of the Central Government for dealing with the representation submitted by the
detenu and the actual time taken in disposing of the representation by the Central Government is
not fatal. He prays for rejecting the writ petition.
WP(Cril.) No. 57 of 2023 Page 3
[8] We have considered the submissions made at the bar, perused
the materials on record and official files submitted by the State Government.
[9] On the part of the State Government, there is no violation of the mandatory provisions of the
PIT-ND & PS Act, the grounds of detention was furnished within 5 days as stipulated under Section
3 (3) of the Act and the detention order was forwarded to the State Government within 10 (ten) days
as provided under Section 3(2) of the Act, it took only 4 (four) days for the State Government in
disposing of the representation.
[10] We are of the view that there is no delay on the part of the State Government in dealing with the
detention of the detenu. However, it took 19 days for the Central Government to decide the
representation dated 24.03.2023. The period from 24.03.2023 to 31.03.2023 (i.e. 7 days) has been
explained as the time taken for receiving the representation as well as para- wise comment from the
State Government. Hence, it took 12 (twelve) effective days for the Central Government in disposal
of the representation. These 12 days' delay has not been satisfactorily explained by the Central
Government in the memorandum dated 12.04.2023 nor in the counter affidavit submitted before
this Court.
[11] In the case of Rajammal v. State of T.N. reported in (1999) 1 SCC 417 at para 7, it was held that
the authority is permitted to explain the delay which had occasioned in disposal of the
representation and on failure to explain such delay, the detention order would be illegal. Similarly, it
was held in the case of Sarabjeet Singh Mokha v. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur reported as
MANU/SC/1011/2021 that unexplained delay in considering the representation will invalidate the
detention order.
[12] In the present case, the Central Government could not explain the delay of 12 (twelve) days time
taken while disposing of the representation even after receive of para-wise comment. On this ground
WP(Cril.) No. 57 of 2023 Page 4 alone, the detention order cannot be sustained. Accordingly, the
detention order dated 09.12.2022 and the confirmation order dated 07.02.2023 issued by the
Commissioner (Home), Government of Manipur are set aside and the detenu, namely Aribam Sidik
Ali, be released forthwith from custody, if not required in any other case.
[13] Writ petition is allowed. No cost.
[14] Send a copy of this order to the Commissioner (Home),
Government of Manipur and Superintendent of Police, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa for information
and doing the needful.
