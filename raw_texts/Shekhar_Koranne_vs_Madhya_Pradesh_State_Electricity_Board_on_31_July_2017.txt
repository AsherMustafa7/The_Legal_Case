ORDER
( 31/07/2017) Regard being had to the similitude in the controversy involved in the present cases,
the writ petitions were analogously heard and by a common order, they are being
--- 7 ---
disposed of by this Court. Facts of Writ Petition No. 2847/2016 are narrated hereunder.
The petitioner before this Court has filed this present writ petition being aggrieved by the order
dated 18/3/2016 passed by the respondents by which the respondents have set aside the pay fixation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76782752/ 5
Shekhar Koranne vs Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board ... on 31 July, 2017
of the petitioner dt. 27/12/1999 and has directed recovery made to the petitioner.
The contention of the petitioner is that the petitioner was appointed on 22/5/1982 as Office
Assistant Grade 3, at Indore and on 6/5/1999 an order was passed granting time bound promotion
to the petitioner. On 15/12/1999 Petitioner was promoted to the post of Office Assistant Grade 2.
The contention of the petitioner is that the aforesaid promotion was granted keeping in view the
time bound promotion scheme applicable to Class 3 and Class 4 employees dt. 6/5/1999. Further
contention of the petitioner is that he was fixed in the pay scale of Rs.2800-5825.
Another Circular was issued on 19/7/1990 which was again for grant of higher pay scale and the
petitioner was
--- 8 ---
granted higher pay scale on 29/12/2007. It has been further stated that the higher pay scale was
granted as per Circular dt. 19/7/1990 and the petitioner was again granted second higher pay scale
by order dated 17/7/2008. The petitioner's grievance is that a Notice was issued to the petitioner on
7/5/2015 stating that as to why benefit of higher pay scale should not be withdrawn and the
emoluments granted in excess to his entitlement should not be recovered.
The petitioner did file a reply and after hearing the petitioner, the respondents have passed an order
dt. 18/3/2016 withdrawing the higher pay scale granted to the petitioner in the year1999 and the
recovery has been ordered.
The contention of the petitioner is that all the three pay scales were granted to him in the light of
various policies issued by the Board from time to time and no recovery can be initiated in the light of
the judgment delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Punjab and others Vs.
Rafiq Masih reported in 2014 AIR SCW 6256.
--- 9 ---
On the other hand, a reply has been filed in the matter and it is submitted that the Petitioner was
mistakenly granted the benefit of Higher Pay-scale under the TBPS, wherein as per the Scheme an
Employee is ought to have been granted the benefit of Re-designation of the Post only and not the
benefit of Higher Pay-scale or Revision of pay and accordingly the said erroneously extending the
benefit of Higher Pay-scale and fixation of pay was rectified by the Respondents after following
principles of natural justice. It is an important fact to consider that in the erstwhile Board and in the
present Company there is no provision to grant the benefit of Three Higher Pay-scales to its
employees and the contention of the respondent is that due to erroneous interpretation of Circulars,
the benefit was extended to the Petitioner and he has obtained Three Higher Pay-scale in his service
tenure.
It has been further stated that it is a matter of consideration that an employee can be granted the
benefit of Higher Pay-scale or Revised Pay-fixation only when the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76782752/ 6
Shekhar Koranne vs Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board ... on 31 July, 2017
--- 10 ---
relevant policy provides. The Scheme of Time Bound Promotion enforced by the erstwhile Board
vide its Circular Dt. 06.05.1999 under which it was principally decided to grant the benefit of the
scheme to the 10 posts of Direct recruitment cadre posts of the Board. It was decided that those
employees who were already granted the benefit of Higher Pay-scale of next promotional post after
completion of 9/18 years of Service would redesignated by prefixing word 'Additional' before their
name of next promotional post of which Pay-scale they are already availed under the Higher
Pay-scale Scheme Dt. 19.07.1990 of the Board. Copy of the Circular Dt. 19.07.1990 has already
submitted by the Petitioner as Annexure P/5 at Page No.29-48 of the Writ Petition.
It is further contended that an employee under the prevailing Circulars was entitled to get the
benefit of Higher Pay-scales (First and Second) of next promotional post, if they were not promoted,
after completion of 9/18/25 years of service and to make distinction between the employees
--- 11 ---
who have got the benefit of Higher Pay-scale it was decided to grant them benefit of TBPS under
which they have to be re-designated by suffixing the word 'Additional' before the name of Next
promotional post, Pay-scale of which they were already receiving.
It has been further contended that as per Circular Dt. 06.05.1999 under the TBPS there is no
provision to grant the benefit of Higher Pay-scale/Revision of Pay Fixation, which also gets
confirmed by perusal of Clause 2 and 3 of the Circular. Para 2 and 3 reads as under: -

Respondents have further stated that the aforesaid
--- 12 ---
decision of redesignation was only taken principally it was further provided under the
Clause 8 of the Order that to implement the decision the rules and other conditions
will be provided separately. Copy of Circular Dt. 06.05.1999 has already placed on
Record by the Petitioner as Annexure P/1.
It has been further contended that since in view of the Clause 8 of the Circular Dt.
06.05.1999 no order under the TBPS was issued in continuation of the same and
upon request of the representative Union a Circular Dt.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76782752/ 7
Shekhar Koranne vs Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board ... on 31 July, 2017
30.07.1999 was issued whereby certain directions was provided for issuing the order
under the TBPS. The operative para/directions were given from Clause 5 of the
Circular Dt. 30.07.1999 as per which it became abundantly clear that those
employees, who are already getting the benefit of Higher Pay Scale on completion of
9/18 years of service, the order of Re-designation, by prefixing the word "Additional"
before the post for which higher Pay-scale has been granted has to be issued. It was
further provided to
--- 13 ---
ascertain/verify that the employee is already getting and placed in the higher Pay-scale of next
promotional post directions has been issued from the Service Book/L.P.C. etc. Copy of Circular Dt.
30.07.1999 has already placed on Record by the Petitioner at Page No.18 (Annexure-P/3) of the
Writ compilation.
It has been further contended that the provisions contained in the Clause 5(a), (b) and (c) also
makes it clear that under the scheme there was no provision to grant the benefit of Higher Pay Scale
or Pay fixation, in fact Clause 5(c) provides for the eventuality wherein those employee whom
Higher Pay-scale is has to be given and provides that after granting the benefit of First Higher
Pay-scale as per the Board's Circular enforced they have to be re-designated under the TPB Scheme.
Clause 7 of the Circular also provides that the Order of Re-designation was not to be issued from
retrospective effect, i.e. from the date of granting the benefit of Higher Pay-scale.
It has been further stated that the decision of Time
--- 14 ---
Bound Promotion Scheme was only principally taken and the same was subject to the Full Board's
approval, which is also confirmed by perusal of the Order Dt. 15.12.1999 (Annexure P/2), which
provides that in event of Full Board not approving the Scheme, the said benefit would be liable for
withdrawn and promotion made also would be withdrawn.
It has been further stated here that vide Order Dt. 07.02.2001, it was decided to stop the benefit of
TBPS and accordingly authorities were informed, not to grant the benefit of TBPS to the employees,
a copy of Order Dt. 07.02.2001 is on record and marked as Annexure R/1.
It has been further contended that since it was found that in some cases under the TBPS Scheme,
employees were granted the benefit of Higher Pay-scale, wherein, as per the TBP Scheme there was
no provision to grant the benefit of Higher Pay-scale therefore a Clarification Order Dt. 14.01.2011
was issued whereby it was clarified that under the provisions of TBPS, employee is not entitled to be
fixed
--- 15 ---
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76782752/ 8
Shekhar Koranne vs Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board ... on 31 July, 2017
or grant the Higher Pay-scale. Copy of Clarification Order Dt. 14.01.2011 is on record as Annexure
P/8.
It has been further stated that upon issuance of the Clarification Order Dt. 14.01.2011 the Corporate
Selection Committee of the Company was ordered to reconsider and to decide such matters, wherein
the employees were granted erroneous benefit of Higher Pay-scale under the TBPS and accordingly
adhering to the principle of natural justice a Notice was issued to the Petitioner and he was also
provided opportunity of personal hearing and after considering all the aspect of the matter a
detailed and exhaustive Order Dt. 18.03.2016 (Annexure P/11) was issued, whereby the erroneous
benefit of Higher Pay-scale under TBPS granted to the Petitioner was withdrawn and consequential
Recovery Order was issued, which is just, proper and legal.
It has been further stated that after passing of Order Dt. 18.03.2016, pay of the Petitioner has been
fixed w.e.f. 30.12.2007 in the Pay-scale of 9300-34800+GP 3800 vide Order Dt. 07.04.2016
(Annexure P/12) and consequently a
--- 16 ---
calculation sheet has been prepared by fixing his pay accordingly with respect to payment of excess
Salary till 31.03.2016, as per which a total amount of Rs. 2,36,113/- is required to be recovered from
the Petitioner.
The respondents have further stated that the petitioner has submitted an Undertaking at the time of
Revision of his Pay and Fixation of Pay w.e.f. 01.01.2006 and as per the Undertaking, with respect to
Payment of any dues or loss caused due to fixation of pay, the same can be recovered. A copy of
Undertaking furnished by the Petitioner time to time, is on record as Annexure R/2.
The respondents have further stated that the Petitioner was initially appointed on the Post of Office
Assistant Grade-III and his pay was revised time to time as per the prevailing wage Revisions of the
Board till passing of the Order Dt. 15.12.1999. Prior to issuance of Order Dt. 15.12.1999 he was never
granted the Higher Pay-scale and by the aforesaid order he has been granted Pay-scale of Rs.
2800-70-3440 though his existing pay of Office Assistant
--- 17 ---
Grade-III was Rs. 2490-60-5075, therefore the benefit of the Time Bound Promotion Scheme
(TBPS) could not have been extended to the Petitioner as he was never granted Higher Pay-scale as
per the Circular issued on Dt. 19.07.1990 (Annexure R/1).
It has been further contended that in the Case of Chandi Prasad Uniyal And Others Vs. State Of
Uttarakhand And Others, reported in [2012] 8 S.C.C. 417, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has
been held that any amount paid/received without authority of law can always be recovered barring
few exceptions of extreme hardships but not as a matter of right, in such situations law implies an
obligation on the payee to repay the money, otherwise it would amount to unjust enrichment. Thus
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76782752/ 9
Shekhar Koranne vs Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board ... on 31 July, 2017
the recovery of the excess amount paid to the Petitioner cannot be said to be illegal and is well
according to the principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
It has been further contended that as per the Impugned Order Dt. 18.03.2016 it is evident that
Petitioner has been
--- 18 ---
granted Higher Pay-scale belonging to Section Officer vide Order Dt. 17.07.2008 (Annexure P/7)
and he could not have been granted the Higher Pay-scale of Section Officer holding the substantive
post of Office Assistant Grade-II and consequently the same has been withdrawn as he has been
extended First Higher Pay-scale of Office Assistant Grade-II vide Order Dt. 15.12.1999 (Annexure
P/2) and Second Higher Pay-scale vide Order Dt. 29.12.2009 (Annexure P/6) w.e.f. 28.12.2004
therefore the Order passed on 17.07.2008 has been cancelled as the same was found to be issued on
the wrong presumption that the Petitioner is entitled to receive the Pay-scale of Section Officer.
It has been further stated that the explanation issued on Dt. 14.01.2011 clearly provides that under
Time Bound Promotion Scheme Higher Pay-scale could not be granted and no 'Fixation of Pay' is
required but due to some mistakenly belief and wrong interpretation of the Circular, the Indore
Region of the M.P.S.E.B. has been granted
--- 19 ---
Higher Pay-scale under TBPS though in the other region of erstwhile M.P.S.E.B. had not been
provided Higher Pay- scale pursuant to the circular issued on 06.05.1999 and 30.07.1999, therefore
when the matter was came-up before the authorities for its consideration it was found that the
Higher Pay-scale has been wrongly extended to the Office Assistant Grade-III belonging to Indore
Region and accordingly same has been rectified by passing the Impugned Order Dt. 18.03.2016 by
granting an opportunity of hearing to each of the employees after issuing a Show- cause Notice and
providing a Personal Hearing to the Petitioner to follow the Principles of Natural Justice.
It has been further stated that the respondent- Authorities is having authority to recover the amount
which has been found to be excess/overpayment of pay and allowances as per the provision
contained in Rule 65 of the M.P. Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1976 and a recent judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court High Court of Punjab and Haryana Vs. Jagdev Singh reported in AIR
--- 20 ---
(2016) SC 3523, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has been held that any payment found
to have been made in excess would be required to be refunded. It has been further stated that the
petitioner furnished an Undertaking while opting for the Revised Pay-scale and he is bound by the
Undertaking, therefore, on the basis of above pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court the
amount which was paid excess to the legal entitlement of the Petitioner is rightly being recovered as
per law.

Shekhar Koranne vs Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board ... on 31 July, 2017
Heard learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the record.
Undisputedly, facts of the case reveal that various schemes were issued from time to time for grant
of higher pay scale. Employees of the Board and the petitioner in the light of the Circular dt.
6/5/1999 read with Circular dt. 30/7/1999 was granted the benefit of redesignation under the
Scheme vide order dated 15/12/1999. It was clearly mentioned in the aforesaid order that the
petitioner will continue to work on his original post ie., Office Assistant
--- 21 ---
Grade 3 keeping in view the provisions of Circular dt. 6/5/1999 and 30/7/1999. The petitioner was
not entitled for higher pay scale or revision of pay fixation. In the light of the Scheme the petitioner
was never granted higher pay scale before passing of the order dt. 15/12/1999 and he was not
entitled to be redesignated as Office Assistant Grade 2 pursuant to Circular dt. 6/5/1999 and
30/7/1999. Not only this, under the time bound promotion scheme, the petitioner was wrongly
granted benefit of higher pay scale of the post of Office Asstt. Grade 2 vide order dt. 15/12/1999
whereas he was entitled for the same under the higher pay scale scheme and not under the time
bound promotion scheme. Another important aspect of the case is that at the time of issuance of
order dt. 15/12/1999 (Annexure P/2) the petitioner was working on the post of Office Assistant
Grade 3 and he was not receiving the pay scale of office Assistant Grade 2 and he was not entitled for
the pay scale of Office Asstt. Grade 2 and, therefore, wrong extension of benefit of higher pay scale at
the time of redesignation was granted
--- 22 ---
vide order dt. 29/12/2007. In fact, by order dt. 29/12/2007, the petitioner was granted second
higher pay scale and not the first higher pay scale. The petitioner was wrongly granted pay scale of
Section Officer which was the third higher pay scale and it is a case where an employee who was
entitled for two higher pay scales has been granted 3 higher pay scales. The respondents have passed
a very exhaustive order clarifying all the issues and the order dt. 18/3/2016 which refers to all the
scales and the mistake committed by the Department, reads as under :

passed in consonance with the various schemes framed from time to time and as the
petitioner was granted one extra higher pay scale, the same has been withdrawn that
too after granting an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and after taking into
account all the grounds raised by the petitioner.
Hon'ble the apex Court in the case of State of Punjab and others Vs. Rafiq Masih (supra) in
paragraph 5 to 8 has held as under :
5. In Shyam Babu Verma's case (Supra), this Court while observing that the
petitioners-therein were not entitled to the higher pay scales, had come to the
conclusion that since the amount has already been paid to the petitioner, for no fault
of theirs, the said amount shall not be recovered by the respondent-
nion of India. The observations made by this Court in the said case are as under: "Although we have
held that the petitioners were entitled only to the pay scale of Rs.330-480 in terms of the
recommendations of the Third Pay Commission w.e.f. January 1, 1973 and only after the period of 10
years, they became entitled to the pay scale of Rs.330-560 but as they have received the scale of
Rs.330-560 since 1973 due to no fault of theirs and that scale
--- 28 ---
is being reduced in the year 1984 with effect from January 1, 1973, it shall only be just and proper
not to recover any excess amount which has already been paid to them. (emphasis supplied)."

6. In Sahib Ram Verma's case (Supra), this Court once again held that although the appellanttherein
did not possess the required educational qualification, yet the Principal granting him the relaxation,
had paid his salary on the revised pay scale. This Court further observed that this was not on
account of mis- representation made by the appellant but by a mistake committed by the Principal.
In a fact situation of that nature, the Court was pleased to observe that the amount already paid to
the appellant need not be recovered. In the words of the Court:
"Admittedly the appellant does not possess the required educational qualifications.
Under the circumstances the appellant would not be entitled to the relaxation. The
principal erred in granting him the relaxation. Since the date of relaxation the
appellant had been paid his salary on the revised scale. However, it is not on account
of any misrepresentation made by the appellant that the benefit of the higher pay
scale was given to him but by wrong construction made by the Principal for which
appellant cannot be held to be fault. Under the circumstances the amount paid till
date may not be recovered from the appellant."
7. In our considered view, the observations made by the Court not to recover the excess amount paid
to the appellant-therein were in exercise of its extra-ordinary powers under Article 142 of the
Constitution of India which vest the power in this Court to pass equitable orders in the ends of
justice.
8. In Chandi Prasad Uniyal's case (Supra), a specific issue was raised and canvassed. The issue was
whether the appellant- therein can retain the amount received on the basis of irregular/wrong pay
fixation in the absence of any misrepresentation or fraud on his part. The Court after taking into
consideration the various decisions of this Court had come to the conclusion that even if by mistake
of the employer the amount is paid to the employee and on a later date if the employer after proper
determination of the same discovers that theexcess payment is made by mistake or negligence, the
excess payment so made could be recovered. While holding so this Court observed at paragraphs 14
and 16 as under:
"14.We are concerned with the excess payment of public money which is often
described as "taxpayers' money" which belongs neither to the officers who have
effected overpayment nor to the recipients. We fail to see whey the concept of fraud
or misrepresentation is being brought in such situations. The question to be asked is
whether excess money has been paid or not, may be due to a bona fide mistake.
Possibly, effecting excess payment of public money by the government officers may
be due
--- 29 ---
to various reason like negligence, carelessness, collusion, favouritism, etc. because
money in such situation does not belong to the payer or the payee. Situations may
also arise where both the payer and the payee are at fault, then the mistake is mutual.
Payments are being effected in many situations without any authority of law and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76782752/ 16
Shekhar Koranne vs Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board ... on 31 July, 2017
payments have been received by the recipients also without any authority of law. Any
amount paid/received without the authority of law can always be recovered barring
few exceptions of extreme hardships but not as a matter of right, in such situations
law implies an obligation on the payee to repay the money, otherwise it would
amount to unjust enrichment.
16. The appellant in the appeal will not fall in any of these exceptional categories,
over and above, there was a stipulation in the fixation order that in the condition of
irregular/wrong pay fixation, the institution in which the appellants were working
would be responsible for recovery of the amount received in excess from the
salary/pension. In such circumstances, we find no reason to interfere with the
judgment of the High Court. However we order that excess payment made be
recovered from the appellants salary in 12 equal monthly instalments."
This Court is of the considered opinion that the order passed by the respondents does not warrant
any interference. However, the fact remains that the respondents have not filed any document to
demonstrate before this Court that the petitioner has given an undertaking in the matter of pay
fixation while higher pay scales were granted under the time bound upgradation Schemes. The
petitioner and other identically placed persons are retired employees who have retired from Class 3
posts and the recovery is bound to cause undue hardship to the retired employees.
Resultantly, in the light of the judgment delivered by
--- 30 ---
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Punjab and others Vs. Rafiq Masih (supra), recovery
ordered by the respondents is hereby quashed. However, pay fixation is upheld. The petitioner shall
be entitled for all terminal dues and other dues keeping in view the order dt. 18/3/2016. The present
Writ Petition stands partly allowed.
A copy of this order be placed in the record of the connected Writ Petitions.
