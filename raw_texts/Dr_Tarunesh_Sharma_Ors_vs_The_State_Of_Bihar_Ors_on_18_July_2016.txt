CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR TRIPATHI
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 18-07-2016
Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016
5/20
On a prayer being made by counsel for the petitioners as
well as the respondents all the four writ applications were clubbed
together and heard together, since it is the decision of the Medical
Council of India (hereinafter referred to as "M.C.I." for short),
contained in Annexure-4, to all the writ applications, dated
02.12.2015
, except in C. W. J. C. No. 6967 of 2016, where the date of impugned Annexure - 4 is 21.01.2016, all
these petitioners, who had been admitted in Post Graduate Courses by different institutions in the
session 2014-2015 have been ordered to be discharged. The primary reason for doing so is said to be
admission granted to these students after the cut-off date fixed by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,
which is 10th of July, 2014.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56951553/ 5
Dr. Tarunesh Sharma & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 18 July, 2016
2. The petitioners are seeking not only quashing of impugned Annexure - 4, but also a direction
upon the respondents not to interfere with their studies, since they have been continuing their
studies uninterruptedly till the M.C.I. decided to pass the directive to discharge the petitioners.
3. The facts are not a matter of dispute and in fact there is commonality therein. Petitioners were all
successful candidates in the examination, which was held by Bihar Combined Entrance Competitive
Examination Board (for brevity "Board") for admission in Post Graduate Courses in different
medical colleges of Bihar. The examination in question was held in the year 2014. The Board fixed
different dates for counseling, which was rescheduled as per their Patna High Court CWJC No.6120
of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 own decision for one reason or the other. The counseling got staggered and it
is not a matter of dispute that the third round of counseling was done until 03.08.2014 and
admissions allowed and accepted till 11.08.2014. Thereafter the petitioners have been continuing
their studies without any let or hindrance.
4. While the petitioners were pursuing their Post Graduate education they came to know through
newspapers that their admissions are going to be annulled on the basis of a decision taken by the
M.C.I. on the purported ground that admission have been granted to such students after the cut-off
date fixed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It in the above background the petitioners had to seek
shelter of the Court.
5. The main thrust of the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that all these petitioners
were bona fide students and only after having been successful in the competitive examination and
counseling, held by the Board that they had been granted admission for studies in the Post Graduate
Courses. Since admission of these petitioners were permitted by the authorities saddled with the
responsibility of conducting the examination and counseling, the petitioners' future cannot be
jeopardized for any official delay committed by the Board in completing the counseling within the
time-frame.
6. It is nobody's case that there is any other omission or aberration in grant of admission to these
petitioners except that the Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 formality of
admission was delayed by about a month. Since the delay is not attributable to these petitioners,
therefore, they cannot be punished by terminating their admissions on that ground.
7. Counsel for the petitioners also demonstrated before this Court that many of these petitioners,
who have been made a victim, had been granted admission much before the cut-off date.
The only folly which they committed is that due to the on going counseling they got an opportunity
to opt for a course of their liking, which somehow extended to 8th of August, 2014.
8. Re-scheduling of the various rounds of counseling is established by the fact that public notices
were issued by the Board and petitioners have annexed some of those notices with the writ
applications to show that it was an official and conscious decision publicly made by the Board, since
it was prevented from completing the process of counseling within the fixed time-frame.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56951553/ 6
Dr. Tarunesh Sharma & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 18 July, 2016
9. Counsel for the petitioners also takes a plea that by allowing the impugned decision of the M.C.I.
to stay, would amount to giving a seal of approval to an act on which these petitioners had no
control or contribution to make.
10. In the peculiarity of facts, the Court directed the Board as well as M.C.I. to file their counter
affidavit. The counter affidavit has been filed in C. W. J. C. No. 6120 of 2016 and has been adopted
in all the writ applications by the respondents.
11. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Board Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016
dt.18-07-2016 they have explained themselves and accepted the fact of delayed counseling. The
Court would like to re-produce what the Board has offered as their explanation with regard to the
admission in the Post Graduate Course for the year 2014.
"7. That in the year 2014, the PGMAT-2014 was conducted on 09.03.2014 and the
merit-list based on PGMAT-2014 was published vide Advertisement no. BCECEB

Advertisement No. 2014/11, dated 28.03.2014. Accordingly the first round of
counseling based on PGMAT-2014 was held during the period from 19.04.2014 to
29.04.2014. During the aforesaid first round of the counseling all the qualified
candidates in each category were called and Course / Institution were allotted as per
the option of the candidate appearing in the counseling on merit-cum- choice basis
on the seats as allocated and provided by the Department of Health, Government of
Bihar. It is to point out that during the 1st counseling, the seats reserved for Medical
Officers, served in remote area of the State were not allotted in view of the fact that
the definition of remote area was not provided by the Department of Health,
Government of Bihar.
8. That after conclusion of the first round of the counseling based on PGMAT-2014
for the next and second of the counseling considering the delay in getting the
"definition" of remote area from the Department of Health, Government of Bihar, it
was decided to conduct second round of the counseling only after getting the
definition of remote area also Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016
dt.18-07-2016 through online allotment procedure.
Accordingly the Advertisement no. BCECEB (PGMAT)-2014 /07, dated 11.06.2014
was published by the BCECE Board. As per the aforesaid Advertisement, the options
were online invited from the candidates, who were desirous to participate in second
round of counseling in order to either change their Course / Institutions allotted
earlier (during the first round of counseling) or to exercise their option afresh on
available seats on merit-cum-
choice basis. The candidates, through the above said advertisement were asked to submit their
online options from dated 12.06.2014 to 17.06.2014. In the meantime the Department of Health,
Government of Bihar vide notification no. 2 / Court-59/13-695 (2), dated 17.06.2014, which was

received in BCECE Board office on 19.06.2014, communicated the "definition" of the remote area of

9. That the Department of Health, Government of Bihar prior to issuing the communication with
regard to definition of "remote / difficult areas" vide letter no. 2/Court- 59/13-695 (2), dated
17.06.2014 had directed to BCECE Board vide letter no. 2/Court-59/13-906 (2), dated 27.07.2013
that the matter regarding the decision of the "remote / difficult area" is under consideration of the
State Government and the same is defined and notified, no candidates be allowed to allot any seat
based on their certificate issued earlier for having worked three years in remote / difficult areas.
10. That it is pertinent to point out here that the provision contained in Para - 5.4 in the prospectus
of PGMAT-2014 reads as follows: -
(a) (i) 50 % of the seats in the Post Graduate Diploma Courses will be reserved for
Medical Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 Officers in the

12. That in view of the facts mentioned above, the completion of the process of Online seat
allotments of PG Medical courses during the second round of the counseling based on
PGMAT-2014, was completed only on 25.06.2014. Accordingly the details with regard to such
allotments of PG Medical seats during 2nd round of Online counseling was informed to the
Principals of the concerned Medical Colleges vide letter no. -1C/2014, dated 25.06.2014. Through
this letter all the Principals of the Medical Colleges were directed to complete the admission process
by 28.06.2014 and were requested to report regarding remaining vacancies on the same day.
13. That BCECE Board vide letter no.
1547/2014, dated 06.07.2014 had also requested Department of Health, to provide report regarding
remaining vacancies, inclusive of the surrendered Central quota seats latest by 07.07.2014, so that
the next round of allotment process and admissions based on those Patna High Court CWJC
No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 allotments could be completed upto 10.07.2014. (Within the period
as specified by the Hon'ble Apex Court). In response to the above vacancies provided by the
concerned Medical Colleges and finally signed by the authority / representative of the Department
of Health, Department of Heath were made available in BCECE Board only 19.07.2014.
14. That in this context it is pertinent to point out here that as per procedure adopted for the
convenience of the candidates, the vacancies / seat matrix (Institution wise / course wise / category
wise availabilities) are generally made public through different communication mode, such
uploading on website of the BCECE Board or / and publishing in leading local dailies of Bihar for

Dr. Tarunesh Sharma & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 18 July, 2016
16. That it is pertinent to mention here that the work and responsibility of BCECE Board is Patna
High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 confined to conduct PGMAT (Post Graduate
Medical Admission Test), publish merit-list and conduct counseling for allotment of PG Medical
seats. For carrying out such procedure, the Principals or their representative of concerned Medical
Colleges along with the representative of Department of Health, Government of Bihar recalled to
participate in counseling and allotment process. The role of the BCECE Board is limited to allotment
of PG Medical seats to eligible candidates on Merit-cum- choice basis but the admission based on
such allotments are to be taken by the concerned Medical Colleges after due verification and
following the requirements of the M.C.I. as the medical Colleges are the admitting authority.
17. That the BCECE Board has never thought remotely to violate the directives of the Hon'ble Apex
Court. The matter with regard to delay in conducting third round of the counseling and admissions
based on allotments made during third round of the counseling (after 10.07.2014) was only a
circumstantial compulsion. It is not out of the context to mention here that due to parliamentary
election in Bihar during the period from April-2014 to May-2014 had added the disturbance in
conducting third round of the counseling.
18. That it is pertinent to mention here that except the petitioner no. 5, Navin Kumar, all five
petitioners of the present writ applications were allotted course and Institutions during the first
counseling held during the period from 19.04.2014 to 29.04.2014. However, all the writ petitioners
(except petitioner no. 5) were re- allotted course and Institution against available vacancies after
10th of July 2014. As such they should not be construed having admitted Patna High Court CWJC
No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 afresh after the 10.07.2014, the last date fixed for admission in PG
Medical courses.
19. That in view of the matter explained above, the delay in allotments / admissions in PG Medical
course after 10.07.2014 may be considered as compelling situation and therefore condoned.
Accordingly the present writ application may be allowed and the MCI may be directed to restrain
from cancelling the admission of the writ petitioners for their getting admission after 10.07.2014."
12. If the stand of the Board is understood in its entirety then there was certain compelling reasons
as to why the exercise of counseling could not be completed before 10.07.2014, but to the credit of
the Board they have taken the onus upon themselves and have very fairly placed the factual position
before the Court and also taken a plea that under the above circumstances, the decision of M.C.I.
should not be acted upon. It is also evident that many of these petitioners had taken admission on
the basis of the 1st and 2nd counseling well before cut-off date. But because of options and openings
coming their way due to fresh counseling in courses which in their opinion was a better opening that
they are in this difficulty. It is contended, therefore, on behalf of the petitioners that it will not be
fair to make these petitioners suffer, merely because they took admission a second time over when
the initial opening or admission was allowed much before the cut-off date i.e. 10.07.2014.
13. Counsel, representing the M.C.I. takes a plea that Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016
dt.18-07-2016 they are bound by the directives and the calendar fixed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of Mridul Dhar Versus Union of India etc. and therefore, to maintain and enforce the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56951553/ 10

calendar, when the M.C.I. was made aware of admissions, having been granted to the petitioners
after the cut-off date, their hands were forced and the impugned orders with the directive was
issued.
14. Counsel, representing the Board, submits before the Court that there was neither any intent or
desire to breach any directive of the Hon'ble Apex Court, but their hands were forced for the reasons
explained in their counter affidavit and whatever decision was taken was done keeping in mind the
interest of the students in public domain and there was no hide and seek or any element of mischief
or mala fide involved.
15. Counsel for the petitioners submits that no doubt the cut-off date fixed by the Hon'ble Apex
Court is sacrosanct but the Hon'ble Apex Court itself in certain given facts and situation has given a
window of opening to the Courts to intervene in some rarest of rare cases or exceptional
circumstances. The present set of facts which speak for themselves is a fit case where the Court
should interfere keeping in mind the future and career of the students and non-interference with the
impugned decision will make or mar the entire life of these students.
16. Attention of the Court has been drawn to a decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court, which is the case
of Asha Versus Pt. BD Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 Sharma University of
Health Sciences, reported in 2012 (7) SCC 389.
Reliance is placed on paragraph 29 to 34, which are reproduced hereinbelow:-
29. However, the question that immediately follows is whether any mid-term
admission can be granted after 30th September of the concerned academic year
concerned, that being the last date for admissions. The respondents before us have
argued with some vehemence that it will amount to a mid-term admission which is
impermissible, will result in indiscipline and will cause prejudice to other candidates.
Reliance has been placed upon the judgments of this Court in Medical Council of India v. Madhu
Singh , Ms. Neelu Arora v. Union of India, Aman Deep Jaswal v. State of Punjab, Medical Council of
India v. Naina Verma,, Mridul Dhar v. Union of India.
30. There is no doubt that 30th September is the cut-off date. The authorities cannot grant
admission beyond the cut-off date which is specifically postulated. But where no fault is attributable
to a candidate and she is denied admission for arbitrary reasons, should the cut-off date be
permitted to operate as a bar to admission to such students particularly when it would result in
complete ruining of the professional career of a meritorious candidate, is the question we have to
answer. (emphasis mine)
31. Having recorded that the appellant is not at fault and she pursued her rights and remedies as
expeditiously as possible, we are of the considered view that the cut-off date Patna High Court
CWJC No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 cannot be used as a technical instrument or tool to deny
admission to meritorious students. The rule of merit stands completely defeated in the facts of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56951553/ 11
Dr. Tarunesh Sharma & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 18 July, 2016
present case. The appellant was a candidate placed higher in the merit list. It cannot be disputed
that candidates having merit much lower to her have already been given admission in the MBBS
course. The appellant had attained 832 marks while the students who had attained 821, 792, 752,
740 and 731 marks have already been given admission in the ESM category in the MBBS course. It is
not only unfortunate but apparently unfair that the appellant be denied admission.
32. Though there can be rarest of rare cases or exceptional circumstances where the courts may have
to mould the relief and make exception to the cut-off date of 30th September, but in those cases, the
Court must first return a finding that no fault is attributable to the candidate, the candidate has
pursued her rights and legal remedies expeditiously without any delay and that there is fault on the
part of the authorities and apparent breach of some rules, regulations and principles in the process
of selection and grant of admission. Where denial of admission violates the right to equality and
equal treatment of the candidate, it would be completely unjust and unfair to deny such exceptional
relief to the candidate. Refer Arti Sapru v. State of J & K, Chhavi Mehrotra v. Director General
Health Services, Aravind Kumar Kankane v. State of UP. (emphasis mine)
33. We must hasten to add at this stage Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of 2016 dt.18-07-2016 that
even if these conditions are satisfied, still, the court would be called upon to decide whether the
relief should or should not be granted and, if granted, should it be with or without compensation.
34. This brings us to the last phase of this case as to what relief, if any, the appellant is entitled to.
Having returned a finding on merits in favour of the appellant, the Court has to grant relief to the
appellant even, if necessary, by moulding the relief appropriately and in accordance with law. This
Court must do complete justice between the parties, particularly, where the legitimate right of the
appellant stands frustrated because of inaction or inappropriate action on the part of the concerned
respondents. In fact, normally keeping in view the factual matrix of this case, we would have
directed the admission of the appellant to the MBBS course in the academic year 2011-2012 and
would further have directed the respondents to pay compensation to the appellant towards the
mental agony and expense of litigation and the valuable period of her life that stands wasted for
failure on the part of the respondents to adhere to the proper procedure of selection and admission
process. May be the Court would have granted this relief subject to some further conditions.
However, we are unable to grant this relief to the appellant in its totality for reasons of her own
doing. She has completely faulted in pursuing her academic course in accordance with the Rules and
like a diligent student should do. "

17. If the above principle laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court is taken into
consideration, then the Court does feel that there is no hanky panky in granting
admissions to these petitioners after the cut-off date. The reason for delay has been
well explained by the authorities, who are saddled with the responsibility of not only
holding of examination, but also the counseling and that these petitioners have had
no role in delaying the admission after the cut-

off date. In fact many of them had already taken admission well before the cut-off
date but for sake of argument if it can be said that it is the indiscretion on their part
to take admission afresh because of opening which was provided to them then it is
not a case of any mischief or an effort made to over-reach the guidelines or the cut-off
date fixed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.
18. The Court, however, does feel that Board should have approached the authorities
or may be even the Apex Court for permitting them to complete the process of
counseling if they faced certain difficulty in the year 2014 that should have been in
fairness of things.
19. However, in totality the Court comes to a considered opinion that in the interest
of justice and keeping in mind the future, which is at stake of these students and their
bona fide being above board, the impugned orders, dated 02.12.2015 and 21.01.2016,
contained in Annexure-4, is required to be quashed. Petitioners should be permitted
to complete their studies without further dispute Patna High Court CWJC No.6120 of
2016 dt.18-07-2016 on this aspect of the matter.
Keeping the aforesaid facts and circumstances in mind, writ applications stands
allowed.
