dated 22/11/2024 and consequentially allow the

7. Thereafter the authorities have again issued a fresh allotment letter no. 951 dated 12.09.2025
(Annexure-X) whereby the number of godowns earlier allotted to the petitioners have been reduced.
8. Learned senior counsel Shri. Ramakant Sharma has submitted that once the petitioner has been
empanelled as a DSD contractor and an agreement entered between the parties, the authorities
cannot rescind from the same and reduce the godowns which were earlier allotted to the petitioner.
Learned counsel has stated that the petitioners have invested huge amounts in procuring the
necessary vehicles and also manpower for transporting the foodgrains from the godowns which were
allotted to them and due to the unilateral reduction of the work vide impugned order vide memo No.
961 dated 12.09.2025 (Annexure- X) the petitioners would suffer irreparable loss. Learned counsel
has, therefore, prayed this Hon'ble Court to allow the present writ petition and set aside the
impugned order dated 12.09.2025 (Annexure- X).
9. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the BSFC has vehemently opposed the very
maintainability of the present writ petition.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12433 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025
10. Learned counsel for the respondents has stated that the total sanctioned posts in the Bettiah
district are nine and on an earlier occasion i.e. vide NIT No. 665 dated 22.07.2024 (Annexure- P/1)
five posts were advertised, out of which four persons were selected i.e. the petitioners herein and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53963424/ 4
Sanjay Kumar Singh vs The Bihar State Food And Civil Supplies ... on 14 October, 2025
thereafter another NIT has been issued vide NIT No. 630 (Annexure- P/10) wherein four posts have
been advertised out of which three persons have been selected. Learned counsel has submitted that
the order dated 12.09.2025 vide memo no. 961 (Annexure- X) only shows the consolidated list of the
contractors who were selected under the two NITs i.e. the NIT No. 665 and dated 22.07.2024 and
NIT No. 630 dated 28.06.2025 and also the allotment of godowns. Learned counsel has submitted
that the respondent authority is well within their rights to allot the work as per the volume of the
work and the petitioner cannot have any vested right to contend that the authorities cannot change
the number of godowns allotted to the petitioners as per the earlier allotment letter dated
26.11.2024 (Annexure- P/7). Learned counsel has drawn the attention of the Court to the agreement
entered between the petitioners and the respondent- Corporation dated 22.11.2024 (Annexure- P/3)
specifically to clause- XIV. Learned counsel has stated that the authority has only rationalised the
work allotted to Patna High Court CWJC No.12433 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 the petitioners and other
contractors who were selected/empanelled under the NIT No. 630 dated 28.06.2025. Further
learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that the petitioners have not challenged the
NIT No. 630 dated 28.06.2025 whereby the advertisement for four posts were given out of which
three persons have been selected. That once the authority has selected the contractors under the
NIT No. 630 dated 28.06.2025, they were bound to allot the godowns as per the requirements and
volume of work involved and rationalise the entire operation. Learned counsel has, therefore,
prayed for dismissing the present writ petition.
11. Admittedly as seen from the pleadings as well as the material filed by both the parties, the
petitioners have been empanelled as DSD contractors pursuant to the NIT No. 665 dated
22.07.2024. Further, it is also not in dispute that three other contractors have been selected under
the NIT No. 630 dated 28.06.2025. It is pertinent to note that the petitioners were selected
pursuant to the NIT No. 665 dated 22.07.2024 and an agreement was entered between the
petitioners and the respondents vide agreement dated 22.11.2024. Thereafter the allotment of work
has been given to the petitioners vide allotment letter dated 26.11.2024 (Annexure- P/7). The fact
remains that there were only four Patna High Court CWJC No.12433 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025
empanelled contractors at that relevant point of times and basing on the requirements of the
corporations, the allotment letter dated 26.11.2024 has been issued. The contention of the
petitioners that the said allotment letter cannot be meddled with or modified is without any legal
basis as it is not disputed that there are total of nine sanctioned posts and subsequently the
authority have also issued NIT No. 630 dated 28.06.2025 for empanelling four more contractors
after which three persons were selected. Once the number of empanelled contractors is increased,
the consequential action would be to rationalise the work and allot the godowns to all the seven
contractors which are within the district. Further, it is to be noted that the petitioner have not
challenged the NIT No. 630 dated 28.06.2025 or the empanelment of the three contractors done
under the said NIT. Once the number of contractors increases, the authorities are well within their
right to re-distribute the godowns between the seven empanelled contractors and in furtherance of
the same, the allotment letter no. 951 of 12.09.2025 (Annexure-X) has been issued. Further, it is to
be noted that as per Clause- 14 of the agreement entered between the parties which reads as under:
"XIV. Volume of Work:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53963424/ 5
Sanjay Kumar Singh vs The Bihar State Food And Civil Supplies ... on 14 October, 2025
(a) Subject as here in after mentioned, the Corporation does not guarantee any
definite volume of work or any particular pattern of service, at any time or
throughout the period of the contract. The mere mention Patna High Court CWJC
No.12433 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 of any item of work in this contract does not by itself
confirm a right on the contract or to demand that the work relating to all or any item
thereof should necessarily or exclusively be entrusted to him.
(b) The corporation have the exclusive right to appoint one or more contractors at
any time viz at the time of award of the contract and/or during the tenure of contract
for any or all the service sand to divide the work as between such contract or seen any
manner that the Corporation may decide and no claim shall lie against the
corporation by reason of such division of work.
(c) If the contractor is required to perform any service in addition those specifically
provided for in the contract, the remuneration for the same will be paid at the rates
as negotiated and fixed by mutual agreement.
(d) The question whether a particular service is or is not covered by any of the
services specifically described and provided for in the contract, or is not auxiliary or
incidental to any of such services shall be decided by the District Manager whose
decision shall be final and binding on the contractor.
(e) The Contractor will have the right to represent in writing to the District Manager
(Bettiah), that a particular service which he is being called upon to perform is not
covered by any of the services specifically provided for in the contract, or is not
auxiliary or incidental to such services, provided that such representation in writing
must be made within 15 days after the date of actual performance of such services. If
no such representation in writing is received within the said time, the contractor's
right in this regard will be deemed to have been waived.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12433 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 NOTE:- Notwithstanding the numbers
and storage capacity of the existing Godowns and those expected to be constructed/acquired during
the contract period the description of which is given in the tender, the Corporation may, during the
currency of the contract, take over/acquire/construct more Godowns for storage as and when
necessary. Alternatively, it may also be necessary for the corporation to give up or release one or
more Godowns out of those, which are later constructed/acquired later during the Pendency of the
contract. In such an event the contract shall not be rendered void and the contractor shall not be
entitled to make any claim whatsoever against the Corporation for compensation, revision of rates
or otherwise due to increase/decrease in the number of Godowns or the storage capacity of the
Godowns."
12. A reading of the above clause makes it abundantly clear that the authorities are well within their
rights to re-distribute the godowns between the selected/empanelled contractors and the petitioner
as a matter of right cannot contend that the earlier allotment letter dated 26.11.2024 (Annexure-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53963424/ 6
Sanjay Kumar Singh vs The Bihar State Food And Civil Supplies ... on 14 October, 2025
P/7) cannot be modified or meddled with.
13. Having regard to the above mentioned facts and circumstances, this Court does not find any
merit in the present writ petition which warrants any interference by this Hon'ble Court.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12433 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025
14. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed, however, without costs.
