3. The first bail application of applicant was rejected by this Court vide order dated 30.10.2023,
which is reproduced as under :-
"1. Heard Sri Gopal Swaroop Chaturvedi, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Sri
Saurabh Raj Srivastava, learned counsel for the applicant, learned counsel for the
informant and Sri P. C. Srivastava, learned Additional Advocate General for the State
of U. P. along with learned A. G. A.
2. The present bail application has been filed by the applicant in Case Crime No. 194
of 2021, under Sections-147, 149, 452, 323, 504, 506, 307, 511, 392, 120-B IPC, P.
S.-Jaitpura, District-Varanasi, with the prayer to enlarge the applicant on bail.
3. Learned Senior Advocate submitted that the applicant is innocent and he has been
falsely implicated in this case. The father of the applicant has been a member of
Legislative Assembly for four times and his mother has also been an Ex. M. L. C. and
that the prosecution case is wholly false and baseless and has been lodged with
malafide intention. No specific date or time of incident or specific role has been
mentioned in the first information report. The complainant has made his statement
by submitting a typed statement after eleven days of the incident. The alleged first
incident has been shown of 22.12.2020 and first information report has been lodged
after nine months of the same. There is long and undue delay in recording the
statement of the witnesses.
4. Learned counsel has referred the version of the first information report and
submitted that the entire family of the applicant was named in the first information
report and that it is not probable that the applicant along with his entire family
members, including his sisters, would trespass into the house of the informant and
would threaten her.
5. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that in fact, in the month of August, 2020 a
business dispute arose between Krishna Mohan Tiwari and mother of the applicant,
regarding partnership firm, M/s Krishna Mohan Tiwari. In order to grab the
partnership business, the said Krishna Mohan Tiwari has lodged a case against the
family members of applicant and that there are multiple civil and criminal cases
pending between both the parties. It was submitted that the said Krishna Mohan
Tiwari has planted the complainant and a false first information report was got
lodged vide Case Crime No. 379 of 2020 under Sections-376 D, 342, 506 I. P. C. at
Police Station-Gopiganj, district-Bhadohi, to settle political scores. The said first
information report was registered on 18.10.2020, whereas, the incident was shown of
the year, 2014. There is nexus between Krishna Mohan Tiwari and complainant of
that case. The said Krsihna Mohan Tiwari and his sons were shown witnesses in that
matter. In said Case Crime No. 379 of 2020, the complainant / alleged victim has
already been examined and thus, there is no possibility of tampering with evidence.
In that matter earlier the applicant could not surrender as he was having serious
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176450544/ 2
Vishnu Mishra vs State Of U.P. on 3 March, 2025
apprehension / threat to his life, but he was arrested on 24.7.2022 and since then, he
is in jail. Referring to the dispute between family of the applicant and said Krishna
Mohan Tiwari, it was pointed out that Krishna Mohan Tiwari and his sons and
complainant of this case, have lodged as many as sixteen frivolous first information
reports against the family members of the applicant. Further, the said witnesses
Krishna Mohan Tiwari is having criminal history of ten cases, including the case of
murder and rape. The complainant is a lady of dubious character and she is running a
racket of honey trap. Earlier on 22.6.2017 she has lodged one first information report
vide Case Crime No. 430 of 2017, under Sections- 354 A, 504, 506 I.P.C. against one
Manoj Sharma on similar lines and after investigation police have submitted final
report. She had filed a complaint before the S. S. P., Varanasi against her
brother-in-law and in that matter also, final report was submitted. She has lodged
one first information report against one Triloki Singh, who is a leader of Aam Aadmi
Party (AAP) and that in every case later on either she compromised the matter or
police submitted final report. The complainant has also been involved in Hawala
racket and she was intercepted by the custom officers for possessing illegal foreign
currency and that she is having two passports. It was submitted that the complainant
is continuously involved in criminal activities.
6. In the first information report of this case, no date or time of the alleged incident
has been mentioned and there is long delay in recording the statement of the
witnesses. The investigation has not been conducted properly. Referring to the first
information report, it was submitted that no offence under Section-307 or 392 IPC is
made out. There is no independent witness of alleged incident. Further, co-accused
Vikas Mishra and Satish Mishra have been granted bail and co-accused Dr. Mukesh
Tiwari, Smt. Garima Tiwari, Mrs. Reema Pandey, Mrs. Beema Dubey and Mr. Raj
Dubey alias Pankaj Dubey have already been granted anticipatory bail. Criminal
history of two cases was shown against the applicant, which has duly been explained.
However, after this case, the applicant-accused has been shown to be involved in
several other cases, which has duly been explained in the affidavit.
7. Referring to the facts of the matter, learned Senior Advocate submitted that the
allegations made in the first information report are wholly false and this case has
been lodged with ulterior motive and that investigation has not been conducted
properly and in view of the aforesaid facts, the applicant is entitled for being released
on bail.
8. Learned A. G. A. as well as learned counsel for the informant have vehemently
opposed the bail application and submitted that the applicant is named in the first
information report. It was submitted that there are serious allegations against the
applicant. Earlier rape was committed upon the complainant by the applicant and
co-accused Vijay Mishra and Vikas Mishra and that the applicant-accused was
continuously absconding and that the accused persons were threatening the
complainant to submit affidavit in their favour and to change her statement and due
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176450544/ 3
Vishnu Mishra vs State Of U.P. on 3 March, 2025
to that reason, all the accused persons, including the applicant, have trespassed into
house of the complainant and threatened that earlier co-accused Vijay Mishra has got
murdered one Constable Surya Mani Mishra and if she did not make statement in
their favour, she would also be met with the same fate and that they have also tried to
snatch her mobile phone. The applicant has remained absconder for long time and
there is criminal history of eight cases, including a case under the Gangster Act,
against the applicant. The statement of complainant has not been recorded in this
case so far and if the applicant was released on bail, he may threaten the complainant
and witnesses and may tamper with the evidence.
9. Learned counsel for the informant further submitted that the applicant is an
accused in Case Crime No. 379 of 2020, under Sections-376 D, 342, 506 I. P. C. and
that the victim of the said case was threatened in order to force her to enter into
compromise. In that matter after issuance of non-bailable warrants, process under
Section-82/83 Cr. P. C. were also issued against the accused persons and the
applicant-accused was declared as proclaimed offender and that a Case under Section
174-A I. P. C. was also registered against him. The version of the complainant is
supported by several witnesses. It was submitted that after the applicant was
arrested, an A. K.-47 rifle, pistol and cartridges were recovered at his pointing out
and in that connection, a report has been lodged against him as Case Crime No. 230
of 2020, under Sections-3/7/25 of Arms Act. Earlier he was granted by this Court in
Case Crime No. 194/2021, under Sections-147, 148, 149, 452, 323, 504, 506, 307, 511,
392, 120-B I. P. C. and that bail was cancelled by Hon'ble Apex Court vide order
dated 28.4.2023. It was submitted that the statement of the complainant has not
been recorded before the trial Court so far and that, if the applicant was granted bail,
he may tamper with evidence.
10. I have considered the rival submissions and perused the record.
11. Perusal of Record shows that on 18.10. 2020 the informant has lodged an FIR vide
case Crime No. 379 of 2020 under section 376 D, 342 and 506 IPC against the
applicant and accused Vijay Mishra and Vikas Mishra making allegations of gang
rape. First information of this case was lodged on 13.9.2021, wherein, it was alleged
that the applicant and co -accused persons were threatening and pressurizing the
informant to change her statement, in the said gang rape case, in their favour and it
was also alleged that the applicant and co-accused have trespassed into the house of
the informant and they assaulted and threatened her. It was shown that in the said
earlier case registered as Case Crime No. 379 of 2020, the applicant accused did not
surrender for long time and he has continuously absconded and due to these reasons,
the process under Sections-82 and 83 Cr.P.C. was executed and after that a case
under Section 174-A IPC was also registered against the applicant and co-accused
persons and after that the applicant was arrested on 24.7.2022. In Case Crime No.
230 of 2020, one A. K.-47 rifle and pistol were shown recovered at the instance of the
applicant accused. It was also shown that in one of the cases, Case Crime No. 194 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176450544/ 4
Vishnu Mishra vs State Of U.P. on 3 March, 2025
2020, the applicant-accused was granted bail by this Court but the same was
cancelled by the Hon'ble Apex Court. Though it was pointed out that in Case Crime
No. 379 of 2020 the statement of informant/ victim has already been recorded but in
the present case, statement of informant is yet to be recorded and an apprehension
was expressed on behalf of the prosecution and the informant that in case the
applicant was granted bail, he may threaten the informant and temper with evidence.
12. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, at this stage, no case for bail is
made out. Hence the bail application of applicant-accused is hereby rejected.
However, after statement of informant of this case is recorded before the trial Court
or in case no substantial progress is made in the trial within a period of six months
from today, the applicant-accused would be at liberty to move a fresh bail application
in accordance with law.
13. With the aforesaid observations, the bail application is rejected."
4. It is submitted by learned Senior Advocate that applicant is innocent and he has been falsely
implicated on account of political enmity, as father of applicant is Ex. Member of Legislative
Assembly. The entire family of applicant was named in the first information report and the
allegations made by the complainant are wholly improbable. Referring to first information report, it
was submitted that applicant was not present at the spot and that no case under Section ? 120-B
I.P.C. is made out against applicant. No date or time of alleged incident has been mentioned and
there is nothing to show that complainant has sustained any injury. There is long and undue delay in
lodging of the first information report and alleged eye witnesses Babul Dubey and Amit Singh, who
are residents of Mumbai, have been introduced later on.
5. It was submitted that there was business dispute between one Krishna Mohan Tiwari and mother
of applicant in respect to partnership firm M/s Krishna Mohan Tiwari. There is nexus between said
Krishna Mohan Tiwari and complainant of this case. It was stated that while rejecting first bail
application of applicant vide order dated 30.10.2023, the applicant was given liberty to move fresh
bail application after statement of informant is recorded before the trial court or if no substantial
progress is made in the trial within a period of six months. Perusal of order-sheet of Trial court
shows that informant did not appear before the trial court for long, whereas a period of seven
months has been passed since then. In Case Crime No. 379 of 2020 applicant has already been
acquitted by the trial court. Co-accused Reema Pandey, Beema Dubey, Dr. Mukesh Tiwari and
Garima Tiwari have been granted anticipatory bail and co-accused Ratan Mishra is on interim
anticipatory bail. Similarly co-accused Manish Mishra, Vikas Mishra and Satish Mishra have been
granted bail. It is further submitted that prior to 04.08.2020, applicant has previous criminal
history of only two cases and after this case, applicant has been implicated in eight more cases. The
criminal history of applicant has been explained in affidavit filed in support of the bail application.
6. Per contra, learned Additional Advocate General as well as learned counsel for the informant,
have vehemently opposed the prayer of bail and submitted that applicant along with Vijay Mishra
was also accused in Crime No. 379 of 2020, under Sections ? 376-D, 342, 506 I.P.C., Police Station ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176450544/ 5
Vishnu Mishra vs State Of U.P. on 3 March, 2025
Gopiganj, District ? Bhadohi. The accused persons have threatened the complainant of that case and
thus, instant case was lodged. The applicant has absconded and process under Section ? 82 and 83
Cr.P.C. was executed against him and a case under Section ? 174-A I.P.C. was also registered. In
Crime No. 273 of 2020, the anticipatory bail application of applicant was rejected by the Hon'ble
Apex Court. When applicant was arrested, an A.K.-47, pistol and cartridges were recovered at his
instance.
7. Learned Additional Advocate General has referred facts of the matter and submitted that
statement of informant is being recorded before the trial court and in case applicant is granted bail,
there is possibility that he may threaten the informant and other witnesses. It was submitted that
bail application of co-accused Manish Mishra was allowed by this Court vide order dated
07.05.2024, which was challenged by the informant before the Hon'ble Apex Court vide S.L.P.
Criminal Diary No. 22192 of 2024, wherein notice was issued to the respondent-accused and it was
directed that respondent no.1 (co-accused Manish Mishra) shall not be released in connection with
F.I.R. No. 194 of 2021, Police Station - Jaitpura, District ? Varanasi (present case). Learned
Additional Advocate General has referred contents of counter affidavit and submitted that there are
serious allegations against applicant and in view of his previous conduct of abscondence, applicant
is not entitled for bail. It was further submitted that in case applicant is granted bail, there is every
possibility that he may threaten the informant and witnesses and would tamper with evidence.
8. I have considered the rival submissions and perused the record.
9. Perusal of record shows that first bail application of applicant was rejected by this Court vide
order dated 30.10.2023, however the applicant was given liberty to file fresh bail application after
statement of informant is recorded or if no substantial progress is made within a period of six
months. Though, a period of one year has been passed since then but it was stated that examination
of informant is in progress before the Trial court and her statement is yet to be completed. However,
examination of informant has been started after several months after rejection of first bail
application of applicant. It appears from record that earlier informant has lodged Case Crime No.
379 of 2020, under Sections ? 376-D, 342, 506 I.P.C., making allegations of gang rape against
applicant, Vijay Mishra and Vikas Mishra. The main allegation of informant in the instant case is
that the applicant and co-accused persons have threatened the informant in order to pressurize her
to compromise the said Case Crime No. 379 of 2020. Co-accused Manish Mishra was granted bail by
this Court vide order dated 07.05.2024 and it was shown that informant has challenged said order
before the Hon'ble Apex Court, wherein by order dated 17.05.2024, notice was issued to the
respondent and it was directed that respondent shall not be released in the instant matter (F.I.R.
No. 194 of 2021). Thus, the bail matter of co-accused Manish Mishra is yet to be decided by the
Hon'ble Apex Court. Criminal history of 11 cases has been shown against applicant. However, it was
shown in above referred Case Crime No. 379 of 2020, applicant has been acquitted by the Trial
court. Two cases shown in criminal history were withdrawn by the prosecution and in one case he
has been discharged. It was also shown that after the above referred Crime No. 379 of 2020 was
registered, applicant has absconded and process under Section ? 82 and 83 Cr.P.C. was issued
against him and that when he was arrested, one A.K.-47 rifle and pistol were recovered at his
instance. It was further shown that in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No. 7571 of 2024 filed before
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176450544/ 6
Vishnu Mishra vs State Of U.P. on 3 March, 2025
the Hon'ble Apex Court against grant of bail to co-accused Manish Mishra on 23.09.2024, the
matter was adjourned by the Hon'ble Apex Court by considering the fact that statement of
informant was not recorded before the Trial Court. Taking cumulative effect of all the facts and
circumstances of the matter, no case for bail is made out, at this stage.
10. Accordingly, the instant second bail application filed on behalf of the applicant - Vishnu Mishra
is rejected.
11. However, the Trial Court is directed to expedite the proceedings of the trial and to complete the
examination of informant, as early as possible.
12. A copy of this order be forwarded to the concerned trial court for necessary compliance.
