For Petitioner : Mr.Joseph Prabakar
For Respondent : Ms.Anu Ganesan
Junior Panel Counsel
ORDER
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Junior Panel Counsel for the
respondent. I have perused the records and the decisions cited by the learned counsel for the
petitioner and the learned Junior Panel Counsel for the respondent. I have also perused the circular
dated 29.12.2017 which was furnished today by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
2. The facts are not in dispute. It is the case of the petitioner that the Transferor Company namely
the Quest Global Engineering Services Private Limited stood merged with the petitioner. It is
submitted that the said Transferor Company had raised invoices during the month of June, July,
August and September, 2017 on their client/customer namely M/s.Caterpillar India Private Limited
and had discharged the Tax liability particularly under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1994 and
the respective GST Acts, 2017.
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
3. It is the specific case of the petitioner that after the amalgamation of the said Transferor Company
namely Quest Global Engineering Services Private Limited with the petitioner, pursuant to the order
of the National Company Law Tribunal on 01.10.2017, the data/ informations in the system of the
said transferor company were integrated with the data/information of the petitioner.
4.It is submitted that by mistake, the system picked the same invoices on which service tax was paid
by the transferor company and which were reflected in the returns for the period between June,
July, August and September 2017 on 01.11.2017 and tax was paid by the petitioner without either
actually supplying service to the their customer or by raising corresponding invoice on the customer.
5. It is further case of the petitioner that all the invoices which are dated 01.11.2017 in the returns
were never generated by the petitioner.
However, the petitioner ended up paying tax on account of invoice numbers being generated on
01.11.2017.

x. Circular No.26/26/2017-GST dated 29.12.2017.
7. The learned Junior Panel Counsel defending the stand of the respondent submits that the
petitioner has neither filed any records to substantiate that the tax was paid on an earlier occasion
between June, July, August and September 2017 nor has produced any proof to substantiate that
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the said customer namely M/s.Caterpillar India
Private Limited had not availed Input Tax Credit based on the invoice raised by the petitioner.
8.The learned Junior Panel Counsel for the respondent further submits that the limitation under
Section 54 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the CGST Act)
also makes it clear that even if tax was paid by mistake on account of non-supply of any service
either wholly or partially, for which no invoices were raised or issued or where a refund voucher had
been issued cannot be ignored under explanation to Section 54 of the CGST Act.
9.It is submitted that in this case, the tax was admittedly paid on 01.11.2017. Therefore, the refund
claim should have been filed within two year from the date of payment of tax by the petitioner. Since
the refund claim was filed on 30.05.2020, long after the expiry of limitation prescribed under
Section 54 of the CGST Act, 2017, the respondent was justified in rejecting the refund claim of the
partitioner as time barred.
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
10.The learned Junior Panel Counsel for the respondent also submits that even as per the decision
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mafatlal Industries Vs Union of India, 1997 (89) ELT 247 (S.C)
except in the case of unconstitutional levy, limitations prescribed under the Act cannot be
overlooked. It is further submitted that in this case, admittedly, tax was paid under the provisions of
the Finance Act, 1994 and CGST Act, 2017 on 01.11.2017 and therefore the petitioner's refund claim
was beyond the period specified under the Act.
11.By way of re-joinder, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that even as per C.B.E & C.
Circular No.26/26/2017-GST, F.No.349/164/2017-GST dated 29.12.2017, the amount paid in excess
has to be refunded to the petitioner.

Quest Global Engineering Services ... vs The Deputy Commissioner on 21 December, 2021
12.It is submitted that all the issues arising out of the difficulties experienced during first year
during the implementation of GST has been explained. A reference was made to Paragraph 3.3 of
the above circular which reads as under:-
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
3. Amendment/corrections/rectification of errors:
3.1 Various representations have been received wherein registered have requested for
clarification on the procedure for rectification of errors made while filing their FORM
GSTR-3B. In this regard, Circular No.7/7/2017-
GST, dated 1st September 2017 [2017 (4) G.S.T.L.C23] was issued which clarified that errors
committed while filing FORM GSTR-3B may be rectified while filing FORM GSTR-1 and FORM
GSTR-2 of the same month. Further, in the said circular, it was clarified that the system will
automatically reconcile the data submitted in FORM GSTR-3B with FORM GSTR-1 and FORM
GSTR-2, and the variations if any will either be offset against output tax liability or added to the
output tax liability of the subsequent months of the registered person.
3.2 Since, the GST Council has decided that the time period of filing of FORM GSTR-2 and FORM
GSTR-3 for the month of July 2017 to March 2018 would be worked out by a Committee of officers,
the system based reconciliation prescribed under Circular No.7/7/2017-GST, dated 1st September
2017 can only be operationalized after the relevant notification is issued. The said circular is
therefore kept in abeyance till such time.
3.3 The common errors while submitting FORM GSTR-3B and the steps needed to be taken to
rectify the same are provided in the table annexed herewith. The registered person needs to decide
at which stage of filing of FORM GSTR-3B he is currently at and also the error committed by him.
The corresponding column in the table provides the steps to be followed by him to rectify such
error.” ____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
13.The learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention to illustrations given in Paragraph 8
which reads as under:-
8. Stage 1 – Confirmed Submission Company B had reported an inter-State sale but
realized that the same sale was counted twice and hence was not to be reported. But
the return form was already submitted and no change could be done to the liabilities.
What can company B do?
In this case, Company B has the option to use the “edit” facility to reduce such liability and proceed
to file their return.
Stage 2 – Cash Ledger Updated Company B had reported an inter-State sale but realized that the
same sale was counted twice and hence was not to be reported or taxed. But the return form was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106596896/ 4
Quest Global Engineering Services ... vs The Deputy Commissioner on 21 December, 2021
already submitted and no change could be done to reduce the liabilities. Further, the company had
already deposited cash in their cash ledger before realizing this error. What can company B do?
In this case, Company B has the option to use the “edit” facility to reduce such liability. Once, this is
done, they can partially debit their cash ledger to offset their tax liability. Further, remaining
balance can either be claimed as refund or used to offset future liabilities.
Stage 3 – Offset Liability Company B had reported an inter-State sale but realized that the same sale
was counted twice and hence was not to be reported or taxed.
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis But the return form was already filed and no
change could be done to reduce the liabilities. What can company B do?
In this case, they may reduce this liability in the return of subsequent months or claim refund of the
same.
14.I have considered the arguments advanced on behalf of the either side. Section 54(1) of the CGST
Act, 2017 reads as under:-
“Section 54 - refund of Tax:-
(1) Any person claiming refund of any tax and interest, if any, paid on such tax or any
other amount paid by him, may make an application before the expiry of two years
from the relevant date in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that a registered person, claiming refund of any balance in the electronic
cash ledger in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (6) of section 49, may
claim such refund in the return furnished under section 39 in such manner as may be
prescribed.”
15. Explanation to Section 54 of the CGST Act, 2017 defines the expression refund and relevant date
for the purpose of the above provision.
They are reproduced as under:-
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Explanation: For the purpose of
section:-
(1) "refund" includes refund of tax paid on zero-rated supplies of goods or services or
both or on inputs or input services used in making such zero -rated supplies, or
refund of tax on the supply of goods regarded as deemed exports, or refund of
unutilized input tax credit as provided under sub-section (3).
(2) "relevant date" means-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106596896/ 5
Quest Global Engineering Services ... vs The Deputy Commissioner on 21 December, 2021
(a) in the case of goods exported out of India where a refund of tax paid is available in
respect of goods themselves or, as the case may be, the inputs or input services used
in such goods,
(i) if the goods are exported by sea or air, the date on which the ship or the aircraft in
which such goods are loaded, leaves India; or
(ii) if the goods are exported by land, the date on which such goods pass frontier; or
(iii) if the goods are exported by post, the date of despatch of goods by the Post Office
concerned to a place outside India;
(b)......
(c)....
(d)....
(e).....
(f) ...
(g) ...
(h) in any other case, the date of payment of tax.
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
16. In this case, the tax was paid on 20.12.2017. Thus, the refund claim if it was to be filed ought to
have been filed by the petitioner within the period of limitation prescribed under the Act. The refund
claim should have been filed on or before 19.12.2019. However, refund claim was filed only on
30.05.2020. The refund claim was thus beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 54
of the CGST Act, 2017.
17. In fact, if there was a wrong entry as was argued, the petitioner should have taken steps for
rectification of the returns under proviso to Sub Section (9) to Section 39 of the Act.
18. However, in this case, the petitioner has given a specific date or the invoice ie. 1.11.2017 and paid
tax. Therefore, refund under Section 54 of the TNGST & CGST Act, 2017 cannot be entertained the
respondent.
19. Sub-clause 8 to Section 54 of the Act is attracted only if such claim refund claim is admissible
and is made within two years from the relevant date. This is evident from a reading of sub-clause (c)
to sub-section 8 to Section 54 of the respective GST enactments which read as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106596896/ 6
Quest Global Engineering Services ... vs The Deputy Commissioner on 21 December, 2021
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis “(8) ...
(a) ...
(b) ...
(c) refund of tax paid on a supply which is not provided, either wholly or partially,
and for which invoice has not been issued, or where a refund voucher has been
issued.”
20. The circular which has been issued sought to be relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner
will apply only in a case where the Company had reported supply twice. However, in this case the
petitioner has generated invoice number and date.
21. The option available to the petitioner was to request its customer/client M/s.Caterpillar India
Private Limited to issue an appropriate credit notes to neutrilize the alleged excess payment of GST
while generating and issuing invoices dated 01.11.2017 details of which was captured in their regular
return and tax was paid.
22. The refund claim filed by the petitioner is clearly barred under the limitation prescribed under
Section 54(1) of the respective enactments read with explanation (h) which has been extracted
above.
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
23. The petitioner has to workout with its customer/client M/s.Caterpillar India Private Limited and
neturalize the incidence of alleged wrong /excess payment of tax.
24. This Writ Petition is therefore liable to be dismissed and it is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Consequently, connected Writ Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
