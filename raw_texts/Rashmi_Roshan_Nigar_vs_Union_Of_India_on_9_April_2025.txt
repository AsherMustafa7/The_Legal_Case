Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
opposite party No.4 giving her the status of ―wife(cid:129), the instant writ petitioner has
been filed.
Facts:
2. The relevant facts as adumbrated in the writ petition by the petitioner are stated
herein below.
2.1. The petitioner claiming to have got married to the opposite party No.4 on
25.06.2006 alleged to have been ill-treated in her in-law's house which compelled her
to leave her matrimony. On the intervention of gentlemen, both the petitioner and
the opposite party No.4 got married again as per Islamic ritual. A Nikahnama dated
12.12.2008 was issued by Government Qazi and on the same day both have executed
marriage agreement before Notary Public mentioning therein that the Government
Qazi performed Nikah on 12.12.2008 in the Kendrapara Police Station premises.
2.2. Though they led conjugal life in the matrimonial home, the opposite party No.4
left for his place of work after some days. Since she was subjected to cruelty, an F.I.R.
was lodged alleging offence under Sections 498A/506/ 34, Indian Penal Code, 1860 in the
Kendrapara Police Station. Consequently, in G.R. Case No.308 of 2009, the opposite party No.4 was
arrested from his place of work, i.e., Indian Air Force at Chandigarh and got released on bail. Having
surrendered before the learned Sub- Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Kendrapara, the opposite party
No.4 was enlarged on bail by Order dated 22.08.2009. The police filed charge sheet in the
meanwhile and the case is pending trial.
2.3. The petitioner, residing at a short stay home, instituted a case under the Protection of Women
from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was registered as DV Misc. Case No.429 of 2009 in the
Court of the learned Sub- Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Bhadrak and also filed a petition for grant
of maintenance. Having got order for interim maintenance, the opposite party No.4 approached this
Court in Criminal Revision No.1316 of 2009, but the said revision petition was withdrawn. The said
D.V. Misc. Case No.429 of 2009 was heard on contest and by Judgment dated 03.03.2012, the
learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bhadrak directed the opposite party No.4 to pay
maintenance of Rs.5,000/-
per month with effect from 15.10.2009 in addition thereto a sum of Rs.1,000/- per month towards
house rent. On appeal being preferred by the opposite party No.4 against such order/direction, the
learned District Judge, Bhadrak dismissed Criminal Appeal No.10/49- 2012-06 and thereby
confirmed the Judgment of the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class. The opposite party No.4
carried the matter further before this Court in revision which was registered as Criminal Revision
No.835 of 2012. Said criminal revision also got dismissed confirming the order of the Appellate
Court.

2.4. In response to questionnaire issued by the Court of Inquiry to the petitioner, eliciting details of
fact reply was given by letter dated 05.11.2009, but the opposite parties did not consider her name
to be recorded in the service book of the opposite party No.4. The petitioner thereafter on
06.09.2016 filed representation before the Commanding Officer, Silliguri in West Bengal. On
coming to know about the transfer of the opposite party No.4 to Agra, another representation dated
12.10.2016 was filed before the Commanding Officer, Air Force, C/o.56, APO.
2.5. As the marriage agreement dated 12.12.2008 executed between the petitioner and the opposite
party No.4 stated to be in force whereby it was assured that no talaq or threatening for talaq can be
given by the husband, there is no scope for him to go for second marriage. Notwithstanding such
agreement, the opposite parties having not recorded the name of the petitioner reflecting marital
status as ―wife(cid:129) of the opposite party No.4 in his service book, a writ of mandamus deserved to be
issued. Therefore, the petitioner has made the following prayers in the writ petition:
"It is, therefore prayed that this Hon(cid:130)ble Court may graciously be pleased to admit
this Writ Petition, issue notice to opposite parties and after hearing from the counsels
of parties, issue a Writ in the nature of mandamus/certiorari directing the opposite
parties to deduct amount from the salary of the opposite party No. 4 for payment of
maintenance to wife-petitioner as per provision under Section 92(i) of Air Force Act
for the interest of justice;
And further direct to record the name of the petitioner as wife in the service record of
the opposite party No.4 and ensure the opposite party No.4 will maintain marital
status with petitioner by keeping her in his service place taking the facts and
circumstances of the case;
And issue any other order/orders, direction/directions and writ/writs as this
Hon(cid:130)ble Court may deem fit and proper giving complete justice to the petitioner;
And for this act of kindness the petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray."
Response of the opposite parties:
3. Counter affidavit in response to the averments made in the writ petition has come to be filed on
behalf of the opposite party Nos.1 to 3.
3.1. It is stated that in response to show cause notice dated 18.06.2012 issued to the opposite party
No.4 asking him to submit his application with requisite documents for taking Personnel
Occurrence Report of his marriage and outcome of the case before the learned Family Court,
Cuttack, in his reply dated 03.07.2012 he submitted that talaq has been given to Rashmi Roshan @
Nigar on 01.09.2009 as per Hanif Muslim Law and copy of talaqnama was served on the petitioner
through the learned Family Court. As the talaqknama issued vide Serial No. N-14-239/240
(Register-B, Book-II, Divorce Certificate) by Md. Abdul Wahid, Mohammedan Registrar and Shaher
Qazi, Cuttack, as provided in Section 6 of the Act for the registration of Mohammedan Marriage and

Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
Divorce, bore no signature of Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar, a representative of the Air Force Police was
asked to verify the veracity of the document. The verification was carried out on 16.02.2015 and
found to be genuine. A certificate to that effect was also obtained by the department from the Qazi.
3.2. The application of the air warrior dated 10.06.2013, 27.06.2013 and 27.10.2014 for recognising
his talaqnama and permission to marry Sahista Parwin was then considered and was approved vide
1041/189/Disc., dated 03.03.2015 for recording the name of Sahista Parwin as wife of the opposite
party No.4.
3.3. Per Air Force Order No. 134 of 1998 to record any occurrence in personal service record the
individual is required to apply with valid requisite documents as soon as the event occurs. Till the
petitioner forwarded letter which was received at the petitioner's Unit on 28.12.2008,
non-disclosure of marriage could not come to fore. To enter the name of petitioner as wife, the
opposite party No.4 was required to apply along with all valid documents as proof of marriage and
submit marriage photographs (joint) for the purpose of record. As he did not submit the said
documents punishment of ―reprimand' was awarded under the provisions of the Air Force Act.
3.4. The opposite party No.4 had submitted repeated applications for according permission to marry
after divorcing (talaq) the petitioner. As per Muslim Law, a Muslim of sound mind may divorce
(dissolve the marriage) at his ―will(cid:129) without the intervention of Court. Further, continuation of
criminal proceedings against the opposite party No.4 does not debar him of his right to get married,
as his status is ‗unmarried' after pronouncing talaq vice the petitioner.
3.5. The petitioner prayed for relief in this writ petition is commented by the opposite party Nos.2
and 3 to the extent that the application of the air warrior dated 10.06.2013, 27.06.2013 and
27.10.2014 for recognising his talaqnama and permission to marry Sahista Parwin was considered
after due verification of the genuineness of talaqnama issued by a registered body vide Sl. No. N-
14-239/240 (Register B Book II, Divorce Certificate) by Md Abdul Wahid, Mohammedan Registrar
and Shaher Qazi, Cuttack and was approved vide EAC 1041/189/Disc dated 03.03.2015 for
recording the name of Sahista Parwin as wife. The recording of name of Sahista Parwin was taken
into consideration before the interim order dated 09.11.2016 was passed in the present case while
issuing notice, which reads as follows:
"As an interim measure it is directed that the opposite parties 1 to 3 shall not take any
decision on any declaration given by the opposite party No.4 regarding his marriage
to any other person except petitioner till the next date."
3.6. Hence, at this stage the petitioner cannot be recognised as legally wedded wife for the purpose
of record and deduction of amount towards maintenance.
4. A counter affidavit has also been filed by the opposite party No.4, asserting that the direction of
the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class as confirmed in the Appeal and affirmed by this Court in
Criminal Revision being No.835 of 2012, is binding between the petitioner and the opposite party
No.4 so far as payment of maintenance of Rs.5,000/- per mensem and Rs.1,000/- towards house
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 4
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
rent per mensem. It is asserted that the opposite party No.4 has been depositing such amounts
regularly, to which evidence is furnished in Annexure- A/4.
4.1. Denying and disputing marriage held on 25.06.2006 at Mazar and describing the marriage on
12.12.2008 as forcible one in a Police Station with the help of NGO on the basis of F.I.R. 343/2008
at Kendrapara, it is affirmed that the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class had opined in the
Order-sheet maintained in D.V. Misc. Case No.429 of 2009 to the following effect (extracted from
paragraph 6 of the counter affidavit):
"*** from the evidence adduced by aggrieved person and her witnesses as well as
from the documentary evidences produced, the Court is of the opinion that aggrieved
person has proved her domestic relationship with respondent No.1 though conclusive
proof cannot be drawn out regarding the marriage from the said document."
4.2. The petitioner on the basis of three dates of marriage, i.e., 25.06.2006, 07.11.2005 and
12.12.2008, filed five cases against the opposite party No.4 relating to dowry, torture and
maintenance. However, by way of affidavit evidence of talaqnama was adduced before the Family
Court on 04.09.2009 in the proceeding being CRP No.71 of 2007 stating that divorce between the
opposite party No.4 and the petitioner had already been effected on 01.09.2009, which fact has been
recorded on 20.12.2014 in the Register-B (Book-II) at serial No.N.14--239/240 (column No.6).
4.3. After the aforementioned divorce, the opposite party No.4 got married to Sahista Parwin on
16.08.2013 vide Certificate of Marriage (Annexure-C/4) issued under Section 13 of the Special
Marriage Act, 1954.
4.4. It is further asserted that the marriage agreement executed on 12.12.2008 arose out of forcible
marriage which lost its force after talaq being effected on 01.09.2009. The Air Force Authorities
conducting Court of Inquiry qua the opposite party No.4 though reprimanded him for not applying
for Personnel Occurrence Report and not apprising the authorities about cases against him, being
satisfied about the genuineness of talaqnama by conducting such inquiry, permitted the opposite
party No.4 to marry Sahista Parwin.
4.5. While affirming that the direction to pay maintenance being complied with religiously, it is
stated that as per paragraph 6 of AFO 24 of 2000, if the application is based on an order of a civil
Court granting maintenance allowance the case will not be processed under Section 91(i) or 92(i) of
the Air Force Act. The petitioner is to be intimated and advised to progress the matter accordingly
under the Code of Criminal Procedure. However the individual may be advised and a record is to be
kept to the effect that:
(a) He should respect the Court Orders and the maintenance allowance regularly,
unless he obtains a stay from a competent Court;
(b) Default in payment may result in his arrest/ imprisonment and/or attachment of
pay and allowances.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 5
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
As per paragraph 18 of AFO 24 of 2000 in case the spouse of a person subject to AFA is granted a
maintenance allowance by the Civil Court, no further maintenance allowance would be granted
under Section 91/92 of Air Force Act, 1950.
In the present case the opposite party No 4 has lawfully obeyed the order and as of now he is not a
defaulter. Hence, under aforesaid scenario, the petitioner's maintenance cannot be attached to
salary of opposite party No 4.
4.6. The opposite party No.4 raising question of maintainability of the nature of prayers made in the
writ petition, stated that no direction to record the name of the petitioner as ―wife(cid:129) in the service
record of the opposite party No.4 is permissible in view of factum of marriage with Sahista Parwin is
acknowledged by the Air Force Authorities on being satisfied with the genuineness of talaqnama of
the opposite party No.4 with the petitioner. It is not that the petitioner is remediless to approach
competent court of law in the event of default in making over the amounts of maintenance and
house rent to the petitioner as directed by the criminal court.
Analysis and discussions:
5. From the pleadings it transpires that:
i. From the copy of nikahnama (Annexure-1, translated copy is not furnished) and
copy of marriage agreement before the Notary Public on 12.12.2008 (Annexure-2),
there appears marriage (nikah) between the petitioner and the opposite party No.4
took place on 12.12.2008, though it is claimed by the petitioner that the marriage
took place on 25.06.2006.
ii. Upon report filed with respect to allegation of commission of offence under Sections 498A/506/
323/34, Indian Penal Code, 1860 as false (Annexure-F/4), Criminal Proceeding No.71 of 2007 filed
at the behest of the petitioner (Reshmi Roshan @ Nigar) before the learned Judge, Family Court,
Cuttack, came to be ended with withdrawal by the petitioner.
iii. However, in the case under Sections 12, 18, 19, 20 and 22 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005, against the Judgment and Order dated 03.03.2012 passed in Misc.
Case No.429 of 2009 by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bhadrak, Criminal Appeal
bearing No.10/49-2012-06 got disposed of by Judgment dated 15.12.2012 pronounced by learned
Additional Sessions Judge (FTC-I), District:
Bhadrak, finding that the parties had a relationship in the nature of marriage which
is akin to a common law marriage, the said Court observed that the appellants (the
opposite party No.4 was Appellant No.1) have not taken any step with regard to
declaration of the marriage null and void inasmuch as there was no consent of the
opposite party No.4 for marriage with the petitioner and ―the act of the appellant
No.1 by giving talaq to the respondent (petitioner herein) goes to show that he had
divorced his wife. The learned Appellate Court sustained the maintenance allowance
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 6
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
and the amount of house rent to be paid to the petitioner by the opposite party No.4,
as awarded by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class. Said Appellate Order dated
15.12.2012 of the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge (FTC-I), Bhadrak
being carried to this Court in revision under Section 401 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, registered as Criminal Revision No.835 of 2012, the same got
dismissed by Order dated 24.06.2016.
iv. Since the opposite party No.4 did not disclose such domestic
relationship/marriage to the authorities concerned, he was reprimanded.
v. Be that be, copy of Register-B (Book-II) has been enclosed to the counter affidavits
of the opposite party No.4 as also other opposite parties to fortify their argument that
talaqnama was issued on 20.12.2014 wherein it has been categorically depicted that:
"Mr. Md. Sabir Ahemad confessed in a statement that „I was married to Reshmi
Raushan Nigar on 12th day of December, 2008, but she did not have conjugal
relation and did not sleep with me in the same bed. Moreover she every now and then
picked us quarrel with. This made my life miserable. Today I would like to make you
all and the shaher quazi clear that I had given one Falaqu-e-Bayin (one divorce) to
Reshmi Raushan Nigar on 1st day of September, 2009. I had already submitted the
Talaque Nama to Reshmi Raushan Nigar with signatures of mine and two witnesses.
She had not brought any dowry. So only the amount of dower (Meher) Rs.50,000/-
(Rupees Fifty thousand only) and the Rs.3,500/- (Rupees Three thousand thousand
and Five hundred only) towards her maintenance is due with me will be paid to her
as soon as possible. From the day I divorced her she is no longer my wife and I am no
longer her husband."
vi. Upon permission being granted by the authorities concerned being satisfied on conducting
inquiry that the talaqnama was genuine, nikah took place between the opposite party No.4 and
Sahista Parwin and a Certificate of Marriage was issued under the provisions of the Special Marriage
Act, 1954, on 16.08.2013 acknowledging marriage between the opposite party No.4 (Md. Sabir
Ahemad) and Sahista Parwin. Necessary documents, like Life Membership Card and Dependent
Identity Card, were issued in favour of said Sahista Parwin, reflecting her as ―wife(cid:129) of the opposite
party No.4 by the Indian Air Force Authorities.
5.1. With the aforesaid background facts, when this Court examines the relationship of the petitioner
with the opposite party No.4, it could be ascertained from the Judgment of the learned Additional
District and Sessions Judge (FTC-I), Bhadrak that, "Having gone through the material on record, I
find that the respondent (petitioner herein) has established in the instant case that she had a
relationship with appellant No.1 (opposite party No.4 herein) in nature of marriage which is akin to
a common law marriage."
5.2. The finding of fact of the Court is unequivocal to show that the marriage between the opposite
party No.4 and the petitioner is ―akin(cid:129) to marriage and in the nature of marriage, but there is no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 7
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
finding that there was ―marriage(cid:129) between them. Nonetheless, against the said Judgment and
Order of the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge (FTC-I), Bhadrak, in the criminal
revision of the opposite party No.4 being Crl. Rev. No.835 of 2012, vide Order dated 24.06.2024 it
has been observed as follows:
8. As provided under the PWDV Act, the aggrieved person/wife can approach the
Magistrate under Section 12 of the PWDV Act seeking one or more reliefs. 'Domestic
relationship' as defined in Section 2(f) of the PWDV Act means that a relationship
between two persons who live or have, at any point of time, lived together in a shared
household, when they are related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a
relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living
together as a joint family.
9. It would be appropriate to re-produce paragraph-33 of the judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of D. Velusamy Vrs. D. Patchaiammal, 2011 CRI.L.J. 320 = (2010)
10 SCC 469 here below:
„33. In our opinion a relationship in the nature of marriage is akin to a common law
marriage. Common law marriages require that although not being formally married:
(a) The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses.
(b) They must be of legal age to marry.
(c) They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including being
unmarried.
(d) They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the world as
being akin to spouses for a significant period of time.
10. The opposite party-wife in her evidence has stated that she had relationship with the petitioner
no.1 since 07.11.2005. On 25.06.2006 she and the petitioner No.1 stayed in Hotel „Blue Vine,
Bhadrak(cid:130) and in that evening the friends of the petitioner No.1- husband called a Kaji and
Nikahanama was performed as per Muslim rituals. On her request to take her to his parental house,
the petitioner No.1 stated that his parents would not accept her and they would demand dowry of
Rs.5 lacs. On 26.06.2006 they stayed in her uncle's house and on the next day when they went to the
matrimonial home, the mother of the petitioner no.1 demanded dowry of Rs.5 lacs to accept her as
their daughter-
in-law and she was assaulted and driven out from their house.
11. The opposite party-wife had further stated that on 12.12.2008 police arrested the petitioner No.1
and his father in connection with the case initiated by her and being called by police, her parents,
the Secretary of the short-stay home and others went to Kendrapara Police Station and their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 8
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
marriage was performed in presence of the Kaji. An agreement was executed before the Notary,
Bhadrak and after marriage she stayed in her in-law(cid:130)s house peacefully for a period of six months
and thereafter she was tortured. The petitioner no.1-husband insisted her to obey his mother. She
also stated that the petitioner No.1-husband attempted to kill her and when she telephonically
informed the matter to her parents, they came and rescued her from the clutches of her husband.
P.W.2 stated that on 26.06.2006 the petitioner No.1 and the opposite party had came to their house
and stayed in that night. P.W.3, the father of the opposite party also stated about the marriage in the
Police Station and about the parties staying together in different hotels. P.W.5, the proprietor of the
Hotel stated that the couple had stayed in his hotel "Blue Vine" on different occasions. P.W.6
testified that he had attended the Nikah of the couple and further added that they remained as
husband and wife in the house of the petitioner No.1. The petitioners have not adduced any evidence
in support of their pleadings.
12. Evidence adduced on behalf of the opposite party-
wife goes to show that she had love affairs with the petitioner No.1 since 2006 and that on
12.12.2008 the opposite party had married to the petitioner no.1 in Kendrapara Police Station in
presence of the relations and they remained as husband and wife in the house of the petitioner No.1.
It further emerges that after she was rescued from the house of her in- laws she remained in Asiyana
short-stay home. It is the case of the petitioners that the marriage dated 12.12.2008 in Kendrapara
Police Station was a forced marriage and the petitioner No.1 was not a willing party to the same. If in
fact the petitioner no.1 had married the opposite party-wife under compulsion of police, he could
have made allegations before higher police authorities. Equally, he could have initiated cases before
proper Court for declaring the marriage as null and void on the ground of police pressure or
compulsion, but things are not so. No explanation has been adduced by the petitioners in this
context. Rather, the petitioners had pleaded that the petitioner No.1 had given Talaq to the opposite
party-wife. The so-called Talaq was just an afterthought to get rid of the rigidity and legal effect of
the marriage.
13. As per Section 2(a) of the PWDV Act, „aggrieved person(cid:130) means any woman who is, or has been,
in a domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges to have been subjected to any act of
domestic violence by the respondent. „Domestic violence(cid:130) has been defined under Section 3 of the
PWDV Act which is very exhaustive. The conduct of the petitioners as stated by the opposite party
wife in her evidence goes to show that she was subjected to domestic violence and she was an
aggrieved person within the purview of PWDV Act. That apart, even if it is assumed that the
petitioner No.1 had divorced the opposite party-wife, by giving Talaq, still then being an estranged
wife she has right to stay in her husband(cid:130)s house and she is also entitled to receive maintenance
from him. Both the Courts below after elaborately discussing the evidence have rightly allowed the
claim of the opposite party: wife for separate residence and maintenance. So far quantum of
maintenance and rent, the same appears to be in consonance with the income of the petitioner
No.1-husband who is admittedly working in Indian Army. There is no apparent perversity in the
findings of both the Courts below and for that the impugned orders of both the Courts below need
no interference by this Court in this revision petition.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 9
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
14. Hence, this revision petition being devoid of any merit stands dismissed. L.C.R. be sent back
forthwith along with a copy of this order."
5.3. It emanates from the above orders that the petitioner has been in relationship with the opposite
party No.4 akin to marital relationship, but not relationship on account of ―marriage(cid:129). It is also
pertinent to notice that the observation of this Court in the criminal revision was on the basis that
the petitioners therein (the opposite party No.4 herein) did not adduce any evidence in support of
pleadings. In the present petition, the opposite party No.4 in his counter affidavit has placed on
record the material evincing that talaqnama was issued on 20.12.2014 with recording of fact that
talaq was effected qua the petitioner by the opposite party No.4 on 01.09.2009. After the said
document being verified as genuine, the authorities have permitted the opposite party No.4 to marry
Sahista Parwin, who was issued with Cards by the Indian Air Force recognizing her status as ―wife(cid:129)
of Md. Sabir Ahemad. Furthermore, a Marriage Certificate has also been granted recording the
name of Sahista Parwin as wife of the opposite party No.4 under the provisions of the Special
Marriage Act.
5.4. Sri Amiya Kumar Mishra, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party No.4 forcefully
contended that so long as the talaqnama is subsisting and not challenged before the competent
Court of law, it would not be justified on the part of the petitioner to assert that the name of the
petitioner should find place in the service book of the opposite party No.4.
5.5. Dr. Binoda Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner laid emphasis on the marriage
agreement executed on 12.12.2008 between the petitioner and the opposite party No.4 before the
Notary Public has sanctity and such document should have been respected by the Indian Air Force
Authorities to record the name of the petitioner in the service book of the opposite party No.4. As
against such argument, Sri Amiya Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate urged that such marriage is not
recognized in the law.
5.6. This Court would wish to examine the status of execution of marriage by Notaries.
5.7. In the Office Memorandum bearing F.No. N-
15011/211/2024-NC, issued by the Government of India in the Ministry of Law and Justice,
Department of Legal Affairs (Notary Cell), dated 10.10.2024 it has been stated as follows:
"The Notaries Act, 1952 and the Notaries Rules, 1956 regulate the profession of
Notaries. In pursuance of Section 3 of the Notaries Act, 1952, the Central
Government, for the whole or any part of India and any State Government, for the
whole or any part of the State, may appoint as Notaries any legal practitioners or
other persons who possess such qualifications as may be prescribed. The functions
and duties of Notaries are enumerated in Section 8 of the Notaries Act, 19521. The
transaction 1 Section 8 of the Notaries Act, 1952, reads as under:
―8. Functions of notaries.--

(1) A notary may do all or any of the following acts by virtue of his office, namely:
(a) verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any instrument;
(b) present any promissory note, hundi or bill of exchange for acceptance or payment
or demand better security;
(c) note or protest the dishonour by non-acceptance or non-payment of any
promissory note, hundi or bill of exchange or protest for better security or prepare
acts of honour under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (XXVI of 1881), or serve
notice of such note or protest;
(d) note and draw up ship(cid:130)s protest, boat(cid:130)s protest or protest relating to demurrage
and other commercial matters;
(e) administer oath to, or take affidavit from, any person;
(f) prepare bottomry and respondentia bonds, charter parties and other mercantile
documents;
(g) prepare, attest or authenticate any instrument intended to take effect in any
country or place outside India in such form and language as may conform to the law
of the place where such deed is intended to operate;
of business by a Notary is regulated by Rule 11 of the Notaries Rules, 1956.
2. It is clear from the plain reading of Section 8 of the Notaries Act, 1952 and sub-rule (8) of Rule 11
of the Notaries Rules, 1956 that execution of marriage or divorce affidavit is not the function of the
Notary. The functions of Notaries as envisaged in Section 8 of the Notaries Act, 1952 and sub-rule
(8) of Rule 11 of Notaries Rules, 1956 do not authorise any Notary to notarise an affidavit of
marriage or divorce. Neither the Notary is authorized to certify the marriage nor competent to
execute the divorce deed under the Notaries Act, 1952 and the Notaries Rules, 1956. A Notary has
not been appointed as a Marriage Officer.
3. Despite the above legal position, it has come to notice that some Notaries are executing
documents regarding marriage, divorce, etc. Further, some Notaries are also issuing Marriage
Certificates and allowing the execution of declarations of marriage between the parties, which has
far-reaching consequences.
4. Hon(cid:130)ble High Court of Orissa and Hon(cid:130)ble High Court of M.P. have also clearly held that
Notaries are not appointed as Marriage Officers and they are not authorised to execute marriage or
divorce

Hon'ble High Court of Orissa (Date of judgment:
14.09.2023)
(ii) Mukesh S/o Mr. Lakshman @ Lakshminaryan Vrs. The State of M.P., M. Cr. C.

5. An act or omission on the part of any Notary in respect of any provision of the Notaries Act, 1952
or the Notaries Rules, 1956 will be seen as professional misconduct and the Notary concerned will
render himself/herself liable to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions contained in Rule 13
of the Notaries Rules, 1956 and action may also be taken against him/her by the appropriate
Government under sub-rule (12) (b) of Rule 13 of the Notaries Rules, 1956 and sub-section
(d) of Section 10 of the Notaries Act, 1952. Names of such Notaries who have been found to be guilty
of professional or other misconduct rendering them unfit to practise as Notaries may also be
removed from the Register of Notaries by an order of the appropriate Government in pursuance of
the provision contained in sub-section (d) of Section 10 of the Notaries Act, 1952.
The Hon(cid:130)ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Bhagwan Singh Vrs. State of U.P. & Ors. in
Diary No. 18885 of 2024 [(2024) 9 SCR 774] has observed as under in judgment/order dated
20.09.2024:
„37. Similarly, the Notaries Act 1952 regulates the profession of Notaries. The
functions and duties of Notaries are enumerated in Section 8 thereof. The transaction
of business by a Notary is contained in Rule 11 of the Notaries Rules 1956. Any acts or
omissions thereof, on the part of the Notary would tantamount to misconduct, and
the person complained against would be unfit to be a Notary.(cid:130)
6. In view of the above, it is brought to the notice of all concerned that Notaries appointed under the
Notaries Act, 1952 should desist themselves from executing marriage or divorce deeds as they are
not appointed as Marriage Officers. Such actions on their part are against the extant law. Any
omission or commission of the Notaries Act, 1952 or the Notaries Rules, 1956 in this regard on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 12
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
part of any Notary will tantamount to misconduct and action will accordingly be taken against such
Notary in accordance with the provisions contained in Notaries Act, 1952 and Notaries Rules, 1956."
5.8. A Division Bench of this Court in Partha Sarathi Das Vrs.
State of Odisha, 2023 SCC OnLine Ori 5657 held as follows:
"5. *** Time and again Courts across the country have echoed it in identical voice that
Notaries are neither authorized to issue certificates of marriage nor they are legally
entitled to notarize any signed declaration of marriage, which is apparently beyond
the scope of their functions prescribed under Section 8 of the Notaries Act, 1952 (Act
No. 53 of 1952).
6. Noticing such illegal practice by the Notaries, a Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Rohit Kumar Behera Vrs. State of Orissa, 2012 (II) ILR-Cut 395 had held as
follows:
„6. As some Notaries had adopted a self-
innovated format by issuing authenticated certificate of Marriage purported to be in
pursuance of Rules 11(1) and 16 of the Rules, 1956, the Law Department on
18.03.2009 had issued a letter vide Letter No. III-1-7/07 3921/L directing all the
Notaries across the State not to issue Marriage Certificate which is not a function of
the Notary under Section 8(1) of the Act, 1952.
***
17. The functions and transactions of business by Notary as envisaged in Section 8 of the Act, 1952
and Rules, 1956 respectively cannot be done in a routine manner without application of mind;
otherwise the very purpose of enacting Section 8 of the Act, 1952 and Rule 11(8) of the Rules, 1956
would be frustrated because sanctity is attached to the certificate of the Notary. Thus, Section 8 of
the Act, 1952 and Rule 11(8) of the Rules, 1956 cast an obligation on Notary to apply his mind while
discharging his notarial functions and transactions of business.
18. Notaries are appointed for authentication of certificates/documents. Documents duly notarized
by the Notaries are accepted to be genuine documents in absence of any other material. Certificates
duly authenticated by the Notaries are presented before different authorities for various purposes. It
is very much necessary that before authenticating any document by putting his signature and
Notarial seal, the Notary should ensure that the document is a genuine one. Sometimes, it is found
that power given to a Notary is misused. Therefore, it is necessary to regulate the work of the
Notaries.(cid:130)
7. In the case of Ramakanta Nayak Vrs. Itishree Mohapatra, 2017 SCC OnLine Ori 219, while this
Court was adjudicating a revision petition filed against the order of maintenance by Family Court,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 13
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
the marriage certificate issued by a Notary was placed before it and therein, this Court had again
reminded the position of law declared by Rohit Kumar Behera (supra) and denied to accept such
certificate issued by the Notary.
8. More recently, the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Mukesh Vrs. The State of M.P.,
M.Cr.C. No. 44184 of 2020, decided on 31.12.2020, after being made cognizant of the aforesaid
illegal practice by the Notaries, has directed the Principal Secretary, Department of Law,
Government of Madhya Pradesh to issue necessary directions to restrain the Notaries from issuing
marriage certificates. The Court, while taking serious note of such unlawful practice, has held as
follows:
„The job of the Notary is defined under the Notary Act. He is not supposed to
perform the marriage by executing documents. Had he properly guided and refused
to execute the marriage agreement to the complainant, then the present offence
would not have been committed. This Court is repeatedly receiving the cases of
forged marriage performed by the Notary, therefore, the Law Department of the State
is required to look into these matters as to how the Notaries and Oath Commissioners
are involving themselves in executing the document in respect of the marriage,
divorce, etc., which are not permissible under the law. Neither the Notary is
authorised to perform the marriage nor competent to execute the divorce deed.
Therefore, strict guidelines are required to be issued to the Notaries and oath
commissioners for not executing such type of deed, failing which their licence would
be terminated. Let a copy of this order be sent to the Principal Secretary, Law
Department of State of M.P. For taking action in the matter.(cid:130)
9. Despite such authoritative pronouncements, this Court is vexed to observe that the Notaries are
not abstaining themselves from issuing marriage certificates which have absolutely no value in the
eyes of law and without any valid proof of marriage, they are allowing execution of declaration of
marriage between the parties which have far- reaching consequences. Due to such extra-legal and
subterfuge arrangements by the Notaries, parties are made to believe that they are legally married
when in fact their marriage do not have even the slightest of legal sanctity."
5.9. Madhya Pradesh High Court observed in Lakhan Ahirwar Vrs. State of M.P., 2023 SCC OnLine
MP 4227 as:
"16. Undisputedly, marriage by executing a marriage agreement is not a valid form of
marriage. In Hindu law, marriage is not a contract and it has to be performed by
observing Saptpadi or by any other recognized mode of marriage either under the
Anand Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, Arya Marriage Validation Act etc.
17. This Court in the case of Bundel Singh Lodhi Vrs.
State of M.P. decided on 30.04.2021 in M.Cr.C. No. 15168 of 2021 (Gwalior Bench) 2
and Mukesh S/o. Mr. Lakshman @ Lakshminarayan Vrs. The State of M.P. decided
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 14
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
on 31.12.2020 in M.Cr.C. No. 44184/2020 (Indore Bench) has held that it is not the
duty of Notary to execute a marriage agreement and even directions were given to
Law Department to take action against such Notaries who were involved in executing
marriage agreements.
18. This Court in the case of Bundel Singh Lodhi (supra), has held as under:
2 Reported at 2021 SCC OnLine MP 2231 = (2021) 2 MP LJ 323 = (2021) 222 AIC
304, Paragraph 11 whereof read as under: "11. From the plain reading of section 8 of
Notaries Act, it is clear that execution of Marriage Affidavit and Divorce Affidavit is
not the function of a Notary. Thus, it is clear that without any authority of law,
marriage affidavits and divorce affidavits are being executed by Notaries, thereby,
assisting the unscrupulous boys for committing rape as defined under Section 375 of
India Penal Code."
„In Hindu Law, marriage is not a contract. The marriages cannot be performed by execution of a
marriage affidavit. Either, the marriage is to be performed by performing Saptpadi, or in accordance
with custom. Marriage can also be performed as per the provisions of Special Marriage Act or as per
the provisions of other Statutes like Anand Marriage Act, 1909 etc. However, the Counsel for the
applicant, could not point out any provision, under which, a marriage can be performed by
execution of an Affidavit. Similarly, he could not point out any provision of law, by which a marriage
can be dissolved by execution of an Affidavit.
Notaries have never been appointed as Marriage Officers. They cannot notarize an affidavit of
marriage or divorce. Furthermore, Divorce can be granted only by a decree of a Court of competent
jurisdiction or as per custom."
5.10. As is urged by Dr. Binoda Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate, by stemming on the contents of
paragraph 4 of the writ petition that in the ―marriage agreement it has been clearly mentioned that
on 12.12.2008 the Government qazi has performed their marriage in the premises of Kendrapara
Police Station(cid:129), Sri Amiya Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate replied by advancing argument based
on paragraph 8 of counter affidavit that forcible marriage with the help of the police and the NGO
on 12.12.2008 cannot be held to be valid.
5.11. A Division Bench of Madras High Court in Ilavarasan Vrs. Superintendent of Police, 2023 SCC
OnLine Mad 2852 observed as follows:
"8. We are wondered as to how the Advocates are authorised to perform special
marriages in their office or Trade Union. When a similar matter came up for
consideration in S. Balakrishnan Pandiyan Vrs. Superintendent of Police,
Kanchipuram District, reported in (2014) 6 CTC 129 = 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 8815 3
, this Court has categorically held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 15
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
„39. Our declaration of law that, marriages performed in secrecy in the Office of
Advocates and Bar Association Rooms cannot amount to solemnisation within the
meaning of Sections 7 and 7-A of the Hindu Marriage Act, cannot be used as a sword
by the males for cutting the nuptial knot in matrimonial proceedings, but can be used
only by the fair sex to get liberated from sham marriages of this nature. We also 3 In
the ultimate, at paragraph 41, the Madras High Court held as follows:
"41. To sum up:
(a) Marriages performed in secrecy in the chambers of Advocates and Bar Association
Rooms, will not amount to solemnisation and only women, who are victims of such
marriage can question the same in matrimonial proceedings before the appropriate
Court as a question of fact.
(b) No registration of marriage can be done under the Tamil Nadu Registration of
Marriages Act, 2009 without the physical presence of the parties to the marriage
before the Registrar, except under special circumstances after recording the reasons.
(c) If a Complaint is made by a party to the marriage to the Bar Council of Tamil
Nadu and Puducherry against a Priest-cum-
Advocate, the Bar Council shall take appropriate action in accordance with law.
(d) On Complaints lodged by the Registering Authorities seeking protection, the Police are directed
to afford sufficient protection immediately."
hold that the Certificate of Solemnisation issued by Advocates will not be per se proof of
Solemnisation of Marriage in a matrimonial dispute.
40. Coming to the propriety of Advocates going to the Registration Office and presenting the
Memorandum of Registration of Marriages, Mr. R.C. Paul Kanagaraj submitted that, there is no bar
for the Advocates to present the papers for Registration and he drew parallels by citing the practice
of Advocates presenting documents like sale deed etc. for registration before the Registration
Officials. We are unable to agree with this submission of the learned counsel for the following
reasons:
[a] Under the Tamil Nadu Document Writers Licence Rules, 1982, all
non-testamentary documents should have to be prepared only by a Document Writer
licensed in this behalf and it shall be duly attested by him with his full name and
licence number. The Rules define „Document Writer(cid:130) as a person engaged in the
profession of preparing documents. Preparation of document requires legal acumen
and therefore, this falls within the province of the professional duties of an Advocate.
The Registrar is required to go through the recitals in the document and also check
the valuation etc. At that time, when there is a doubt in law, he will have to clarify it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 16
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
from the person who had drafted the document. Therefore, the presence of Advocate
for Registration of documents becomes essential.
[b] An Advocate before registering a marriage, issues a Solemnisation Certificate in
his capacity as Priest, as defined by Section 2(e) of the Act. Neither the Act nor the
Rules insist upon the presence of the Priest during Registration. The scope of
Registration is to check the identity of the parties and the witnesses and the enquiry
is only factual. There is no question of law or legal question involved in such an
enquiry for the Advocate to be present and give clarification to the Registrar of
Marriages. The Registrar of Marriages is performing a public duty and the Act itself
provides that he should give reasons for refusing to register a marriage and the order
passed by him is an appealable one. We find there is no scope for the presence of the
Lawyer-cum-Priest for effecting registration of a marriage. When the Registrar
entertains any doubt with regard to the performance of the marriage, he may call
upon the parties to produce further information to satisfy himself and only at that
juncture, the necessity of the Priest to appear before the Registrar may arise and not
otherwise. Therefore, we do not approve of Advocates appearing before the Registrar
and presenting the Memorandum of Registration, for that would definitely lower the
dignity of the Bar in the eyes of the public. The Preamble of the Bar Council Rules
extracted above clearly states that, what may be lawful and moral for a person who is
not a member of the Bar, or for a member of the Bar in his non-professional capacity
may still be improper for an advocate.(cid:130)
9. A perusal of the above decision makes it clear that the marriage performed by the
Advocates in their office is not a valid marriage, unless the marriage is registered
under the Tamil Nadu Registration of Marriages Act, 2009 and the physical
appearance of the parties to the marriage before the Registrar is essential.
However, the petitioner claims that their marriage was performed in the presence of the office
bearers. It is not a valid one. Further, the earlier marriage performed by the parents of the detenue
was not questioned either by the detenue or her parents. Hence, the earlier marriage performed by
the parents of the detenue is perfectly valid and the subsequent marriage performed in the presence
of the advocates and officer bearers of the Trade Union is invalid. After the above decision of the
Division Bench, marriages performed by the Advocates are not valid and disciplinary action is to be
initiated against those Advocates."
5.12. In view of the enunciation of law as discussed above, it is unequivocal that the marriage stated
to have been effected between the petitioner and the opposite party No.4 in a police station on issue
of nikahnama by qazi and consequent thereupon, agreement was entered into on the very date, i.e.,
12.12.2008, before the Notary Public cannot possibly be held enforceable; rather, such aspect being
disputed questions of fact requiring it to be proved before a competent court of law for declaration
of marital status. Dr. Binoda Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate laid emphasis by way of written note
of submission on the disputed question of fact that ―the talaqnama, the opposite party Nos.1 and 2
have taken into consideration, is of the year 2014 issued on 20.12.2014 and has been issued by a qazi
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 17
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
who did not have either geographical jurisdiction to grant talaq in the marriage of the petitioner and
the opposite party No.4 who belong to different districts. Secondly, the qazi is not legally
empowered to certify a unilateral divorce(cid:129). On the contrary, the opposite party No.4 has adduced
evidence to demonstrate that the fact of talaq given to the petitioner on 01.09.2009 has been
recorded in the talaqnama vide Register-B (Book-II) [Annexure-B/4]. Subsequently, the same being
found to be genuine on verification by the Air Force Authorities, the opposite party No.4 was
accorded permission to marry. Accordingly, marriage between Sahista Parwin and the opposite
party No.4 was solemnized and out of their wedlock a child is born on 20.09.2016, evidence of
which is available at Annexure-D/4: Birth Certificate. Air Force Wives Welfare Association issued
Life Membership Card in favour of Sahista Parwin recognizing her as ―wife(cid:129). A Dependent Identity
Card has also been issued in her favour by the Indian Air Force, wherein she is shown as ―wife(cid:129) of
Md. Sabir Ahemad.
5.13. Basing on averment that the marriage agreement before the Notary Public contained that the
opposite party No.4 would never give talaq or threaten the petitioner for talaq, Sri Binoda Kumar
Mishra, learned Advocate urged that the subsequent marriage with Sahista Parwin in view of agreed
covenant is illogical and illegal. Sri Amiya Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate submitted that such a
contention of the petitioner is liable to be repelled as it is trite that under Section 27 to determine
whether agreement is void one has to see reasonableness of restraint and onus being upon
covenanter to show it to be unreasonable. It is in Superintendence Company of India (P) Ltd Vrs.
Shri Krishan Murgai AIR 1980 SC 1717 = (1981) 2 SCC 246 = (1980) 3 SCR 1278 held that negative
covenant not to serve anywhere else or enter into competitive business in similar lines is considered
restraint of trade and therefore illegal and unenforceable under Section 27 of the Contract Act. It is,
therefore, submitted relying on unobjected portion of the counter affidavit of the opposite party
Nos.1 to 3 that ―In the meantime Rashmi Roshan Nigar had withdrawn the case CRP No.71 of 2008
that she filed before Hon'ble Court of Judge Family Court, Cuttack which she filed for grant of
maintenance. ... In his reply dated 03.07.2012 to the said SCN he submitted that he had given talaq
to Rashmi Roshan Nigar on 01.09.2009 as per Hanif Muslim Law and submitted copy of the
talaqnama which he served to Rashmi Roshan Nigar through the Family Court(cid:129). Restricting to avail
legal remedies by way of agreement is, thus, objected to by the counsel for the opposite party No.4 is
arbitrary and inoperative.
5.14. Thus, there are serious disputed questions of fact involved in the present writ petition which
does not warrant this Court to exercise extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India.
6. Sri Amiya Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate along with Sri Anoop Mishra, learned counsel for the
opposite party No.4 opposing strongly against the consideration of the first prayer of the petitioner
would submit that provisions of Section 91 of the Air Force Act, 1950 does not attract in the present
set of fact-situation.
6.1. Section 91 of the Air Force Act, 1950, reads as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 18
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
"Chapter VIII Penal Deductions "91. Deductions from pay and allowances of
officers.--
The following penal deductions may be made from the pay and allowances of an
officer, that is to say,--
(a) all pay and allowances due to an officer for every day he absents himself without
leave, unless a satisfactory explanation has been given to his commanding officer and
has been approved by the Central Government;
(b) all pay and allowances for everyday while he is in custody or under suspension
from duty on a charge for an offence of which he is afterwards convicted by a criminal
court or a court-martial or by an officer exercising authority under Section 86;
(c) any sum required to make good the pay of any person subject to this Act which he
has unlawfully retained or unlawfully refused to pay;
(d) any sum required to make good such compensation for any expenses, loss,
damage or destruction occasioned by the commission of an offence as may be
determined by the court-
martial by whom he is convicted of such offence, or by an officer exercising authority under Section
86;
(e) all pay and allowances ordered by a court-
martial or an officer exercising authority under Section 86 to be forfeited or stopped;
(f) any sum required to pay a fine awarded by a criminal court or a court-martial exercising
jurisdiction under section 71;
(g) any sum required to make good any loss, damage or destruction of public or service property
which, after due investigation, appears to the Central Government to have been occasioned by the
wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer;
(h) all pay and allowances forfeited by order of the Central Government if the officer is found by a
court of inquiry constituted by the Chief of the Air Staff in this behalf, to have deserted to the enemy,
or while in enemy hands, to have served with, or under the orders of, the enemy or in any manner to
have aided the enemy, or to have allowed himself to be taken prisoner by the enemy through want of
due precaution or through disobedience of orders or wilful neglect of duty, or having been taken
prisoner by the enemy to have failed to rejoin his service when it was possible to do so;
(i) any sum required by order of the Central Government to be paid for the maintenance of his wife
or his legitimate or illegitimate child or towards the costs of any relief given by the said Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 19
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
to the said wife or child."
6.2. While referring to the above provision, Sri Amiya Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate contended
that the present case involves payment to be made to the petitioner by the opposite party No.4 on
account of maintenance and towards house rent as directed by the learned Judicial Magistrate First
Class whose judgment was upheld not only by the Appellate Court, but also this Court in Criminal
Revision. This Court finds force in such submission of the learned counsel for the opposite party
No.4 that recovery of such amount of maintenance and house rent awarded in favour of the
petitioner does not fall within the scope and ambit of Section 91(i) of the Air Force Act inasmuch as
any sum required by Order of the Central Government to be paid for the maintenance of wife or
towards the costs of any relief given by the said Government to the said wife would be
comprehended in said provision. The learned counsel for the petitioner having not been able show
any statutory provision with respect to the nature of prayer made in the writ petition, writ in the
nature of mandamus cannot be issued to the opposite party Nos.1 to 3 ―to deduct amount from
salary of the opposite party No.4 for payment of maintenance to wife-petitioner(cid:129).
7. Next plank of argument advanced by both the contesting counsel for the respective parties is with
respect to prayer made in the writ petition as to direct the opposite party Nos.1 to 3 to record the
name of the petitioner as ―wife(cid:129) in the service record of the opposite party No.4 and to ensure that
the opposite party No.4 would maintain marital status with the petitioner.
7.1. Strenuous argument is advanced by Dr. Binoda Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate that in order
to render justice this Court is required to show indulgence by acceding to the prayer of the
petitioner. To such contention of the petitioner, Sri Amiya Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate
rejuvenated his argument by urging that conceding to such a prayer of the petitioner would be to
adjudicate disputed questions of fact qua marital status which is not the domain of writ Court while
in seisin of the matter under writ jurisdiction.
7.2. Advancing suave submission he proceeded to amplify that if such a prayer is allowed, then the
marital status of Sahista Parwin would be disturbed and such negation of marital status thereby
would, in effect, nullify not only the talaq dated 01.09.2009 vide talaqnama issued on 20.12.2014
which got recorded in Register-B, Book-II. Such document was found to be genuine by the Air Force
Authorities on inquiry. The veracity of such talaqnama being not questioned before any competent
Court of law and the observations of this Court in the Criminal Revision cannot be held to be
binding inasmuch as this Court proceeded to uphold the maintenance and house rent as awarded by
the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class as affirmed in the Appellate Court on the basis that the
opposite party No.4 (petitioner in the Criminal Revision) did not adduce evidence of talaq with the
petitioner and nikah with Sahista Parwin.
7.3. Having perused the record it could be discerned that such documents being not impeached and
the Certificate of Marriage issued under the Special Marriage Act showing marriage of the opposite
party No.4 with Sahista Parwin (who is not impleaded as party to the present proceeding) being not
questioned before the competent Court of law, any Order directing the opposite party Nos.1 to 3 to
record the name of the petitioner describing marital status as ―wife(cid:129) of the opposite party No.4 in

Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
his service book would tantamount to declare the marital status of the petitioner by striking off the
name of Sahista Parwin. Such power of declaration is not within the purview of writ Court invoking
provisions of Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
7.4. Noteworthy here to have regard to a Division Bench decision of this Court rendered in the case
of Sandhyarani Sahoo @ Mohanty Vrs. Anusaya Mohanty, MATA 4 of 2024, vide Judgment dated
02.04.2025, wherein in answering the question, "Whether the Respondent(cid:130)s prayer for declaration
of her marital status is maintainable before the learned Judge, Family Court under Section 7 of the
Family Courts Act, or whether she was required to approach the Civil Court under Section 34 of the
Specific Relief Act?"
it is held,
"8. This Court, after carefully considering the rival submissions and examining the statutory
provisions, finds that Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, is broad enough to encompass
the relief sought by the Respondent. The provisions reads as follows:
„7. Jurisdiction.--
(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a Family Court shall--
(a) have and exercise all the jurisdiction exercisable by any district Court or any
subordinate civil Court under any law for the time being in force in respect of suits
and proceedings of the nature referred to in the Explanation; and
(b) be deemed, for the purposes of exercising such jurisdiction under such law, to be
a district Court or, as the case may be, such subordinate civil Court for the area to
which the jurisdiction of the Family Court extends.
EXPLANATION.--
The suits and proceedings referred to in this sub-section are suits and proceedings of the following
nature, namely:
(a) a suit or proceeding between the parties to a marriage for a decree of nullity of
marriage (declaring the marriage to be null and void or, as the case may be, annulling
the marriage) or restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation or dissolution of
marriage;
(b) a suit or proceeding for a declaration as to the validity of a marriage or as to the
matrimonial status of any person;
Additionally, Section 8 of the Family Courts Act reinforces the exclusivity of the Family Court(cid:130)s
jurisdiction by expressly barring the jurisdiction of Civil Courts in matters covered under Section 7.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 21
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
The provision reads as:
„8. Exclusion of jurisdiction and pending proceedings.--
Where a Family Court has been established for any area,--
(a) no district Court or any subordinate civil Court referred to in sub-section (1) of
Section 7 shall, in relation to such area, have or exercise any jurisdiction in respect of
any suit or proceeding of the nature referred to in the Explanation to that
sub-section;
(b) no magistrate shall, in relation to such area, have or exercise any jurisdiction or
powers under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974);
(c) every suit or proceeding of the nature referred to in the Explanation to sub-
section (1) of Section 7 and every proceeding under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (2 of 1974),--
(i) which is pending immediately before the establishment of such Family Court before any district
Court or subordinate Court referred to in that sub section or, as the case may be, before any
magistrate under the said Code; and
(ii) which would have been required to be instituted or taken before such Family Court if, before the
date on which such suit or proceeding was instituted or taken, this Act had come into force and such
Family Court had been established, shall stand transferred to such Family Court on the date on
which it is established.(cid:130) Finally, Section 20 of the Family Courts Act provides that the Act has an
overriding effect over any other law that may be inconsistent with it:
„20. Act to have overriding effect.--
The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent
therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument
having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act.
9. The Hon(cid:130)ble Supreme Court, in Balram Yadav Vrs.
Fulmaniya Yadav reported in AIR 2016 SC 2161, has categorically held the following:
„Under Section 7(1) Explanation (b), a Suit or a proceeding for a declaration as to the
validity of both marriage and matrimonial status of a person is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Family Court, since under Section 8, all those jurisdictions covered
under Section 7 are excluded from the purview of the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts.
In case, there is a dispute on the matrimonial status of any person, a declaration in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 22
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
that regard has to be sought only before the Family Court. It makes no difference as
to whether it is an affirmative relief or a negative relief. What is important is the
declaration regarding the matrimonial status. Section 20 also endorses the view
which we have taken, since the Family Courts Act, 1984, has an overriding effect on
other laws.(cid:130)
10. The language of the above-mentioned provisions leaves no room for ambiguity. A suit seeking a
declaration of marital status whether it affirms or denies the existence of a valid marriage squarely
falls within the ambit of the Family Court's jurisdiction. Once the Family Court jurisdiction is
established over a matter, any attempt to bypass it would undermine the very purpose of
establishing Family Courts, which is to provide a specialised forum for resolving family disputes
efficiently. In the present case, the core of the matter is a declaration of marital status, which aligns
squarely with Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act. The Family Court had the proper jurisdiction
under Section 7(1)(b) of the Act to entertain the Respondent's prayer for a declaration of her marital
status. The provision clearly vests the Family Court with the authority to decide matters relating to
the validity of a marriage and the matrimonial status of any person.
11. The Appellant(cid:130)s argument that the Respondent ought to have approached the Civil Court under
Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act is misplaced, as the Family Courts Act is a special law enacted to
deal with disputes of a matrimonial nature, including the determination of marital status. The
principle of lex specialis derogat legi generali i.e. meaning special law prevails over general law
applies in this context, giving precedence to the Family Courts Act over the general provisions of the
Specific Relief Act. Furthermore, the Family Court(cid:130)s jurisdiction is not merely concurrent but
exclusive for matters enumerated under Section 7, thereby precluding the jurisdiction of Civil Courts
in such cases. Moreover, the fact that the Respondent initially approached the Civil Court and the
plaint was returned under Order VII Rule 10 CPC further reinforces the conclusion that the Family
Court was the correct forum. The Appellant(cid:130)s failure to challenge the jurisdiction in the earlier
proceedings further weakens her case, as jurisdictional objections must be raised at the earliest
stage of litigation.
12. Therefore, this Court finds no merit in the Appellant(cid:130)s contention regarding lack of jurisdiction.
The Family Court validly exercised its jurisdiction under Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act,
and the Appellant(cid:130)s objection regarding maintainability is, accordingly, untenable and stands
rejected."
7.5. The nature of prayer that to maintain marital status of the opposite party No.4 with the
petitioner being disputed question of fact to be adjudicated upon by competent Court having
jurisdiction, this Court desists from issuing writ of mandamus in this regard.
8. The aforesaid discussion and analysis of various aspects now lands this Court to consider the
scope of judicial review under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India.
8.1. In Kerala State Electricity Board Vrs. Kurien E. Kalathil, (2000) 6 SCC 293 it was held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 23
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
"10. We find that there is a merit in the first contention of Mr. Raval, Learned counsel
has rightly questioned the maintainability of the writ petition. The interpretation and
implementation of a clause in a contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ
petition. Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is a question of
construction of contract. If a term of a contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is
not the writ petition under Article 226. We are also unable to agree with the
observations of the High Court that the contractor was seeking enforcement of a
statutory contract. A contract would not become statutory simply because it is for
construction of a public utility and it has been awarded by a statutory body. We are
also unable to agree with the observation of the High Court that since the obligations
imposed by the contract on the contracting parties come within the purview of the
Contract Act, that would not make the contract statutory. Clearly, the High Court fell
into an error in coming to the conclusion that the contract in question was statutory
in nature.
11. A statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a statutory body to enter
into contracts in order to enable it to discharge its functions. Dispute arising out of
the terms of such contracts or alleged breaches have to be settled by the ordinary
principles of law of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the agreement is a
statutory or public body will not by itself affect the principles to be applied. The
disputes about the meaning of a covenant in a contract or its enforceability have to be
determined according to the usual principles of the Contract Act. Every act of a
statutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise of statutory power. Statutory
bodies, like private parties, have power to contract or deal with property. Such
activities may not raise any issue of public law. In the present case, it has not been
shown how the contract is statutory. The contract between the parties is in the realm
of private law. It is not a statutory contract. The disputes relating to interpretation of
the terms and conditions of such a contract could not have been agitated in a petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication by a
civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract. Whether any amount is due
and if so, how much and refusal of the appellant to pay it is justified or not, are not
the matters which could have been agitated and decided in a writ petition. The
contractor should have relegated to other remedies."
8.2. In Magadh Sugar & Energy Ltd. Vrs. State of Bihar, (2022) 16 SCC 428 it has been elaborated as
follows with respect to maintainability of writ petition when disputed questions of fact arise:
"20. While a High Court would normally not exercise its writ jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution if an effective and efficacious alternative remedy is
available, the existence of an alternative remedy does not by itself bar the High Court
from exercising its jurisdiction in certain contingencies. This principle has been
crystallised by this Court in Whirlpool Corpn. Vrs. Registrar of Trade Marks, (1998) 8
SCC 1 and Harbanslal Sahnia Vrs. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 107.
Recently, in Radha Krishan Industries Vrs. State of H.P., (2021) 6 SCC 771 a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 24
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
two-Judge Bench of this Court of which one of us was a part of (D.Y. Chandrachud,
J.) has summarised the principles governing the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the
High Court in the presence of an alternative remedy. This Court has observed:
(Radha Krishan Industries Vrs. State of H.P., (2021) 6 SCC 771, SCC p. 795, para 27)
„27. The principles of law which emerge are that:
27.1. The power under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue writs can be exercised
not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but for any other purpose as well.
27.2. The High Court has the discretion not to entertain a writ petition. One of the
restrictions placed on the power of the High Court is where an effective alternative
remedy is available to the aggrieved person.
27.3. Exceptions to the rule of alternative remedy arise where:
(a) the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of a fundamental right
protected by Part III of the Constitution;
(b) there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice;
(c) the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction; or
(d) the vires of a legislation is challenged.
27.4. An alternative remedy by itself does not divest the High Court of its powers under Article 226
of the Constitution in an appropriate case though ordinarily, a writ petition should not be
entertained when an efficacious alternative remedy is provided by law.
27.5. When a right is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for
enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that particular statutory remedy before
invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of
statutory remedies is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion.
27.6. In cases where there are disputed questions of fact, the High Court may decide to decline
jurisdiction in a writ petition. However, if the High Court is objectively of the view that the nature of
the controversy requires the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, such a view would not readily be
interfered with.(cid:130)
21. The principle of alternate remedies and its exceptions was also reiterated recently in the decision
in Commr. of State Tax Vrs. Commercial Steel Ltd., (2022) 16 SCC 447. In State of H.P. Vrs. Gujarat
Ambuja Cement Ltd., (2005) 6 SCC 499 this Court has held that a writ petition is maintainable
before the High Court if the Taxing Authorities have acted beyond the scope of their jurisdiction.
This Court observed: (State of H.P. Vrs. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd., (2005) 6 SCC 499), SCC pp.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 25
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
517-18, para 23) „23. Where under a statute there is an allegation of infringement of fundamental
rights or when on the undisputed facts the Taxing Authorities are shown to have assumed
jurisdiction which they do not possess can be the grounds on which the writ petitions can be
entertained. But normally, the High Court should not entertain writ petitions unless it is shown that
there is something more in a case, something going to the root of the jurisdiction of the officer,
something which would show that it would be a case of palpable injustice to the writ petitioner to
force him to adopt the remedies provided by the statute. It was noted by this Court in L. Hirday
Narain Vrs. CIT, (1970) 2 SCC 355 that if the High Court had entertained a petition despite
availability of alternative remedy and heard the parties on merits it would be ordinarily unjustifiable
for the High Court to dismiss the same on the ground of non-exhaustion of statutory remedies;
unless the High Court finds that factual disputes are involved and it would not be desirable to deal
with them in a writ petition.(cid:130)
22. The above principle was reiterated by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Southern Electricity
Supply Co. of Orissa Ltd. Vrs. Sri Seetaram Rice Mill, (2012) 2 SCC 108. In that case, a show-cause
notice/ provisional assessment order was issued to the assessee on the ground of an unauthorised
use of electricity under Section 126(1) of the Electricity Act, 2003 and a demand for payment of
electricity charges was raised. The assessee contended that Section 126 was not applicable to it and
challenged the jurisdiction of the Taxing Authorities to issue such a notice, before the High Court in
its writ jurisdiction. The High Court entertained the writ petition. When the judgment [Sri
Seetarama Rice Mill Vrs. Jeypore Electrical Division, 2010 SCC OnLine Ori 467 of the High Court
was appealed before this Court, it held that the High Court did not commit any error in exercising its
jurisdiction in respect of the challenge raised on the jurisdiction of the Revenue Authorities. This
Court made the following observations: (Southern Electricity Supply Co. of Orissa Ltd. Vrs. Sri
Seetaram Rice Mill, (2012) 2 SCC 108, SCC p. 140, paras 81 & 82) „81. Should the courts determine
on merits of the case or should they preferably answer the preliminary issue or jurisdictional issue
arising in the facts of the case and remit the matter for consideration on merits by the competent
authority? Again, it is somewhat difficult to state with absolute clarity any principle governing such
exercise of jurisdiction. It always will depend upon the facts of a given case. We are of the considered
view that interest of administration of justice shall be better subserved if the cases of the present
kind are heard by the courts only where they involve primary questions of jurisdiction or the matters
which go to the very root of jurisdiction and where the authorities have acted beyond the provisions
of the Act. ...
82. It is argued and to some extent correctly that the High Court should not decline to exercise its
jurisdiction merely for the reason that there is a statutory alternative remedy available even when
the case falls in the above stated class of cases. It is a settled principle that the courts/ tribunal will
not exercise jurisdiction in futility. The law will not itself attempt to do an act which would be vain,
lex nil frustra facit, nor to enforce one which would be frivolous-- lex neminem cogit ad vana seu
inutilia-- the law will not force anyone to do a thing vain and fruitless. In other words, if exercise of
jurisdiction by the tribunal ex facie appears to be an exercise of jurisdiction in futility for any of the
stated reasons, then it will be permissible for the High Court to interfere in exercise of its
jurisdiction. This issue is no longer res integra and has been settled by a catena of judgments of this
Court, which we find entirely unnecessary to refer to in detail.(cid:130)

Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
23. In Union of India Vrs. State of Haryana, (2000) 10 SCC 482 the assessing authorities imposed
sales tax on the rentals charged for supply of telephones. Writ petitions were filed in the High Court
challenging the levy. The writ petitions were dismissed on the ground that an alternative remedy of
a statutory appeal was available. An appeal against these orders was filed before this Court. The
appeal was allowed and the matter was remanded back to the High Court for determination since it
involved a question of law on whether the supply of telephones amounted to sale."
8.3. In State of U.P. Vrs. Ehsan, (2023) 13 SCR 905 it has been succinctly held that, "We are
conscious of the law that existence of an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar on exercise of writ
jurisdiction. More so, when a writ petition has been entertained, parties have exchanged their
pleadings/ affidavits and the matter has remained pending for long. In such a situation there must
be a sincere effort to decide the matter on merits and not relegate the writ petitioner to the
alternative remedy, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. One such compelling reason
may arise where there is a serious dispute between the parties on a question of fact and materials/
evidence(s) available on record are insufficient/ inconclusive to enable the Court to come to a
definite conclusion."
8.4. In the present case though pleadings are completed, it is felt apposite not to adjudicate the
disputed questions about ―marital status(cid:129) of the parties, particularly when Sahista Parwin is not
impleaded as party to the present proceeding. Doing so would imperil the marital status of Sahista
Parwin, whose name has already been entered in the service records of the opposite party No.4 and
the status of the child born out of wedlock of the opposite party No.4 and Sahista Parwin would also
be questioned. Material made available by the parties suggests that though there was claim of
marriage between the petitioner and the opposite party No.4 was subsisted since 2006, the same has
been stated to have been performed again in 2008 as evidenced from newspaper publications. As
per the petitioner such marriage was taken place in a police station with the help of NGO on
12.12.2008, which fact is asserted to be recorded in nikahnama (assumed to be in Urdu language
and English translated copy of such document is not available in record) and thereafter a marriage
agreement was executed before the Notary Public on 12.12.2008. Nevertheless, such marriage is
claimed to have been terminated by issue of talaqnama vide Register-B, Book- II (Divorce
Certificate). On inquiry being conducted by the Air Force Authorities regarding genuineness of such
talaqnama, and permitted by such competent Authorities in EAC-1041/189/Disc, dated 03.03.2015,
the petitioner got married to one Sahista Parwin, who is described in the service book of the
opposite party No.4 as ―wife(cid:129). A copy of Marriage Certificate issued under the provisions of the
Special Marriage Act is enclosed to the counter affidavit depicting marriage between the petitioner
and the opposite party No.4 and evidence is also laid by the opposite party No.4 to show that out of
wedlock, a child was born on 20.09.2016 (as is apparent from the copy of Certificate of Birth). The
factum of marriage between the opposite party No.4 and Sahista Parwin is questioned basing on the
finding recorded by this Court in the revision, being Criminal Revision No.835 of 2012, vide Order
dated 24.06.2016. Careful reading of said Order indicates that had forcible marriage was performed
between the petitioner and the opposite party No.4, the latter would have proceeded to institute
appropriate proceeding before competent Court for declaration of marriage as null and void. No
explanation in this regard being offered, talaq as claimed to have been given by the opposite party
No.4 is construed to be ―an afterthought to get rid of the rigidity and legal effect of the marriage(cid:129). It
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9998146/ 27
Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
is not out of place to mention that this Court while rendering such finding for the purpose of
deciding lis between the parties with respect to grant of maintenance under the Protection of
Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, observed that the opposite party No.4 did not adduce
evidence in support of his pleadings. Manifestly such a finding is recorded by taking note of
definition of the term ―domestic relationship(cid:129) contained in Section 2(f) of the Protection of Women
from Domestic Violence Act, 20054 and decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
the case of D. Velusamy Vrs. D. Patchaiammal, 2011 CRI.L.J. 320 = (2010) 10 SCC 469. In the said
reported decision it has been opined that ―a relationship in the nature of marriage is akin to a
common law marriage(cid:129) which falls within the scope of proceeding under the said Act of 2005.
8.5. The perception of the term ―akin(cid:129) has illuminatingly been discussed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in Gastrade International Vrs. Commissioner of Customs, 2025 INSC 411, which
deserves to be mentioned:
"By way of illustration, we may explain the position. If an importer classifies the
imported goods as "X", which is disputed by the Customs authority and classifies the
same as "Y", the test would be whether the goods imported are "most akin" to "X" or
"Y" in terms of Rule 4 of the aforesaid Rules. The importer may also claim if he so
wishes, that the goods are most akin to "Z", though it may be akin to "Y" also, if such
claim is more beneficial to him. Thus, it has to be shown by the Customs Authority
that the imported goods bear the most affinity or resemblance or similarity to be
"most akin" to the specified goods and not mere similarity or akinness. In other
words, the test will be whether the imported goods 4 Section 2(f) defines the term
―domestic relationship(cid:129) as:
"(f) "domestic relationship" means a relationship between two persons who live or
have, at any point of time, lived together in a shared household, when they are related
by consanguinity, marriage, or through a relationship in the nature of marriage,
adoption or are family members living together as a joint family;"
bear the closest resemblance or similarity with the specified good so that these can be considered to
be "most akin" to the specified good. Certainly, the principle of preponderance of probability may
fall short of the more heightened test of "most akin" for proper classification. The imported goods
may bear resemblance to more than one specified goods, in which event, unless the high degree in
the test of preponderance of probability is applied, there may be difficulties in the proper
classification. However, the said difficulty may be overcome if the test of "most akin" is applied. If
the attributes of the imported goods show that the goods are "most akin" to the specified goods
amongst an array of other specified goods, these imported goods have to be classified as the
specified goods with which these goods bear the most resemblance or most akinness. Thus, in our
view, application of the principle of preponderance of probability does not provide an accurate test.
The more accurate and precise test will be whether the goods in question are "most akin" or most
similar to the specified goods, as provided under Rule 4 referred to above."

Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
8.6. Taking cue from the meaning of ―akin(cid:129) from above illustration, it can safely be said that for
determination of entitlement for maintenance a relationship akin to common law marriage is
enough, but to establish marital status that the petitioner is ―wife(cid:129) of the opposite party No.4 and
such marriage is subsisting, would be disputed questions of fact which do require proof by leading
exhaustive evidence, oral and/or documentary, before the competent Court of law.
8.7. When there emanates apparent factual dispute between the private parties, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in Roshina T Vrs. Abdul Azeez K.T., (2018) 14 SCR 974 laid down that:
"14. These questions, in our view, were pure questions of fact and could be answered
one way or the other only by the Civil Court in a properly constituted civil suit and on
the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties but not in a writ petition filed under
Article 226 of the Constitution by the High Court.
15. It has been consistently held by this Court that a regular suit is the appropriate
remedy for settlement of the disputes relating to property rights between the private
persons. The remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution shall not be available
except where violation of some statutory duty on the part of statutory authority is
alleged. In such cases, the Court has jurisdiction to issue appropriate directions to the
authority concerned. It is held that the High Court cannot allow its constitutional
jurisdiction to be used for deciding disputes, for which remedies under the general
law, civil or criminal are available. This Court has held that it is not intended to
replace the ordinary remedies by way of a civil suit or application available to an
aggrieved person. The jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution being special
and extraordinary, it should not be exercised casually or lightly on mere asking by the
litigant. (See Mohan Pande Vrs. Usha Rani, 1992 (4) SCC 61 and Dwarka Prasad
Agrawal Vrs. BD Agrawal, (2003) 6 SCC
230).
16. In our view, the writ petition to claim such relief was not, therefore, legally permissible. It,
therefore, deserved dismissal in limine on the ground of availability of an alternative remedy of
filing a civil suit by respondent No. 1 (writ petitioner) in the Civil Court.
17. We cannot, therefore, concur with the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the High Court
when it unnecessarily went into all the questions of fact arising in the case on the basis of factual
pleadings in detail (43 pages) and recorded a factual finding that it was the respondent No. 1 (writ
petitioner) who was in possession of the flat and, therefore, he be restored with his possession of the
flat by the appellant.
18. In our opinion, the High Court, therefore, while so directing exceeded its extraordinary
jurisdiction conferred under Article 226 of the Constitution. Indeed, the High Court in granting such
relief, had virtually converted the writ petition into a civil suit and itself to a Civil Court. In our view,
it was not permissible."

Rashmi Roshan @ Nigar vs Union Of India on 9 April, 2025
Conclusion:
9. On analysis of material available on record vis-à-vis afore-discussed factual matrix,
it is untrammeled that there exists dispute between private parties with respect to
matrimonial issues including marital status. Whether talaq was validly effected
between the petitioner and the opposite party No.4 and consequent upon such talaq
the marriage between the opposite party No.4 and Sahista Parwin is valid and many
more such disputed questions of fact do arise in the present matter which are
required to be established before the competent Court of law.
9.1. With respect to the first prayer that the petitioner is entitled for a direction to the
opposite party Nos.1 to 3 for deduction of amounts awarded towards maintenance
and house rent as per order of the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class does not fall
within the ken of Section 91(i) of the Indian Air Force Act, 1950. When the petitioner
has failed to show that the opposite party Nos.1 to 3 are statutorily bound in terms of
Section 91 of the Air Force Act, 1950, to deduct amounts awarded by ―Court(cid:129)
(contrast with Central Government or or any prescribed officer) towards
maintenance and house rent to be paid by the opposite party No.4 to the petitioner,
no writ of mandamus is liable to be issued; however, the petitioner is not remediless
to enforce the payment of such amounts as directed by the learned Judicial
Magistrate First Class, which got confirmed by the Appellate Court and affirmed by
this Court in revision by properly instituted proceeding.
9.2. With respect to prayer of the petitioner for a direction to record her name as
―wife(cid:129) in the service book of the opposite party No.4, the same deserves to be
adjudicated by competent Court of law as name of ―Sahista Parwin(cid:129) appears to have
been recorded in the service records of the opposite party No.4 by the opposite
parties-Air Force Authorities. Such a prayer cannot be granted in view of elaborate
discussions made in the foregoing paragraphs as factual adjudication by competent
Court of law is required. As the disputed questions of fact are required to be
answered by a competent Court of law on the basis of evidence being led by parties,
this Court refrains from exercising power under Article 226/227 of the Constitution
of India.
