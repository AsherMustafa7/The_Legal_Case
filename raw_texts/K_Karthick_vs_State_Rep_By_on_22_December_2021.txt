ORDER
This Criminal Revision Case has been preferred challenging the judgment of the learned III
Additional District and Sessions Judge, Gopichettipalayam, dated 12.09.2015 passed in C.A.No.46 of
2016.
2. The case of the prosecution is that on 31.07.2013, at about 3.00 p.m., the defacto complainant /
Subbayal [PW.1] was walking towards West near Gopi Pachaimalai Road, Mayura Nagar, the 2nd
accused drove the Yamaha motorcycle bearing registration No.TN 39 BY 8322, in which, the 1st
accused travelled as a pillion rider. When they came near the defacto complainant/PW.1, the 1st
accused snatched her gold chain of weighing about 3 sovereigns from her neck and escaped from the
scene of occurrence. On the complaint given by the defacto complainant, a case has been registered
by the Gopichettipalayam police station in Crime No.592 of 2013 for an offence under Section 392
IPC.
3. The case was registered by the Sub Inspector of Police [PW.8] in Crime No.592 of 2013 for an
offence under Section 392 IPC and FIR was prepared [Ex.P6]. The Inspector of police [PW.9] took
up https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the case for investigation, went to the place of occurrence,
prepared the rough sketch and the Observation Mahazar in the presence of PW.1 to PW.6. He also
examined some of the witnesses and recorded their statement. On 15.08.2013, at about 5.00 p.m.,
when he was involved in vehicle check up at Gopichettipalayam-Kunnathur Road, Vadugapalayam
junction, the accused came in a red colour Yamaha motorcycle bearing registration No. TN 39 BY
8322. On seeing the police in the check up point, the accused were trying to escape from the spot,
but the police caught hold of them and enquired them. Thereafter, they confessed that they had
snatched the golden chain of the victim in this case; thereafter police have arrested the accused and
recorded their confession statement in the presence of witnesses PW.7-Manikandan and
Premkumar. In the confession statement, the accused had spoken about the stolen property. On the
basis of the confession, stolen property involved in this case was recovered under the Seizure
Mahazar in the presence of witnesses Manikandan and Premkumar. Thereafter, the accused was
remanded to judicial custody. The stolen property viz. Gold chain was marked as MO.1. After
completion of the investigation, the charge sheet was filed against the accused for the offence under
Section 392 IPC. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
4. On taking the case on file and on being satisfied with the prima facie materials available on
record, the learned trial Judge framed the charges against the accused for the offence under Section
392 IPC and questioned. Since the accused pleaded innocence and claimed to be tried, trial was
conducted.
5. On the side of the prosecution, nine (9) witnesses have been examined as PW.1 to PW.9 and eight
(8) documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P8 and two material objects were marked as M.O.1 and
M.O.2. The incriminating materials that appear before the evidence on the prosecution were put to
the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the accused was questioned, he denied the same. On the side
of the accused no witness has been examined and two (2) documents were marked as Ex.D1 and
Ex.D2.

6. After the conclusion of the trial and after considering the materials available on record, the
learned trial Judge, found both the accused guilty for the lesser offence under Section 379 and 356
IPC and convicted them as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Rank of Charges Findings of Punishment the the
trial accused Court 1st accused U/s.356 IPC Found guilty Convicted and sentenced to
undergo one year Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default
to undergo one month Simple Imprisonment.
U/s.379 IPC Found guilty To undergo two years Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a
fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo one month Simple Imprisonment.
2nd accused U/s.356 IPC Found guilty Convicted and sentenced to undergo one year
Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo one
month Simple Imprisonment.
U/s.379 IPC Found guilty To undergo two years Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a
fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo one month Simple Imprisonment.
7. Aggrieved over the said judgment, an appeal was preferred by the 2nd accused in C.A.No.46 of
2016 and that the appeal was also dismissed by the III Additional District and Sessions Judge,
Gopichettipalayam and found the accused guilty for an offence under Section 392 IPC and convicted
and sentenced as below:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Rank of Charges Findings of Punishment the the
accused appellate Court 2nd accused U/s.392 IPC Found guilty Convicted and
sentenced to undergo two years Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of
Rs.1,000/- in default to undergo one month Simple Imprisonment.
Challenging the same, the 2nd accused preferred the present criminal revision case.
8. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Advocate (Crl.side) for
the State.
9. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the 2nd accused was convicted on
the basis of his confession, which is not legal; the defacto complainant had identified the accused for
the first time before the Court; and hence her evidence before this Court cannot be relied on; since
the name of the 2nd accused was not mentioned in the F.I.R and the name of the accused was also
not mentioned during https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the enquiry made by the police, the
investigating officer ought to have given a request for conducting test identification parade; the
learned counsel has also relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in Dana
Yadav @ Dahu & Ors Vs. State of Bihar reported in 2002 Supp(2) SCR 363 in support of the above
contention. In the said judgment, it is held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165921039/ 3
K.Karthick vs State Rep.By on 22 December, 2021
“(g) Ordinarily, if an accused is not named in the First Information Report, his
identification by witnesses in Court, should not be relied upon, especially when they
did not disclose name of the accused before the police, but to this general rule there
may be exceptions as enumerated above.”
10. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. side) submitted that both the accused have been
arrested one and the same time and their confession have also been recorded at the same time; since
both the accused have stated about the stolen object, the recovery was made; just because the
recovery of the article was made on the basis of the confession statement of either of the accused,
that will not absolve the other from the criminal liability; the judgment of the Courts below does not
require any interference.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
11. Points for consideration:
Whether the sentence and judgment of the lower Appellate Court confirming the
judgment of the learned trial Judge is unfair, improper or not legal?
12. On a perusal of the complaint given by PW.1, it is seen that she had mentioned about two
persons, who were coming in the bike. Her evidence would reveal that one person was riding the
bike and other person was sitting behind the rider. PW.1 has not stated in her complaint that she
had not seen the face of the accused clearly and that it is possible for her to identify him in case he
was arrested by the police. Even during the cross-examination, PW.1 has stated that she had seen
this accused only from a side view and hence she could not have noticed his face fully. When such
being the evidence on record, it is unreasonable to state that the identification parade ought to have
been conducted prior to the trial. After recovering the stolen jewel from the accused, P.W1 was told
by the police that he was the accused who had stolen her jewel. So it is possible for her to take notice
of the accused only at that point of time https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and thereafter she
identified him at the time of trial. So this case does not deserve any identification parade. It is for
the simple reason that PW.1 never claimed any time during the investigation that she had registered
the identity of the accused in her mind at the time of occurrence and she could identify him, if any
identification parade was conducted.
13. Both the accused were arrested together and they have jointly given the confession and shown
the place where exactly the stolen jewels were concealed. In fact on the basis of the same confession,
the police could recover some other stolen properties involved in some other cases as well.
14. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that once the recovery was made based
on the confession of the 1 st accused, the statement of the 2nd accused in connection with the
recovery of the article cannot be held as incriminating material against the 2 nd accused. It is to be
noted that both the accused have been arrested in one and the same time and the recovery was made
in the presence of both the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis accused in the presence of witnesses.
Both the accused were travelling in the bike which was also a stolen one. So the involvement of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165921039/ 4
K.Karthick vs State Rep.By on 22 December, 2021
2nd accused cannot be overlooked for any super technical reason.
15. The evidence of PW.1 to PW.6 would show that PW.1 has lost her jewels as it was snatched by
two persons came in the bike. After recovery of the jewels on the confession of the accused, it was
identified by PW.1. Thus the connection between the stolen articles and the accused was established
in this case. The custody of the stolen articles with the accused would no doubt draw an advance
presumption under Section 114 of Evidence Act and that alone is sufficient to prove their
involvement in the offence. The learned trial Judge and the first appellate Judge have rightly
appreciated the evidence on record and convicted both the accused by recording a finding about
their guilt for the offence under Sections 379 and 356 IPC.
16. It seems that the appellate Court has modified the sentence and convicted the accused for the
offence under Section 392 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis IPC. This is a simple case of theft. It is
not the case of the prosecution that the accused had threatened the defacto complainant to part
away with her property. So it is wrong on the part of the appellate Court to convict the accused
under Section 392 IPC. Such a finding cannot be given by the appellate Court in an appeal filed by
the accused and not by the prosecution. So I feel that the judgment of the first appellate Court
should be modified by confirming the judgment of the Judicial Magistrate No.I, Gobichettipalayam,
dated 24.02.2016 passed in C.C.No.161/2013.
17. However, this Criminal Revision Case is disposed of and the judgment of the appellate Court
made in C.A.No.46 of 2016, dated 12.09.2016 is modified to the effect of confirming the judgment of
the trial Court in C.C.No.161 of 2013 that the accused is found guilty for the offence under Section
379 IPC. The accused is convicted and sentenced to undergo two years R.I and to pay a fine of
Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo one month S.I. The period of incarceration undergone by the
accused can be set off under Section 428 Cr.P.C. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
18. The trial Court is directed to issue NBW to secure the petitioner/accused and commit him to
prison to undergo the remaining period of sentence.
