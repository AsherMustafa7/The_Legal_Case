THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
MCRC-1445-2017
(State of M.P. & Ors. vs. Abhishek)
Gwalior, Dated 11.02.2019
Shri F.A. Shah, learned Public Prosecutor for the
applicant/State.
Shri T.C. Bansal, learned counsel for the respondent.
This application under Section 378(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 at the instance of
State of Madhya Pradesh is for grant of leave to challenge the judgment dated 26/10/2016 passed by
the Special Court, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Vidisha,
recording acquittal of respondent for offence under Sections 376(D), 376(B), 376(C) of Indian Penal
Code, Section 3(1)(12) and 3(2)(5) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act and Section 3(b)/4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
Perused the record.
The respondent was tried for aforesaid offences on the prosecution story that on 09/03/2014 at
6-6.30 PM when the prosecutrix along-with her sister and a friend had gone to attend the nature's
call at nearby nallah. She was caught hold by the respondent and his younger brother Kalla Yadav
(who being minor is tried by the Juvenile Board). Whereas, Kalla fiddled with her, the
MCRC-1445-2017 (State of M.P. & Ors. vs. Abhishek) accused-respondent breached her chastity. On
lodging of report by the prosecutrix's father on 10/03/2014, the prosecution was set in motion. The
prosecutrix was medically examined. The statement of prosecutrix and her sister were recorded. The
accused persons were arrested. On completion of investigation, the charge sheet was filed. The
respondent-accused abjured his guilt and pleaded that he is falsely implicated. The prosecution
besides examining the prosecutrix(PW/1) examined other witnesses to bring home the charges.
The trial Court, after meticulously analyzing the testimony of prosecutrix, found that she is not
creditworthy, because of the major conduction as to the event narrated during course of
investigation and thereafter in Court. The trial Court found that even the medical evidence did not
corroborate the prosecutrix version as to the commission of crime. Trial Court found major
contradiction in the statement of Mamta Bai(PW/2), younger sister of the prosecutrix and Varsha
(PW/4), friend of prosecutrix. It found that as per statement of Varsha(PW/4), she alone went with
prosecturix to attend the nature's call; whereas, Shivlal(PW/5), father of the prosecutrix and her
mother Laltabai(PW/6) stated that they were informed by their daughter Mamta(PW/2). The trial

Court further MCRC-1445-2017 (State of M.P. & Ors. vs. Abhishek) found that Varsha(PW/4)
having not gone to inform the prosecutrix's parents. In that event, the trial Court found that entire
story knit by the prosecution became doubtful. The trial Court found:

Besides contradictions, the trial Court also found exaggeration by the prosecutrix, as regard to the
alleged force used on her by the accused who as alleged also dragged by them. It dragged, the doctor
Leena Sharma(PW/3) could have definitely seen those marks on the prosecutrix. But there is no
such observation in the medical report(Ex.P/3) nor in the statement of the doctor Leena
Sharma(PW/3), who categorically stated that the prosecutrix on being examined by her was found
to be habitual of MCRC-1445-2017 (State of M.P. & Ors. vs. Abhishek) intercourse and that there
was no blood or any external or internal part of body. The vaginal swab, pubic hair and the
undergarments which were sealed in packet and given by doctor to constable who accompanied the
prosecutrix was never sent for scientific analysis.
All these facts led the trial Court disbelieve the story narrated by the prosecutrix.
True it is that the prosecutrix being not an accomplice in a crime of rape but is at par with injured
victim and that her statement should not be lightly brushed aside. However, equally true it is that
the evidence of prosecutrix should be such as would inspire confidence and must be plausible. In the
case at hand, trial Court having disbelieved the statement of prosecutrix and doubted the
correctness in the statement of the parents, Varsha(PW/4), Shivlal (PW/5), which as evident did not
collate with other evidence on record, we perceive no error in the judgment recording acquittal of
the respondent.
