Vijay Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 10 October, 2025
Kesheshwar Sthan Block (Biraul Sub-
Division) issued on 01.09.2017 by which
the respondent No. 12 (Ram Govind
Ram) has been illegally selected in Merit
List for the PDS shop License through the
petitioner is much better in each and
every corner than respondent No. 1. He
has been left out and the Respondent No.
12 has been selected at Serial No. 5.
Photocopy of Memo No. 869 dated
01.09.2017
along with the Merit list of PDS license is enclosed here with as Annexure P1."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision. Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
Patna High Court CWJC No.16820 of 2017 dt.10-10-2025 "32 (iii). Any person
aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the issue or renewal of the
license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the license may appeal to the
District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of the order and the District
Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal within a period of sixty
days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the
order under appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider
necessary for giving a reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-
clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the Writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Patna High Court CWJC No.16820 of 2017
dt.10-10-2025 Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee, he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.

5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the Writ petition is disposed of Patna High Court CWJC No.16820 of 2017
dt.10-10-2025 with a direction to the petitioner to file complaint/application within two month from
the date of receipt of this order before the concerned authority. The delay in filing the complaint/
application shall be condoned by the authority concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the
same within three months from the date of filing of the same.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
