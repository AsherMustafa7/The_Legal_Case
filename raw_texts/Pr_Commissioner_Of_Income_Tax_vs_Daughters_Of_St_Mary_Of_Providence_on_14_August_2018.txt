Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of
Providence Society [2018] 89 taxmann.com 127 [SC], by which the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has affirmed the view taken by the Bombay High Court in 'Commissioner of
Income Tax v. Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS)' [2003] 131 Taxman
386 [Bom.]. The relevant portion of the said Judgment of Bombay High Court as
quoted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and affirmed is quoted below for ready
reference.
"In the said judgment, [Bombay High Court] the contention of the Department
predicated on double benefit was turned down in the following manner:
3. As stated above, the first question which requires consideration by this court is :
whether depreciation was allowable on the assets, the cost of which has been fully
allowed as application of income under section 11 in the past years? In the case of CIT
v.
Munisuvrat Jain 1994 Tax Law Reporter, 1084 the facts were as follows. The assessee
was a Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income
Tax (Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society
Charitable Trust. It was registered as a Public Charitable Trust. It was also registered
with the Commissioner, Pune. The assessee derived income from the temple property
which was a Trust property. During the course of assessment proceedings for
assessment years 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80, the assessee claimed depreciation
on the value of the building at the rate of 2.5 per cent and they also claimed
depreciation on furniture at the rate of 5 per cent. The question which arose before
the court for determination was: whether depreciation could be denied to the
assessee, as expenditure on acquisition of the assets had been treated as application
of income in the year of acquisition? It was held by the Bombay High Court that
section 11 of the Income Tax Act makes provision in respect of computation of
income of the Trust from the properly held for charitable or religious purposes and it
Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society also
provides for application and accumulation of income. On the other hand, section 28
of the Income Tax Act deals with chargeability of income from profits and gains of
business and section 29 provides that income from profits and gains of business shall
be computed in accordance with section 30 to section 43C, That, section 32(1) of the
Act provides for depreciation in respect of building, plant and machinery owned by
the assessee and used for the business purposes. It further provides for deduction
subject to section 34. In that matter also, a similar argument, as in the present case,
was advanced on behalf of the revenue, namely, that depreciation can be allowed as
deduction only under section 32 of the Income Tax Act and not under general
principles. The court rejected this argument. It was held that normal depreciation can
be considered as a legitimate deduction in computing the real income of the Date of
Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax

Pr.Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Daughters Of St.Mary Of Providence ... on 14 August, 2018
(Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society assessee on
general principles or under section 11(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act. The court rejected
the argument on behalf of the revenue that section 32 of the Income Tax Act was the
only section granting benefit of deduction on account of depreciation.
It was held that income of a Charitable Trust derived from building, plant and machinery and
furniture was liable to be computed in normal commercial manner although the Trust may not be
carrying on any business and the assets in respect whereof depreciation is claimed may not be
business assets. In all such cases, section 32 of the Income Tax Act providing for depreciation for
computation of income derived from business or profession is not applicable. However, the income
of the Trust is required to be computed under section 11 on commercial principles after providing
for allowance for normal depreciation and deduction thereof from gross income of the Trust.
Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) &
Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society In view of the aforestated Judgment of the
Bombay High Court, we answer question No. 1 in the affirmative i.e., in favour of the assessee and
against the department.
4. Question No. 2 herein is identical to the question which was raised before the Bombay High Court
in the case of Director of Income Tax (Exemption) v. Framjee Cawasjee Institute (1993) 109 CTR
463 (Bom). In that case, the facts were as follows:
The assessee was the Trust. It derived its income from depreciable assets. The
assessee took into account depreciation on those assets in computing the income of
the Trust. The Income Tax Officer held that depreciation could not be taken into
account because, full capital expenditure had been allowed in the year of acquisition
of the assets. The assessee went in appeal before the Assistant Appellate Date of
Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society
Commissioner. The appeal was rejected. The Tribunal, however, took the view that
when the Income Tax Officer stated that full expenditure had been allowed in the
year of acquisition of the assets, what he really meant was that the amount spent on
acquiring those assets had been treated as 'application of income' of the Trust in the
year in which the income was spent in acquiring those assets. This did not mean that
in computing income from those assets in subsequent years, depreciation in respect
of those assets cannot be taken into account. This view of the Tribunal has been
confirmed by, the Bombay High Court in the above judgment. Hence, Question No. 2
is covered by the decision of the Bombay High Court in the above judgment.
Consequently, Question No. 2 is answered in the affirmative i.e., in favour of the
assessee and against, the department.
Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society After
hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the aforesaid view
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61323501/ 4
Pr.Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Daughters Of St.Mary Of Providence ... on 14 August, 2018
taken by the Bombay High Court correctly states the principles of law and there is no
need to interfere with the same."
6. Since the issue regarding claim of Depreciation in the hands of the Charitable
Trust is no longer res integra, We are of the opinion that no substantial question of
law now arises in the present Appeals filed by the Revenue."
4. With regard to carrying forward of the losses for being set off against the income of
the charitable trust for the present Assessment Year, the controversy is covered by
the judgment in Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) and another Vs. Ohio
University Christ College rendered on 17.07.2018 in ITA.No.312/2016 and ITA
No.313/2016, in which this Court held as under:
"16. In so far as the second question proposed by the Revenue, quoted above is
concerned also, Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner
of Income Tax (Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence
Society we find that the Tribunal's findings in this regard do not give rise to any
substantial question of law. The said findings are quoted below for ready reference :
"5.1 In the course of assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer observed that the assessee had
claimed application of income on account of expenditure of earlier years, which has been brought
forward and set off in the year under consideration. The Assessing Officer disallowed the same on
the ground that there is no express provision in the Act permitting the adjustment of earlier years
brought forward expenses as application of income in the current year. According to the Assessing
Officer, the application of income for charitable purposes must be during the relevant previous year.
Since the income of the trust is exempt from tax, the question of deficit does not arise and also the
trust is required to utilize 85% of the income of the previous year for charitable purposes during the
year. In Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society this view of the matter and
for the above reasons, the Assessing Officer disallowed the assessee's claim of expenditure of earlier
years being brought forward and set off during the year.
5.2 On appeal, the learned CIT (Appeals) allowed the amortization of the expenditure as claimed by
the assessee and deleted the disallowance made by the Assessing Officer by placing reliance on the
decision of the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Society of the Sisters of St. Anne
reported in 146 ITR 28 (1984) and CBDT Circular No.5-P(LXX)-6 of 1968.
5.3.1 We have heard the rival contentions of both the learned Departmental Representatives for
Revenue and the learned Authorised Representative for the assessee and perused and carefully
considered the material on record, including the judicial pronouncements cited. The facts of the
issue before us is that the assessee had Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr.
Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence
Society incurred certain preliminary expenditure in the year of setting up of the trust. The same is
amortised by the assessee trust over a period of 5 years from the year of incurring of expenditure.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61323501/ 5
Pr.Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Daughters Of St.Mary Of Providence ... on 14 August, 2018
The fact of amortization was not disputed by the Assessing Officer in the assessment proceedings for
Assessment Year 2007-08 where the entire amount was added back claiming 1/5th of the
expenditure. The un-amortized expenditure has been brought forward and set off as application of
income in subsequent years, including the assessment years 2008-09 and 2009-10 which are under
consideration.
5.3.2 We find that the issue before us is directly related to the issue decided by the Hon'ble
Karnataka High Court in the case of Sisters of St. Anne (supra) cited by the assessee. In the said
case, the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court at paras 8 to 10 thereof has held as under : -
Xxxxxxx .......
Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society 5.3.3
Further, the CBDT Circular No.5-P (LXX)-6 of 1968 cited by the assessee makes it
clear that income should be understood in its commercial sense : in the case of trusts
also and therefore the commercial principle enunciated by the Hon'ble Karnataka
High Court in the above referred case of Sisters of St. Anne (supra) applies to trusts
as well. In view of the factual and legal matrix of this issue in the case on hand as
discussed above, we concur with the decision of the learned CIT (Appeals) in
cancelling the disallowance made by the Assessing Officer and in allowing the
amortization of expenses. Consequently, Ground No.B (1 to 6) of the Revenue's
appeal for Assessment Year 2008-09 and Ground No.C for Assessment Year 2009-10
are dismissed."
17. In our opinion, the matter is squarely covered by a decision of the cognate Bench
of this Court in the case of CIT vs. Society of the Sisters of St. Anne (1984) 16 Taxman
400 (Kar.) and (1984) 146 Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr.
Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of
Providence Society ITR 28, wherein the congnate Bench of this Court held that even
the depreciation not involving any cash outflow is also in the character of expenditure
and therefore such depreciation is nothing but decrease in the value of property
through wear and tear, deterioration or obsolescence and the allowance made for that
purpose in the books of accounts were deemed to be the application of funds for the
purpose of Sec. 11 of the Act. The relevant portion of the said judgment is also quoted
below for ready reference:
"11. Mr. Srinivasan, however, urged that there are enough indications in Section 11 to
exclude the mercantile system of accounting. The learned counsel relied upon
sections 11(1)(a) and 11(4) in support of his contention. We do not think that there is
anything in these sub-sections to support the contention of Mr. Srinivasan.
Explanation to section 11(1)(a) on the contrary takes note of the income not received
in a particular year. It lends support to the contention of the assessee that accounting
need not only be on cash basis. Section 11(4) is not intended to Date of Judgment 14

-08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) &
Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society explain how the accounts of
the business undertaking should be maintained. It is intended only to bring to tax the
excess income computed under the provisions of the Act in respect of business
undertaking.
12. The depreciation if it is not allowed as necessary deduction for computing the
income from the charitable institutions, then there is no way to preserve the corpus
of the trust for deriving the income. The Board also appears to have understood the
`income' under section 11(1) in its commercial sense. The relevant portion of the
Circular No.5XX-6 of 1968, dated 19-6- 1968 (See Taxmann's Direct Taxes Circulars,
Vol. 1, 1980 edn. P.85) reads:
"Where the trust derives income from house property, interest on securities, capital
gains, or other sources, the word `income' should be understood in its commercial
sense, i.e., book income, after adding back any appropriations or applications thereof
towards the purposes Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr.
Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of
Providence Society of the trust or otherwise, and also after adding back any debits
made for capital expenditure incurred for the purposes of the trust or otherwise. It
should be noted, in this connection, that the amounts so added back will become
chargeable to tax under section 11(3) to the extent that they represent outgoings for
purposes other than those of the trust. The amounts spent or applied for the purposes
of the trust from out of the income, computed in the aforesaid manner, should not be
less than 75 per cent of the latter, if the trust is to get the full benefit of the exemption
under section 11(1)."
13. In CIT v. Trustee of H.E.H. The Nizam's Supplemental Religious Endowment Trust (1981) 127
ITR 378, the Andhra Pradesh High Court has accepted the accounts maintained in respect of the
trust in conformity with the principles of accountancy for the purposes of determining the income
derived from the property held in trust."
Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) &
Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society
18. In view of the aforesaid findings of the learned Tribunal, allowing any expenditure of the earlier
year which has been brought forward and set off in the year under consideration, is a justified
finding of fact based on the correct interpretation of law and the judgment relied upon by it
rendered by the cognate Bench. Therefore, the same does not call for interference. A similar view
was also taken by the Division Bench of Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v.
Institute of Banking (2003) 264 ITR 110, wherein the Division Bench of Bombay High Court held
that the income derived from the trust property has also got to be computed on commercial
principles and if commercial principles are applied, then adjustment of expenses incurred by the
trust for charitable and religious purposes in the earlier years against the income earned by the trust
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61323501/ 7
Pr.Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Daughters Of St.Mary Of Providence ... on 14 August, 2018
in the subsequent year will have to be regarded as application of income of the trust for charitable
and religious purposes in the subsequent year. The relevant portion of the said judgment of Bombay
High Court is also quoted below for ready reference :
Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Exemptions) & Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society "Normal
depreciation can be considered as a legitimate deduction in computing the real
income of the assessee on general principles or under section 11(1)(a) of the
Inome-tax Act, 1961. Income of a charitable trust derived from building, plant and
machinery and furniture is liable to be computed in a normal commercial manner
although the trust may not be carrying on any business and the assets in respect
whereof depreciation is claimed may not be business assets. In all such cases, section
32 of the Act providing for depreciation, for computation of income derived from
business or profession is not applicable.
However, the income of the trust is required to be computed under section 11 on commercial
principles after providing for allowance for normal depreciation and deduction thereof from the
gross income of the trust.
Income derived from the trust property has also got to be computed on Date of Judgment 14
-08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) & Another Vs.
Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society commercial principles and if commercial principles are
applied, then adjustment of expenses incurred by the trust for charitable and religious purposes in
the earlier years against the income earned by the trust in the subsequent year will have to be
regarded as application of income of the trust for charitable and religious purposes in the
subsequent year in which adjustment had been made having regard to the benevolent provisions
contained in section 11 of the Act and such adjustment will have to be excluded from the income of
the trust under section 11(1)(a)."
In view of the controversy covered by the above decisions of this Court, we are of the opinion that
the substantial question of law as suggested by the appellants does not now arise for our further
consideration in the present appeal.
Date of Judgment 14 -08-2018 I.T.A.No.325/2018 Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) &
Another Vs. Daughters of St. Mary of Providence Society The appeal filed by Revenue is accordingly
disposed of in terms of the aforesaid judgments of this Court. No costs.
