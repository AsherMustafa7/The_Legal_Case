that even as per F.I.R, the defacto complainant is not an eye witness to the occurrence. The incident

time, in fact, the deceased is the person who is a aggressor in this case, has assaulted one
Arumugam, who is A3 in this case. Initially, the deceased had assaulted the appellants with sticks
and stones, due to which, Arumugam(A3) in this case sustained injuries. On the complaint given by

and four of his friends.

were having drinks together and the incident https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.A.Nos.578 &

major part of the investigation is over and the appellants are in custody from 10.06.2021 onwards

may be imposed on them and prayed that the appeals may be allowed and the appellants may be
granted bail.

and 2 would submit that case has been registered based on the complaint given by one Thamarai
Selvi, wife of the deceased. As per the complaint, her husband gone out from her house at 8 pm and
at about 8.30 pm she was informed by her relative that the accused had assaulted her husband and
his friends with sticks and stones. The incident had occurred when the accused were drinking and
the accused had abused the victim calling his caste name and brutally assaulted him. Based on the
complaint given by A3, case in Crime No.207 of 2021 had been registered against the deceased and
four of his friends. He would further submit that investigation has been completed
