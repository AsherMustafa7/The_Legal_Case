Letkhogin Vaiphei vs The Special Secretary (Home) on 25 January, 2023
O R D E R (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] Challenge in this writ petition is to the order dated 09.09.2022 of the Special
Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, whereby the petitioner was WP(Cril.)
No. 42 of 2022 Page 1 subjected to preventive detention in exercise of power under
Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1988. He seeks a consequential writ of habeas corpus to set him at
liberty forthwith. [2] Heard Mr. Th.Jugindro, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr.
S.Nepolean, learned Government Advocate, appearing for respondents No.1 and 2;
and Mr. W.Darakishwor, learned Sr. PCCG appearing for respondent No.3. [3] The
primary ground of attack urged by Mr. Th. Jugindro, learned counsel, is the
unexplained delay in the disposal of the petitioner's representation against his
detention. The petitioner's representation was dated 20.09.2022 and was rejected on
19.10.2022. The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, reflects that para-wise comments were received upon the
said representation on 19.10.2022 and it was rejected on the very same day.
[4] The file of the detaining authority is produced by Mr.S.Nepolean, learned Government Advocate,
and it reflects that the Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, forwarded 5(Five) copies of the
petitioner's representation to the Inspector General of Prisons, Manipur, on 20.09.2022 itself and
they were received in the Directorate of Prisons, Manipur, on 21.09.2022. In turn, the Inspector
General of Prisons, Manipur, forwarded the 5(Five) copies of the petitioner's representation to the
Home Department on 22.09.2022 and they were received on the very same day. Thereafter, letter
dated 18.10.2022 was addressed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, to the
Director General of Police, Manipur, calling for para-wise comments on the said representation. The
same were furnished on the very next day by the Superintendent of Police, Bishnupur District,
leading to rejection of the petitioner's representation on 19.10.2022. However, no explanation is
forthcoming as WP(Cril.) No. 42 of 2022 Page 2 to why para-wise comments were not called for by
the Home Department till 18.10.2022 when the petitioner's representation was received by the
Home Department as long back as on 22.09.2022.
[5] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme
Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to
indifference or any other lapse, such delay would adversely affect further detention of the prisoner.
According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in
disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the delay is very short, as even longer
delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is
explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that case was a mere 5 days.
[6] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur [AIR 1972 Supreme Court
438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground that there was unexplained
delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by the detenu.

Letkhogin Vaiphei vs The Special Secretary (Home) on 25 January, 2023
[7] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and others
[(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the
Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government
denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the delay by the State
Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and
guarantees granted to a detenu.
WP(Cril.) No. 42 of 2022 Page 3
[8] Though it is laudable that the Government of Manipur is waging a 'war on
drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug manufacture, trafficking
and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its responsibility to ensure that
procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the Constitutional and statutory
rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite this Court stating to this effect
time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to compliance with the
prescribed norms. [9] The unexplained somnolence on the part of the State authorities in dealing
with the detenu's representation clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on their part,
which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The same would
also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order.
[10] The order of detention dated 09.09.2022 issued by the Special Secretary (Home), Government
of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand
set aside. The petitioner, Letkhogin Vaiphei (26), S/o Khutinlun Vaiphei of Tangmual Village, PO &
PS- Churachandpur, Churachandpur District, Manipur, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central
Jail, Sajiwa, shall be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly required in
connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 42 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
A copy of this order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information
and necessary further action in the context of educating the detaining authorities in the State of
Manipur as to what are the procedural and temporal WP(Cril.) No. 42 of 2022 Page 4 norms that
they need to adhere to while exercising power and jurisdiction under preventive detention laws.
