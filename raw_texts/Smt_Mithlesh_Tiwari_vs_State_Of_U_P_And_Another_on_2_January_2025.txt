1. Heard Sri Dharmendar Pratap Singh Chauhan, learned counsel for the applicant and Sri Pankaj

2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the entire proceeding of Complaint
No. 186658 of 2023 (Birendra Pratap Singh vs. Smt. Mithlesh Tiwari), u/s 138 N.I. Act, P.S.

him to file compounding application with the cost of 10% of the cheque amount.
4. Apex court in the case of Damodar S. Prabhu (supra) has issued following guidelines, paragraph
no.21 of the said judgement is being quoted as under:
"21. With regard to the progression of litigation in cheque bouncing cases, the learned
Attorney General has urged this Court to frame guidelines for a graded scheme of
imposing costs on parties who unduly delay compounding of the offence. It was
submitted that the requirement of deposit of the costs will act as a deterrent for
delayed composition, since at present, free and easy compounding of offences at any
stage, however belated, gives an incentive to the drawer of the cheque to delay
settling the cases for years. An application for compounding made after several years
not only results in the system being burdened but the complainant is also deprived of
effective justice. In view of this submission, we direct that the following guidelines be
followed:
THE GUIDELINES
(i) In the circumstances, it is proposed as follows:
(a) That directions can be given that the writ of summons be suitably modified
making it clear to the accused that he could make an application for compounding of
the offences at the first or second hearing of the case and that if such an application is
made, compounding may be allowed by the court without imposing any costs on the
accused.
(b) If the accused does not make an application for compounding as aforesaid, then if
an application for compounding is made before the Magistrate at a subsequent stage,
compounding can be allowed subject to the condition that the accused will be
required to pay 10% of the cheque amount to be deposited as a condition for
compounding with the Legal Services Authority, or such authority as the court deems
fit.
(c) Similarly, if the application for compounding is made before the Sessions Court or
a High Court in revision or appeal, such compounding may be allowed on the
condition that the accused pays 15% of the cheque amount by way of costs.
(d) Finally, if the application for compounding is made before the Supreme Court, the
figure would increase to 20% of the cheque amount."
5. In view of the above, applicant is permitted to move an application for compounding u/s 147 of
the Act, 1881 along with the receipt of deposit of 10% of the cheque amount, payable to Dr. Rajendra
Prasad, National Law University, Prayagraj, within a period of 15 days.

6. In case, the applicant files the application along with the aforesaid deposit within 15 days, then

7. For a period of one month or till disposal of the above application of the applicant, no coercive
action shall be taken against the applicant.
8. It is made clear, if applicant fails to file the aforesaid application with required deposit within 15
days from today, then the court below will be free to proceed against the applicant.
9. With the aforesaid observations, the present application is disposed of.
