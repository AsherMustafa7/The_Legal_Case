Sandham Daho Singh @ Santikumar vs The Officer-In-Charge Of Kumbi Police ... on 27 November, 2023
[2] The petitioner was arrested on 09.01.2017 in connection with FIR No.2(1)2017 Kub-PS U/S 364
A/34 IPC & 25 (1-C) Arms Act. [3] Vide order dated 10.11.2021 passed in Cril.Misc.(B) Case No.64 of
2021, Ld. Sessions Judge, Bishnupur released the petitioner on interim bail for 90 days on medical
ground and vide another order dated 01.03.2022 passed in Cril.Misc.(B) Case No.7 of 2022, the
interim bail was further extended for a period of 60 days on medical ground. However, vide order
dated 30.04.2022 passed in Cril.Misc.(B) Case No.14 of 2022 (Annexure-A/8), interim bail was
rejected and the petitioner was taken into custody and it is stated that since then, the petitioner is in
custody. The petitioner and other four accused faced the trial in Sessions Trial Case No.3 of 2018 in
the Court of Sessions Judge, Bishnupur. PW No.7 was examined on 25.03.2022 and since then,
there is no progress in the trial and none of the other cited witnesses has been examined without
assigning any reason. It is submitted that out of the 5(five) accused, 2(two) Bail Application No.24 of
2022 Page |3 accused have already been released on default bail and the petitioner and 2(two) other
accused are languishing in custody.
[4] Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is innocent
and none of the 7 (seven) PWs examined so far, has stated anything implicating of the present
petitioner and the petitioner has a good chance of acquittal in the trial and confining him in custody
without any material will amount to punitive detention before completion of the trial. It is prayed
that the petitioner be released on bail during pendency of the trial. [5] Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner relies on a judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sagar
Tatyaram Gorkhe & Another vs. State of Maharashtra reported as (2021) 3 SCC 725 wherein the
Hon'ble Supreme Court released the accused as there is no progress in the trial. [6] Mr. Y. Ashang,
learned PP for the State Respondent submits that the petitioner was involved in the heinous crime
of abduction and ransom. It is further stated that the trial could not be proceeded further due to
Covid-19 Pandemic and the prevailing law and order condition in the State of Manipur. He further
stated that if the accused is released on bail, there is likelihood of him threatening the witnesses.
Accordingly, it is prayed that the Bail Application may be rejected.
Bail Application No.24 of 2022 Page |4 [7] This Court has considered the rival submissions made at
the bar and the materials on record.
[8] In the charge-sheet, 21 PWs are listed for examination and PW No.7 was last examined on
25.03.2022. It is admitted that there is no progress in the investigation and no satisfactory reason
has been provided by the prosecution. On bear perusal of the deposition of 7 PWs recorded so far,
nothing material has been stated by them implicating the present accused in the crime except for
stating that he was arrested and some of the PWs signed in the arrest memo. The specific role of the
petitioner is missing from the depositions of 7 PWs examined so far by the trial Court. Fourteen
more PWs are to be examined by the trial Court. It is the settled principle of law that rejection of bail
should not be neither punitive nor preventive. It is essential for securing the appearance of the
accused during the trial.
[9] In a celebrated case of Hussainara Khatoon v. Home Secy., State of Bihar reported as (1980) 1
SCC 81, right to speedy trial of offenders facing charges is "implicit in the broad sweep and content
of Article 21 and the same is a fundamental right.

Sandham Daho Singh @ Santikumar vs The Officer-In-Charge Of Kumbi Police ... on 27 November, 2023
[10] In the case of Mohd. Muslim Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) reported as AIR 2023 SC 1648, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held in Para 21 that "it would be important to reflect that laws which impose
stringent conditions for grant of bail, Bail Application No.24 of 2022 Page |5 may be necessary in
public interest; yet, if trials are not concluded in time, the injustice wrecked on the individual is
immeasurable" and the Court released the accused (a person involved in NDPS) on bail on the
ground of delay in trial. [11] In the case of Sanjay Chandra Vs. CBI reported as (2012) 1SCC 40 , the
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that the object of bail is to secure the appearance of the accused
person at his trial by reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor
preventative. Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment; unless it can be required to
ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon.
[12] Since the delay in trial has not been satisfactorily explained by the prosecution, this Court is
inclined to release the accused on bail as there is no progress in the trial and also none of the 7 PWs
examined so far by the trial Court, says anything against the accused for involvement in the alleged
heinous offences.
[13] Accordingly, the Bail Application is allowed with the following conditions:
a) The petitioner be released on bail on furnishing PR Bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees
fifty thousand) with a surety (government Bail Application No.24 of 2022 Page |6
employee) of like amount to the satisfaction of the Ld. Sessions Judge, Bishnupur;
b) The petitioners shall cooperate with the prosecution;
c) The petitioners shall appear before the trial Court on each day fixed for trial;
d) The petitioner shall not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses; and
e) On breach of any of the aforesaid conditions, the respondent is at liberty to
approach this Court for appropriate order in accordance with law.
[14] Send a copy of this order to learned Sessions Judge, Bishnupur for information.
