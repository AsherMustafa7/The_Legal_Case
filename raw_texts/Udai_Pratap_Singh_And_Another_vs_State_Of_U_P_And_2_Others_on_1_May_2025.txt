Hon'ble Ashwani Kumar Mishra,J.
Hon'ble Praveen Kumar Giri,J.
1. This petition is directed against an order passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest, Gorakhpur
Division, Gorakhpur, dated 22.04.2014, as well as a subsequent order of the Divisional Forest
Officer, Gorakhpur Forest Division, Gorakhpur dated 27.06.2014. By these two orders, petitioners'
claim for grant of permission to cut their trees on 9.4 acres of land has been rejected.
2. The facts of the case as emerge from the records are that petitioners' ancestors, namely, Champa
Devi (grand mother of the petitioners) was recorded over plot no. 806/2 corresponding to new plot

no. 769/2, area 9.40 acre situated in Village Rajaura Panjum, Pargana Haveli, Tehsil Sadar, District
Gorakhpur. The land now forms part of District Maharajganj. According to petitioners, an objection
was filed in consolidation proceedings under section 9A(2) of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act as
to whether the plot in question is a reserved forest or not. An order came to be passed in
consolidation proceedings holding that plot no. 806/2 area 9.40 acre is on the other side of Rajaura
minor and, therefore, it be recorded in the name of Ram Bihari. This order was challenged in
revision which was dismissed. The forest department of the State filed writ petition No. 26397 of
1994 which came to be dismissed on 03.08.1995 by following orders:
"A perusal of the order passed by Ziladhikari/Zila Up-Sanchalak (Chakbandi)
Maharajganj, shows that the order is based on consideration of an order dated
09.05.61 of the Forest Settlement Officer passed in favour of contesting respondent
and entry in khasra 1359 F. In view of the order dated 9.5.61, the consolidation
authorities can not be said to have committed any error which may be is apparent on
the face of the record is holding that the property does not belong to forest
department. The land belonging to individual tenure holder can not be declared as
"Reserve Forest" Under Section 4 readwith section 20 of the Forest Act."
3. This Court for the purposes of dismissing the writ petition had taken note of an order passed by
Forest Settlement Officer in favour of the petitioners' ancestor dated 09.05.1961, as per which, the
land in question was not a forest land. The judgement of learned Single Judge dated 03.08.1995 was
then carried in appeal before the Supreme Court by the State which was also dismissed on the
ground of delay.
4. It appears that after the previous round of litigation the claim of the petitioners' ancestor had
attained finality. The claim of State with regard to land being forest land was revived relying upon a
notification issued on 13.09.1977 under section 20 of the Forest Act. By this notification, 40 odd
acres of land was declared as forest land. The petitioners contested the proceedings on the ground
that total area of pot no. 806 was 63.93 acre and the land included in forest by virtue of notification
under section 20 was limited to 40 odd acres. We may note that the claim of the petitioners was not
accepted by the Divisional Forest Officer on 08.03.2013. Against this order, a revision was
permitted to be filed before the Chief Conservator of Officer and a Division Bench of this Court
disposed of the writ petition No. 13248 of 2014, filed by the petitioners vide order dated 04.03.2014.
The order is reproduced hereinunder:
"Since the Revision which has been filed by the petitioner before the Chief
Conservator of Forest, Gorakhpur on 30 July 2013 is still pending and having regard
to the statement made by the learned counsel that the arguments were concluded on
4 September 2013, we direct the second respondent to dispose of the Revision
expeditiously, and within a period of two months of the receipt of a certified copy of
this order.
The petition is, accordingly, disposed of."

5. Pursuant to this order of the writ court the Chief Conservator of Forest has rejected the claim of
the petitioner. Thus aggrieved the petitioners are before this Court.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the order of Chief Conservator of Forest is
arbitrary and perverse. In as much as the authority concerned has not cared to examine the facts of
the case in correct prospective. It is urged that the basis for rejecting the claim of the petitioners is
the subsequent notification under section 20 dated 13.09.1977. The discussion and finding
contained in the order of the Chief Conservator of Forest is reproduced hereinunder:

7. This Court on 10.07.2023, called upon the State to clarify as to what is the total area of plot no.
806. The order dated 10.07.2023 is reproduced hereinunder:
"1. As per notification of the year 1977, an area of 41.52 Hectare of Plot No.806 was
declared as Reserved Forest. The petitioners claim right over 9.40 acre (3.6 Hectare)
of the said plot. The total area of Plot No.806 has not been disclosed.
2. As prayed, time is allowed for filing the supplementary affidavit annexing
therewith revenue records to show the total area of the said plot and the persons
recorded over it in the year 1977 immediately before the issuance of the notification
dated 13.9.1977 u/s 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927.
3. List this matter on 25.7.2023."
8. A supplementary affidavit is filed by the respondent sworn by the Range Forest Officer,
Gorakhpur Forest Division, Gorakhpur, in which the total area of plot no. 806 is mentioned as 63.93
acre. Paragraph nos. 4 and 5 of the supplementary counter affidavit is extracted hereinbelow:
"4. That according to the CH Form No. 2-Ka of the year 1975. the total area of Gata
No. 806 is 63.93 acre, in which 40.77 acre (16.499 Hect.) is recorded as "Jangal
Sakhoo" and according to the CH Form 2-Ka of the year 1975, in the Gata No. 806,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49612239/ 3
Udai Pratap Singh And Another vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 1 May, 2025
the Gata No. 806/2 area 40.77 acre is recorded as "Jangal Sakhoo", Gata No. 806/1/1
area 15.11 acre is recorded in the name of Smt. Ramvasi Devi, Gata No. 806/1/3 area
4.81 acre is recorded in the name of Mewa Lal son of Rampav but in the Khasra the
said gata is recorded as "Jangal Sakhoo", Gata No. 806/1/2 area 3.50 acre is recorded
in the name of Smt. Ramvasi Devi but in the khasra the said gata is recorded as
"Jangal Sakhoo" and gata no. 806/3 area 1.24 acre is recorded in the name of Jatan
Basrat. Copy of the CH Form-2-Ka is being filed herewith and marked as
ANNEXURE NO. SA-1 to this affidavit.
5. That the area of the land in dispute is 9.4 acre and the land which is disputed in the
writ petition is undisputedly Reserve Forest Land, which has been declared as
Reserve Forest Land by the Gazette Notification No. 4712/14-2-20 (138)-76 dated
13.09.1977 issued under Section 20 of Indian Forest Act, 1927. Copy of the gazette
Notification No. 4712/14-2-20 (138)-76 dated 13.09.1977 and copy of the Map
according to the Gazette notification are being filed herewith and marked as
ANNEXURE NO. SA-2 & 3 to this affidavit."
9. From the stand taken by the respondent, it remains undisputed that though the total area of plot
806 is 63.93 acre but the land notified under section 20 as forest land is only 41.52 acres. Remaining
land of plot 806 is not shown to have been notified as forest land. According to petitioners their plot
of 9.4 acre forms part of the remaining land which is not notified as forest land.
10. A supplementary affidavit has also been filed by the petitioners placing on record an order
passed by the revenue authority under section 24 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 in case no. 201 of
2016. As per which petitioners' land (identified with reference to new plot no. 769) is an area of 3.62
hectare which has been demarcated on the spot.
11. Learned State counsel, however, submits that in respect of forest land the revenue authorities
have no power to carry out demarcation.
12. Be that as it may, in the facts of the case, we find that the claim of the petitioners in respect of 9.4
acre land has been rejected primarily on the ground that such land forms part of notification issued
under section 20 of the Forest Act dated 13.09.1977.
13. The order of Chief Conservator of Forest fails to notice the total area of the plot and also does not
consider as to whether petitioners' 9.4. acre land forms part of the land notified as forest land or it
forms part of the land which is left out of the notification issued under section 20. This
determination would also require physical survey of the spot. According to the revenue authorities,
petitioners' land is out of forest. In the previous round of litigation the claim of the petitioners'
ancestor has been accepted and has attained finality up to the Supreme Court. Since on these
aspects there is no consideration or finding in the order of the Chief Conservator of Forest as such
the orders impugned cannot be sustained.

14. Consequently, the writ petition succeeds and is allowed. The impugned order dated 22.04.2014
passed by the Chief Conservator of Forest, Gorakhpur Division, Gorakhpur, and subsequent order
dated 27.06.2014 passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, Gorakhpur Forest Division, Gorakhpur are
set aside and quashed. The matter stands remitted to the Chief Conservator of Forest for a fresh
consideration of cause in terms of the above observation after affording opportunity of hearing to
the parties within a period of four months.
