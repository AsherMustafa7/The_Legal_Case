Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
ORDER
W.P Nos.19386/2016, 21468/2016, 22370/2016 and 23622/2016 are filed in public interest and the
other writ petitions are filed by the individual persons in their personal interest. Now, we shall go
through the facts of each of the writ petitions in seriatim.
I. Brief facts of the case
(a) Writ Petition No.21468/2016 (PIL) by AAB:
2. This writ petition is filed by the Advocates Association, Bengaluru in public
interest for a writ of certiorari to quash the notifications dated 19.3.2016 vide
Annexures - F, G, H and J. By Annexure-F notification, the Government of Karnataka
authorized all the Deputy Superintendents of Police, office of the Anti Corruption
Bureau ('ACB' for short) for the purpose of investigation in consonance with the
provisions of Section 17 of the Prevention of Corruption Act ('PC Act' for short). By
Annexure-G notification, the Government of Karnataka has superseded the
Notification No.HD 286 PEG 90 dated 6.2.1991 with immediate effect. This would
mean that the power to investigate any offence under the provisions of the PC Act by
the Police Wing of the Karnataka Lokayukta as prescribed under section 17 of the PC
Act, is superseded. By Annexure-H notification, the Government of Karnataka, in
exercise of the powers under the provisions of Clause (s) of Section 2 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, declared that the office of the ADGP, Anti Corruption Bureau,
Bengaluru as Police Station having jurisdiction for the whole of the State of
Karnataka. By Annexure-J notification, the Government of Karnataka, in exercise of
the powers under the provisions of Clause (s) of Section 2 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, has superseded the Notifications NO.HD 292 PEG 2000, dated 8.5.2002
and HD 324 PEG 2002, dated 5.12.2002 with immediate effect. With this
notification, the office of the ADGP, Lokayukta would no longer have the effect of that
of a Police Station.
3. It is the case of the petitioner/Advocates association that the Association was
registered under the provisions of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act to cater to
the needs and necessities of the Advocates fraternity and office bearers are elected by
the enrolled and practicing Lawyers, who are further enrolled as members of the
Advocates Association. The petitioner Association has been keenly interested and is
actively concerned with the problems of the common man and has actively voiced in
various forums and platforms. It is further case of the petitioner that prior to the
Karnataka Lokayukta Act,1984 ('KL Act' for short) came into force, there used to be a
Vigilance Commission to look into the grievances of the people. That in view of more
effectively ensuring better administrative action, check the omissions and
commissions, cater to the common man, the State Legislature in its endeavour to
clean the Augean stables, was pleased to enact KL Act which was intended to be a pro
people Act as a self contained mechanism through which the grievances of the people
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 24
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
of the State can get effective redressal as also the mischief of the erstwhile Vigilance
Commission could also be cured.
4. The Provisions of Section 3 of the KL Act regulates the method of appointment of
Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta. A person to be appointed as the Lokayukta shall be a
person who has held the office of a Judge of the Supreme Court or that of the Chief
Justice of a High Court or a person who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court
for not less than ten years and a person to be appointed as a Upa-Lokayukta shall be
a person who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court for not less than five
years. There would be sufficient number of officers to ensure the effective functioning
of the Institution. The State of Karnataka has framed rules for recruitment of the staff
in the Lokayukta called Karnataka Lokayukta (Cadre, Recruitment and conditions of
service of the officers and employees) Rules, 1988. Rule 3 thereof provides for the
strength and composition of the staff of the Lokayukta and states that the staff shall
be recruited as detailed in the first schedule of the Rules. Rule 4 of the said Rules
prescribes the method of recruitment. The first schedule divides the staff into four
wings viz.,
i) Administrative and Enquiry Wing
ii) Technical Wing
iii) Police Wing
iv) General Wing The Administrative and Enquiry Wing consists of District Judge,
Senior Civil Judge, Civil Judge, Public Prosecutor and others to handle the charge
sheeted cases before the jurisdictional Courts;
Technical Wing consists of Chief Engineer, Superintendent Engineer, Executive Engineer and
others; Police Wing consists of Additional Director General of Police or Inspector General of Police,
Deputy Inspector General of Police and others; General Wing consists of Audit Officer, Office
Superintendent and others. The aspirations and the grievances of the common man have been met
with since the time Lokayukta has been constituted, which has further received the Presidential
Assent. It is hence holding the corruption prevention mechanism by an enactment.
5. It is further submitted that by a notification dated 6.2.1991, the Police Inspectors of the Lokayukta
were authorized with the powers of investigation to meet the requirement of Section 17 of the PC
Act. That thereafter by notification dated 2.11.1992, the State Government in exercise of the power
conferred by the first proviso to Section 17 of the PC Act, authorized all the Inspectors of Police,
Office of the Karnataka Lokayukta, for the purpose of the said proviso, subject to the general and
overall control and supervision by the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta as the case may be.
6. As there were certain issues which stood raised against the creation of post of an Additional
Director General of Police and the control of the Police officers working in the Lokayukta
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 25
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
organization, the matter reached the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Apex Court in the case of C.
Rangaswamaiah and others -vs- Karnataka Lokayukta and others1 decided on 21.7.1998 laid down
the law that the Police officers on the rolls of the Karnataka Lokayukta work under the supervision
and control of the Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta and there can always be a solution to the
deputation of the police officers to the Lokayukta, keeping in view the independence of the
Lokayukta and its effective functioning as maters of utmost importance. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
also observed that the legislative intent behind the enactment is to see that public servants covered
by the sweep of the Act should be answerable for their actions as such to the AIR 1998 SC 2496
Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta, so that these statutory authorities can work as real Ombudsmen for
ensuring that people's faith in the working of these public servants is not shaken. These statutory
authorities are meant to cater to the need of the public at large with a view to see that public
confidence in the working of the public bodies remains intact. When such authorities consist of high
judicial dignitaries, it would be obvious that such authorities should be armed with appropriate
powers and sanctions so that their orders and opinions do not become mere paper directions. The
decisions of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta, therefore, must be capable of being fully implemented.
These authorities should not be reduced to mere paper tigers but must be armed with proper teeth
and claws so that the efforts put in by them are not wasted and their reports are not shelved by the
disciplinary authorities concerned.
7. It is also submitted by the petitioner/Advocates Association that KL Act was amended by
Karnataka Act No.35 of 2015 and certain mechanisms to regulate the appointment of Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta and the procedure to remove them is also amended and the said ordinance has
received the assent of the Governor on 19.8.2015. With this amendment, the intention of the State
Legislature was to make the public feel proud about the establishment of the organization and
further make every action of the said organization accountable and in genuine public interest.
8. It is further case of the petitioner/Advocates Association that due to the reasons beyond the
reach, there would be pendency of cases, investigation, delay in securing sanction and related issues
and the learned Single Judge of this Court in Criminal Petition No.2653/2015 has issued a series of
directions to the State to ensure that the office of Lokayukta is strengthened, capable officers
appointed, officers serving more than the period prescribed weeded out, the public prosecutors
appointed to ensure speedy trial, the vacancies to be filled up within a time bound period and the
Lokayukta manual be prepared and circulated etc., In fact, the respondent/State have represented to
the learned Single Judge of this Court by an affidavit that it is their endeavour to ensure that the
office of the Lokayukta is strengthened at all costs and it would be more accountable and worthy of
public trust. The learned Single Judge of this Court has relied upon several judgments of the Apex
Court covering the field to strengthen the office of Lokayukta to ensure that the mal administration
is stemmed at the bud.
9. When the things stood thus, the State Government created Anti Corruption Bureau in Karnataka
by Government Order dated 14.3.2016 and issued notifications dated 19.03.2016 authorizing all the
Deputy Superintendents of Police in consonance with Section 17 of the PC Act for the purpose of
investigation. The notification issued by the State Government is to defunct the Lokayukta and it
would virtually defeat the very purpose for which the office of Lokayukta was constituted and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 26
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
created a parallel body through an executive notification to achieve the same purpose with lesser
intent. Therefore, the notification constituting the ACB is unsustainable, suffers from malafides and
legal infirmities. When the Karnataka Lokayukta Act was assented by the President, that would
prevail and the field occupied cannot be eroded and the respondents cannot trench upon the
occupied field. It is nothing, but transgression by an administrative order to usurp the powers of
Lokayukta. It is further submitted that the impugned executive order passed by the State
Government has indirectly diluted the powers of the Lokayukta and the ACB cannot function either
as a parallel body or an alternate body or substitute the Lokayukta. Therefore, the notification
constituting the ACB for a function already being conferred to the Lokayukta, is impermissible in
law. Hence the present writ petition is filed for the relief sought for.
(b) Writ Petition No.19386/2016 (PIL) by Advocate:
10. This writ petition is filed by Mr.Chidananda Urs., Practising Advocate, in public interest for a
writ of certiorari to quash the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 issued by the 1st respondent
constituting ACB as per Annexure D so also subsequent supporting notifications dated 19.3.2016
issued by the 5th respondent as per Annexure - E, E1 E2 and E3.
11. It is the case of petitioner that he is a practicing Advocate for more than 15 years and he has
co-authored a commentary titled "Commentaries on Foreign Exchange Management Act, and
Money Laundering Law" which is published by Lexis Nexis Butterworth. The petitioner is also a
Chartered Accountant and has been a speaker in various forums on Taxation Laws and also on the
law of money laundering. It is further case of the petitioners that the Respondent Nos.1 to 5 by
issuance of impugned notifications have caused closure of Police Wing attached to the premier anti
corruption institution in the State of Karnataka viz., The Karnataka Lokayukta. The institution of
Karnataka Lokayukta has been created under the provisions of the KL Act, which came into
existence for improving the standards of public administration, by looking into complaints against
administrative actions including cases of corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in
administrative machinery. The Police Wing attached to the Karnataka Lokayukta was known to be
discharging its dual role, under the KL Act and also under the PC Act. The common man has
immense faith in the institution of Karnataka Lokayukta and also its Police Wing, that too after
handling investigation relating to mining scam. Further, the common man could have filed
complaint against anybody to set the law in to motion especially under the PC Act and there was no
bureaucratic impediment or decision required to initiate the proceedings against a complaint.
However, ACB was set up abruptly with an intention to take control of the pending investigation
against the high functionaries of the State, Bureaucrats etc., It also raises a very pertinent question
as to whether the process/proceedings/investigation initiated by the Police Wing of Karnataka
Lokayukta need any reconsideration by the ACB and also how would such proceedings be
completely taken over by another wing when these investigations are being completed by the Police,
which amounts to waste of public money and time and also would have deleterious consequences.
12. It is further case of the petitioner that the State Government by the notification dated 6.2.1991
deputed Police Personnel of various ranks to Karnataka Lokayukta and in addition to that the
notification was also issued under the provisions of Section 17 of the PC Act empowering the rank of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 27
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
Police Inspector and above to investigate offences under the PC Act. By such notification, the Police
personnel on deputation to Karnataka Lokayukta were placed under the Administrative and
Supervisory control of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta, as the case may be. The very object of the
notification referred above was to remove the bureaucratic control and political interference in the
matter relating to corruption, irrespective of the rank and position of the accused either in the
bureaucractic or political circles. At this stage, it has to be stated that a person to be appointed as the
Lokayukta shall be a person who has held the office of a Judge of the Supreme Court or that of the
Chief Justice of a High Court or a person who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court for not
less than ten years and a person to be appointed as a Upa-lokayukta shall be a person who has held
the office of a Judge of a High Court for not less than five years. Thus, the Police personnel who were
deputed to Karnataka Lokayukta were placed under the direct control and supervision of a retired
judge of the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice/Judge of the High Court with an intention to
command highest respect and fearless, impartial and fair investigation to be conducted even though
Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta are not the authorities under the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. The object of both the enactments i.e., KL Act and PC Act was to achieve common object
and goal of corruption free society. Both the legislations entail civil and criminal consequences and
both the authorities under these Acts are two different sides of the same coin. With this laudable
object, the Police Wing was deputed to Karnataka Lokayukta for performing a dual role.
13. It is further case of the petitioner that various reformative measures were taken and
implemented by the State Government in compliance of the orders passed in Criminal Petition
No.2653/2015. In the meanwhile, various complaints were reported to have been filed against the
incumbent Chief Minister of the State relating to corrupt practices followed in de-notification of
lands in Arkavathi layout. It is learnt through the print media that disproportionate asset case was
also registered against one Mr. Kapil Mohan, who is a Senior IAS Officer of the Karnataka Cadre. It
is also learnt that there are cases of corruption pending investigation against certain MLAs and
bureaucrats. In order to protect and scuttle the investigation against political class and bureaucrats,
notification dated 14.3.2016 came to be issued constituting ACB as authority for investigation under
the PC Act, thereby the very purpose of KL Act was indirectly defeated.
14. It is further case of the petitioner that as per the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
the complainant himself should not be an Investigating Officer. As per the notification, if any
complaint filed as against the Chief Minister or the Minister in the Council of Ministers, the Chief
Minister himself has to oversee the investigation and also permit investigation, thereby the
notification issued would be opposed to the rule of law and contrary to the dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah2. Thereby, he filed the present writ petition for the
reliefs sought for.
(c) W.P. No.23622/2016 (PIL) by Samaj Parivarthana Samudaya:
15. This writ petition is filed in public interest by Samaj Parivarthana Samudaya represented by its
founder President - Sri S.R. Hiremath, for a writ of certiorari to quash the Government Order dated
14.3.2016 issued by the State Government as per Annexure-A so also the subsequent supporting
notifications dated 19.3.2016 issued by the 2nd respondent as per Annexures - B,C,D and E. Supra

Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
at Footnote No.1
16. It is the case of the petitioner - 'Samaj Parivarthana Samudaya' that it is a voluntary organization
working in Karnataka, and other parts of India since 1984. It works in close cooperation with several
other voluntary organisations, networks and movements, to promote actions with people's power of
participation on a broader scale towards social transformation and to bring about larger collective
impacts on the Governmental policies, deliberated legislations and programmes, for human
wellbeing. It is also engaged in the activities for betterment of the society in general and for
protection of natural resources, in particular and working in the said direction for more than four
decades and it has filed several successful Public Interest Litigations before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court and this Court. The petitioner/organisation has taken strenuous efforts for public cause by
seeking judicial redressal in a number of litigations and several reported judgments in the name of
the organisaton before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Court clearly depict petitioner's concern
for preservation of natural resources and its fight against corruption at all levels.
17. It is further case of the petitioner that anti corruption institution that existed prior to 1984 was
Vigilance Commission. During the year 1984, the State Legislature enacted the KL Act which
provided for a self-contained mechanism through which the grievance of the people of the State can
get effective redressal. The Act also provided to cure some of the defects found in the Vigilance
Commission. The Act created the offices of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta. Section 3 of the KL Act
regulates the method of appointment of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta. A person to be appointed as
the Lokayukta shall be a person who has held the office of a Judge of the Supreme Court or that of
the Chief Justice of a High Court or a person who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court for
not less than ten years and a person to be appointed as a Upa-lokayukta shall be a person who has
held the office of a Judge of a High Court for not less than five years. There would be sufficient
number of officers to ensure the effective functioning of the Institution. The State of Karnataka has
framed rules for recruitment of the staff in the Lokayukta called Karnataka Lokayukta (Cadre,
Recruitment and conditions of service of the officers and employees) Rules, 1988. Rule 3 thereof
provides for the strength and composition of the staff of the Lokayukta and states that the staff shall
be recruited as detailed in the first schedule of the Rules. Rule 4 of the said Rules prescribes the
method of recruitment.
18. It is further case of the petitioner that by a notification dated 6.2.1991, the Police Inspectors of
the Lokayukta were authorized with the powers of investigation to meet the requirement of Section
17 of the PC Act. That thereafter by notification dated 2.11.1992, the State Government in exercise of
the power conferred by the first proviso to Section 17 of the PC Act, authorized all the Inspectors of
Police, Office of the Karnataka Lokayukta, for the purpose of the said proviso, subject to the general
and overall control and supervision by the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta as the case may be.
19. It is further case of the petitioner that as there were certain issues which stood raised against the
creation of post of an Additional Director General of Police and the control of the Police officers
working in the Lokayukta organization, the matter reached the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Apex
Court in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah decided on 21.7.1998 laid down the law that the Police
officers on the rolls of the Karnataka Lokayukta work under the supervision and control of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 29
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta and there can always be a solution to the deputation of the police
officers to the Lokayukta, keeping in view the independence of the Lokayukta and its effective
functioning as matters of utmost importance. The Hon'ble Supreme Court also observed that the
legislative intent behind the enactment is to see that public servants covered by the sweep of the Act
should be answerable for their actions as such to the Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta and such
authorities should be armed with appropriate powers and sanctions so that their orders and
opinions do not become mere paper directions. The decisions of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta,
therefore, must be capable of being fully implemented. These authorities should not be reduced to
mere paper tigers etc.,
20. It is also the case of the petitioner that KL Act was amended by Karnataka Act No.35 of 2015 and
certain mechanisms to regulate the appointment of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta and the
procedure to remove them is also amended. It is also submitted that the learned Single Judge of this
Court in Criminal Petition No.2653/2015 has issued a series of directions to the State to ensure that
the office of Lokayukta is strengthened, capable officers appointed, officers serving more than the
period prescribed weeded out, the public prosecutors appointed to ensure speedy trial, the vacancies
to be filled up within a time bound period and the Lokayukta manual be prepared and circulated
etc., In fact, the respondent/State have represented to the learned Single Judge of this Court by an
affidavit that it is their endeavour to ensure that the office of the Lokayukta is strengthened at all
costs and it would be more accountable and worthy of public trust.
21. It is the case of the petitioner that when things stood thus, contrary to the representations made
before the learned Single Judge, the State Government by Government Order dated 14.3.2016, has
created Anti Corruption Bureau in Karnataka, which would in effect virtually replace the very
establishment of the Lokayukta or make it redundant. Further, the State Government by the
notification dated 19.3.2016 authorized all the Deputy Superintendents of Police in consonance with
Section 17 of the PC Act for the purpose of investigation. The notification issued by the State
Government is to defunct the Lokayukta and it would virtually defeat the very purpose for which the
office of Lokayukta was constituted and created a parallel body through the executive notification to
achieve the same purpose with lesser intent. Therefore, the notification constituting the ACB is
unsustainable, suffers from malafides and legal infirmities.
22. It is further case of the petitioner that the very constitution of ACB by the Government is to
shield corrupt politicians, Ministers and the officers from the watchful eyes of the Lokayukta and
that Government is weakening the institution of Lokayukta to protect these persons from
prosecution, inter alia under the PC Act. In fact, the petitioner made representations from time to
time before the Lokayukta against the politicians, Ministers and the officers of the Government
alleging serious corruption and requesting the Lokayukta to initiate action. The State is bent upon
saving its corrupt Ministers and Officers and therefore the impugned Government Order and
subsequent supporting notifications are contrary to the very object of the KL Act.
23. It is also the case of the petitioner that as per the List II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution of
India, any law of the nature of the Lokayukta Act and its enactment would be within the competence
of the State Legislature and is insulated from administrative transgression. When the KL Act was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 30
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
assented by the President, that would prevail and the field occupied cannot be eroded and the
respondents cannot trench upon the occupied field. It is nothing but transgression by an
administrative order to usurp the powers of Lokayukta. It is further submitted that the impugned
executive order passed by the State Government has indirectly diluted the powers of the Lokayukta
and the ACB cannot function either as a parallel body or an alternate body or substitute the
Lokayukta. Therefore, the Government Order constituting the ACB for a function already being
conferred to the Lokayukta, is impermissible in law.
24. It is further case of the petitioner that the impugned Government Order constituting ACB
empowers the Chief Minister to veto investigation or the sanction of investigation. This itself defeats
the very purpose of the Anti Corruption Drive and ACB is not at all an independent body. The
Deputy Superintendent of Police of the ACB being a Class I Officer works under the authority of the
Chief Minister and any independent investigation is only a mirage. No serving officers would be in a
position to conduct an enquiry against the Chief Minister under whom they would be working as
subordinates. Therefore by the constitution of ACB, the basic investigation apparatus/mechanism is
dysfunctional. The ACB is constituted virtually to defeat the very purpose of PC Act itself. Such an
intention of the State must not be allowed to be accomplished. In the circumstances, the present
writ petition is filed for the reliefs sought for.
(d) W.P. No.16222/2017 (filed in personal interest):
25. This writ petition is filed by one Mr.K.T. Nagaraja, who is working in the cadre of Chief Engineer
in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagrapalike ('BBMP' for short) in his personal interest for a writ of
certiorari to quash the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB.
26. It is the case of the petitioner that he has maintained unblemished service record and working
sincerely in BBMP. However, the 3rd respondent/ACB has suo motu took up the matter alleging
that he has amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. On 23.10.2017 the
Inspector of Police attached to the 3rd respondent/ACB has submitted the report which depicts
200% disproportionate assets accumulated by him. Based on the said report, FIR came to be
registered in Crime No.8/2017 under the provisions of Section 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(2) of
the PC Act, on 27.2.2017. On the very next day, the 3rd respondent/ACB has conducted raid on the
house situated at No.455, III Block, 21st Cross, 4th Link Road, Jayanagar, Bengaluru. The petitioner
challenged the FIR before this Court in Criminal Petition No.3044/2017 and this Court by the order
dated 11.4.2017 granted interim order of stay of further proceedings.
27. It is further contended by the petitioner that the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984 has received the
assent of the President of India. The KL Act created the offices of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta.
Section 3 of the KL Act regulates the method of appointment of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta.
Further, there would be sufficient number of officers to ensure the effective functioning of the
Institution. The Karnataka Lokayukta establishment was divided into four wings viz.,
i) Administrative and Enquiry Wing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 31
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
ii) Technical Wing
iii) Police Wing
iv) General Wing The public servants covered under the KL Act include -
- Chief Minister
- All other Ministers
- Members of the State Legislature
- All Officers of the State Government
- Chairman, Vice Chairman of local authorities
- Statutory bodies/Corporation established under any law of the State Legislature.
28. It is further contended that by a notification dated 6.2.1991, the Police Inspectors of the
Lokayukta were authorized with the powers of investigation to meet the requirement of Section 17 of
the PC Act. The State of Karnataka has also issued notifications declaring the offices of Lokayukta as
Police Stations under Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal Procedure .
29. When things stood thus, the 1st respondent passed an Executive Order on 14.3.2016 constituting
ACB which lacks statutory force. This order passed under Article 162 of the Constitution of India is
contrary to the law. When the Police Force has already been established under the KL Act, the State
cannot pass Executive Order constituting the ACB. The constitution of ACB is one without authority
of law and though it purports to create an independent wing, it is controlled by the Chief Minister.
The petitioner submits that after the constitution of ACB by way of executive order, the 2nd
respondent issued notifications dated 19.3.2016, thereby superseding the earlier notifications dated
6.2.1991, 8.5.2012 and 5.12.2012. Thus, the Lokayukta Police Force is virtually abolished by the
aforesaid notifications. It is further contended that the constitution ACB itself is without basis and
without statutory backing. The 1st respondent cannot constitute an independent Police Force when
the field is occupied by the Karnataka Police Act, 1963. The Lokayukta Police was established under
the provisions of the KL Act and therefore backed by statute. However, the ACB is established by
means of an executive order, which has no legs to stand. The 3rd respondent cannot perform the
duty of Police unless it is established by means of statute. Therefore, constitution of ACB itself is
shaky, opposed to the provisions of law and therefore cannot perform the duty of the Police.
30. It is further contended that the Karnataka Lokayukta was primarily established for making
enquiries into administrative action relatable to matter specified in List II or List III of the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India. However, alongside the said function, a separate Police Wing
was constituted known as 'Lokayukta Police' which was entrusted with the function of registering,
investigating and enforcement of the provisions of the PC Act. The said Police Wing was an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 32
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
independent investigating agency. The said independent investigating agency is what was envisaged
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Prakash Singh -vs- Union of India3. Therefore, the
establishment of ACB is against the letter and spirit of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
Therefore, the petitioner sought for quashing the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting
ACB by allowing the present writ petition.
(e) Writ Petition No.16223/2017 (filed in personal interest):
31. This writ petition is filed by one Mr. Kale Gowda, who is working as Assistant Engineer in the
Public Works Department, Mandya, in his personal interest for a writ of certiorari to quash the
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB so also the First Information Report dated
6.2.2017 registered against him in Crime No.1/2017 by the ACB and all further proceedings pending
against him on the file of the ACB.
32. It is the case of the petitioner that the 2nd respondent/ACB collected source information
regarding his alleged income. The source report collected by the respondent No.2 includes the
independent income earned by his brother-in-law and (2006)8 SCC 1 mother-in-law. The said
source report depicts that the he has disproportionate income of 105.44% including the independent
income of his mother-in-law and brother-in-law. Based on the said report, the 2nd respondent/ACB
registered FIR against him on 6.2.2017. The petitioner further submits that Respondent No.2/ACB
sent a copy of the FIR to the concerned Court and obtained warrant from the Court to search his
house, his office and the house belonging to his brother-in-law and mother-in-law. The Court below,
without applying mind, issued warrant permitting to search the house belonging to his
brother-in-law and mother-in- law. The petitioner being a public servant, is governed by Karnataka
Civil Service (conduct) Rules. In fact, he has intimated his income received from the lawful sources
by filing his statement of assets and liabilities every year. The search mahazar drawn by the
respondent No.2 does not indicate that the petitioner has other sources of income and therefore, the
petitioner has not committed any offence under the provisions of Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act.
Without holding proper preliminary enquiry in corruption cases, FIR is registered, which is bad in
law.
33. The petitioner further contended that the 1st respondent passed an Executive Order on
14.3.2016 constituting ACB which lacks statutory force. The order passed under Article 162 of the
Constitution of India is contrary to the law. The executive power of the State with respect to which
the Legislature of the State has powers to make laws is subject to and limited by executive power.
When the Police force has already been established under the Karnataka Police Act, the State cannot
pass Executive Order constituting ACB. The constitution of ACB is one without authority of law and
though it purports to create an independent wing, it is controlled by the Hon'ble Chief Minister. The
ACB is under the exclusive control of the political executive. Therefore, there is an inherent danger
of making ACB as a tool for subverting the process of law. The petitioner submits that after the
constitution of ACB by way of executive order, the 2nd respondent issued notifications dated
19.3.2016, thereby superseding the earlier notifications dated 6.2.1991, 8.5.2002 and 5.12.2002 that
authorized the Lokayukta Police with powers to investigate and had declared the offices of Police
Inspectors of Lokayukta as Police Stations. Thus, the Lokayukta Police Force is abolished by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 33
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
aforesaid notifications. It is further contended that the constitution ACB itself is without basis and
without statutory backing. The 1st respondent cannot constitute an independent Police Force when
the field is occupied by the Karnataka Police Act, 1963. The Lokayukta Police was established under
the provisions of the KL Act and therefore backed by statute. However, the ACB is established by
means of an executive order, which has no legs to stand. The 2nd respondent cannot perform the
duty of Police unless it is established by means of statute. Hence, constitution of ACB itself is shaky,
opposed to the provisions of law and therefore cannot perform the duty of the Police. Therefore, the
petitioner sought for allowing the writ petition by quashing the Government Order dated 14.3.2016
constituting ACB so also the FIR registered against him.
(f) W.P. No.16697/17 (filed in personal interest):
34. This writ petition is filed by one Mr. Sidharth Bhupal Shingadi in his personal
interest praying to quash the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB so
also the First Information Report dated 6.3.2017 registered against him in Crime
No.3/2017 by the ACB and all further proceedings pending against him on the file of
the ACB.
35. It is the case of the petitioner that he was appointed as a Village Accountant on
21.3.1986 and posted to Jallapur village, Raibag Taluk and he worked in the said
place for a period of five years. Thereafter, he worked in several places of Belgavi
district.
While he was working as Village Accountant at Hirekodi village, the 5th respondent/complainant
has filed false and frivolous complaint dated 6.3.2017 before the 4th respondent alleging that the
complainant had given an application to change the revenue entry to his name on 18.6.2016 in the
office of the Tahasildar and when he enquired about the same, he was informed by the officials of
the Tahsildar office that, he will be issued notice through the petitioner (Village Accountant) and
thereafter to submit the relevant documents. Accordingly, the complainant visited the office of the
petitioner on 9.2.2017 and the petitioner directed him to approach the Village Assistant by name
Mr. Patel. Thereafter, the said Patel demanded bribe amount of Rs.5,000/- stating that the
petitioner has directed to take money for doing the said work. The 4th respondent based on the said
baseless complaint dated 6.3.2017 registered FIR in Crime No.3/2017 against the petitioner and
others under the provisions of Sections 7, 13(1)(d) r/w 13(2) of the PC Act. Thereafter, the 4th
respondent has drawn an Entrustment panchanama on 7.3.2017 to make an attempt to trap the
petitioner and the said Village Assistant. Accordingly, the 4th respondent went to the office of the
petitioner for conducting the trap on 7.3.2017 and alleged to have conducted trap panchanama. It is
forthcoming in the Trap panchanama that though the complainant offered the bribe amount, the
petitioner refused to accept the same. Though the petitioner has not committed any offence under
the provisions of PC Act, he had been falsely implicated by the 3rd respondent/ACB, which is
contrary to the material on record . Therefore, the petitioner sought to allow the writ petition by
quashing the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 so also the complaint and FIR registered against
him.

(g) W.P. No. 16703/17 (filed in personal interest):
36. The petitioners have filed this writ petition in their personal interest for a writ of
certiorari to quash the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 issued by the State
Government constituting ACB.
37. It is the case of the petitioners that 1st and 2nd petitioners are the employees of
Bruhuth Bangalore Mahanagar Palike and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are
government servants holding civil posts. The Petitioners have maintained
unblemished service records and working sincerely in their respective places.
One Mr. H.S. Manjunath gave a complaint before the 3rd Respondent against the 1st and 2nd
Petitioners on the ground that they have demanded illegal gratification to do an official favour.
Based on the Complaint by the private person, First Information Report was registered against the
1st and 2nd Petitioners in Crime No.22/2016 dated 29/11/2016. Further, one Mr. H.C. Umesh gave
a complaint to the 3rd Respondent alleging that the 3rd Petitioner has asked for bribe to get the
pending work done. Based on the said complaint, FIR was registered in Crime No.27/2016. The 4th
Petitioner was working as Deputy Director of Land Records, Bangalore Rural District. While
working so, one Sri. Mune Gowda gave a complaint to the 3rd Respondent complaining that 4th
petitioner has demanded Rs.50,000/- illegal gratification to do an official favour. Based on the said
complaint, FIR came to be registered in Crime No.8/2016. All the Petitioners have approached this
Court challenging the registration of First Information Report and all the proceedings including
investigation pending on the file of the 3rd Respondent in Writ Petition No. 2131- 32/2017, Writ
Petition No. 2134/2017, Writ Petition No. 6/2017, Writ Petition No. 3146/2017 and Writ Petition
No. 3147/2017. This Court was initially granted an interim Order of Stay and thereafter, after
hearing the matter at length, this Court vacated the interim Order. Against the vacation of interim
Order, the 3rd and 4th Petitioners have approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave
Petition (Criminal) No. 2303/2017 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court stayed the Order of this Court
until further Orders. Therefore, the petitioners sought to allow the writ petition by quashing the
Government Order dated 14.3.2016.
(h) Writ Petition No. 16862/17 (filed in personal interest):
38. This writ petition is filed by one Mr. Deepak Kumar in his personal interest for a
writ of certiorari to quash the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB
so also the complaint dated 26.8.2016 lodged by the 4th respondent and the FIR
registered in Crime No.01/2016 by the ACB.
39. It is the case of the petitioner that he joined the service on 29.06.2010 in
Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited, Bengaluru and in the same
year, he was transferred to Wadi, Gulbarga District and thereafter transferred to
Hassan. In the year 2015, the Petitioner transferred to KIADB Section of CHESCOM,
Hassan. He served the CHESCOM in a proper manner and upto the satisfaction of his
superiors as well as consumers.

Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
There are no complaints against him during his tenure for all the years prior to filing of the writ
petition.
40. When things stood thus, the 4th Respondent - K.M.Ahmed lodged a false and frivolous
complaint against the Petitioner on 26.08.2016 before the 3rd Respondent, alleging that he applied
for sanction of 20 H.P. Power and that the petitioner demanded for illegal gratification of
Rs.20,000/- and the same has been reduced to Rs.15,000/- towards sanction of power. On the basis
of said false complaint dated 26.8.2016, the 3rd respondent conducted a trial mahazar and trap
mahazar on 26.8.2016. Consequently, the CHESCOM by its order dated 7.9.2016 suspended the
petitioner. Thereafter, the CHESCOM by an order dated 30.01.2017, revoked the said suspension
order. The petitioner sought to allow the writ petition by quashing the Government Order dated
14.3.2016 so also the complaint lodged by the 4th respondent and the FIR registered against him.
(i) W.P. No.28341/2017 (filed in personal interest):
41. The petitioner filed this writ petition in his personal interest for a writ of certiorari to quash the
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB and the subsequent supporting Government
notifications dated 19.3.2016, 30.3.2016 and 21.4.2016.
42. It is the case of the petitioner that he was working as an Assistant Executive Engineer, Municipal
Corporation, Tumkur during 2016. On the basis of the complaint lodged by one Syed Abu Sayeed,
the respondent/ACB registered a case against the petitioner and two others for the offences
punishable under the provisions of the P.C. Act, in Crime No.3/2016. On 13.10.2106, a forceful trap
was laid where Accused No.2 was purportedly caught with the bribe money of Rs.40,000/- and he
was arrested along with Accused No.3. Since petitioner/Accused No.1 was out of station, he had a
providential escape from human dishonest design. Therefore, the petitioner sought to allow the writ
petition by quashing the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 and the subsequent supporting
Government notifications dated 19.3.2016, 30.3.2016 and 21.4.2016.
(j) W.P. No.108010/2017 (filed in personal interest)
43. The petitioner has filed this writ petition in his personal interest for a writ of certiorari to quash
the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB so also the complaint dated 13.2.2017

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 36
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
45. When things stood thus, the 4th respondent has lodged a complaint with the 3rd respondent on
13.2.2017 alleging that on making the application, the spot was inspected on 17.12.2016. It is further
alleged that after about a week, the 4th respondent has visited the office of the Hubli-Dharwad
Urgan Development Authority and has met the petitioner. It was informed by the petitioner that the
cess challan amount was Rs.27,000/- and that a further amount of the same value should be given
in order to process the file. It is further alleged that the 4th respondent refused to pay the said
amount and left the place and thereafter, the petitioner has telephoned and informed the 4th
respondent that at least Rs.15,000/- has to be paid, which is alleged to have been recorded on the
mobile phone of the 4th respondent. It is further alleged that even after several days, the file was not
processed since the 4th respondent did not pay the said amount demanded. Therefore, the 4th
respondent lodged a complaint before the 3rd respondent.
46. On receipt of the complaint dated 13.2.2017 by the 3rd respondent, the 3rd respondent/ACB has
registered the FIR against the petitioner under Section 7 of the PC Act in Crime No.2/2017.
Thereafter, the raiding team along with the panch witnesses have raided the office of the petitioner.
However, the trap laid by the 3rd respondent was unsuccessful and the petitioner was not caught
either in demanding or taking bribe. Inspite of trap being unsuccessful, the petitioner was taken to
custody and subsequently was released on bail on 15.2.2017.
47. It is further case of the petitioner that being aggrieved, the petitioner has approached this Court
in Criminal Petition No.100663/2017 seeking to quash the proceedings in Crime No.2/2017 and the
said criminal petition came to be rejected, which is confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is
further submitted that in the Criminal Petition, the constitution of ACB or the competence of the
Inspector of Police was never called in question. Therefore, the judgment rendered in criminal
petition would not be a bar to question the constitution of ACB and the registration of FIR in the
present writ petition. Hence, the petitioner sought to allow the writ petition by quashing the
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 so also the complaint and FIR registered against him by the ACB
(k) Writ petition No.108689/17 (filed in personal interest):

conducted a raid at the Commercial Tax Office, Outward Check Post, Nippani on 11.6.2017. It is
submitted that on the same day, the petitioner was called to the said check post to repair some
malfunctioning computers and when the petitioner was repairing the computers, the 3rd respondent

the trap being unsuccessful, the petitioner was taken to custody. Subsequently, he has been released
on bail on 20.6.2017. The petitioner sought to allow the writ petition by quashing the Government
Order dated 14.3.2016 so also the complaint and the FIR registered by the ACB.

officials working in the said check post. Thereafter, trap mahazar was conducted and
it is found that there is absolutely no material to show that the petitioners had
demanded and accepted the illegal gratification. Inspite of the trap being
unsuccessful, the petitioners and others were taken to custody and subsequently, they

53. It is the case of the petitioners that the 1st petitioner is a public servant working as Sub-Registrar
in the Revenue Department; 2nd petitioner is a practicing advocate in Kadur taluk; and the 3rd
petitioner is working as Computer Operator in the office of the Sub-Registrar, Kadur. It is further
contended that the petitioner Nos.2 and 3 are not public servants.
54. It is further case of the petitioners that one Smt. Seethamma, who is ailing and bed ridden made
a request for private attendance for registration of Will and absolute sale deed on 23.4.2018 to the
1st petitioner. After seeing the relevant records, the 1st petitioner has personally visited the house of
Smt. Seethamma and registered two documents viz., Will and absolute sale deed.
55. When things stood thus, the 4th respondent has given complaint to the 3rd respondent alleging
that the 1st and 2nd petitioners have demanded illegal gratification to do official work by registering
the Will and absolute sale deed. The complaint given by the 4th respondent shows that he is not
connected to the transaction and documents executed by Smt. Seethamma. Based on the allegation
made in the complaint, the 3rd respondent/ACB has registered a case against the petitioner Nos.1
and 2 under the provisions of Sections 7,8 and 13(1)(d) r/w Section 13(2) of the PC Act in Crime
NO.3/2018 on 12.4.2018. In the complaint, it is alleged that the 2nd petitioner is a stamp vendor,
which is factually incorrect and in fact, he is a practicing advocate.
56. Based on the version of the 4th respondent, an entrustment mahazar was drawn on 12.4.2018
and the alleged money was given to the 4th respondent to lay a trap against the petitioners in
presence of two panchas. However, they could not lay trap on the petitioners. Again, on 23.4.2018
one more entrustment mahazar was drawn to lay a trap against the petitioners. Even on the said
date, they could not lay a trap against the petitioners and therefore one more mahazar was drawn on
23.4.2018. The petitioners further submit that again on the 3rd occasion, the entrustment mahazar
was drawn on 24.4.2018 at 7.45 a.m. and prepared to lay a trap on the petitioners. Even on that day,
the petitioners have not been caught red handed and the trap was not successful. The trap mahazar
shows that he 4th respondent has given the alleged money to the 3rd petitioner who is no way in
picture till the alleged trap has taken place. The trap mahazar does not disclose that there was a
demand on the part of the petitioner No.1 and the petitioner No.1 has accepted the alleged illegal
gratification. The purchaser, namely, one Smt. S. Sendhamarai has appeared before the 1st
petitioner and has given a statement that there is no demand of bribe by the petitioners and she has
not given any instructions to the 4th respondent to give a complaint against the petitioners. The
petitioners sought to allow the writ petition by quashing the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 so
also the complaint and FIR registered against them by the ACB
(n) Writ Petition No.9147/2019 (filed in personal interest):
57. The petitioner has filed this writ petition in his personal interest for a writ of
certiorari to quash the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 issued by the State
Government constituting ACB so also the complaint dated 20.11.2018 given by the
4th respondent and the FIR dated 20.11.2018 registered in Crime No.30/2018 by the
3rd respondent/ACB.

58. It is the case of the petitioner that he is a Government servant belonging to Public
Works Department and on deputation working in Bruhath Bengaluru Mahanagara
Palike as Assistant Director of Town Planning, Mahadevapura, during the year 2018.
At that time, one Sri Ajay Jayanthilal has applied for sanction of building plan for construction of
property in Varthu Hobli, Bangalore East taluk, Bangalore. It is the allegation of the 4th respondent
on behalf of said Sri Ajay Jayanthilal that the petitioner and another namely Sri Srinivas Gowda,
Assistant Engineer are demanding huge amount of bribe for sanctioning of the building plans. Since
the client of the 4th respondent is not willing to pay the bribe amount, he has recorded the
conversation of the petitioner on 19.11.2018 when he visited the office of the petitioner. Thereafter
on 20.11.2018, the 4th respondent has given the complaint to the 3rd respondent alleging that the
petitioner and another have demanded illegal gratification to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/- for sanction
of building plan. Based on the said complaint, the 3rd respondent/ACB has registered the case
against the petitioner under Section 7(a) of the PC Act. The entrustment mahazar was drawn by the
3rd respondent in presence of the panch witness on 20.11.2018. Thereafter, the 3rd respondent has
laid a trap against the petitioner and the trap mahazar was also drawn in presence of two witnesses.
The trap mahazar shows that the petitioner is not caught red-handed and the alleged money has not
been recovered from the petitioner. It further discloses that the petitioner has absolutely not made
any demand from the 4th respondent. Therefore, The petitioner sought to allow the writ petition by
quashing the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 so also the complaint and FIR registered against
him by the ACB.
(o) Writ Petition No.18042/2019 (filed in personal interest):
59. The petitioner has filed this writ petition in his personal interest for a writ of
certiorari to quash the Government Order dated 14.3.2016 issued by the State
Government constituting ACB so also the subsequent supporting Government
notifications dated 19.3.2016, 30.3.2016 and 21.4.2016.
60. It is the case of the petitioner that on 19.5.2017, the respondent No.2/ACB
generated a source report by gathering information and particulars with regard to his
alleged disproportionate assets. The said source report was transmitted to the
Superintendent of Police on 9.5.2017. On the said date, the Superintendent of Police
directed Deputy Superintendent of Police, ACB to register a case under Section
13(1)(e) and Section 13(2) of the PC Act and to conduct further enquiry. The Dy.S.P.
had registered a case on 9.5.2017 in Crime No.20/17 for the offences punishable
under the provisions of Section 13(1)(e) and 13(2) pf the PC Act. In the source report,
it is alleged that the petitioner has amassed disproportionate wealth in a sum of
Rs.1,20,50,000/- at 102.12% of known sources of income. The registration of the case
as aforesaid is entirely illegal and contrary to law. The respondent/Police have
usurped the powers to investigate from the legally constituted body under the
Karnataka Lokayukta Act by registering a case without there being duly constituted
legal body to work as a Police Station. Therefore sought to allow the writ petition by
granting the reliefs sought for.

- Government notifications dated 6.2.1991, 8.5.2002 and 5.12.2002 that authorized the Lokayukta
Police with powers to investigate and had declared the offices of Police Inspectors of Lokayukta as
Police Stations;

- Issuance of Government Order dated 14.3.2016 and subsequent supporting notifications dated
19.3.2016 etc., the petitioners in all these writ petitions which are filed in personal interest sought to

supporting Government notifications dated 19.3.2016, 30.3.2016 and 21.4.2016.
II. Objections filed by the respondent No.1/State of Karnataka in W.P. No.19386/2016
62. In the statement of objections filed by the State of Karnataka, it is stated at the outset that the
writ petition is mis- conceived and is not maintainable, both on facts as well as law and the same is
liable to be dismissed in limine. The petitioner has made references to several issues which are
factually incorrect, misleading and completely lacking in bonafides. The petitioner is a practising
Lawyer and claims to have filed the present writ petition in public interest. The petition lacks any
kind of public interest and it is politically motivated and lacks bonafides. The petitioner also has no
locus-standi to prefer this writ petition and on these preliminary issues itself, the writ petition is
liable to be dismissed in limine.
63. It is further stated in the objections that the Police Wing attached to the Karnataka Lokayukta,
as it stood prior to the impugned Notifications, in so far as its functions and powers to investigate
the cases arising out of the offences committed under the provisions of PC Act, were independent of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 41
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
any control by the office of Lokayukta and was never under the control of the Karnataka Lokayukta.
Investigations 'qua' offences under PC Act were 'additional duties' entrusted to such Police of the
Police Wing, which by practice was being referred to as 'Lokayukta Police', and in so far as its
jurisdiction to investigate the offences arising out of PC Act, it carried out its duties as contemplated
under the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure, Karnataka Police Act and, the PC Act,
independent of any 'control' by the Institution of the Karnataka Lokayukta. This 'Police Wing' was
part of the State Police, in the same manner as the rest of the Police, in terms of the Karnataka
Police Act, in so far as it exercised its powers to investigate the offences under the PC Act. Therefore,
hue and cry that has been made out by the petitioner to the effect that by creating the Anti
Corruption Bureau, the State Government has weakened the institution of Lokayukta' or it has
interfered with its functioning in some manner, is wholly mis-conceived, imaginary and lacking in
bonafides; especially since petitioner claiming to be a practicing advocate.
64. It is further stated in the objections that as can be noticed from a reading of Sections 7, 8, 9 and
12 of KL Act, investigations contemplated are of civil nature ultimately resulting in reports and
recommending appropriate action to be taken thereon. Under Section 14 of KL Act, when Lokayukta
is satisfied that public servant has committed any 'criminal offence' and should be prosecuted for
such offence, then he may pass an order to that effect and initiate prosecution of the public servant
concerned.
65. It is further stated in the objections that on enactment of 1984 Act, the Lokayukta Institution
was provided with a 'police wing', a ' technical wing' and, an 'enquiry wing for carrying out the
functions, under the KL Act. The KL Act empowers the Lokayukta to inquire into complaints against
public servants. However, it does not empower Lokayukta to conduct or supervise criminal
investigations into the offences of corruption by the public servants and others, punishable under
the Indian Penal Code or the PC Act or under any other statute. The State Government is
empowered to designate an 'office' as a Police Station' under section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.
66. It is further stated in the objections that the PC Act and, the Indian Penal Code. define the
offences of corruption and prescribe punishments. The procedure for investigation into offences
relating to corruption is laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the PC Act. Accordingly,
the Government, exercising its powers under Section 17 of the PC Act, had earlier issued a
notification on 06.02.1991 entrusting the Inspectors of Police, on deputation to the Karnataka
Lokayukta "police wing', with the powers of investigation under the PC Act. In addition, the State
Government exercising its power under section 2(s) of the Criminal Procedure Code, had declared
the offices of the Police wing of Karnataka Lokayukta as the 'police stations' vide Notifications dated
08.05.2002 and 05.12.2002.
67. It is also stated in the objections that in the year 1992, the Government by executive order,
created a Bureau of Investigation (BOI) in the Karnataka Lokayukta, which was headed by a
Director General (DG) in the rank of Additional Director General of Police. The Director General
was made an independent head of the department with a separate Budget Head. However, in 1998,
the Government abolished the 'Bureau of Investigation' and the 'post of Director General' and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 42
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
power of the Head of the Department was also withdrawn. The Registrar, Karnataka Lokayukta, was
authorized to operate the finances of the Police wing. This action of the Government brought the
'police wing' under the administrative and financial control of the office of Lokayukta. As a result,
Police officers having powers of investigation under the PC Act, were brought administratively
subordinate to the Lokayukta who had however no statutory powers or duties to administer any
penal statute, like Indian Penal Code, PC Act. The Lokayukta has powers of a Civil Court in terms of
provisions of Lokayukta Act, but not a Criminal Court.
68. It is further stated in the objections that the issue of competence of Lokayukta Police Wing to
investigate the cases under the PC Act was challenged before this Court and later before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. The Apex Court in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah -vs- Karnataka Lokayukta4, finally
decided (in 1998) on this issue, stating that, the police officers of the State on deputation to
Karnataka Lokayukta continued to remain public servants in the services of the State Government,
as long as they were not absorbed in the Karnataka Lokayukta. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
as under:
"This legal position is absolutely unassailable because the State of Karnataka has
merely lent the Supra at Footnote No.1 services of these officers to the Lokayukta
and, the officers continued to be employees of the State. In spite of the deputation of
the officers with the Lokayukta, the relationship of master and servant between the
State of Karnataka and these officers does not stand terminated".
69. It is further contended that the Lokayukta derives powers and functions under the KL Act, which
gives power to inquire into any action taken by any public servant, in any case where a complaint
involving a grievance or an allegation is made in respect of such action. For such enquiry, he is given
the power of civil court and the assistance of an 'enquiry wing', a 'technical wing' and a 'police wing'.
After such enquiry/investigation, the Lokayukta is empowered to ask the competent authority to
remedy or redress the injustice or hardship. He is also empowered to send a detailed report of
investigation to the competent authority, which shall examine and take action based on the report.
The above powers of the Lokayukta under the Lokayukta Act do not envisage any authority to
Lokayukta, under criminal statues like Indian Penal Code and PC Act.
70. In view of the above legal position and after considering all the aspects of the matter, the State
Government in the interest of effective implementation of both the KL Act and the PC Act, took a
conscious decision to formalize the space between the Lokayukta and the Police wing by separating
the powers of the Lokayukta Police Wing investigating into the criminal offences under Indian Penal
Code and PC Act. Accordingly, the State Government issued the G.O.No.DPAR 14 SLU 2016, dated
14.03.2016 constituting an independent Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) on the lines of the Central
Bureau of Investigation, without disturbing the powers and functions of the Lokayukta under the
Lokayukta Act. In view of the constitution of the new Anti Corruption Bureau in the State of
Karnataka, the powers of investigation given to the Police of Lokayukta Police Wing earlier under
Section 17 of the PC Act and the Police Station status given to the offices of the Inspectors of Police
under Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the purpose of Prevention of Corruption
Act were withdrawn. Thereby, the respondent/State denied the averments made in the writ petition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 43
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
and sought to reject the writ petition.
III. Objections filed by the 2nd respondent/ACB in WP
71. The 2nd respondent - ACB filed objections denying the averments made in the writ petitions and
contended that in cases pertaining to the PC Act, 1988, there exists a statutory bar to the grant of
interim relief in the form of stay of proceedings under the Act. The petitioners in the present writ
petitions have not alleged that due to any stated irregularity or omission on behalf of the 2nd
respondent, any failure of justice has been occasioned. Further, as per the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh -vs- Virender Kumar Tripathi5, the stage at
which failure of justice may be claimed has not even reached in the present cases. It is further
contended that Writ Petition is not maintainable and the same is liable to be dismissed in limine for
the following reasons :
a. The Petitioner has deliberately misled this Court on issues of fact through (2009)
15 SCC 533 averments in the Writ Petition. It is submitted that the Petition deserves
to be rejected with costs in limine.
b. The Petitioner has not raised any substantive grounds challenging the institution
of the proceedings against him by the 2nd Respondent, but has raised irrelevant and
inconsequential grounds, which should be rejected.
c. There exists strong prima facie basis to fully investigate the Petitioner for the
offences under Sections 13(1)(e) read with S.13(2) of the PC Act, based on the
complaint.
72. Thus, the respondent/State has denied the averments made in the writ petition and sought for
dismissal of the writ petition.
73. Except in the above writ petitions, neither the State nor any other respondent has filed statement
of objections in other writ petitions including in the PILs filed by the Advocates' Association,
Bengaluru in Writ Petition No.21468/2016 and also in the writ petition filed by Samaj Parivarthana
Samudaya in Writ Petition No.23622/2016.
IV. Statement of legal submissions of Karnataka Lokayukta in W.P. No. 19386/2016, W.P.
No.23622/2016, 58252- 58256/2017, 3109-3113/2018, 4319-4328/2018
74. It is contended that as per the recommendations of the Administrative Reforms Commission, the
Institution of Lokayukta was set up "for the purpose of improving the standards of public
administration, by looking into complaints against administrative actions, including cases of
corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in administrative machinery." The Institution of
Lokayukta was created in 1985 under the KL Act, which received the assent of President of India on
16.1.1985. As per Statement of Objects and Reasons of the KL Act, apart from looking into
complaints against administrative actions, including cases of corruption, the KL Act deals with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 44
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
definition of "corruption", which includes anything made punishable under the provisions of the PC
Act. The terms, 'Action', 'Allegation', 'Grievance', and 'Maladministration' are defined under Section
2; Section 7 deals with matters which may be investigated by Lokayukta and an Upa- Lokayukta;
Section 9 deals with provisions relating to complaints and investigations; Section 12 relates to
reports of Lokayukta etc.; Section 14 deals with initiation of prosecution; Section 15 relates to staff of
Lokayukta; and Sections 17, 17A and 19 deal with insult, contempt, inquiry, delegation etc.,
75. By a combined reading of the objects of the KL Act and provisions of the said Act, it is clear that
the Act is substantive law dealing with cases of corruption in public administration. The
Government of Karnataka filled up certain gaps in the KL Act, by issuing the earlier notifications
dated 26.5.1986 under section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and notification dated
26.5.1986 under Section 17 of the PC Act for the purpose of investing the Police Officers of the
Karnataka Lokayukta for investigation of the offences under PC Act. To the same effect were the
subsequent notifications dated 6.2.1991, 2.11.1992, 8.5.2002 and 5.12.2002; whereby the
Government of Karnataka empowered and entrusted the powers of investigation in the officers of
Lokayukta for the purpose of PC Act, subject to the overall control and supervision by the Lokayukta
or UpaLokayukta as the case may be. The said actions of the Government of Karnataka entrusting
additional functions in the police officers attached to the Police Wing to the Lokayukta has been
considered and approved by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah -vs-
Karnataka Lokayukta6. In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court specifically considered the issue
of deputation and entrustment of additional functions by seeking to harmonize Section 17 of the PC
Act and Section 15 of KL Act. As observed by the Apex Court in paragraphs 23 to 28, consent of the
Lokayukta was necessary for the purpose of entrusting the functions of the investigation under
Section 17 of the PC Act. The relevant portion of paragraph 23 is as under:
"The lending authority cannot entrust extra duties without the consent of the
borrowing authority".
76. In view of the observations and findings in the case of Rangaswamaiah7 stated supra, it is
submitted that the converse of the same is true, in as much as, the consent of borrowing Supra at
Footnote No.1 Supra at Footnote No.1 authority should be obtained before withdrawing from the
extra duties. The Hon'ble Supreme Court subsequently described how the process of consultation
should be followed in the case of Justice Chandrahekaraiah (Retd.) -vs- Janekere C. Krishna and
others8.
77. It is further contended that for the issue of the notification dated 19.3.2016, purporting to
withdraw the powers of the Lokayukta Police, the Government of Karnataka seeks to derive its
power from Section 21 of General Clauses Act, 1897 for the purpose of withdrawing the police
powers granted to the Lokayukta Police for issuing earlier notification of 1986, 1991, 1992 and 2002.
The Apex Court has held the consent of the borrowing authority is necessary for entrustment of
extra duties. As soon as such duties were entrusted, the power under Section 17 of the PC Act is used
up. In view of the fact that similar conditions were not fulfilled and since the requirement of
'information', or 'approval' or 'consultation' or 'obtaining consent' has not been complied with, by
the Government of Karnataka for the purpose of withdrawing or AIR 2013 SC 726.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 45
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
superseding the earlier notifications, the Government of Karnataka should have fulfilled the
conditions which would have enabled them to exercise the power. However, since the consent of the
Karnataka Lokayukta was not obtained for the withdrawal of the police powers by the issue of
notification dated 19.3.2016, the power under Section 21 of the General Clauses Act is not available.
As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh -vs- Ajay Singh9, the
general power under Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, to rescind the notification has to be
understood in the light of the subject matter, context and effect of the relevant provisions of the
statute under which notification is issued and the power not available after an enforceable right as
accurate under notification.
78. It is further contended that the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of Justice Chandrahekaraiah
(Retd.) -vs- Janekere C. Krishna and others10 stated supra has referred to the recommendations of
the Administrative Reforms Commission which has recommended for appointment of the authority
which is AIR 1993 SC 825 AIR 2013 SC 726 independent of the Executive, Legislature and the
Judiciary. It is further observed that the Institution of the Lokayukta should be demonstrably
independent and impartial.
79. The power of initiating prosecution is invested with the Lokayukta under Section 14 of the KL
Act, the formation of another Bureau, Department, Wing or any other Team, which is not under the
supervision and control of the Lokayukta does not align with object of the KL Act.
80. Since the 'decision making' Public Servants have been placed differently, compared to the other
Public Servants in terms of the notification dated 14.3.2016, there is violation of fundamental right
under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. A Police officer who is working under the
disciplinary control of the Home Department and/or Government of Karnataka, while being an
Investigating officer under the Anti Corruption Bureau cannot be expected to conduct a fair and
impartial inquiry or investigation in relation to high ranking Public Servants. On the other hand , a
police officer working under the supervision of the Lokayukta is insulated from such influence.
Article 21 of the Constitution of India ensures right to life and liberty to every person. The said rights
are required to be protected and safeguarded even in respect of 'public servants' falling within the
definition of Section 2(12) of the KL Act, in the larger public interest. The representatives of the
people, who are public servants and also full time government officials, who are government
servants, are well protected if the investigation powers under the PC Act, are with the Lokayukta.
There is absolutely no chance for vindictive action at the instance of political opponent against the
representatives of the people. Same is the position in respect of the bureaucrats who take an
independent decision in the larger public interest. If the investigation agency is not independent
then the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens under Article 21 is threatened.
81. Under the KL Act and Karnataka Lokayukta Rules - 1985, undisputedly Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta are declared to be persons of high responsibility and of impeccable character and is
given status akin to the Chief Justice of India. Some of the relevant provisions which ensure
independence of Lokayukta as provided under the provisions of KL Act and Rules are as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 46
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
(1) The Hon'ble Lokayukta is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief
Minister in consultation with the Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka, the
Chairman of the Karnataka Legislative Council, the Speaker of the Karnataka
Legislative Assembly, the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative
Council and the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly as
contemplated under the provisions of Section 3(1) and 3(2) of the KL Act..
(ii) The Hon'ble Lokayukta, before entering office, make and subscribe before the
Governor or some other person appointed in that behalf, an oath of affirmation as
contemplated under the provisions of Section 3(3) of the KL Act.
(iii) The service conditions, the allowance and pension of the Hon'ble Lokayukta is
the same as that of the Chief Justice of India and the salary is that of the Chief Justice
of High Court as contemplated under Rule 6 of the Karnataka Lokayukta Rules.
(iv) Removal of the Hon'ble Lokayukta is by a process (impeachment) which is
similar as that of the Hon'ble Judges of the High Court and Supreme Court as
contemplated under Section 6 of the KL Act.
(v) To ensure independence and no-conflict, Hon'ble Lokayukta, shall not be
connected with any political party, cannot hold any office of Trust or profit, must
sever his connections with the conduct and management of any business, must
suspend practice of any profession as contemplated under Section 4 of the KL Act;
and
(vi) To ensure independence and no-conflict, on ceasing to hold office, the Hon'ble
Lokayukta is ineligible for further employment to any office of profit under the
Government of Karnataka or any other Authority.
Corporation, Company, Society or University relating to Government of Karnataka.
82. It is further contended that the Police Officers who are working for the Karnataka Lokayukta
cannot be removed without the consent of the Lokayukta as contemplated in terms of Section 15 of
the KL Act. The object of this provision is to ensure the independence of the investigating agency.
Under Section 15(3) of the KL Act, the said Police Officers are under the direct supervision and
disciplinary control of the Lokayukta as per Section 15(3) of the KL Act. So far as the ACB Police are
concerned, they are under the direct control of the Executive and their tenure in it is not ensured.
The interference in their investigation by the Executive is not ruled out. Therefore, the fear/threat of
transfer or vindictive action against them is also not ruled out. The notification dated 19.3.2016
issued by Government of Karnataka withdrawing status of the Police Station on Lokayukta is
contrary to the provisions of Section 14 of KL Act read along with other provisions of the said Act
and PC Act as well as Karnataka Police Act, 1963. Even if it is held that the notification dated
19.3.2016 withdrawing the status of Police Station as per Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure on the Officers of the Lokayukta, is valid in law, it is permissible for Lokayukta to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 47
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
independently exercise the power of getting an FIR registered on the basis of the complaint laid
before Lokayukta etc.,
83. A careful reading of Section 14 of the KL Act makes it clear that, after investigation into any
complaint, in case the Lokayukta or an UpaLokayukta is satisfied that a public servant has
committed "any" criminal offence and should be prosecuted in a court of law for such offence, then
he may pass an order to that effect and initiate prosecution of the public servant concerned and if
prior sanction of any authority is required for such prosecution, then notwithstanding anything
contained in any law, such sanction shall be deemed to have been granted by the appropriate
authority on the date of such order.
84. As already stated supra, the KL Act has been passed on the basis of the recommendation made
by the Administrative Reforms Commission, recommending for setting up of an Institution of
Lokayukta for the purpose of improving the standard of public administration, by looking into the
complaints against the administrative actions, including cases of corruption, favouritism and official
indiscipline in administrative measure. It is further contended that there cannot be two views that
by means of legislation itself it was open to the Legislature to create an institution conferring powers
of investigation both under criminal and civil jurisdiction. The reading of several provisions of the
Karnataka Lokayukta Act makes it clear that the Lokayukta as an institution having been created for
the purpose of preventing maladministration in public administration of the State, is empowered to
do so not only by instituting disciplinary action against erring public servants but also by initiating
criminal proceedings, wherever required on the basis of the materials on record.
85. The provisions of Sections 7(1) and 7(2A) of the KL Act confers the power to the Lokayukta to
investigate against the several authorities/public servants of the State and empower the Lokayukta
or an UpaLokayukta to investigate any action taken by or with the general or specific approval of the
public servant, if it is referred to him by the State Government. Section 8 of the KL Act specifically
bars the matter set out in the said Section from investigation and section 9 of the KL Act enables any
persons to make a complaint under the said Act to the Lokayukta or Upa- Lokayukta. No doubt the
Act does not define what is meant by 'complaint'. The provisions of section 9(2) of the KL Act
stipulates that the complaint should be made in the prescribed form under Rule 4 of the Karnataka
Lokayukta Rules. Though the definition of 'complaint' is not provided in the Act, the Act defines the
terms 'Allegation' under Section 2(2); 'Grievance' under Section 2(8); 'Corruption' under Section
2(5); and 'Mal-administration' under Section 2(10) of the KL Act. In the absence of specific
provision in the Act, it is well settled that the Courts can look into the definition of those terms
provided in the similar statutes or general definition provided.
86. It is further contended that under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas
Act - 2013, the 'complaint' is defined as under:
"Complaint means a complaint, made in such form as may be prescribed, alleging
that a public servant has committed an offence punishable under the PC Act, 1988"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 48
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
87. It is further contended that Section 15 of the KL Act relates to staff of Lokayukta. The object of
Section 15 is to make the institution of Lokayukta autonomous and its staff to be under the direct
administrative supervision and disciplinary control of the Lokayukta, with a view to ensure
independence and objectivity to the said staff of the Lokayukta in assisting the
Lokayukta/Upalokayukta in discharge of their duties. It is further contended that the object of the
enactment is to provide transparency in public administration. In this context, it is relevant to refer
to Section 190 of the Code of Criminal procedure, which deals with powers of the Magistrate to take
cognizance of the offence by Magistrates. In view of the provisions of Section 190 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, the Magistrate can take cognizance on the basis of the (1) complaint. (2) Police
Report and (3) suo motu (Upon his own knowledge). Therefore, cognizance of an offence can be
taken on the basis of the police report or on the basis of a complaint filed as provided under Section
200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and also suo motu, that is on the basis of information.
88. Section 23 of the KL Act empowers the State Government by Notification in its official gazette to
make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the said Act. In exercise of the
said power, the State Government has framed the Karnataka Lokayukta (Cadre, Recruitment and
Conditions of Service of the Officers and Employees) Rules, 1988. Rule 3 of the said Rules provides
for strength and composition of the staff of Lokayukta. Rule 4 provides for recruitment and
minimum qualification of the Staff. First Schedule of the said Rules provides for four wings in the
Lokayukta. They are:
(1) Administration and Enquiry Wing;
(2) Technical Wing;
(3) Police Wing; and (4) General Wing.
89. It is further contended that 2nd Schedule of the said Rules provide for the qualification of the
staff to be recruited or deputed. Technical Wing consists of officials in the cadre of Chief
Engineer/Engineers and Deputy Director of Statistics as well as Deputy Controller of Accounts. The
Police Wing consists of the staff deputed from Police Department in the cadre of IPS as well as
Karnataka Police Service.
90. The cadre of the officers who are part of the institution of Lokayukta includes one Police Officer
in the rank of Additional Director General of Police, who is an IPS Officer, one police officer in the
rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police, 23 police officers in the rank of Superintendent of
Police, 43 police officers in the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police, 90 police officers in the
rank of Police Inspector, 13 police officers in the rank of Police Sub- Inspector, 4 police officers in
the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police and 145 police officers in the cadre of Head Constable.
Apart from the above, 234 Civil Police Constables, 15 Head Constable Drivers, 30 Armed Police
Constables and 148 Armed Police Constable Drivers. Therefore, statutorily a Police Wing is created
and made as an inseparable part of the Lokayukta Institution. The powers of the Police Wing in no
way can be taken away by virtue of the two notifications impugned in the present writ petition, one
withdrawing status of police stations of Lokayukta and the second constituting ACB. The Police
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 49
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
Wing attached to the institution of Lokayukta has all the powers and duties conferred on it under
the Karnataka Police Act, 1964, and also under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
91. It is further contended that Section 2(16) of the Karnataka Police Act defines the term "Police
Officer", which means any member of the Police force appointed or deemed to be appointed under
the said Act and includes a special or an additional police officer appointed under section 19 or 20 of
the said Act. Section 65 of the Police Act provides for duties of a Police Officer.
92. It is also contended that the only restriction provided under the provisions of PC Act is that the
officer to investigate the offences punishable under the PC Act should not be below the rank of
DySP, as is clear from the reading of Section 17(c) of PC Act. Therefore, cadre strength of the
Karnataka Lokayukta referred to above shows that there are police officers in the cadre of ADGP,
DIGP, SP and Dy.SPs in all around 747 officers. As such, there cannot be any difficulty or objection
for the Lokayukta Police in the cadre referred to above to conduct investigation in respect of the
offences punishable under PC Act. There is no prohibition under the PC Act in relation to the power
of the Lokayukta Police, referred to above, to conduct any investigation with regard to the offences
punishable under PC Act.
93. It is further contended that KL Act is a self contained code providing for investigation, filing of
complaint and all other incidental matters with the police attached to the Lokayukta institution by
virtue of statutory provisions. Thereby, when the Karnataka Lokayukta .Act is holding the field, it is
not permissible for the State in exercise of its executive power under Article 162 of the Constitution
of India to constitute ACB to nullify the power conferred on the Lokayukta as an institution under
the KL Act. In support of its contention, Lokayukta relied upon judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of I.T.C. Bhadrachalam Paperboards vs. Mandal Revenue Officer, AP .
94. It is further contended that the State Government under Article 162 of the Constitution of India,
has issued notification constituting ACB on an erroneous understanding of the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah and others -vs- Karnataka
Lokayukta and others .In fact the said judgment curtails the power of the State Government to
constitute ACB or any alternative mode of investigating agency and interfere with the functioning of
the Lokayukta. The only principle in the Rangaswamaiah13 case is that, it permits entrustment of
extra work to any other investigating agency/ACB only to a limited extent and that too with the
consent of Lokayukta. In the present case, the consent of the Lokayukta has not been obtained. It is
further contended that the power is conferred on a very high authority, who is either the former
Judge of Supreme Court or who was the Chief Justice of the High Court or (1996)6 SCC 634.
Supra at Footnote No.1 Supra at Footnote No.1 who has been a Judge of the High Court for a period
more than 10 years to be Lokayukta and any High Court Judge to be Upalokayukta. It is well settled
principle of law that while interpreting the provisions of law, the object of the legislation is required
to be kept in mind, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Manmohan Das v. Bishun
Das14.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 50

95. In view of the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Institution of A.P. Lokayukta
UpaLokayukta & Others v. T. Rama Subba Reddy & Another15 (Para 17) and the mandate of Section
63 of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013, any effort to disband the Institution of the Karnataka
Lokayukta will be regressive. Hence, the Government Order dated 14.03.2016, notification dated
19.03.2016 and all subsequent notifications issued pursuant to the Government Order dated
14.03.2016 for the purpose of formation and working of the ACB, could not have been issued. The
same is hit by the requirement of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.
AIR 1967 SC 643.
(1997) 9 SCC 42
96. The notifications dated 19.3.2016 withdrawing the powers of the Lokayukta Police under Section
17 of the PC Act read with Section 21 of the GC Act, is bad in law and there is no source of power to
issue such notifications.
97. It is further contended that the Government Order dated 14.03.2016, is not tenable in view of the
same being contrary to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court. Paragraph 5 of the
Government Order seeks to create an additional layer, which is not in consonance with the
judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Vineet Narain v. Union of India16 and Dr.
Subramanian Swamy v. Director, CBI & Another17. In the circumstances sought to pass appropriate
orders in the interest of public at large.
98. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. AIR 1998 SC 889 (2014) 8 SCC 682 V.
Arguments advanced by Sri Ravi B. Naik, learned senior counsel for Sri K.B. Monesh Kumar,
learned counsel for the petitioners in W.P. Nos.19386/2016 and 21468/2016
99. Sri Ravi B. Naiik, learned senior counsel for the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.19386/2016 and
21468/2016 contended that the provisions of Section 17 of the P.C. Act specifies the persons
authorized to investigate any offence punishable under the said Act. He would further contend that
earlier notifications dated 6.2.1991 and 2.11.1992 were issued by the State Government in support of
the Lokayukta. In view of the provisions of section 15 of the KL Act, there shall be such officers and
employees as may be prescribed to assist the Lokayukta and the Upa-Lokayukta in the discharge of
their functions under the said Act. He would further contend that without prejudice to the
provisions of Section-1 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, the Lokpal may, for the purpose of
conducting any preliminary inquiry or investigation, utilise the services of any officer or
organization or investigating agency of the Central Government or any State Government, as the
case may be with prior concurrence of Central and State Government.
100. The learned senior counsel further contended that the statutory powers assigned to Lokayukta
and Upa-Lokayukta under the provisions of the KL Act cannot be diluted by the executive orders
passed by the State Government under Article 162 of the Constitution of India. The provisions of
Section 23 of the KL Act empowers the Government to make rules. He would further contend that
earlier the State Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by Clause (s) of Section 2 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 51
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
Code of Criminal Procedure, has issued notification declaring the offices of Lokayukta Police as
Police Stations, thereby they have power to investigate the offences punishable under the PC Act.
The same is withdrawn by the impugned executive order, thereby made the Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta powerless - paper tigers. He would further contend that the State Government by
notification dated 2.11.1992 and in partial modification of the earlier Notification dated 6.2.1991, has
authorized all the Inspectors of Police, Office of the Karnataka Lokayukta for the purpose of the
proviso to Section 17 of the PC Act, subject to the overall control and supervision by the Lokayukta
or Upa-Lokayukta as the case may be. Now by virtue of the present notification, the said power is
withdrawn which is impermissible. The learned senior counsel further contended that the field
occupied under the provisions of the KL Act, cannot be taken away by the State Government by way
of the notification dated 14.3.2016, thereby he sought to allow the petition.
101. In support of his contentions, learned senior counsel relied upon the dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah -vs- Karnataka Lokayukta18 (paragraphs 26 to 30).
VI. Arguments advanced by Sri M.S. Bhagwat, learned senior counsel for the petitioners in Writ
Petition Nos.9147/2019, 16222/2017, 16223/2017, 16703/2017, 108010/2017, 108689/2017,
108690/2017 and 22851/2018
102. Writ Petition Nos.9147/2019, 16222/2017, 16223/2017, 16703/2017, 108010/2017,
108689/2017, 108690/2017 and 22851/2018 are filed by the individual petitioners in their personal
interest challenging the Government Order dated 14/03/2016 constituting ACB under Article 162 of
Constitution of India.
103. Sri M.S. Bhagwat, learned senior counsel appearing for petitioners in the above writ petitions
contended that Entry-2 of List Supra at Footnote No.1 II to the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of
India contemplates Police (including railway and village police) subject to the provisions of Entry 2A
of List-I. Entry 2A of List-I contemplates deployment of any armed force of the Union or any other
force subject to the control of the Union or any contingent or unit thereof in any State in aid of the
Civil power; powers, jurisdiction, privileges and liabilities of the members of such forces while on
such deployment. He would further contend that the provisions of Section 3 of the Karnataka Police
Act, 1963 contemplates that "there shall be one Police Force for the whole State", thereby the State
cannot create one more police wing i.e., ACB under Article 162 of the Constitution of India. He
would further contend that the provisions of Section 4 of the Karnataka Police Act contemplates
Superintendence of Police Force to vest in the Government. The provisions of Section 20-A of the
Karnataka Police Act contemplates the State Security Commission. When there is a specific wing
under the Karnataka Police Act, introducing of one more authority would not arise, thereby the
Executive order of the Government dated 14/03/2016 is contrary to the provisions of Sections - 3, 4
and 20-A of the Police Act. Absolutely, there is no possibility of impartial investigation at the
instance of the authority constituted under the notification. He further contended that the object of
the Lokayukta Act depicts that the Administrative Reforms Commission had recommended for
setting up of the institution of Lokayukta for the purpose of improving the standards of public
administration, by looking into complaints against administrative actions, including cases of
corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in administration machinery. He referred to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 52
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
provisions of Section 2 (2) of the KL Act, which contemplates that 'allegation' in relation to a public
servant means any affirmation that such public servant -
(a) has abused his position as such public servant to obtain any gain or favour to himself or to any
other person or to cause undue harm or hardship to any other person;
(b) was actuated in the discharge of his functions as such public servant by personal interest or
improper or corrupt motives; and
(c) is guilty of corruption, favourtisim, nepotism, or lack of integrity in his capacity as such public
servant.
104. Learned senior counsel contended that as per sub- section (5) of Section 2 of the KL Act,
'corruption' includes anything made punishable under Chapter IX of the Indian Penal Code or under
the provisions of PC Act. He also contended that sub-section(8) of Section 2 of the KL Act defines
'grievance', which means a claim by a person that he sustained injustice or undue hardship in
consequence of maladministration. He further contended that Section 7 of the KL Act deals with
matters which may be investigated by the Lokayukta and an Upa-Lokayukta. Section 7(2) of the KL
Act prescribes that subject to the provisions of the said Act, an Upa-lokayukta may investigate any
action which is taken by or with the general or specific approval of, any public servant not being the
Chief Minister, Minister, Member of the Legislature, Secretary or other public servant refereed to in
sub- section (1), in any case where a complaint involving a grievance or an allegation is made in
respect of such action or such action can be or could have been, in the opinion of the Upa-Lokayukta
recorded in writing, the subject of a grievance or an allegation.
105. Learned senior counsel further contended that the provisions of Section 14 of the KL Act
contemplates initiation of prosecution and Section 23 of the KL Act contemplates power to make
rules. He further contended that a separate police wing has been constituted to look after the
allegation of corruption against the public servant. In view of the aforesaid provisions of KL Act and
the Rules, the State Government has no authority to pass an executive order under the provisions of
the Article 162 of the Constriction of India, diluting the statutory powers as contemplated under the
KL Act and the Police Act. He would further contend that Section 63 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas
Act, 2013 relates to establishment of Lokayukta and as per the said Section, every State shall
establish a body to be known as the Lokayukta for the State, if not so established, constituted or
appointed, by a law made by the State Legislature, to deal with complaints relating to corruption
against certain public functionaries, within a period of one year from the date of commencement of
the said Act. He would further contend that the object of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act as stated
supra is that there must be a Lokayukta to deal with complaints and eradicate the corruption under
certain public functionaries, thereby the executive order passed by the State Government is
impermissible and the State Government indirectly encouraging the corruption in the State.
Therefore, he sought to allow the writ petitions.
106. In support of his contentions, the learned senior counsel relied upon the following judgments:

Arguments advanced by Sri V. Lakshminarayana, learned senior counsel/amicus
curiae
107. Sri V. Lakshminarayana, learned senior counsel, on instructions from the instructing counsel,
submitted that W.P. No.58252/2017, 3109/2018 and 4319/2018 may be dismissed as withdrawn
and accordingly, the said writ petitions were dismissed as withdrawn by separate orders on
27.6.2022. However, since he was appearing for some of the private parties and has argued the
matter at length, this Court by the order dated 27.6.2022 requested him to assist the Court as an
amicus curiae. Accordingly, he assisted the Court as amicus curiae.
108. Sri V. Lakshminarayan, learned senior counsel/amicus curiae while referring to the impugned
notification dated 14.3.2016, has contended that notification contemplates that the Government has
realized necessity of a strong and effective vigilance system in addition to the Karnataka Lokayukta,
in order to prevent the inappropriate operation of the administrative apparatus and improve the
administration and therefore, it has been decided to divest Karnataka Lokayukta of its additional
responsibility under the PC Act, thereby the Government has ordered to create an Anti Corruption
Bureau so as to effectively enforce and conduct independent investigations under the PC Act,
establish Vigilance Cells in all the departments of the government and a Vigilance Advisory Board to
supervise such a system of vigilance. He would further contend that vide Notification dated
14/03/2016, the ACB was created with the following designations:
1. Additional Director General of Police (ADGP)
2. Inspector General of Police (IGP)
3. Superintendent of Police (SP)
4. Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP)
5. Police Inspectors (PI)

2. Additional Chief Secretary, Internal Administration

4. Principal Secretary, DPAR
5. D.G. & I.G.P.
6. Two Eminent personalities experienced and experts in the field of Administration
and Public issues
7. Secretary, Vigilance Wing of DPAR
109. Learned senior counsel/amicus curiae further pointed out that the Notification contemplates
that the ACB will function under the overall supervision of the Department of Personnel and
Administrative Reforms and in order to provide the necessary administrative support to the ACB, a
post of the rank of Secretary would be created in the Department of Personnel and Administrative
Reforms and under his leadership, a Vigilance Wing is created. The Secretary of the DPAR Vigilance
Wing will report to the Hon'ble Chief Minister through the Chief Secretary.
110. Learned senior counsel/amicus curiae would further contend that by virtue of Government
Order, the independent powers conferred under the statute has been removed which is
impermissible. He would further contend that the Hon'ble Chief Minister has no role in the
independent investigation by the competent authority, thereby the Government Order dated
14/03/2016 is contrary to the object of the KL Act. The investigation has to be done by the
Lokayukta under the PC Act and the State cannot appoint other agency by way of executive order to
proceed under the provisions of Section 17 of the PC Act. He would further contend that the
authority should be independent of the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary and the fourth wing-Press
& Media.
111. Learned senior counsel would further contend that under the provisions of Section 15(3) of the
KL Act, the Lokayukta or an Upa-lokayukta may for the purpose of conducting investigations under
this Act utilise the services of any officer or investigating agency of the State Government or the
Central Government.
112. Learned senior counsel/amicus curiae further contended that 'United Nations Convention
against Corruption' is committed to pursue the policy of zero tolerance against corruption and the
instrument of ratification is dated 9.5.2011. He further contended that the Police Officers are under
the administrative control of the Lokayukta or Upa-lokayukta under the Act. He invited the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 55
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
attention of the Court to Article 1 of United Nations Convention against corruption, which relates to
statement of purpose. The purposes of Convention are:
(a) To promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat corruption more
efficiently and effectively;
(b) To promote, facilitate and support international cooperation and technical
assistance in the prevention of and fight against corruption, including in asset
recovery;
(c) To promote integrity, accountability and proper management of public affairs and
public property.
113. Learned senior counsel/amicus curiae also invited the attention of the Court to Article-3 of
United Nations Convention against corruption, which relates to scope of application. Article-3
prescribes that the convention shall apply, in accordance with its terms, to the prevention,
investigation and prosecution of corruption and to the freezing, seizure, confiscation and return of
the proceeds of offences established in accordance with the convention.
114. Learned senior counsel/amicus curiae contended that Chapter-II of United Nations Convention
against Corruption contemplates preventive measures and it is relevant to refer to certain Articles of
the said chapter. Article 5 deals with preventive anti-corruption policies and Article-6 relates to
preventive anti- corruption body or bodies. Sub-clause (2) of Article 6 contemplates that each state
party shall grant the body or bodies referred to in paragraph 1 of this article the necessary
independence, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, to enable the body
or bodies to carry out its or their functions effectively and free from any undue influence. Article -
7(1)(d) relates to promoting education and training programmes. Article 30 contemplates
prosecution, adjudication and sanctions. Article 36 contemplates specialized authorities and it
stipulates that each State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal
system, ensure the existence of a body or bodies or persons specialized in combating corruption
through law enforcement. Such body or bodies or persons shall be granted the necessary
independence, in accordance with the fundamental principles of the legal system of the state Party,
to be able to carry out their functions effectively and without any undue influence. Such persons or
staff of such body or bodies should have the appropriate training and resources to carry out their
task.
115. Learned senior counsel/amicus curiae would further contend that the provisions of Article 253
of the Constitution of India relates to legislation for giving effect to international agreements. It
contemplates that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, Parliament
has power to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any
treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or any decision made at any
international conference, association or other body.

Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
116. Learned senior counsel would further contend that the statement of objects and reasons of the
KL Act depicts that the institution of Lokayukta was set up for the purpose of improving the
standards of public administration, by looking into complaints against administrative actions,
including cases of corruption, favoritism and official indiscipline in the administration machinery.
He brought to the notice of the Court the definition of 'public servant' as defined under sub-section
(12) of Section 2 of the KL Act so also provisos (1) and (2) of Section 17 of the P.C. Act and contends
that there cannot be any dilution of powers. The learned Senior Counsel would further contend that
the investigation has nothing to do with the administration. Once the notification for investigation is
issued under Section 17(c) of the PC Act, it becomes statutory enforcement and the same cannot be
withdrawn by the executive orders of the State Government. He further pointed out that the
corruption can be investigated only by one investigating agency and there should not be any
influence. He would further contend that the investigation should be fair and proper on the part of
the investigating officer, who is the backbone of the Rule of Law. He further contended that
investigation should be independent without any bias, fear or favour.
117. Learned senior counsel/amicus curiae would further contend that the allegation with regard to
corruption can be investigated only by one authority under the provisions of PC Act and not two
authorities viz., Lokayukta as well as ACB. The creation of ACB parallel to the institution of
Lokayukta is bad in law. He would further contend that the Government Order dated 14.3.2016
issued under the provisions of Article 162 of the Constitution of India clearly depicts that at every
step there will be political influence on the officer concerned which is impermissible. ACB should
work under the provisions of the KL Act in view of the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Rangaswamaiah19 stated supra. The provisions of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act is
not applicable as contended by the Supra at Footnote No.1 learned Advocate General, in view of
Vineet Narain20 case. Therefore, learned senior counsel/amicus curiae sought to quash the
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB and allow the writ petitions.
118. In support of his contentions, learned senior counsel/amicus curiae relied upon the following
judgments:
1. Vineet Narain -vs- Union of India reported in (1998)1 SCC 226 (relevant paras - 38,
39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 and 58), particularly at paragraph-
38 it is stated that the meaning of the word "superintendence" in Section 4(1) of the Delhi Special
Police Act, 1946 determines the scope of the authority of the Central Government in this context.
2. Justice Chandrashekaraiah (Retired) vs. Janekere C.Krishna & others reported in (2013)3 SCC 117

VIII. Arguments advanced by Sri Basavaraju .S, learned senior counsel for Sri Gowtham A.R,
learned counsel for the petitioner/s in Writ Petition No.23622/2016
119. Sri Basavaraju, learned Senior Counsel along with Sri Gowtham A.R., learned counsel for the
petitioner in W.P. No.23622/2016 contended that the present writ petition is filed in public interest
challenging the Government Order dated 14.03.2016 at Annexure-A as well as subsequent
notifications at Annexures-B, C, D, E, all dated 19.3.2016. Learned senior counsel contended that
the Government Order dated 14.03.2016 is contrary to the provisions of Articles 14, 19, 21 and 300
of the Constitution of India. He further contended that every institution should maintain
institutional responsibility and integrity and any attempt to dilute the same is undemocratic and
against the basic structure of the Constitution, which is impermissible. He contended that the
Government Order dated 14.03.2016 suffers from legal malafides since it protects certain persons
and has not taken into consideration the definition of 'public servant' as contemplated under Section
2(12) and 7 of the KL Act.
120. In support of his contentions, learned Senior Counsel relied upon the following judgments:
1. Yakub Abdul Razak Memon v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2013)13 SCC 1
(paragraphs 91 to 100)

2. Institution of A.P. Lokayukta/Upa-Lokayukta and others vs. T. Rama Subba Reddy
and another reported in (1997) 9 SCC 42 (paragraph 19) IX. Arguments advanced by
Sri D.L. Jagadish, learned senior counsel for Ms. Rakshitha D.J., learned counsel for
the petitioner in W.P. No.16862/2017
121. Sri D.L.Jagadish, learned Senior Counsel for Ms.Rakshitha D.J., learned counsel for the
petitioner contended that the impugned Government Order dated 14.03.2016 passed by the State
Government cannot be sustained as the same is contrary to the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Sri C. Rangaswamaiah21 (paragraphs-29 and 30). He further contended that by
virtue of the Government Order dated 14.03.2016, independence of Lokayukta and its effective
functioning as a matter of utmost importance has been removed/diluted and people's faith in the
working of public servants is shaken. He further contended that the dictums/decisions of Lokayukta
or Upa-Lokayukta should not become mere paper directions. Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta must
be armed with proper tooth and claws so that the efforts put in by them are not wasted and their
reports are not shelved by the disciplinary authorities concerned.
122. Learned senior counsel further contended that the Government Order dated 14.03.2016 is
contrary to the provisions of Section 15(1) and (2) of the KL Act. He further contended that the
'public servant' as defined under the provisions of Section 2(12) of the KL Act includes the Hon'ble
Chief Minister. But the impugned Government Order dated 14.03.2016 indirectly excludes some of
the authorities mentioned in Section 2(12) of the KL Act including the Hon'ble Chief Minister.
Supra at Footnote No.1
123. In support of his contentions, learned Senior Counsel relied upon the dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Chandrashekaraiah v. Janekere C. Krishna22 (paragraphs 20, 21 and
36).
X. Arguments advanced by Sri C.V. Sudhindra, learned counsel for the petitioners in
W.P.No.28341/2017 and
124. These writ petitions are filed by the individual petitioners in their personal interest challenging
the Government Order dated 14/03/2016 constituting ACB under Article 162 of Constitution of
India so also the subsequent supporting notifications dated 19.3.2016, 30.03.2016 and 21.04.2016
issued by respondent No.1.
125. Sri C.V. Sudhindra, learned counsel for the petitioners contended that Section 17 of the PC Act
contemplates the persons authorized to investigate the cases under the PC Act and first proviso to
the said section envisages that if a police officer not (2013)3 SCC 117 below the rank of an Inspector
of Police is authorised by the State Government in this behalf by general or special order, he may
also investigate any such offence without the order of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Magistrate of
the first class, as the case may be, or make arrest therefor without a warrant. The second proviso to
the said section provides further that an offence referred to in clause
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 59
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
(b) of sub-section (1)] of section 13 shall not be investigated without the order of a police officer not
below the rank of a Superintendent of Police. He further contended that the said provisions
contemplate to investigate -
(a) trap cases
(b) disproportionate assets cases, as contemplated under Sections 7 and 13(a)(b)(c)(d)(e) of the PC
Act.
126. Learned counsel further contended that by the impugned Government Order dated 14.03.2016,
the ACB is constituted with the following posts.
Sl. Designation of posts No. of posts
No.
6 Head Constables/Police Constables 200
(HC/PC)
127. Learned counsel also contended that in order to supervise the Vigilance system in the State, a
Vigilance Advisory Board has been created comprising of the following persons:
Sl. Designation of posts
No.
1 Chief Secretary President of
Board
2 Addl. Chief Secretary, Internal Member
Administration
3 Principal Secretary, Department of Member
Finance
3 Principal Secretary, DPAR Member
4 D.G. & I.G.P. Member
5 Two prominent persons having Member
specialisation and experience in
Administration and Public Matters
6 Secretary, DPAR Vigilance Division Member
Secretary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 60
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
128. Learned counsel further contended that the Vigilance Advisory Board will meet atleast once in
three months, to review the operations of the Vigilance Cells in the Government and to review the
progress of the ACB and the cases pending before it. In case the Vigilance Advisory Board decides to
refer the investigation to be conducted by an outside agency/ogranization, such matter after
approval of the Chief Minister may be handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department
(C.I.D.). Therefore, he contended that one cannot expect the Vigilance Advisory Board functions
independently, since even to refer the investigation to C.I.D., approval of the Chief Minister must be
obtained.
129. Learned counsel also contended that Section 2(16) of the Karnataka Police Act contemplates
that, 'Police Officer' means any member of the police force appointed or deemed to be appointed
under the said Act and includes a special or an additional police officer appointed under Section 19
or 20. He further contended that Section 2(22) of the Karnataka Police Act contemplates that
'Superior Police' means members of the Police Force above the rank of Inspector. He further
contended that, the provisions of Section 6 of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963, contemplates that, for
the direction, control and supervision of the Police service, the Government shall appoint a Director
General and Inspector General of Police, who shall subject to the control of the government, exercise
such powers and perform such functions and duties and shall have such responsibilities and such
authority as may be provided by or under the said Act. Sub Section (2) of Section (6) of the
Karnataka Police Act, 1963, contemplates that the Director General and Inspector General of Police
shall be selected by the State Government from amongst officers of the Indian Police Service in the
rank of Director General of Police who have been empanelled for promotion to that rank on the
basis of their length of service, very good history of service, professional knowledge and ability to
lead Police Force in the State. Therefore, he contended that the impugned Government Order dated
14.03.2016 is in utter violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India and the provisions
of Section 6(1) and (2) of the Karnataka Police Act, thereby the very intention and enactment of the
Karnataka Police Act, 1963 is frustrated. Therefore, he sought to allow the writ petition.
XI. Arguments advanced by Sri Sharath S. Gowda, learned counsel for the petitioner/s in Writ
Petition No.16697/2017
130. The petitioner filed this writ petition in his personal interest challenging the validity of the
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting the ACB and the complaint dated 6.3.2017 and the
FIR registered thereon dated 6.3.2017.
131. Sri Sharath S Goiwda, learned counsel for the petitioner while adopting the arguments of Sri
M.S. Bhagwath, learned senior counsel and Sri V. Lakshminarayana, learned senior counsel/amicus
curiae contended that the definition of 'public servant' as contemplated under the provisions of
Section 2(12) of the KL Act includes the Chief Minister; a Minister; a Member of the State
Legislature, a Government servant etc., By virtue of the impugned Government Order constituting
ACB, ultimately the investigation or report has to be approved by the Chief Minister and thereby, he
cannot decide his own case. Therefore, he sought to allow the writ petition by quashing the
Government order dated 14.3.2016 etc., XII. Arguments advanced by Sri Ashok Haranahalli, learned
senior counsel for Karnataka Lokayukta
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 61
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
132. Sri Ashok Haranahalli, learned senior counsel along with Sri B.S.Prasad and Sri Venkatesh
S.Arabatti, learned counsel for Lakayukta contended that KL Act enacted for the purpose of
improving the standards of public administration, by looking into complaints against administrative
actions, including cases of corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in administrative
machinery. Where, after investigation into the complaint, the Lokayukta considers that the
allegation against a public servant is prima facie true and makes a declaration and in case, the
declaration is accepted by the Competent Authority, the public servant concerned, if he is a Chief
Minister or any other Minister or Member of State Legislature shall resign his office and if he is any
other non-official shall be deemed to have vacated his office, and, if an official, shall be deemed to
have been kept under suspension, with effect from the date of the acceptance of the declaration.
Learned senior counsel further contended that if, after investigation, the Lokayukta is satisfied that
the public servant has committed any criminal offence, he may initiate prosecution without
reference to any other authority. Any prior sanction required under any law for such prosecution
shall be deemed to have been granted. The Vigilance Commission is abolished, but all inquiries and
investigations and other disciplinary proceedings pending before the Vigilance Commission got
transferred to the Lokayukta. The Bill became an Act with some modifications as the Karnataka
Lokayukta Act, 1984. Thereby, he contended that the impugned Executive Order passed by the State
Government under the provisions of Article 162 of the Constitution of India dated 14/03/2016 is
contrary to the very object of the KL Act.
133. Learned senior counsel further refers to the provisions of Section 14 of the KL Act which states
about the initiation of prosecution. If after investigation into any complaint the Lokayukta or an Upa
Lokayukta is satisfied that the public servant has committed any criminal offence and should be
prosecuted in a Court of law for such offence, then, he may pass an order to that effect and initiate
prosecution of the public servant concerned and if prior sanction of any authority is required for
such prosecution, then, notwithstanding anything contained in any law, such sanction shall be
deemed to have been granted by the appropriate authority on the date of such order or any other
agency.
134. Learned senior counsel would further contend that Section 15(3) Lokayukta Act, 1984
contemplates that without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (1) the Lokayukta or an
Upalokayukta may for the purpose of conducting investigations under this Act utilise the services of
any officer or investigating agency of the State Government; or any officer or investigating agency of
the Central Government with the prior concurrence of the State Government. He specifically
pointed out that Section 15(4) of the KL Act contemplates that the officers and other employees
referred to in sub-section (1) shall be under the administrative and disciplinary control of the
Lokayukta. He further contended that 'United Nations Convention against Corruption' is committed
to pursue the policy of zero tolerance and the India has ratified it and this convention imposed
number of obligations, some mandatory, some recommendatory, some optional etc.
135. Learned senior counsel would further refer to the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of the Lokpal
and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 with regard to enquiry wing and prosecution wing. He would further refer
to the provisions Section 23 of the said Act which deals with power of Lokpal to grant sanction for
initiating prosecution. Sub-section (2) of Section 23 contemplates that no prosecution under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 62
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
sub-section (1) shall be initiated against any public servant accused of any offence alleged to have
been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, and no
court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the Lokpal. He also
refers to the provisions of Section 24 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, which deals with action on
investigation against public servant being Prime Minister, Ministers or Members of Parliament and
the said section contemplates that where, after the conclusion of the investigation, the findings of
the Lokpal disclose the commission of an offence under the PC Act by a public servant referred to in
clause (a) or clause (b) or clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 14, the Lokpal may file a case in the
Special Court and shall send a copy of the report together with its findings to the competent
authority. He also refers to the provisions of Section 63 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, which
relates to establishment of Lokayukta. The said section contemplates that every State shall establish
a body to be known as the Lokayukta for the State, if not so established, constituted or appointed, by
a law made by the State Legislature, to deal with complaints relating to corruption against certain
public functionaries, within a period of one year from the date of commencement of the said Act.
136. Finally, learned senior counsel contended that the impugned Executive Order passed by the
State is in utter violation of the provisions of Sections 11, 12, 15, 23 and 24 of the Lokpal and
Lokayuktas Act. He would further contend that the powers of Lokayukta should be on par with the
powers of Lokpal. Therefore, the Executive Order passed by the State Government under the
provisions of Article 162 of the Constitution of India is contrary and bad in law. In support of the
said contention, he relied upon the dictum of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ashwini Kumar
Upadhyay vs. Union of India & others23 (paragraph-6).
[W.P.(Civil).No. 684/2016 - SLP(C)No.22841/2016 dated 19/04/2018]
137. Learned senior counsel further contended that the Lokpal Act enacted under Article 223 of the
Constitution of India. The powers to prosecute was given by the Notification dated 06/02/1991
under the provisions of Section 17(c) of the PC Act and the same was withdrawn on 19/03/2016.
138. Learned senior counsel mainly drawn the attention of the Court to paragraph No.25 of the
judgment in Rangaswamaiah cited supra, wherein it is stated that " if the State Government wants to
entrust such extra work to the officers on deputation with the Lokayukta, if can certainly inform the
Lokayukta of its desire to do so. If the Lokayukta agrees to such entrustment, there will be no
problem. But if for good reasons the Lokayukta thinks that such entrustment of work by the State
Government is likely to affect its functioning or is likely to affect its independence, it can certainly
inform the State Government accordingly. In case the State Government does not accept the view
point of the Lokayukta, then it will be open to the Lokayukta-having regard to the need to preserve
its independence and effective functioning to take action Supra at Footnote No.1 under section 15(4)
(read with section 15(2)) and direct that these officers on deputation in its police wing will not take
up any such work entrusted to them by the State Government. Of course, it is expected that the State
Government and the Lok Ayukta will avoid any such unpleasant situations but will act reasonably in
their respective spheres."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 63
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
139. Learned senior counsel also drawn the attention of the Court to paragraph 28 of the judgment
in Rangaswamaiah25 cited supra, where it is stated that "if instead of deputation of police officers
from the Government, any other solution can be found, that is a matter to be decided amicably
between the State Government and the Lok Ayukta, - keeping in view the independence of the Lok
Ayukta and its effective functioning as matters of utmost importance."
140. Learned senior counsel would further contend that with regard to the powers of the Lokayukta,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Institution of A.P. Lokayukta/Upa-Lokayukta, Supra at
Footnote No.1 A.P. & others .vs. T.Rama Subba Reddy and another26 at paragraph No.17 has held as
under:
"17. Before parting with these matters, it may be necessary to note that the legislative
intent behind the enactment is to see that the public servants covered by the sweep of
the Act should be answerable for their actions as such to the Lokayukta who is to be a
Judge or a retired Chief Justice of the High Court and in appropriate cases to the
Upa-Lokayukta who is a District Judge of Grade 1 as recommended by the Chief
Justice of the High Court, so that these statutory authorities can work as real
ombudsmen for ensuring that people's faith in the working of these public servants is
not shaken. These statutory authorities are meant to cater to the need of the public at
large with a view to seeing that public confidence in the working of public bodies
remains intact. When such authorities consist of high judicial dignitaries it would be
obvious that such authorities should be armed with appropriate powers and
sanctions so that their orders and opinions do not become mere paper directions. The
decisions of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta, therefore, must be capable of being fully
implemented. These authorities should not be reduced to mere paper tigers but must
be (1997)9 SCC 42 armed with proper teeth and claws so that the efforts put in by
them are not wasted and their reports are not shelved by the disciplinary authorities
concerned. When we turn to Section 12, sub-section (3) of the Act, we find that once
the report is forwarded by the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta recommending the
imposition of penalty of removal from the office of a public servant, all that is
provided is that it should be lawful for the Government without any further inquiry to
take action on the basis of the said recommendation for the removal of such public
servant from his office and for making him ineligible for being elected to any office
etc. Even if it may be lawful for the Government to act on such recommendation, it is
nowhere provided that the Government will be bound to comply with the
recommendation of the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta.
The question may arise in a properly-instituted public interest litigation as to whether the provision
of Section 12(3) of the Act implies a power coupled with duty which can be enforced by a writ of
mandamus by the High Court or by writ of any other competent court but apart from such litigations
and uncertainty underlying the results thereof, it would be more appropriate for the legislature itself
to make a clear provision for due compliance with the report of Lokayukta or Upa- Lokayukta so
that the public confidence in the working of the system does not get eroded and these institutions
can effectively justify their creation under the statute."

Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
141. Learned senior counsel also relied upon the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Dr. Subramanian Swamy vs. Director, Central Bureau of Investigation & another27 wherein at
paragraphs 58, 59, 67, 71, 74 it is held as under:
"58. It seems to us that classification which is made in Section 6-A on the basis of
status in the Government service is not permissible under Article 14 as it defeats the
purpose of finding prima facie truth into the allegations of graft, which amount to an
offence under the PC Act, 1988. Can there be sound differentiation between corrupt
public servants based on their status? Surely not, because irrespective of their status
or position, corrupt public servants are corrupters of public power. The corrupt
public servants, whether high or low, are birds of the same feather and must be
confronted with the process of investigation and inquiry equally. Based on the
position or status in service, no distinction can be made between public servants AIR
2014 SC 2140 against whom there are allegations amounting to an offence under the
PC Act, 1988.
59. Corruption is an enemy of the nation and tracking down corrupt public servants
and punishing such persons is a necessary mandate of the PC Act, 1988. It is difficult
to justify the classification which has been made in Section 6-A because the goal of
law in the PC Act, 1988 is to meet corruption cases with a very strong hand and all
public servants are warned through such a legislative measure that corrupt public
servants have to face very serious consequences. In the words of Mathew, J. in
Ambica Mills Ltd.72, "The equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of
equal laws. But laws may classify...... A reasonable classification is one which includes
all who are similarly situated and none who are not". Mathew, J., while explaining
the meaning of the words, 'similarly situated' stated that we must look beyond the
classification to the purpose of the law. The purpose of a law may be either the
elimination of a public mischief or the achievement of some positive public good. The
classification made in Section 6-A neither eliminates public mischief nor achieves
some positive public good. On the other hand, it advances public mischief and
protects the crime-doer. The provision thwarts an independent, unhampered,
unbiased, efficient and fearless inquiry/investigation to track down the corrupt
public servants.
67. Can it be said that the classification is based on intelligible differentia when one
set of bureaucrats of Joint Secretary level and above who are working with the
Central Government are offered protection under Section 6-A while the same level of
officers who are working in the States do not get protection though both classes of
these officers are accused of an offence under PC Act, 1988 and inquiry/investigation
into such allegations is to be carried out. Our answer is in the negative. The provision
in Section 6-A, thus, impedes tracking down the corrupt senior bureaucrats as
without previous approval of the Central Government, the CBI cannot even hold
preliminary inquiry much less an investigation into the allegations. The protection in
Section 6-A has propensity of shielding the corrupt. The object of Section 6-A, that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 65
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
senior public servants of the level of Joint Secretary and above who take policy
decision must not be put to any harassment, side-tracks the fundamental objective of
the PC Act, 1988 to deal with corruption and act against senior public servants. The
CBI is not able to proceed even to collect the material to unearth prima facie
substance into the merits of allegations. Thus, the object of Section 6-A itself is
discriminatory. That being the position, the discrimination cannot be justified on the
ground that there is a reasonable classification because it has rational relation to the
object sought to be achieved.
71. Corruption is an enemy of nation and tracking down corrupt public servant,
howsoever high he may be, and punishing such person is a necessary mandate under
the PC Act, 1988. The status or position of public servant does not qualify such public
servant from exemption from equal treatment. The decision making power does not
segregate corrupt officers into two classes as they are common crime doers and have
to be tracked down by the same process of inquiry and investigation.
74. Corruption corrodes the moral fabric of the society and corruption by public
servants not only leads to corrosion of the moral fabric of the society but also harmful
to the national economy and national interest, as the persons occupying high posts in
the Government by misusing their power due to corruption can cause considerable
damage to the national economy, national interest and image of the country."
142. In support of his contentions, learned senior counsel further relied upon the following
judgments:
1. Prakash Singh & others vs. Union of India & others28 (paragraph Nos.19, 22, 25
and 29)
2. C. Rangaswamaiah and others vs. Karnataka Lokayukta and others29, (paragraph
Nos.19, 20, 25, 27 and 28)
3. Justice K.P.Mohapatra vs. Sri Ram Chandra Nayak & others30 (paragraph Nos.11
and 12) Therefore, he sought to allow the writ petitions.
XIII. Arguments advanced by Sri Prabhuling K. Navadgi, learned Advocate General for the
respondent/State
143. Sri Prabhuling K.Navadgi, learned Advocate General while justifying the impugned
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 passed by the State Government constituting ACB, has
contended that in order to decide the controversy raised between the parties, following issued would
arise for consideration:
" I) Whether the impugned notification constituting ACB is in excess of the power conferred
(2006)8 SCC 1 Supra Footnote No.1 2002(8) SCC 1 upon the Government under Article 162 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 66
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
Constitution of India?
a) Whether the constitution of ACB by way of executive instructions is impermissible- since
according to the petitioners there are two enactments operating in the same field viz..
Karnataka Police Act, 1963 and Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984.
b) The parameters and general principles under Article 162 of the Constitution of India? II] Whether
the constitution of ACB violates the provisions of the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984?
a) Whether it is impermissible for any
jurisdictional police to investigate offences
under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988- since it is an occupied field by the Karnataka
Lokayukta Act, 1984?
b) Whether the present impugned notification impinges upon the autonomy, independence and
functioning of the Lokayukta under the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984?
III] Whether the impugned notification is in conflict with the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013?
IV] Whether the impugned notification, which in turn constitutes vigilance advisory board or which
provides for obtaining prior approval of the competent authority, is arbitrary, unguided and
undermines the independence of ACB?
V] Tabulation of number of cases filed by the ACB after its constitution."
144. Learned Advocate General further contended that under Article 162 of the Constitution of
India, the Executive can make any order under List - II or List III to the 7th Schedule of the
Constitution of India. He draws the attention of the Court to the three enactments viz., Karnataka
Police Act, 1963, KL Act and PC Act.
145. Learned Advocate General further contended that as per the provisions of Section 5 of the
Karnataka Police Act, the Police Force shall consist of such number in the several ranks and have
such organisation and such powers, functions and duties as the Government may by general or
special order determine, but all are working under the Police Act. ACB is created under Article 162
of the Constitution of India for the purpose of investigating the offences under the provisions of the
PC Act.
146. Learned Advocate General further contended that the Executive Order passed by the State
Government dated 14.3.2016 does not conflict any of the provisions either under the KL Act or the
Police Act. In terms of the Executive order dated 14.3.2016, the ACB is working under the provisions
of the PC Act as a separate Wing or authority and the same is nothing to do with the provisions of
the KL Act. The powers and functions of the Lokayukta and ACB are entirely different. He further
contended that under the provisions of Section 2(c) of PC Act, 'public servant' means persons falling
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 67
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
under any of the 12 sub-clauses of the said section. In view of the provisions of Sections 7, 7A, 8, 9,
10, 13, 17 (a) and (b) and 23 of the P.C. Act, the ACB has to register, investigate and proceed in
accordance with law. The investigation can be done by the ACB as contemplated under the
provisions of the P.C. Act. He would further contend that the provisions of Sections 17A and 19 of
the P.C. Act clearly depict that Section 3 of the P.C. Act is a complete code in itself. The provisions of
Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal Procedure contemplates the in-charge Police Station. Under the
provisions of Sections 9, 12, 13, 14 of the KL Act, ACB has no role and it is only the officers working
in Lokayukta can investigate. He further contended that as on today, the Lokayukta has 747 Police
Officers to investigate and work under the KL Act and on the other hand only 447 Police Officers are
working in ACB.
147. Learned Advocate General further pointed out that with regard to Clause-5 of the Government
Order dated 14.3.2016, the Chief Secretary, Government of Karnataka has filed the affidavit before
this Court on 28.3.2021 stating that a notification shall be issued by the State Government with the
following modifications to the Government Order dated 14.3.2016:
a) Clause 5 of the order dated 14.03.2016 shall be deleted.
b) The ADGP of the ACB will have security of tenure for a minimum period of two
years. He will not be transferred by the government before the completion of his
tenure of two years unless he is:
i) convicted by a court of law in a criminal case or where charges have been framed
against him by a court in a case involving corruption or offences which amounts to
moral turpitude; or
ii) incapacitation by physical or mental illness or otherwise becoming unable to
discharge his functions as ADGP; or
iii) appointed to any other post with his consent; or
iv) imposed punishment of dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement from service
or of reduction to a lower post, awarded under the provisions of the All India Services
(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969 or any other relevant rule; or
v) under suspension from service; or
vi) When a prima facie case of misconduct or gross negligence is established after a
preliminary enquiry.
148. Though an affidavit filed, learned Advocate General fairly submits that no such modification
notification has been issued as on today.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 68
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
149. Learned Advocate General further contended that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of C.
Rangaswamaiah31 at paragraph-6 observed that even after deputation, there could be a "dual" role
on the part of the Police Officers in their functions, namely, functions under the Lokayukta and
functions in discharge of the duties entrusted to them by the State of Karnataka, under the PC Act.
Further, the notification issued under Section 17 of the PC Act designating all Inspectors on
deputation in the Lokayukta as officers competent for purposes of Section 17 of the PC Act and the
notification issued under Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal procedure designating all offices of the
Lokayukta in the State as Police stations, indicated that these Police officers though on deputation,
were entrusted with these powers of investigation, by virtue of statutory powers.
Supra at Footnote No.1
150. Learned Advocate General further contended that by earlier notifications, in exercise of the
powers under the provisions of Section 17 of the PC Act and Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, extra power was assigned to Lokayukta and after came to know that there is extra
burden, the same has been withdrawn. Once the State has power to grant, it has power to withdraw
also, in view of the provisions of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.
151. Learned Advocate General contended that the petitioners are under wrong notion that by
creating ACB, the powers entrusted to Lokayukta has been withdrawn. The powers of the Lokayukta
under the provisions of KL Act have not been disturbed. The ACB is working under the provisions of
the PC Act as a separate Wing or authority and the same is nothing to do with the institution of
Lokayukta, which is working under the provisions of the KL Act and no powers of Lokayukta have
been diluted as contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners. Learned Advocate General
contended that the provisions of KL Act and the provisions of PC Act are distinct.
152. Learned Advocate General also contended that the ACB is a separate wing under the Karnataka
Police Act to discharge the work assigned to it. The executive Government Order dated 14.03.2016 is
a policy of the State Government and cannot be interfered with by this Court while exercising writ
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The provisions of Section 4 of the
Karnataka Police Act, 1963 contemplates that, the superintendence of the Police Force throughout
the State vests in and is exercisable by the Government and any control, direction or supervision
exercisable by any officer over any member of the Police Force shall be exercisable subject to such
superintendence(Government).
153. Learned Advocate General further contended that Entry- 2 of List II to the 7th Schedule of the
Constitution of India contemplates Police (including railway and village police) subject to the
provisions of entry 2A of List I. It is brought to the notice of the Court that there are 16 States in the
country where both ACB and Lokayuktha are in existence.

154. Learned Advocate General further contended that the State Government issued the
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 constituting ACB, in exercise of powers under Article 162 of the
Constitution of India and such policy decision cannot be interfered by this Court. He would further
contend that there are two types of writ petitions before this Court. One filed in the public interest
and the other in personal interest and the petitioners have not made out any case to interfere with
the executive order passed by the State Government and sought to dismiss the writ petitions.
155. In support of his contentions, learned Advocate General relied upon the following judgments:
1. C. Rangaswamaiah -vs- Karnataka Lokayukta32 (paragraphs 7,8,15, 23, 24 and 29)
2. Vineet Narain and others .vs. Union of India33 and another (paragraphs 40, 41
and 42)
3. Municipal Council, Neemuch v. Mahadeo Real Estate34, (paragraph 13).
4. State of Karnataka and others v. Kempaiah,35 (paragraph 6 and 8).
XIV. Points for determination
156. In view of the aforesaid rival contentions urged by the learned counsel for the parties, the
points that would arise for our consideration in these writ petitions are:
1. Whether the State Government is justified in constituting Anti Corruption Bureau
by an executive Government Order dated 14.3.2016, in exercise of the powers under
Article 162 of AIR 1998 SC 2496 (1998)1SCC 226 (2019)10 SCC 738 (1998)6 SCC 103
the Constitution of India, when the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984 has occupied the
field to eradicate the corruption in the State of Karnataka, in the facts and
circumstances of the present case?
2. Whether the State Government is justified in issuing the impugned notifications
dated 19.3.2016 superseding the earlier notifications dated 6.2.1991, 8.5.2002 and
5.12.2002 that authorized the Lokayukta Police with powers to investigate under the
provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 and had declared the offices of
Police Wing of the Karnataka Lokayukta as Police Stations under the provisions of
Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal Procedure ?
157. We have given our anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for
the parties and perused all the papers including the original records carefully.
XV. Consideration
158. Before proceeding to the merits of the case, it is relevant to refer to the statement of objects and
reasons of the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984 and certain important sections of the said Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 72
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
159. The Legislature - State Government on the basis of the recommendations of the Administrative
Reforms Commission enacted the KL Act w.e.f 15th January 1986 for the purpose of improving the
standards of public administration, by looking into complaints against administrative actions,

165. The provisions of Section 3 of the KL Act contemplates appointment of Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta, which reads as under:
(1) For the purpose of conducting investigations and enquiries in accordance with the
provisions of this Act, the Governor shall appoint a person to be known as the
Lokayukta and one or more persons to be known as the Upalokayukta or
Upalokayuktas.
(2) (a) A person to be appointed as the Lokayukta shall be a person who has held the
office of a Judge of the Supreme Court or that of the Chief Justice of a High Court or
a person who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court for not less than ten years
and shall be appointed on the advice tendered by the Chief Minister in consultation
with the Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka, the Chairman, Karnataka
Legislative Council, the Speaker, Karnataka Legislative Assembly, the Leader of the
Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Council and the Leader of the Opposition in
the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.

166. A careful reading of the above provisions make it clear that a person to be appointed as the

Chief Justice of a High Court or a person who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court for not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 75
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
less than ten years and shall be appointed on the advice tendered by the Chief Minister in
consultation with the -
a) Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka,
b) the Chairman, Karnataka Legislative Council,
c) the Speaker, Karnataka Legislative Assembly,
d) the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Council and
e) the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.
167. The above provisions also make it clear that a person to be appointed as an Upa-Lokayukta
shall be a person who has held the office of a judge of a High Court for not less than five years and
shall be appointed on the advice tendered by the Chief Minister in consultation with -
i) the Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka,
ii) the Chairman, Karnataka Legislative Council,
iii) the Speaker, Karnataka Legislative Assembly,
iv) the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Council; and
v) the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.
168. In view of the above, it is clear that while appointment of either Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta,
the procedure as contemplated under the provisions of Sections 3(2)(a) and 3(2)(b) of the KL Act
has been followed meticulously from the date of enactment of the KL Act i.e. from 15.1.1986 till
today.
169. The provisions of Section 4 of the KL Act contemplates that the Lokayukta or Upalokayukta
shall not be a Member of the Parliament or be a Member of the Legislature of any State and shall not
hold any office of trust or profit (other than his office as Lokayukta or Upalokayukta) or be
connected with any political party or carry on any business or practice any profession and
accordingly, before he enters upon his office, a person appointed as the Lokayukta or an
Upalokayukta shall,--
(a) if he is a Member of the Parliament or of the Legislature of any State, resign such membership;
or
(b) if he holds any office of trust or profit, resign from such office; or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 76
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
(c) if he is connected with any political party, sever his connection with it; or
(d) if he is carrying on any business, sever his connection (short of divesting himself of ownership)
with the conduct and management of such business; or
(e) if he is practising any profession, suspend practice of such profession.
170. Sub-section (1) of Section - 5 of the KL Act, contemplates that a person appointed as the
Lokayukta or Upaloakayukta shall hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he
enters upon his office, provided that -
(a) the Lokayukta or an Upalokayukta may, by writing under his hand addressed to the Governor,
resign his office;
(b) the Lokayukta or an Upalokayukta may be removed from office in the manner provided in
Section 6.
171. Sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the KL Act contemplates that on ceasing to hold office, the
Lokayukta or an Upalokayukta shall be ineligible for further employment to any office of profit
under the Government of Karnataka or in any authority, corporation, company, society or university
referred to in item (g) of clause (12) of Section 2 of the KL Act.
172. The provisions of Section 9 of the KL Act deals with provisions relating to complaints and
investigations. Section 10 of the KL Act contemplates issue of search warrant; Section 12 of the KL
Act contemplates reports of Lokayukta; Section 14 of the KL Act contemplates initiation of
prosecution; and Section 15 of the KL Act relates to the staff of Lokayukta. Sub-section (3) of Section
15 of the KL Act contemplates that without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (1), the
Lokayukta or an Upa-Lokayukta may for the purpose of conducting investigations under this Act
utilise the services of,--
(a) any officer or investigating agency of the State Government; or (aa) any officer or investigating
agency of the Central Government with the prior concurrence of the Central Government and State
Government;
(b) any person or any other agency.
173. By careful perusal of the provisions of the KL Act stated supra and other provisions, it clearly
depict that the scheme ensures preservation of the right, interest and dignity of the Lokayukta or
Upalokayukta and is commensurate with the dignity of all the institutions and functionaries
involved in the process. It also excludes the needless meddling in the process by busy bodies
confining the participation in it, to the Members of the Legislative Assembly or Council,
Speaker/Chairman of the Legislature and the Chief Justice to the High Court of Karnataka, the
highest judicial functionary in the State apart from the Lokayukta. If the allegations are permitted to
be made only in the prescribed manner, justify an inquiry into the conduct of the Upalokayukta. As
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 77
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
the Office in question is a public office as public is vitally interested, the process prescribed in the
Act is to be complied with expeditiously, which is also both in public interest as well as in the
interest of the incumbent of the office.
174. During the year 2011, the Lokayukta while exercising powers under the provisions of KL Act
and PC Act has made the Hon'ble Chief Minister and the Hon'ble Minister, who were in power at the
relevant point of time to resign and has send them to prison by creating history in the State of
Karnataka and has become a model to the entire country. It is also not in dispute that at one point of
time, since the son of the Lokayukta was involved in corruption charges, the Lokayukta was made to
resign and that has become possible, in view of the provisions of the KL Act and PC Act. Such was
the independence of the Lokayukta and its effective functioning in the matters of utmost importance
from the date of the inception of the Lokayukta in the year 1986 till 14.3.2016, the date of passing
the impugned executive order under Article 162 of the Constitution of India i.e., for more than three
decades.
175. When the Karnataka Lokayukta Act was assented by the Hon'ble president of India, that would
prevail and the field occupied cannot be eroded and the Government cannot trench upon the
occupied field. It is nothing, but transgression by an executive administrative order to usurp the
powers of Lokayukta. The very Constitution of ACB by the Government is to shield the Corrupt
politicians, Ministers, and the officers from the watchful eyes of the Lokayukta and that Government
is weakening the institution of Lokayukta to protect these persons from prosecution, inter alia under
the provisions of the P.C. Act.
176. As already stated supra, the KL Act was enacted for the purpose of improving the standards of
public administration, by looking into complaints against administrative actions, including cases of
corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in administration machinery. In order to ensure
effective enforcement of the PC Act, in exercise of the powers conferred by the first proviso to
Section 17 of the PC Act, the State Government issued the notification dated 6.2.1991 authorizing all
the Inspectors of Police, Office of the Karnataka Lokayukta for the purpose of the investigation.
177. The provisions of Section 17 of the Prevention of Corruption Act reads as under:
17. Persons authorised to investigate.--
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), no police
officer below the rank,--
(a) in the case of the Delhi Special Police Establishment, of an Inspector of Police;
(b) in the metropolitan areas of Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Ahmedabad and in any other
metropolitan area notified as such under sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), of an Assistant Commissioner of Police;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 78
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
(c) elsewhere, of a Deputy Superintendent of Police or a police officer of equivalent rank, shall
investigate any offence punishable under this Act without the order of a Metropolitan Magistrate or
a Magistrate of the first class, as the case may be, or make any arrest therefor without a warrant:
Provided that if a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police is
authorised by the State Government in this behalf by general or special order, he may
also investigate any such offence without the order of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a
Magistrate of the first class, as the case may be, or make arrest therefor without a
warrant:
Provided further that an offence referred to in clause
(b) of sub-section (1) of Section 13 shall not be investigated without the order of a
police officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police.
178. It is also not in dispute that the state Government vide notifications dated 8.5.2002 and
5.12.2002 declared the offices of the Police Inspectors of Karnataka Lokayukta as Police Stations
under the provisions of Clause (s) of Section 2 of the Code of Criminal procedure.
179. Sub-Clause (s) of Section -2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as under:
2(s) "police station" means any post or place declared generally or specially by the
State Government, to be a police station, and includes any local area specified by the
State Government in this behalf;
180. When things stood thus, the Director General and Inspector General of Police ('DG & IG' for
short) by a letter dated 3.2.2016 addressed to the State Government, has proposed the creation of an
Anti Corruption Bureau in the State, due to the necessity of modifications required so as to enforce
PC Act, keeping in perspective the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of C.
Rangaswamaiah36. The DG & IG has informed that the duties of the officers of the Lokayukta Police
Wing can be classified into two categories viz.,
1) As per Section 15(1) KL Act, the Police Wing is to primarily assist the Lokayukta in enforcing the
KL Act.
2) The Government of Karnataka, through its many orders, has declared the offices of the Police
Inspectors of Lokayukta as Police Stations; the Police officers can investigate the cases registered
under the PC Act. Since such cases are out of jurisdiction of Lokayukta, the Government has issued
several orders regarding the same.
Thereby, the State Government proceeded to pass the impugned executive order dated 14.03.2016
under the provisions of Article 162 of the Constitution of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 79
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
181. A careful perusal of the impugned Government Order dated 14.3.2016 clearly depicts that the
State Government mainly Supra at Footnote No.1 based on the recommendations of the DG & IG
letter dated 3.2.2016, has constituted ACB on the following grounds:
a) In order to avoid dual duties by the Lokayukta Police.
b) There are no approved systems to supervise the cases arising from investigation of
the Police Wing Officers acting under the provisions of P.C. Act.
c) The DG & IG recommends to withdraw the previous Government notifications
dated 6.2.1991, 8.5.2002 and 5.12.2002 that authorised the Lokayukta Police with
powers to investigate and had declared the offices of Police Inspectors of Lokayukta
as Police Stations.
d) The DG & IG has proposed to limit the current Police wing to assist only in the effective
enforcement of the KL Act.
e) The DG & IG requested to form ACB and to provide them with the powers to investigate in an
independent manner so as to independently investigate the cases referred to by the Head of the
Police and the Government.
f) The independent nature of power of the Police Wing of the KL Act as held by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah37.
g) In view of the interim order dated 8.2.2016 made in Criminal Petition No.5378/2014 and
connected maters
h) To reduce the burden of the Lokayukta Police.
182. On meticulous perusal of the aforesaid reasons, it is not forthcoming as to why the DG & IG
recommended to withdraw the notifications dated 6.2.1991 8.5.2002 and 5.12.2002 that had given
the Lokayukta Police, the powers to investigate under the provisions of PC Act and had declared the
offices of Police Inspectors of Lokayukta as Police Stations under the provisions of Section 2(s) of
the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is also stated in the impugned Government Order that this Court
in Criminal Petition No.5378/2014 and connected matters has further directed the State
Government to establish vigilance cells in the same lines as those established by the Central
Government. The impugned Government Order merely depicts that the Government has realized
Supra at Foot Note No.1 the necessity of a strong and effective vigilance system, in addition to
Karnataka Lokayukta to improve the quality of administration and created an ACB, thereby
indirectly diluted the independent effective functioning of the Karnataka Lokayukta, which is a
matter of utmost importance. "If really the State Government wanted to maintain the independence
of the Lokayukta", it could have strengthened the hands of Lokayukta by giving more independent
power or allowed the ACB to work under the Lokayukta to eradicate the corruption, favouritism and
official indiscipline in administrative machinery in the entire state, in the interest of Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 80
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
and in the interest of general public at large. Though the KL Act prescribes to take action against any
public servant as contemplated under Section 2(12) of the KL Act, it is not forthcoming in the
present impugned executive order as to who is the authority to take action, in case DG & IG involved
in corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in administration machinery. So also in case the
Hon'ble Chief Minister, a Minister, a Member of the State Legislature are involved or in case
'Secretary' i.e., Chief Secretary, an Addl. Chief Secretary etc., are involved, there is no power or
authority in the impugned executive order to take action against such persons.
183. On careful perusal of the impugned executive Government Order, it also clearly depicts that the
"Hon'ble Chief Minister is the supreme" and absolutely there is no independent application of mind
by the State Government before passing the impugned executive order and the same is based only
on the recommendation made by the DG & IG, thereby the executive order passed by the State
Government cannot be sustained.
184. The executive order passed by the State Government constituting ACB is parallel to the
institution of Karnataka Lokayukta and absolutely no reasons are assigned except stating that
Government has realized the necessity of a strong and effective vigilance system in addition to
Lokayukta. It is not the case of the State Government that the Karnataka Lokayukta Police Wing,
which is working under the control of the Lokayukta under the provisions of Section 15(3) of the KL
Act not effectively implementing the provisions of the PC Act nor it is the case of the Government
that any general public lodged complaints against the functions of the Lokayukta or its Police Wing.
It is also not the case of the State Government in the impugned executive order that the Lokayukta
or an Upa-Lokayukta expressed any inability to discharge their functions under the provisions of PC
Act or expressed that it is an additional burden. In the absence of the same, it is the State
Government which has passed the impugned executive order, in exercise of the powers under Article
162 of the Constitution of India mainly based on the recommendation made by the DG & IG, without
independent application of mind. Thereby, the impugned order erroneous and contrary to the
provisions of K.L. Act.
185. The State Government while passing the impugned executive orders, has ignored the fact that
Lokayukta and Upa- Lokayukta are appointed under the provisions of Section 3 of the KL Act. That
is, their appointment is by a consultation process with all the stake holders i.e, they are appointed
on the advice tendered by the Chief Minister in consultation with the -
- Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka;
- the Chairman, Karnataka Legislative Council;
- the Speaker, Karnataka Legislative Assembly;
- the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Council; and
- the Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 81
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
186. It is not in dispute that when the KL Act was enacted in the year 1984, on the recommendation
made by the Administrative Reforms Commission for the purpose of improving the standards of
public administration, by looking into the complaints against administrative actions, including the
cases of corruption, favouritsm and official indiscipline in administration machinery, there was no
necessity for the State Government to constitute ACB parallel to the institution of Lokayukta, that
too when a person to be appointed as the Lokayukta shall be a person who has held the office of a
Judge of the Supreme Court or that of the Chief Justice of a High Court or a person who has held the
office of a Judge of a High Court for not less than ten years and a person to be appointed as an
Upa-Lokayukta shall be a person who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court for not less than
five years.
187. It is not the case of the State Government that ACB is a powerful independent body headed by
any former Supreme Court Judge, in order to curb corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline
in administration machinery, in addition to Lokayukta. If really the Government intends to curb
corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in administration machinery, the ACB should have
been allowed to work under the control of Lokayukta as contemplated under the provisions of
Section 15(3) of the KL Act instead of Hon'ble Chief Minister as stated in the executive order.
Therefore, there is more scope in the executive order for the political influence and the Hon'ble
Chief Minister in power can misuse ACB to control his opponents within his party or the opposite
parties. The conditions of the executive Government Order clearly depict that there is a possibility to
favour the party in power or the party men.
188. It is most unfortunate that even after lapse of 75 years of Independence, no political party in
the country is willing or dare enough to allow independent authority like the Lokayukta to discharge
its duties in a transparent manner in the interest of the general public at large. Very strangely, a
separate Anti Corruption Bureau is created with the following designations:
Sl. Designation of posts No. of posts
No.
6 Head Constables/Police Constables 200
(HC/PC)
189. In order to supervise the Vigilance System in the State, a Vigilance Advisory Board has been
created consisting of - 1 Chief Secretary President of Board 2 Addl. Chief Secretary, Internal Member
Administration 3 Principal Secretary, Department of Member Finance 3 Principal Secretary, DPAR
Member 4 D.G. & I.G.P. (who recommended to Member constitute ACB for the Government) 5 Two
eminent personalities experienced Member and experts in the field of Administration and Public
issues.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 82
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
6 Secretary, Vigilance Wing of DPAR Member Secretary
190. The ACB and the Vigilance Advisory Board are working under the direct administrative control
of the State Government and they cannot act independently as the "Final authority is the Hon'ble
Chief Minister". In fact the executive order dated 14.3.2016 clearly depicts that in case the Vigilance
Advisory Board based on sufficient prima facie reasons, decides to refer the investigation to be
conducted by an outside agency/organization, such matter after approval of the Chief Minister may
be handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D). Therefore, one cannot expect the
Vigilance Advisory Board functions independently, since even to refer the investigation to be
conducted by an outside agency/organization like C.I.D., approval of the Chief Minister must be
obtained.
191. Further, the State Government while withdrawing the statutory notifications dated 6.2.1991,
8.5.2002 and 5.12.2002 that had given the Lokayukta Police the powers to investigate under the
P.C. Act and had declared the offices of Police Inspectors of Karnataka Lokayukta as Police Stations
under the provisions of Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had not consulted the
Lokayukta. Without consultation of Lokayukta, statutory notifications cannot be withdrawn by the
executive order of the State Government. Absolutely no independent reasons are assigned by the
State Government in the executive order to constitute ACB parallel to the Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta, who are appointed under the provisions of the KL Act. The executive order dated
14.3.2016 depicts that the State Government after examining the recommendation made by the DG
& IG, keeping in perspective the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of C.
Rangaswamaiah, has created the ACB and classified the duties of the officers of the Karnataka Police
Wing into two categories. The same is an erroneous understanding of the dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court.
192. In the case of C. Rangaswamaiah38, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that "even after
deputation, there could be a "dual" role on the part of the police officers in their functions, namely,
functions under the Lokayukta and functions in discharge of the duties entrusted to them by the
State of Karnataka under the Supra at Foot No.1 Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988". The Hon'ble
Supreme Court further observed that "though the Director General of Police newly attached w.e.f
21.11.1992 to the Bureau of Investigation of the Lokayukta by way of an administrative order of the
Government was to be in control and supervision of the police staff in the Lokayukta and though the
said post of Director General of Police was not - by appropriate amendment of the recruitment rules
of the Lokayukta staff - included in the cadre of posts in the Police Wing of the Lokayukta - still it
had to be taken that the said Director General of Police was under the administrative and
disciplinary control of the Lokayukta". The Hon'ble Supreme Court also observed that "dual
functions could be performed by these officers in relation to two Acts, namely Prevention of
Corruption Act and the Lokayukta Act and such a situation of dual control could not be said to be
alien to criminal jurisprudence concerning investigation of crimes. In other words, these officers
who were of the requisite rank as per Section 17 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 could not
be said to be incompetent to investigate into offences assigned to them under that Act by the
competent authority by virtue of statutory powers under Section 17 thereof or to that extent not
excluded by the Lokayukta. The Division Bench, therefore, held that the further investigation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 83
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
against the petitioners could be continued through the Police Officers on deputation with the
Lokayukta". The Hon'ble Supreme Court further observed that "the entrustment being under
statutory powers of the State traceable to Section 17 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 the
same cannot be said to be outside the jurisdiction of the State Government. May be, if it is done
without consulting the Lokayukta and obtaining its consent, it can only be treated as an issue
between the State and the Lokayukta. Such entrustment of duties has statutory backing, and
obviously also the tacit approval of the Lokayukta." The Hon'ble Supreme Court further observed
that "having regard to the need to preserve its independence and effective functioning to take action
under Section 15(4) read with Section 15(2) and direct that these officers on deputation in its Police
Wing will not take up any such work entrusted to them by the State Government". The Hon'ble
Supreme Court further observed that "if instead of deputation of police officers from the
Government, any other solution can be found, that is a matter to be decided amicably between the
State Government and the Lokayukta, keeping in view the independence of the Lokayukta and its
effective functioning as matters of utmost importance".
193. In view of the above, the judgment in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah decided on 21.7.1998 will
no way assist the State Government to constitute separate ACB for the first time on 14.3.2016, after
lapse of nearly 18 years of the said judgment and the State Government erroneously interpreted the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the impugned order. On that ground also, the impugned
executive order cannot be sustained.
194. It is relevant to consider the provisions of Article 162 of the constitution of India, on which
basis the impugned executive order came to be issued, which reads as under:
"162. Extent of executive power of State.-- Subject to the provisions of this
Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect
to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws:
Provided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a State and
Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State shall be subject
to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferred by this Constitution or by
any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof."
195. A plain reading of Article 162 of the Constitution of India makes it clear that subject to the
provisions of the Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with
respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws, provided that in any matter
with respect to which the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to make laws, the
executive power of the State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly
conferred by the Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities
thereof. When statutory powers of the Lokayukta under the KL Act and the Rules thereof govern the
field for eradication of corruption, the executive order passed by the State Government is contrary to
the provisions of the KL Act and creation of ACB parallel to the institution of Lokayukta is bad in
law. Executive instructions can only fill the gaps not covered by rules and cannot be in derogation of
statutory rules. The executive power of the State can be exercised only on two occasions -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 84
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
a) if any law or Act have been made by the State Legislature conferring any functions or any other
authority, in that case the Governor is not empowered to make any order in regard to that matter in
exercise of the executive power nor can the Governor exercise such power in regard to that matter
through officers subordinate to him.
b) vesting the Governor with the executive power of the State Government does not create any
embargo for the Legislature of the State from making any and or enacting any law conferring
functions on any authority subordinate to the Governor.
196. In the present case, admittedly the KL Act has been in force from 15th January 1986 for the
purpose of improving the standards of public administration, by looking into complaints against
administrative actions, including cases of corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in
administration machinery, thereby the State Government has exceeded in power to issue executive
order by constituting ACB parallel to the institution of Lokayukta. The impugned executive order
issued by the State Government is to defunct the Lokayukta and it has virtually defeated the very
purpose for which the institution of Lokayukta has been constituted The impugned executive order
only created a parallel body to the institution of Lokayukta to achieve the same purpose with lesser
intent. Therefore, the Government Order constituting the ACB is unsustainable, suffers from
malafides and legal infirmities. The impugned executive order passed by the State Government has
indirectly diluted the powers of the Lokayukta and the ACB cannot function either as a parallel body
or an alternate body or substitute the Lokayukta. Therefore, the Government Order constituting the
ACB for a function already being conferred on the Lokayukta, is impermissible in law.
197. It is high time for the State Government to take necessary steps to ensure to reform the
Lokayukta and to amend the provisions of the K.L. Act and abolish the ACB and the
recommendation of the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta should be binding on the Government. It is for
the Government to take proper steps to reform at the stage of the recruitment itself While
appointing police force in the Karnataka Police Department.
198. After the enactment of KL Act, Lokayukta and Upa- Lokayukta, in exercise of their powers used
to register the criminal cases against the erring public servants prior to passing of the impugned
executive order. In fact, the term, 'public servant' is defined under the provisions of Section 2(12) of
the KL Act.

Ministers, BBMP Corporators etc., by the Lokayukta is as under:

Organizational structure in
sthe official website of
Nagaland Lokayukta
describes the head of police
wing as IGP and Director
and OC Nagaland
Lokayukta Police Station.
206. The material on record clearly depicts after creation of ACB w.e.f 14.3.2016, ACB
has not registered any criminal cases against the Ministers, MPs, MLAS or MLCs, but
only registered few cases against some authorities and conducted raids. No material
is produced by the Government or the ACB to prove that ACB is more powerful than
Lokayukta for the purpose of improving the standards of public administration, by
looking into complaints against administrative actions, including cases of corruption,
favouritism and official indiscipline in administration machinery.
Infact, creation of ACB is only to protect the vested interest and not to protect the interest of the
general public at large. It is high time for the State Government (any Government) or its authorities
to act as a trustee of the society and infact, in all facets of public administration, every public servant
has to exhibit honesty, integrity, sincerity and faithfulness in implementation of the political, social,
economic and constitutional policies to integrate the nation, to achieve excellence and efficiency in
the public administration. A public servant entrusted with duty and power to implement
constitutional policy under Articles 14, 21 and 300 of the Constitution of India and all inter-related
directive principles of state policy under the Constitution, should exhibit transparency in
implementation and of accountable for due effectuation of constitutional goals. Further, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 101
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
Government should allow the Lokayukta/Upa-Lokayukta to work independently without
intervention or undue influence from anybody so that citizen of the State can redress a grievance
before them "without fear or favour".
207. Even though, we got independence about 75 years ago by the struggle of our forefathers, who
fought for our freedom by pricing their blood, unfortunately, we are not in a position to eradicate
corruption till today since, no successive Governments have taken drastic steps in that direction.
Though the KL came into force w.e.f. 15th January 1986, it worked independently only till 14.3.2016,
the date on which the impugned executive order came to be passed.
208. Unfortunately, the institution of Lokayukta has been diluted by the executive order passed by
the State Government by creating ACB, thereby indirectly made the authority of Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta "paper tigers without any teeth and claws", which is impermissible. The legislative
intent behind the KL Act is to see that public servants covered by the sweep of the Act should be
answerable for their actions as such to the Lokayukta and Upa- Lokayukta and such authorities
should be armed with appropriate powers and sanctions so that their orders and opinions do not
become "mere paper directions". The decisions of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta, therefore, must be
capable of being fully implemented. These authorities should not be reduced to "mere paper tigers"
etc., Therefore, it is high time for the State Government to strengthen the institution of Lokayukta
and Upa- Lokayukta and get back its "glory".
209. "It is also relevant to state at this stage that the Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta are appointed
under the provisions of Section 3(2)(a) and 3(2)(b) of the KL Act on the advice tendered by the Chief
Minister in consultation with the several constitutional authorities. If the Government and
constitutional authorities are really interested in public welfare and interest in the development of
Karnataka, they should take conscious and unanimous decision to recommend persons with track
record of integrity and competence and fair both on the public and personal life, to the posts of
Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayuktas uninfluenced by caste, creed etc., and maintain transparency in the
appointment. The appointment should be non-political and the posts of Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayuktas should not be accommodation centre for anybody." The Government should allow
the authorities to work independently without fear or favour, for the purpose of improving the
standards of public administration, by looking into complaints against administrative actions,
including cases of corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in administration machinery. In
addition to the above, Administrative and Enquiry Wing, Technical Wing, Police Wing and General
Wing of the Lokayukta as contemplated under the first schedule of Rule 6(2) of the Karnataka
Lokayukta (C & R etc.) Rules, 1988 should also be strengthened by appointing honest persons.
210. It is high time for the Legislature and the judiciary to curb the "menace of corruption which is
very dangerous to the future generation than the disease of cancer and also it is a major obstacle to
the growth of India and in particular, the State of Karnataka." If a public servant, who is convicted
for corruption, is allowed to continue to hold public office, it would impair the morale of the other
persons manning such office, and consequently, that would erode the already shrunk confidence of
the people in such institutions besides demoralizing the other honest public servants, who would
either be the colleagues or subordinates of the convicted person. If honest public servants are

Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
compelled to take orders from proclaimed corrupt officers on account of the suspension of the
conviction, the fall out would be one of the shaking system itself.
211. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Section 389 (1) of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India and Section 13(2) of the PC Act in the
case of K.C. Sareen -vs- C.B.I. Chandigarh39, at paragraphs 11 and 12 has held as under:
"11. Corruption by public servants has now reached a monstrous dimension in India.
Its tentacles have started grappling even the institutions created for the protection of
the republic. Unless those tentacles are intercepted and impeded from gripping the
normal and orderly functioning of the public offices, through strong legislative,
executive as well as judicial exercises the corrupt public servants could even paralyse
the functioning of such institutions and thereby hinder the democratic polity.
Proliferation of corrupt public servants could garner momentum to cripple the social
order if such men are allowed to continue to manage and operate public institutions.
When a public servant is found guilty of corruption after a judicial adjudicatory
process conducted by a court of law, judiciousness demands that he should be treated
as corrupt until he is exonerated by a superior court. The mere fact that an 2001 AIR
SCW 3339 appellate or revisional forum has decided to entertain his challenge and to
go into the issues and findings made against such public servants once again should
not even temporarily absolve him from such findings. If such a public servant
becomes entitled to hold public office and to continue to do official acts until he is
judicially absolved from such findings by reason of suspension of the order of
conviction, it is public interest which suffers and sometimes, even irreparably. When
a public servant who is convicted of corruption is allowed to continue to hold public
office, it would impair the morale of the other persons manning such office, and
consequently that would erode the already shrunk confidence of the people in such
public institutions besides demoralising the other honest public servants who would
either be the colleagues or subordinates of the convicted person. If honest public
servants are compelled to take orders from proclaimed corrupt officers on account of
6 the suspension of the conviction, the fallout would be one of shaking the system
itself. Hence it is necessary that the court should not aid the public servant who
stands convicted for corruption charges to hold only (sic) public office until he is
exonerated after conducting a judicial adjudication at the appellate or revisional
level. It is a different matter if a corrupt public officer could continue to hold such
public office even without the help of a court order suspending the conviction.
12. The above policy can be acknowledged as necessary for the efficacy and proper
functioning of public offices. If so, the legal position can be laid down that when
conviction is on a corruption charge against a public servant the appellate court or
the revisional court should not suspend the order of conviction during the pendency
of the appeal even if the sentence of imprisonment is suspended. It would be a
sublime public policy that the convicted public servant is kept under disability of the
conviction in spite of keeping the sentence of imprisonment in abeyance till the

disposal of the appeal or revision."
(Underline supplied)
212. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Sections 19(1) and 22 of the PC
Act in the case of Subramanian Swamy -vs- Manmohan Singh40 has strongly condemned the
corruption in the Country as under:
"11. Today, corruption in our country not only poses a grave danger to the concept of
(2012) 3 SCC 64 constitutional governance, it also threatens the very foundation of
Indian democracy and the Rule of Law. The magnitude of corruption in our public
life is incompatible with the concept of a socialist, secular democratic republic. It
cannot be disputed that where corruption begins all rights end.
Corruption devalues human rights, chokes a development and undermines justice, liberty, equality,
fraternity which are the core values in our preambular vision. Therefore, the duty of the Court is that
any anti-corruption law has to be interpreted and worked out in such a fashion as to strengthen the
fight against corruption. That is to say in a situation where two constructions are eminently
reasonable, the Court has to accept the one that seeks to eradicate corruption to the one which seeks
to perpetuate it."
(Underline supplied)
213. It is also not in dispute that India is a Member of 'United Nations Convention Against
Corruption' where certain measures were adopted for preventing corruption. Corruption is an
insidious plague that has wide range of corrosive effects on societies. It undermines democracy and
the rule of law, leads to violations of human rights, distorts markets, erodes the quality of life and
allows organized crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish. Article 36 of
'United Nations Convention Against Corruption' relates to specialized authorities and the said
Article contemplates that each State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its
legal system, ensure the existence of a body or bodies or persons specialized in combating
corruption through law enforcement. Such body or bodies or persons shall be granted the necessary
independence, in accordance with the fundamental principles of the legal system of the State Party,
to be able to carry out their functions effectively and without any undue influence. Such persons or
staff of such body or bodies should have the appropriate training and resources to carry out their
tasks.
214. It is also relevant to state at this stage that the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 is enacted to
provide for the establishment of a body of Lokpal for the Union and Lokayukta for States to inquire
into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries and for matters connected
therewith or incidental thereto. Section 63 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 specifically
mandates that every State shall establish a body to be known as the Lokayukta for the State, if not so
established, constituted or appointed, by a law made by the State Legislature, to deal with
complaints relating to corruption against certain public functionaries, within a period of one year
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 104
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
from the date of commencement of this Act.
215. The object of PC Act is to consolidate and amend the law relating to prevention of corruption
and the matter connected thereto, thereby strengthening of the Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta is
inevitable and "it is high time to say goodbye to the ACB", to strengthen the institution of Lokayukta,
which is functioning under the provisions of the KL Act.
216. It is an undisputed fact that the Lokayukta as an institution has all the trappings of a police
station conferred on it by virtue of several provisions of K.L. Act and Rules framed thereunder.
Section 14 of the K.L. Act makes it clear that whenever sanction of the Competent Authority is
required for prosecution and if such action is required to be taken by the Lokayukta/Upalokayukta,
it is deemed to have been granted. When the power of investigation is conferred on the Lokayukta or
Upalokayukta and the Police Wing is attached to the institution of Lokayukta as per the statutory
provisions, it cannot be reasonably imagined that in the course of the investigation by them, even if
commission of an offence is detected either by the Lokayukta or by the Upalokayukta, it will not
have jurisdiction to deal with the matter and that they have to be only a helpless spectator to
condone the offences committed and stay their hands and that their power is limited only to initiate
disciplinary proceedings. The object of the legislation is to bring about transparency in the
administration and that could be brought about by initiating both criminal and disciplinary
proceedings. It cannot be contended that Lokayukta or Upalokayukta or the Police Wing have no
power to initiate criminal proceedings and conduct an investigation on that behalf. The power of
initiating prosecution includes all the incidental power that is required to complete the
investigation.
217. As already stated supra, the K.L. Act is a self contained code providing for investigation, filing of
complaint and all other incidental matters with the police attached to the Lokayukta institution by
virtue of statutory provisions. Thereby, when the K.L. Act is holding the field, it is not permissible
for the State in exercise of its executive power under Article 162 of the Constitution of India to
constitute ACB to nullify the power conferred on the Lokayukta as an institution under the K.L.Act.
218. Our view is fortified by the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of I.T.C.
Bhadrachalam Paperboards vs. Mandal Revenue Officer, AP41 , wherein it is held as under:
"Where the field is occupied by an enactment the executive has to act in accordance
therewith, particularly where the provisions are mandatory in nature. There is no
room for any administrative action or for doing the thing ordained by the statute
otherwise than in accordance therewith. Where, of course, the matter is not governed
by a law made by a competent Legislature, the executive can act in its executive
capacity since the executive power of the State extends to matters with respect to
which the Legislature of a State has the power to make laws"
(1996)6 SCC 634 Thereby, the very notification issued by the State Government dated 14.3.2016
constituting ACB, cannot be sustained.

Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
219. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Subramanian Swamy -vs- Director, Central Bureau of
Investigation and another42, at paragraphs 54, 57, 58, 59, 64, 69 and 70 has held as under:
"54. The Court then discussed the earlier decisions of this Court in J.A.C. Saldanha
[State of Bihar v. J.A.C. Saldanha, (1980) 1 SCC 554 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 272] and K.
Veeraswami [(1991) 3 SCC 655 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 734] and also the provisions of the
DSPE Act and held that : (Vineet Narain case [(1998) 1 SCC 226 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 307]
, SCC p. 262, para 42) Powers of investigation which are governed by the statutory
provisions and they cannot be curtailed by any executive instruction.
Having said that, this Court stated that the law did not classify offenders differently
for treatment thereunder, including investigation of offences and prosecution for
offences, according to their status in life. Every person (2014)8 SCC 682 accused of
committing the same offence is to be dealt with in the same manner in accordance
with law, which is equal in its application to everyone. The Single Directive is
applicable only to certain persons above the specified level who are described as
decision-making officers. Negativing that any distinction can be made for them for
the purpose of investigation of an offence of which they are accused, this Court in
paras 45 and 46 held as under : (Vineet Narain case [(1998) 1 SCC 226 : 1998 SCC
(Cri) 307] , SCC p. 263) "45. Obviously, where the accusation of corruption is based
on direct evidence and it does not require any inference to be drawn dependent on
the decision-making process, there is no rational basis to classify them differently. In
other words, if the accusation be of bribery which is supported by direct evidence of
acceptance of illegal gratification by them, including trap cases, it is obvious that no
other factor is relevant and the level or status of the offender is irrelevant. It is for
this reason that it was conceded that such cases i.e. of bribery, including trap cases,
are outside the scope of the Single Directive. After some debate at the Bar, no serious
attempt was made by the learned Attorney General to support inclusion within the
Single Directive of cases in which the offender is alleged to be in possession of
disproportionate assets. It is clear that the accusation of possession of
disproportionate assets by a person is also based on direct evidence and no factor
pertaining to the expertise of decision making is involved therein. We have, therefore,
no doubt that the Single Directive cannot include within its ambit cases of possession
of disproportionate assets by the offender. The question now is only with regard to
cases other than those of bribery, including trap cases, and of possession of
disproportionate assets being covered by the Single Directive.
46. There may be other cases where the accusation cannot be supported by direct
evidence and is a matter of inference of corrupt motive for the decision, with nothing
to prove directly any illegal gain to the decision-
maker. Those are cases in which the inference drawn is that the decision must have been made for a
corrupt motive because the decision could not have been reached otherwise by an officer at that
level in the hierarchy. This is, therefore, an area where the opinion of persons with requisite
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 106
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
expertise in decision making of that kind is relevant and, may be even decisive in reaching the
conclusion whether the allegation requires any investigation to be made. In view of the fact that CBI
or the police force does not have the expertise within its fold for the formation of the requisite
opinion in such cases, the need for the inclusion of such a mechanism comprising of experts in the
field as a part of the infrastructure of CBI is obvious, to decide whether the accusation made
discloses grounds for a reasonable suspicion of the commission of an offence and it requires
investigation. In the absence of any such mechanism within the infrastructure of CBI, comprising of
experts in the field who can evaluate the material for the decision to be made, introduction therein
of a body of experts having expertise of the kind of business which requires the decision to be made,
can be appreciated. But then, the final opinion is to be of CBI with the aid of that advice and not that
of anyone else. It would be more appropriate to have such a body within the infrastructure of CBI
itself."
57. Can classification be made creating a class of the government officers of the level of Joint
Secretary and above level and certain officials in public sector undertakings for the purpose of
inquiry/investigation into an offence alleged to have been committed under the PC Act, 1988? Or, to
put it differently, can classification be made on the basis of the status/position of the public servant
for the purpose of inquiry/investigation into the allegation of graft which amounts to an offence
under the PC Act, 1988? Can the legislature lay down different principles for investigation/inquiry
into the allegations of corruption for the public servants who hold a particular position? Is such
classification founded on sound differentia? To answer these questions, we should eschew the
doctrinaire approach. Rather, we should test the validity of the impugned classification by broad
considerations having regard to the legislative policy relating to prevention of corruption enacted in
the PC Act, 1988 and the powers of inquiry/investigation under the DSPE Act.
58. The Constitution permits the State to determine, by the process of classification, what should be
regarded as a class for purposes of legislation and in relation to law enacted on a particular subject.
There is bound to be some degree of inequality when there is segregation of one class from the other.
However, such segregation must be rational and not artificial or evasive. In other words, the
classification must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics, which are to be found in
all persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics
must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. Differentia which is the basis of
classification must be sound and must have reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. If the
object itself is discriminatory, then explanation that classification is reasonable having rational
relation to the object sought to be achieved is immaterial.
59. It seems to us that classification which is made in Section 6-A on the basis of status in
government service is not permissible under Article 14 as it defeats the purpose of finding prima
facie truth into the allegations of graft, which amount to an offence under the PC Act, 1988. Can
there be sound differentiation between corrupt public servants based on their status? Surely not,
because irrespective of their status or position, corrupt public servants are corrupters of public
power. The corrupt public servants, whether high or low, are birds of the same feather and must be
confronted with the process of investigation and inquiry equally. Based on the position or status in
service, no distinction can be made between public servants against whom there are allegations
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 107
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
amounting to an offence under the PC Act, 1988.
64. As a matter of fact, the justification for Section 6-A which has been put forth before us on behalf
of the Central Government was the justification for Single Directive 4.7(3)(i) in Vineet Narain
[(1998) 1 SCC 226 :
1998 SCC (Cri) 307] as well. However, the Court was unable to persuade itself with
the same. In Vineet Narain [(1998) 1 SCC 226 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 307] in respect of
Single Directive 4.7(3)(i), the Court said that : (SCC pp. 262-63, para 44) "44. ...
Every person accused of committing the same offence is to be dealt with in the same
manner in accordance with law, which is equal in its application to everyone."
We are in agreement with the above observation in Vineet Narain [(1998) 1 SCC 226 : 1998 SCC
(Cri) 307] , which, in our opinion, equally applies to Section 6-A. In Vineet Narain [(1998) 1 SCC 226
: 1998 SCC (Cri) 307] , this Court did not accept the argument that the Single Directive is applicable
only to certain class of officers above the specified level who are decision- making officers and a
distinction can be made for them for the purpose of investigation of an offence of which they are
accused. We are also clearly of the view that no distinction can be made for certain class of officers
specified in Section 6-A who are described as decision- making officers for the purpose of
inquiry/investigation into an offence under the PC Act, 1988. There is no rational basis to classify
the two sets of public servants differently on the ground that one set of officers is decision-making
officers and not the other set of officers. If there is an accusation of bribery, graft, illegal gratification
or criminal misconduct against a public servant, then we fail to understand as to how the status of
offender is of any relevance. Where there are allegations against a public servant which amount to
an offence under the PC Act, 1988, no factor pertaining to expertise of decision making is involved.
Yet, Section 6- A makes a distinction. It is this vice which renders Section 6-A violative of Article 14.
Moreover, the result of the impugned legislation is that the very group of persons, namely,
high-ranking bureaucrats whose misdeeds and illegalities may have to be inquired into, would
decide whether CBI should even start an inquiry or investigation against them or not. There will be
no confidentiality and insulation of the investigating agency from political and bureaucratic control
and influence because the approval is to be taken from the Central Government which would involve
leaks and disclosures at every stage.
69. The signature tune in Vineet Narain [(1998) 1 SCC 226 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 307] is, "However high
you may be, the law is above you." We reiterate the same. Section 6-A offends this signature tune
and effectively Article 14.
70. Undoubtedly, every differentiation is not a discrimination but at the same time, differentiation
must be founded on pertinent and real differences as distinguished from irrelevant and artificial
ones. A simple physical grouping which separates one category from the other without any rational
basis is not a sound or intelligible differentia. The separation or segregation must have a systematic
relation and rational basis and the object of such segregation must not be discriminatory. Every
public servant against whom there is reasonable suspicion of commission of crime or there are
allegations of an offence under the PC Act, 1988 has to be treated equally and similarly under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 108
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
law. Any distinction made between them on the basis of their status or position in service for the
purposes of inquiry/investigation is nothing but an artificial one and offends Article 14."
220. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of section 3(2)(a) and (b) of the
KL Act in the case of Justice Chandrashekaraiah .vs. Janekere C. Krishna and others43, at
paragraphs 36, 37, 106, 107 and 112 has held as under:
"36. The Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta under the Act are established to investigate
and report on allegations or grievances relating to the conduct of public servants
which includes the Chief Minister; all other Ministers and Members of the State
Legislature; all officers of the State Government; Chairman, Vice-Chairman of local
authorities, corporations, owned or controlled by the State Government, a company
in which not less than fifty-one per cent of the shares are held by the State
Government, societies registered under the Societies Registration Act, cooperative
societies and universities established by or under any law of the legislature.
(2013)3 SCC 117
37. The Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta while exercising powers under the Act, of
course, is acting as a quasi-
judicial authority but his functions are investigative in nature. The Constitution Bench of this Court
in Nagendra Nath Bora v. Commr. of Hills Division and Appeals [AIR 1958 SC 398] held : (AIR p.
408, para 14) "14. ... Whether or not an administrative body or authority functions as a purely
administrative one or in a quasi-judicial capacity, must be determined in each case, on an
examination of the relevant statute and the rules framed thereunder."
106. The conditions of service of the staff of the Upa- Lokayukta are referred to in Section 15 of the
Act. They may be prescribed in consultation with the Lokayukta in such a manner that the staff may
act without fear in the discharge of their functions. Section 15 of the Act also enables the
Upa-Lokayukta to utilise the services of any officer or investigating agency of the State or even of the
Central Government, though with the prior concurrence of the Central Government or the State
Government. Section 15(4) of the Act makes it clear that the officers and other employees of the
Upa- Lokayukta are under the administrative and disciplinary control of the Lokayukta.
107. The broad spectrum of functions, powers, duties and responsibilities of the Upa-Lokayukta, as
statutorily prescribed, clearly bring out that not only does he perform quasi-judicial functions, as
contrasted with purely administrative or executive functions, but that the Upa-Lokayukta is more
than an investigator or an enquiry officer. At the same time, notwithstanding his status, he is not
placed on the pedestal of a judicial authority rendering a binding decision. He is placed somewhere
in between an investigator and a judicial authority, having the elements of both. For want of a better
expression, the office of an Upa-Lokayukta can only be described as a sui generis quasi-judicial
authority.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 109
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
112. As mentioned above, an Upa-Lokayukta does function as an adjudicating authority but the Act
places him short of a judicial authority. He is much more "judicial" than an investigator or an
inquisitorial authority largely exercising administrative or executive functions and powers. Under
the circumstances, taking an overall view of the provisions of the Act and the law laid down, my
conclusion is that the Upa-Lokayukta is a quasi-judicial authority or in any event an authority
exercising functions, powers, duties and responsibilities conferred by the Act as a sui generis
quasi-judicial authority."
221. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Articles 14, 21, 32, 141, 142 and
144 of the Constitution of India in the case of Vineet Narain and others - vs- Union of India and
others44, at paragraphs 38 39 40, 41, 42 and 43 has held as under:
"38. Section 3 of the Police Act, 1861 is in pari materia with Section 4 of the Delhi
Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. These sections read as under:
Section 3 of the Police Act, 1861:
"3. Superintendence in the State Government.--The superintendence of the police
throughout a general police district shall vest in and shall be exercised by the State
Government to which such district is subordinate, and except as authorised under the
provisions of this Act, no person, officer or court shall be empowered by the State
(1998)1 SCC 226 Government to supersede or control any police functionary."
Sections 3 and 4 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946:
"3. Offences to be investigated by SPE.--The Central Government may, by notification
in the Official Gazette, specify the offences or classes of offences which are to be
investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment.
4. Superintendence and administration of SPE.--(1) The superintendence of the Delhi
Special Police Establishment shall vest in the Central Government.
(2) The administration of the said police establishment shall vest in an officer
appointed in this behalf by the Central Government who shall exercise in respect of
that police establishment such of the powers exercisable by an Inspector General of
Police in respect of the police force in a State, as the Central Government may specify
in this behalf."
The meaning of the word "superintendence" in Section 4(1) of the Delhi Special Police Act, 1946
determines the scope of the authority of the Central Government in this context.
39. There can be no doubt that the overall administration of the said force, i.e., CBI vests in the
Central Government, which also includes, by virtue of Section 3, the power to specify the offences or
class of offences which are to be investigated by it. The general superintendence over the functioning
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 110
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
of the Department and specification of the offences which are to be investigated by the agency is not
the same as and would not include within it the control of the initiation and the actual process of
investigation, i.e., direction. Once the CBI is empowered to investigate an offence generally by its
specification under Section 3, the process of investigation, including its initiation, is to be governed
by the statutory provisions which provide for the initiation and manner of investigation of the
offence. This is not an area which can be included within the meaning of "superintendence" in
Section 4(1).
40. It is, therefore, the notification made by the Central Government under Section 3 which confers
and determines the jurisdiction of the CBI to investigate an offence; and once that jurisdiction is
attracted by virtue of the notification under Section 3, the actual investigation is to be governed by
the statutory provisions under the general law applicable to such investigations. This appears to us
the proper construction of Section 4(1) in the context, and it is in harmony with the scheme of the
Act, and Section 3 in particular. The word "superintendence" in Section 4(1) cannot be construed in
a wider sense to permit supervision of the actual investigation of an offence by the CBI contrary to
the manner provided by the statutory provisions. The broad proposition urged on behalf of the
Union of India that it can issue any directive to the CBI to curtail or inhibit its jurisdiction to
investigate an offence specified in the notification issued under Section 3 by a directive under
Section 4(1) of the Act cannot be accepted. The jurisdiction of the CBI to investigate an offence is to
be determined with reference to the notification issued under Section 3 and not by any separate
order not having that character.
41. This view does not conflict with the decision in J.A.C. Saldanha [(1980) 1 SCC 554 : 1980 SCC
(Cri) 272] as earlier indicated. In Saldanha [(1980) 1 SCC 554 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 272] the question
was whether an unsatisfactory investigation already made could be undertaken by another officer
for further investigation of the offence so that the offence was properly investigated as required by
law, and it was not to prevent the investigation of an offence. The Single Directive has the effect of
restraining recording of FIR and initiation of investigation and not of proceeding with investigation,
as in Saldanha [(1980) 1 SCC 554 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 272] . No authority to permit control of statutory
powers exercised by the police to investigate an offence within its jurisdiction has been cited before
us except K. Veeraswami [(1991) 3 SCC 655 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 734] which we have already
distinguished. The view we take accords not only with reason but also with the very purpose of the
law and is in consonance with the basic tenet of the rule of law.
42. Once the jurisdiction is conferred on the CBI to investigate an offence by virtue of notification
under Section 3 of the Act, the powers of investigation are governed by the statutory provisions and
they cannot be estopped or curtailed by any executive instruction issued under Section 4(1) thereof.
This result follows from the fact that conferment of jurisdiction is under Section 3 of the Act and
exercise of powers of investigation is by virtue of the statutory provisions governing investigation of
offences. It is settled that statutory jurisdiction cannot be subject to executive control.
43. There is no similarity between a mere executive order requiring prior permission or sanction for
investigation of the offence and the sanction needed under the statute for prosecution. The
requirement of sanction for prosecution being provided in the very statute which enacts the offence,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 111
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
the sanction for prosecution is a prerequisite for the court to take cognizance of the offence. In the
absence of any statutory requirement of prior permission or sanction for investigation, it cannot be
imposed as a condition precedent for initiation of the investigation once jurisdiction is conferred on
the CBI to investigate the offence by virtue of the notification under Section 3 of the Act. The word
"superintendence" in Section 4(1) of the Act in the context must be construed in a manner consistent
with the other provisions of the Act and the general statutory powers of investigation which govern
investigation even by the CBI. The necessity of previous sanction for prosecution is provided in
Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Section 19 of the 1988 Act) without which no
court can take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 5 of that Act. There is no such
previous sanction for investigation provided for either in the Prevention of Corruption Act or the
Delhi Special Police Establishment Act or in any other statutory provision. The above is the only
manner in which Section 4(1) of the Act can be harmonised with Section 3 and the other statutory
provisions.
222. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Section 3 of the Gujarath
Lokayukta Act with regard to public accountability, vigilance and prevention of corruption, in the
case of State of Gujarat and another -vs- Justice R.A. Mehta (Retired) and others45, at paragraphs
85 to 89 has held as under;
"85. Without reference to any constitutional provision or any judgment of this Court
referred to earlier, even if we examine the statutory provisions of the Act, the
statutory construction itself mandates the primacy of the opinion of the Chief Justice
for the simple reason that Section 3 provides for the consultation with the Chief
Justice. Section 6 provides for the removal of Lokayukta and lays down the procedure
for such removal. The same can be done only on proven misconduct in an inquiry
conducted by the Chief Justice/his nominee with respect to specific charges. Section
8(3) further provides for recusal of the Lokayukta in a matter where a public
functionary has (2013) 3 SCC 1 raised the objection of bias and whether such
apprehension of bias actually exists or not shall be determined in accordance with the
opinion of the Chief Justice.
86. The purpose of giving primacy of opinion to the Chief Justice is for the reason
that he enjoys an independent constitutional status, and also because the person
eligible to be appointed as Lokayukta is from among the retired Judges of the High
Court and the Chief Justice is, therefore, the best person to judge their suitability for
the post. While considering the statutory provisions, the Court has to keep in mind
the Statement of Objects and Reasons published in the Gujarat Gazette
(Extraordinary) dated 1-8-1986, as here, it is revealed that the purpose of the Act is
also to provide for the manner of removal of a person from the office of the
Lokayukta and the Bill ensured that the grounds for such removal are similar to those
specified for the removal of the Judges of the High Court.
87. As the Chief Justice has primacy of opinion in the said matter, the
non-acceptance of such recommendations by the Chief Minister remains
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 112
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
insignificant. Thus, it clearly emerges that the Governor, under Section 3 of the 1986
Act has acted upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.
Such a view is taken considering the fact that Section 3 of the 1986 Act does not envisage unanimity
in the consultative process.
88. Leaving the finality of choice of appointment to the Council of Ministers would be akin to
allowing a person who is likely to be investigated to choose his own judge. Additionally, a person
possessing limited power cannot be permitted to exercise unlimited powers.
89. However, in light of the facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be held that the process of
consultation was incomplete and was not concluded as per the requirements of the 1986 Act."
223. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay -vs- Union of India46, in
respect of State of Tamil Nadu, has observed as under:
"This Court by its judgment/order dated 27th April, 2017 passed in Writ Petition
(Civil) No.245 of 2014 [Common Cause: A Registered Society vs. Union of India
reported in (2017)7 SCC 158 had already expressed the view that the appointment of
Lokpal at Writ Petition (Civil) No.684/2016 decided on 19.4.2018 the Center need
not await the finalization of the Amendment to the Central Act. In such
circumstances, we are constrained to observe that the stand taken by the State of
Tamil Nadu with regard to establishment of the institution of Lokayukta on the
grounds stated in the affidavit is not acceptable. As the State is duty bound under
Section 63 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 to bring in place the institution of
Lokayukta we direct the State to take necessary action in the matter and report
compliance of the progress made and the stage reached on the next date fixed i.e.
10th July, 2018."
224. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Section 15 of the KL Act and
Section 17 of the PC Act in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah and others -vs- Karnataka Lokayukta and
others47, at paragraphs 19, 20, 25, 26, 27 and 28 has held as under:
"19. We may first deal with the crucial question as to whether the Director General of
Police in the office of the Lokayukta who is to supervise the work of the police officers
on deputation in the Lokayukta is independent Supra at Footnote No.1 of the
Lokayukta and is outside the administrative and disciplinary control of the
Lokayukta. We agree with the Division Bench when it took the view, -- differing from
the learned Single Judge, -- that though the newly- created post of Director General
of Police in the office of the Lokayukta was created on 21-12-1992 by an
administrative order and the relevant recruitment rules of the staff of the Lokayukta
were not amended to bring the said post into the cadre under the Lokayukta, still the
said post created in the Lokayukta Police Wing was intended to be and must be
treated as part of the staff of Lokayukta in the Police Wing. It is well settled that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 113
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
administrative orders even creating posts can be issued so long as they are not
inconsistent with rules, that is to say, as long as there is no prohibition in the
statutory rules for creation of such posts. The learned Single Judge's view that the
independence of the Lokayukta was under threat was mainly based upon his decision
that the post of the Director General created on 21-12- 1992 was outside the control of
the Lokayukta. This view, in our opinion, is not correct for the reasons mentioned
above.
Therefore, while it is true that as per the notification dated 21-11-1992 issued by the
Government, the Police Wing in the Lokayukta is to be under the general and overall
control of the said Director General of Police, still, in our opinion, the said staff and,
for that matter, the Director General himself are under the administrative and
disciplinary control of the Lokayukta. This result even if it is not achieved by the
express language of Section 15(4) is achieved by the very fact that the Director
General's post is created in the office of the Lokayukta. By creating the said post of
Director General of Police in the office of the Lokayukta and keeping the Police Wing
therein under control and supervision of the said Director General, the State of
Karnataka, in our opinion, did not intend to remove the Police Wing or the said
Director General from the administrative and disciplinary jurisdiction of the
Lokayukta nor did the State intend to interfere with the independent functioning of
the Lokayukta and its police staff. The modification of the earlier notification dated
2-11-1992 was, in our opinion, necessitated on account of the creation of the post of
the Director General in the office of the Lokayukta. Nor was the notification intended
to divest the Lokayukta of its powers and to vest the said powers only in the Director
General. For the aforesaid reasons, the memorandum dated 2-9- 1997 issued by the
Lokayukta after the judgment of the learned Single Judge has become redundant as
held by the Division Bench. Thus the main argument relating to the threat to the
independence of the Lokayukta which appealed to the learned Single Judge stands
rejected.
Point 2
20. The next question is whether when the State Government had sent the police
officers on deputation to the Lokayukta, it was permissible for the Government to
entrust them with additional duties under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988?
25. In our view, if the State Government wants to entrust such extra work to the
officers on deputation with the Lokayukta, it can certainly inform the Lokayukta of its
desire to do so. If the Lokayukta agrees to such entrustment, there will be no
problem. But if for good reasons the Lokayukta thinks that such entrustment of work
by the State Government is likely to affect its functioning or is likely to affect its
independence, it can certainly inform the State Government accordingly. In case the
State Government does not accept the viewpoint of the Lokayukta, then it will be
open to the Lokayukta, -- having regard to the need to preserve its independence and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 114
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
effective functioning to take action under Section 15(4) [read with Section 15(2)] and
direct that these officers on deputation in its Police Wing will not take up any such
work entrusted to them by the State Government. Of course, it is expected that the
State Government and the Lokayukta will avoid any such unpleasant situations but
will act reasonably in their respective spheres.
26. But once the Lokayukta has, as in the present case, not objected, -- at the
threshold -- to such entrustment of work by the State Government to the officers on
deputation, then it will not normally be reasonable for the Lokayukta to object to the
said entrustment when these officers are halfway through the extra work. Such
withdrawal by the Lokayukta at a later stage might create various administrative
problems and will only help the public servants against whom investigation is being
done to raise unnecessary legal issues. Of course, in the present case, it is not the
Lokayukta which has raised any objection but it is the public servants -- against
whom the investigation is going on -- who have raised objections. As already stated,
they cannot raise objections if the Lokayukta has not raised any objection at the
threshold. The above, in our view, will take care of the independence and effective
working of the Lokayukta and at the same time, will enable the State of Karnataka if
need be, to exercise its statutory powers under Section 17 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988.
27. In the matters before us, as already stated, there has been no objection by the
Lokayukta at the initial stage of the entrustment of work under Section 17 of the
Central Act to these police officers on deputation. It is therefore not possible to
interdict the further investigation by these officers at this stage at the instance of the
public servants. As stated above, if no objection has come from the Lokayukta at the
time of initial entrustment, it is certainly not permissible for the public servants
against whom the investigation is being done, to raise objection. The Division Bench
was right in holding that the memorandum dated 2-9-1997 issued by the Lokayukta
is, in fact, purely consequential to the judgment of the learned Single Judge and in
declaring the same to be invalid and also redundant.
28. We may, however, add that if instead of deputation of police officers from the
Government, any other solution can be found, that is a matter to be decided amicably
between the State Government and the Lokayukta, -- keeping in view the
independence of the Lokayukta and its effective functioning as matters of utmost
importance."
225. The Hon'ble Suprme Court while considering the provisions of Section 3(3) and Section 8A(2)
of the Commissions of Inquiry Act and Section 21 of the General Clauses Act in the case of State of
M.P. -vs- Ajay Singh and others48, at paragraph-17 held as under:
"17. The Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 was enacted to provide for the
appointment of Commissions of Inquiry and for vesting such commissions with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 115
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
certain powers. Section 2 of the Act contains definitions. Section 3 provides for
appointment of a Commission of Inquiry. Sub-section (1) of Section 3 lays down that
a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into any "definite
matter of public importance"
may be appointed by the appropriate Government if it is of opinion that it is necessary so to do and
shall make such an appointment if a resolution in this behalf is passed by each House of Parliament
or, as the case may be, the Legislature of the State, by notification in the official Gazette. Sub-section
(2) of Section 3 says that the Commission may consist of one or more members appointed by the
appropriate Government, and where the number is more than one, one of them may be appointed as
the Chairman. Sub-section (3) of Section 3 enables the appropriate Government to fill any vacancy
which may arise in the office of a member (1993)1 SCC 302: AIR 1993 SC 825 of the Commission
whether consisting of one or more than one member, at any stage of an inquiry. Sub- section (4) of
Section 3 requires the appropriate Government to cause to be laid before each House of Parliament
or, as the case may be, the legislature of the State, the report, if any, of the Commission of Inquiry
together with a memorandum of the action taken thereon, within a period of six months from the
submission of the report by the Commission to the appropriate Government. Section 4 prescribes
that the Commission shall have the powers of a civil court while trying a suit under the Code of Civil
Procedure in respect of the matters mentioned therein. Section 5 deals with the additional powers of
the Commission. Section 5-A relates to the power of the Commission for conducting investigation
pertaining to ∼ inquiry. Section 5-B deals with the power of the Commission to appoint assessors.
Section 6 provides for the manner of use of the statements made by persons to the Commission.
Section 6-A provides that some persons are not obliged to disclose certain facts. Section 7 deals with
the manner in which a Commission of Inquiry appointed under Section 3 ceases to exist in case its
continuance is unnecessary. It provides for a notification in the official Gazette by the appropriate
Government specifying the date from which the Commission shall cease to exist if it is of the opinion
that the continued existence of the Commission is unnecessary. Where a Commission is appointed
in pursuance of a resolution passed by the Parliament or, as the case may be, the Legislature of the
State, then a resolution for the discontinuance of the Commission is also to be passed by it. Section
8-A provides that the inquiry is not to be interrupted by reason of vacancy or change in the
constitution of the Commission and it shall not be necessary for the Commission to commence the
inquiry afresh and the inquiry may be continued from the stage at which the change took place.
Section 8-B prescribes that persons likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry must be heard.
Section 8-C deals with the right of cross-examination and representation by legal practitioner of the
appropriate Government, every person referred to in Section 8-B and, with the permission of the
Commission, any other person whose evidence is recorded by the Commission. Sections 9, 10 and
10-A relate to ancillary matters while Section 12 contains the rule-making power of the appropriate
Government. Section 11 provides that the Act is to apply to other inquiring authorities in certain
cases and where the Government directs that the said provisions of this Act shall apply to that
authority and issues such a notification, that authority shall be deemed to be a Commission
appointed under Section 3 for the purposes of this Act. Admittedly, it is by virtue of Section 11 that
the Commission of Inquiry appointed in the present case is deemed to be a Commission appointed
under Section 3 for the purposes of this Act because the Commission was constituted by a resolution
of the Government pursuant to the direction of the M.P. High Court in the writ petition filed in

public interest by Kailash Joshi as indicated earlier. For the purposes of this case, the material
provisions of the enactment are Sections 3, 7 and 8-A apart from Section 21 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897 with reference to which the rival contentions were made. These provisions are as under:
The Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 "3. Appointment of Commission.-- (1) The
appropriate Government may, if it is of opinion that it is necessary so to do, and shall,
if a resolution in this behalf is passed by each House of Parliament or, as the case may
be, the Legislature of the State, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint a
Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into any definite matter
of public importance and performing such functions and within such time as may be
specified in the notification, and the Commission so appointed shall make the inquiry
and perform the functions accordingly:
Provided that where any such Commission has been appointed to inquire into any
matter--
(a) by the Central Government, no State Government shall, except with the approval
of the Central Government, appoint another Commission to inquire into the same
matter for so long as the Commission appointed by the Central Government is
functioning;
(b) by a State Government, the Central
Government shall not appoint another
Commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the Commission appointed
by the State Government is functioning, unless the Central Government is of opinion
that the scope of the inquiry should be extended to two or more States.
(2) The Commission may consist of one or more members appointed by the
appropriate Government, and where the Commission consists of more than one
member, one of them may be appointed as the Chairman thereof.
(3) The appropriate Government may, at any stage of an inquiry by the Commission
fill any vacancy which may have arisen in the office of a member of the Commission
(whether consisting of one or more than one member).
(4) The appropriate Government shall cause to be laid before each House of
Parliament or, as the case may be, the Legislature of the State, the report, if any, of
the Commission on the inquiry made by the Commission under sub-section (1)
together with a memorandum of the action taken thereon, within a period of six
months of the submission of the report by the Commission to the appropriate
Government.
7. Commission to cease to exist when so notified.-- (1) The appropriate Government may, by
notification in the Official Gazette, declare that--
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 117
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
(a) a Commission (other than a Commission appointed in pursuance of a resolution passed by each
House of Parliament or, as the case may be, the Legislature of the State) shall cease to exist, if it is of
opinion that the continued existence of the Commission is unnecessary;
(b) a Commission appointed in pursuance of a resolution passed by each House of Parliament or, as
the case may be, the Legislature of the State, shall cease to exist if a resolution for the
discontinuance of the Commission is passed by each House of Parliament or, as the case may be, the
Legislature of the State.
(2) Every notification issued under sub-section (1) shall specify the date from which the Commission
shall cease to exist and on the issue of such notification, the Commission shall cease to exist with
effect from the date specified therein.
8-A. Inquiry not to be interrupted by reason of vacancy or change in the constitution of the
Commission.-- (1) Where the Commission consists of two or more members, it may act
notwithstanding the absence of the Chairman or any other member of any vacancy among its
members.
(2) Where during the course of an inquiry before a Commission, a change has taken place in the
constitution of the Commission by reason of any vacancy having been filled or by any other reason,
it shall not be necessary for the Commission to commence the inquiry afresh and the inquiry may be
continued from the stage at which the change took place." The General Clauses Act, 1897 "21. Power
to issue, to include power to add to, amend, vary or rescind, notifications, orders, rules or
bye-laws.-- Where, by any Central Act or Regulation, a power to issue notifications, orders, rules or
bye-laws is conferred, then that power includes a power, exercisable in the like manner and subject
to the like sanction and conditions (if any) to add to, amend, vary or rescind any notifications,
orders, rule or bye-laws so issued."
226. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Section 3(1)(a), 7 and 2(h) of
the Orissa Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 1995 in the case of Justice K.P. Mohapatra -vs- Sri ram
Chandra Nayak and others49, at paragraphs 11 and 12 has held as under:
(2002)8 SCC 1 "11. Further, Section 4(1) inter alia provides that Lokpal or Lokayukta
should not be connected with any political party. In any case, if he is connected, he is
required to sever the connection on being appointed to the said post. That means, he
must be an independent non-political person. Under Section 7, Lokpal has inter alia
to investigate any action which is taken by or with a general or specific approval of
the Chief Minister or a Minister or a Secretary, in a case where a complaint involving
a grievance or an allegation is made in respect of such action or such action can be or
could have been, in the opinion of the Lokpal, the subject of a grievance or an
allegation. The word "Minister" is defined under Section 2(i) to mean a member of
the Council of Ministers and includes the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister, a
Minister of State, a Deputy Minister and the Leader of the Opposition or a
Parliamentary Secretary.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 118
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
12. In context of the aforesaid functions of the Lokpal and the required qualification
of a person who is to be appointed to hold such office, the word "consultation"
used in Section 3 is required to be interpreted. As provided under Section 3, a person is not qualified
to be appointed as Lokpal unless he is or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court.
In the context of the functions which are to be discharged by the Lokpal, it is apparent that they are
of utmost importance in seeing that unpolluted administration of the State is maintained and
maladministration as defined under Section 2(h) is exposed so that appropriate action against such
maladministration and administrator could be taken. The investigation which Lokpal is required to
carry out is that of quasi-judicial nature which would envisage not only knowledge of law, but also of
the nature and work which is required to be discharged by an administrator. In this context, the
word "consultation" used in Section 3(1) proviso (a) would require that consultation with the Chief
Justice of the High Court of Orissa is a must or a sine qua non. For such appointment, the Chief
Justice of the High Court would be the best person for proposing and suggesting such person for
being appointed as Lokpal. His opinion would be totally independent and he would be in a position
to find out who is most or more suitable for the said office. In this context, primacy is required to be
given to the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court. It is true that proviso (a) provides that
Leader of the Opposition, if there is any, is also required to be consulted. Therefore, if there is no
Leader of the Opposition, consultation is not required. This would indicate the nature of such
consultation and which is to apprise him of the proposed action but his opinion is not binding on the
Government. At the same time, his views or objections are to be taken into consideration. If
something is adverse against the person proposed by the Government, he would be entitled to
express his views and point it out to the Government. This, however, would not mean that he could
suggest some other name and the Government is required to consider it. It would, therefore, be open
to the Government to override the opinion given by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the
appointment of a Lokpal who is statutorily required to be a sitting or retired Judge of the Supreme
Court or of a High Court. Under Section 3(1) of the Act, there is no question of initiation of proposal
by the Leader of the Opposition."
(Underline supplied)
227. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering with regard to Police reforms and measures to
insulate Police machinery from political/executive interference, in the case of Prakash Singh and
others -vs- Union of India and others50, at paragraphs 19, 22, 26 and 29 has held as under:
(2006)8 SCC 1 "19. In the above noted letter dated 3-8-1997 sent to all the State
Governments, the Home Minister while echoing the overall popular perception that
there has been a general fall in the performance of the police as also a deterioration in
the policing system as a whole in the country, expressed that time had come to rise
above limited perceptions to bring about some drastic changes in the shape of
reforms and restructuring of the police before the country is overtaken by unhealthy
developments. It was expressed that the popular perception all over the country
appears to be that many of the deficiencies in the functioning of the police had arisen
largely due to an overdose of unhealthy and petty political interference at various
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 119
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
levels starting from transfer and posting of policemen of different ranks, misuse of
police for partisan purposes and political patronage quite often extended to corrupt
police personnel. The Union Home Minister expressed the view that rising above
narrow and partisan considerations, it is of great national importance to insulate the
police from the growing tendency of partisan or political interference in the discharge
of its lawful functions of prevention and control of crime including investigation of
cases and maintenance of public order.
22. For separation of investigation work from law and order even the Law Commission of India in
its 154th Report had recommended such separation to ensure speedier investigation, better
expertise and improved rapport with the people without of course any watertight
compartmentalisation in view of both functions being closely interrelated at the ground level.
26. Having regard to (i) the gravity of the problem; (ii) the urgent need for preservation and
strengthening of the rule of law; (iii) pendency of even this petition for the last over ten years; (iv)
the fact that various commissions and committees have made recommendations on similar lines for
introducing reforms in the police set-up in the country; and (v) total uncertainty as to when police
reforms would be introduced, we think that there cannot be any further wait, and the stage has come
for issuing of appropriate directions for immediate compliance so as to be operative till such time a
new model Police Act is prepared by the Central Government and/or the State Governments pass
the requisite legislations. It may further be noted that the quality of the criminal justice system in
the country, to a large extent, depends upon the working of the police force. Thus, having regard to
the larger public interest, it is absolutely necessary to issue the requisite directions. Nearly ten years
back, in Vineet Narain v. Union of India [(1998) 1 SCC 226 :
1998 SCC (Cri) 307] this Court noticed the urgent need for the State Governments to
set up the requisite mechanism and directed the Central Government to pursue the
matter of police reforms with the State Governments and ensure the setting up of a
mechanism for selection/appointment, tenure, transfer and posting of not merely the
Chief of the State Police but also all police officers of the rank of Superintendents of
Police and above. The Court expressed its shock that in some States the tenure of a
Superintendent of Police is for a few months and transfers are made for whimsical
reasons which has not only demoralising effect on the police force but is also alien to
the envisaged constitutional machinery. It was observed that apart from demoralising
the police force, it has also the adverse effect of politicising the personnel and,
therefore, it is essential that prompt measures are taken by the Central Government.
29. The preparation of a model Police Act by the Central Government and enactment
of new Police Acts by the State Governments providing therein for the composition of
the State Security Commission are things, we can only hope for the present.
Similarly, we can only express our hope that all State Governments would rise to the
occasion and enact a new Police Act wholly insulating the police from any pressure
whatsoever thereby placing in position an important measure for securing the rights
of the citizens under the Constitution for the rule of law, treating everyone equal and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 120
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
being partisan to none, which will also help in securing an efficient and better
criminal justice delivery system. It is not possible or proper to leave this matter only
with an expression of this hope and to await developments further. It is essential to
lay down guidelines to be operative till the new legislation is enacted by the State
Governments."
228. It is also not in dispute that the Lokpal and the Lokayukta Act, 2013 enacted by
the Parliament has provided for the establishment of the body of the Lokpal for the
Union and Lokayukta for States to inquire into allegations of corruption against
certain public functionaries and for matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto. The provisions of the said Act provide for establishment of a separate inquiry
and Prosecution Wing and for filing of cases in accordance with the findings arrived
at. The provisions of Section 63 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act requires every
State to establish a body to be known as the Lokayukta for the State, if not so
established, constituted or appointed by a law made by the State Legislature, to deal
with complaints relating to corruption against certain public functionaries. Though it
is not so expressly provided, but such Lokayukta is expected to have the same powers
as, the Lokpal. Further, though the Legislature of Karnataka had prior thereto
established the Lokayukta in the year 1986 and from 1986 till 14.3.2016, the date of
passing the impugned executive order, the Lokayukta dealt with the complaints
relating to corruption against certain public functionaries, but the said Lokayukta
does not have the same powers as the Lokpal under the Lokpal Act, 2013. Yet further,
the provisions of Section 63 required the State Legislature to make such an
enactment within one year from the date of commencement of the Lokpal Act, 2013
Act. Therefore, it is high time for the State Government to provide for establishment
of a separate Inquiry and Prosecution Wing and for filing of cases in accordance with
the findings arrived at. On that ground also the impugned executive order cannot be
sustained.
229. In the light of the settled legal position, it is not possible to accede to the
submission of the learned Advocate General that the Lokayukta has no power to call
for records in a preliminary inquiry. The exercise of calling for the records was to
satisfy that there was a prima facie case to proceed with. The objections raised by the
State Government, in view of the executive order, are purely technical and the
contention of the State Government that they are withdrawing extra powers assigned
to Lokayukta by virtue of the executive order, might seriously impede the statutory
and independent functioning of the Lokayukta under the KL Act. The nature of
proceedings conducted by the Lokayukta or Upa-
Lokayukta are altogether different from a civil and criminal lis. Unlike civil or criminal proceedings,
a citizen making allegations against a public functionary may not be in possession of complete facts
or documents, unless the allegation arises out of his personal transaction with any public
functionary. The powers conferred on the Lokayukta are advisedly very wide and these powers are
wider than of any court of law. Notwithstanding remedies to be found in courts of law and in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 121
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
statutory appeals against administrative decisions, there still remains a gap in the machinery for the
redressal of grievances of the individuals against administrative acts or omissions. This gap should
be filled by an authority which is able to act more speedily, informally and with a greater regard to
the individual justice of a case than is possible by ordinary legal process of the Courts, it should not
be regarded as a substitute for, or rival to, the Legislature or to the Courts, but as a necessary
supplement to their work, using weapons of persuasion, recommendation and publicity rather than
compulsion. The fight between an individual citizen and the State is unequal in nature. Therefore,
the very existence of Lokayukta institution will act as a check and will be helpful in checking the
canker of corruption and maladministration. Moreso, when it has been repeatedly asserted that the
canker of corruption, in the proportions it is said to have attained, may well dig into the vitals of our
democratic State, and eventually destroy it. (As stated in the book called, 'Corruption- Control of
Maladministration' by John D. Monteiro).
230. The provisions of KL Act, which is enacted for the eradication of the evil of corruption and
maladministration must be construed liberally so as to advance the remedy. In our opinion, there is
absolutely no merit in the impugned executive order passed by the State Government, in exercise of
the powers under the provisions of Article 162 of the Constitution of India and the impugned order
cannot be sustained. It is also not in dispute that before enacting the KL Act, public opinion has
been agitated for a long time over the prevalence of corruption in the administration and it is likely
that cases coming up before the independent authorities like Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta might
involve allegations or actual evidence of corrupt motive and favouritism. We think that the
institution of Lokayukta should deal with such cases as well.
231. It is also relevant to refer to the main features of the institutions of Lokpal and Lokayukta,
which are as under:
a) They should be demonstrably independent and impartial.
b) Their investigations and proceedings should be conducted in private and should be
informal in character.
c) Their appointment should, as far as possible, be non-political.
d) Their status should compare with the highest judicial functionaries in the country.
e) They should deal with matters in the discretionary field involving acts of injustice,
corruption or favouritism.
f) Their proceedings should not be subject to judicial interference and they should
have the maximum latitude and powers in obtaining information relevant to their
duties.
g) They should not look forward to any benefit or pecuniary advantage from the
executive Government.

232. We have no doubt that the working of the Institution of Lokayukta in Karnataka will be
watched with keen expectation and interest by the other states in India. We hope that this aspect
would also be fully borne in mind by Government in considering the urgency and importance of the
independence of the Lokayukta. A Lokayukta is to function as a sentinel to ensure a corruption free
administration.
233. As already stated supra, the object of the KL Act and PC Act was to achieve common object and
goal of corruption free society. Common man has immense faith in the institution of Karnataka
Lokayukta and also its Police Wing, that too after handling investigating relating to mining scam.
Earlier, the common man could have filed the complaint against anybody to set the law into motion
under the PC Act and there was no bureaucratic impediment or decision required to initiate the
proceedings against a complaint. However, ACB was set up abruptly with an intention to take
control of the pending investigations against the high functionaries of the State, Bureaucrats etc., In
order to protect and scuttle the investigation against political class and bureaucrats, Government
Order dated 14.3.2016 came to be issued constituting ACB as authority for investigation under the
PC Act, thereby the very purpose of KL Act was indirectly defeated. As per the provisions of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, the complainant himself should not be an Investigating Officer. As per the
impugned executive order, if any complaint filed as against the Chief Minister or the Minister in the
Council of Ministers, the Chief Minister himself has to oversee the investigation and also permit
investigation, thereby the impugned executive order is opposed to the rule of law and contrary to the
dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah51. The impugned
Government Order constituting ACB empowers the Hon'ble Chief Minister to veto investigation or
the sanction of investigation. This itself defeats the very purpose of the Anti Corruption Drive and
ACB is not at all an independent body. The Police force of ACB works under the authority of the
Hon'ble Chief Minister and any independent investigation is only a mirage. No serving officers
would be in a position to conduct an enquiry against the Hon'ble Chief Minister under whom they
would be working as subordinates. Therefore by the constitution of ACB, the basic investigation
apparatus/mechanism is dysfunctional. The ACB is constituted virtually to defeat the very purpose
of PC Act itself. The State is bent upon saving its corrupt Ministers and Officers and therefore the
impugned Government Order and subsequent supporting Supra at Footnote No.1 notifications are
contrary to the very object of the KL Act. The constitution of ACB is one without authority of law and
though it purports to create an independent wing, it is controlled by the Hon'ble Chief Minister.
Thus, the Lokayukta Police Force is virtually abolished by creation of ACB. The State Government
issued the impugned Government Order constituting ACB on an erroneous understanding of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of C. Rangaswamaiah52. In fact the said
judgment curtails the power of the State Government to constitute ACB or any alternative mode of
investigating agency and interfere with the functioning of the Lokayukta. The statutory powers
assigned to Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta under the provisions of the KL Act cannot be diluted by
the executive orders passed by the State Government under Article 162 of the Constitution of India.
After the constitution of ACB by way of executive order, the State Government issued notifications
dated 19.3.2016, thereby superseding the earlier notifications dated 6.2.1991, 8.5.2002 and
5.12.2002 that authorized the Lokayukta Police with powers to Supra at Footnote No.1 investigate
and had declared the offices of Police Wing of Lokayukta as Police Stations.

234. The ACB is established by means of an executive order, which has no legs to stand and the ACB
cannot perform the duty of the police unless it is established by means of a statute. The constitution
of ACB itself is shaky, oppose to the provisions of law and cannot perform the duty of the police. The
police wing is an independent investigating agency and though ACB purports to create an
independent wing, it is controlled by the Hon'ble Chief Minister i.e., control of political executive.
The ACB cannot constitute an independent police force when already the field is occupied by the
Karnataka Police Act, 1963. A Police Officer who is working under the control of the Home
Department or State while being investigating officer under ACB cannot be expected to conduct a
fair and impartial investigation in relation to high ranking public servants and it is likely to be
insulated from such influence.
235. For the reasons stated above, the impugned Government Order dated 14.03.2016 constituting
ACB, notifications dated 19.03.2016 and all subsequent notifications issued pursuant to the
Government Order dated 14.03.2016 for the purpose of formation and working of the ACB, are
liable to be quashed. Consequently, Anti Corruption Bureau is liable to be abolished. But, all
inquiries, investigations and other disciplinary proceedings pending before the ACB will get
transferred to the Lokayukta. To be specific, the proceedings in respect of some of the private
petitioners which are pending before the ACB will get transferred to the Lokayukta and the said
petitioners cannot escape from the clutches of law and they have to face the proceedings before the
Police Wing of the Karnataka Lokayukta, who shall proceed in accordance with law.
236. Before parting with the matter, we deem it proper to observe that in order to eradicate
corruption, keeping in view the object of the KL Act and in the interest of justice for public at large,
we request the constitutional authorities as contemplated under the provisions of Section 3(2)(a)
and 3(2)(b) of the KL Act to take conscious and unanimous decision to recommend persons with
track record of integrity, competence and fair, both on the public and personal life, to the posts of
Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayuktas uninfluenced by caste, creed etc., and maintain transparency in the
appointment. The appointment should be non-political and the posts of Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta should not be accommodation centre for anybody.
XVI. Recommendations
237. In view of the above discussion, we are of the considered opinion to make following
recommendations to the State Government:
a) There is immediate necessity for amending Section 12(4) of the Karnataka
Lokayukta Act, 1984 to the effect that once the recommendation made by Lokayukta
under Section 12(3) of the KL Act, the same shall be binding on the Government.
b) The Police Wing of Karnataka Lokayukta shall be strengthened by
appointing/deputing honest persons with track record of integrity and fairness.
c) The Police Personnel, who at present working in Anti Corruption Bureau shall be
transferred/deputed to the Karnataka Lokayukta Police Wing, in order to strengthen
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64144450/ 124
Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 August, 2022
the existing Police Wing of Lokayukta and to enable them to prosecute and
investigate the matters effectively.
The officers/officials, who at present working in the ACB hereinafter shall be under the
administrative and exclusive disciplinary control of Lokayukta.
d) The officers and officials, who assist the Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayuktas in discharge of their
functions shall not be transferred for a minimum period of three years, without the consent of
Lokayukta/Upa-Lokayukta, as the case may be.
e) The investigation once started shall be completed within the reasonable period. In case any
proceedings are pending before the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayuktas on account of pendency of the
matters before the Courts, necessary steps shall be taken for early disposal of the matters before the
Courts.
XVII. Conclusion
238. On appreciation of the entire material placed on record and in the light of the judgments of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court cited supra, we answer the points raised in these writ petitions as under:
i) The 1st point is answered in the negative holding that the State Government is not
justified in constituting Anti Corruption Bureau by an executive Government Order
No.DPAR 14 SELOYU 2016, Bengaluru dated 14.3.2016, in exercise of powers under
Article 162 of the Constitution of India, when the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984 has
occupied the field to eradicate the corruption in the State of Karnataka, in the facts
and circumstances of the case.
ii) The 2nd point is answered in the negative holding that the State Government is
not justified in issuing the impugned notifications dated 19.3.2016 superseding the
earlier notifications dated 6.2.1991, 8.5.2002 and 5.12.2002 that authorized the
Lokayukta Police with powers to investigate under the provisions of Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 and had declared the offices of Police Wing of Lokayukta as
Police Stations under the provisions of Section 2(s) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. All subsequent notifications issued pursuant to the impugned
Government Order dated 14.3.2016 for the purpose of formation and working of
ACB, are also liable to be quashed.
