(cid:12) W.P.No.12934 of 2010
For Petitioner : Mr.W.M.Abdul Majeed
For Respondents : Mr.T.Arunkumar,
Additional Government Pleader
ORDER
The petitioner, challenging the impugned order dated 18.03.2010, in and by which her application
seeking compassionate appointment was rejected by the third respondent, has filed the present writ
petition.
2. It is the case of the petitioner that her husband late Kannan joined the Public Works Department
as NMR [Nominal Mazdoor Roll] at the Sathanur Dam, Tiruvannamalai, in the year 1979. While he
was working as NMR, he died on 02.01.2005, leaving behind the petitioner, two kids and his mother
as legal heirs. According to the petitioner, her husband had completed 10 years of service as NMR
on 01.07.1989 and based on the policy of the Government to regularize all those NMRs who had
completed more than 10 years of service, proposals were sent to the Government including the name
of the petitioner's husband along with those similarly placed for the purpose of regularizing their
service. Subsequently, the services of the petitioner's husband and similarly placed persons were
regularized by issuance of G.O.(Ms)No.334, PW(C2) Department dated 19.10.2007. It is the
contention of the petitioner that even though her husband died in the year
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 2005, the above referred Government Order had included the
name of the petitioner's husband as a person whose service had to be regularized under the above
Government Order and the first respondent had also issued a clarification letter bearing Ms.No.403
dated 08.07.1997 that benefits should be given to all those NMR employees who died or got retired
after their services were regularized.
3. The petitioner has also sent a representation to the third respondent on 23.02.2010 seeking
benefits upon the death of her husband including family pension and compassionate appointment
by enclosing all the necessary certificate and the third respondent, vide letter bearing No.E2(2)/
3476/10 dated 18.03.2010 has returned the representation stating that since the second respondent
had already returned a similar representation from one Bangaru, son of Late R.Kondappan.
Challenging the said order of the second respondent, the present writ petition has been filed.
4. The third respondent has filed a detailed counter affidavit wherein it has been stated as under:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 4.1. The services of 1056 NMR persons who have
completed ten years of service have been regularized in G.O.(Ms)No.334, Public
Works (C2) Department dated 19.10.2007 with the condition that the services
regularized from the date of the said Government Order only. The monetary benefits,
fixation of pay and other benefits should be effected from the date of the said
Government Order only. Therefore, the benefits for the 10 years Nominal Muster Roll
services were denied by the Court in the common order dated 29.08.2011,
W.P.Nos.1286, 2175, 5887 and 7821 of 2009 and in the order dated 29.08.2011 in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78950978/ 2
K.Muniammal vs Government Of Tamil Nadu on 2 December, 2021
W.P.No.502 of 2010. The Nominal Muster Rolls workers should come to the regular
establishment from the date of the said Government Order. Then only they will be
treated as Government servant.
But the petitioner's husband died on 02.01.2005. Hence, the petitioner's husband is not eligible to
come to the regular establishment.
4.2. Thiru.Kannan / petitioner's husband, Nominal Muster Roll has died before regularization of his
service. Therefore, his legal heirs have lost their rights to get any benefits. At present there are no
rules to give any benefits to his family as such as a regular Government Servant. In G.O.(Ms)No.42,
Labour and Employment (Q1) Department dated https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 12.03.2007, it is
clearly stated in Para (2.2.7) that “No appointment on compassionate ground shall be given to
dependents of casual or adhoc or temporary government servants appointed under Rule 10(a)(i) of
General Rules contained in Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service Rules.
4.3. The second respondent in his letter dated 12.08.2009 has rejected the claim of the said Bangaru
S/o. Late R.Kondappan for compassionate appointment by quoting G.O.(Ms)No.42, Labour and
Employee (Q1) Department dated 12.03.2007.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the Government after relaxing the
necessary rules in favour of the petitioner's husband have sought to regularize his service by
issuance of G.O.(Ms)No.334 PW(C2) Department dated 19.10.2007 and the name of the petitioner's
husband has been regularized against the cleaner vacancy in the Chennai Region and having
regularized the services of the petitioner's husband, who died in the year 2005, the respondents
cannot now deny the benefits including family pension etc., to the petitioner and as such, the
impugned order is liable to be set aside.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
6. Mr.T.Arunkumar, learned Additional Government for the respondents has placed reliance on the
aforesaid stand taken by the third respondent in the counter affidavit and would contend that the
petitioner's husband died in the year 2.1.2005 and whereas G.O.Ms.No.334, Public Works (C2)
Department was passed on 19.10.2007 and therefore, the petitioner's husband is not eligible to come
to regular establishment and the second respondent has rightly passed the impugned order by
placing reliance on G.O.(Ms)No.42 Labour and Employment (Q1) Department dated 12.03.2007
and therefore, prays for dismissal of this writ petition.
7. This Court has considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials placed on record.
8. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner's husband worked as NMR till his demise on 02.01.2005.
It is the claim of the petitioner that her husband had completed ten years of service as NMR
employee on 01.07.1989 and as per G.O.Ms.No.344 Public Works (C2) Department dated
19.10.2007, her husband's service is entitled to be regularized and he is deemed to be
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis treated as Regular Employee and consequently, as a legal heir, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78950978/ 3
K.Muniammal vs Government Of Tamil Nadu on 2 December, 2021
petitioner is entitled to get compassionate appointment. On the other hand, it is the stand of the
respondents that the petitioner died in the year 2005 before G.O.Ms.No.344 came into effect and
nowhere in the Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.344 dated 19.10.2007, it has been stated that
monetary benefits be given to the deceased NMR i.e., not alive on the date of the said Government
Order.
9. The distinction with regard to “Work Charged, Permanent and Regular Employee” with regard to
grant of compassionate appointment was elaborately considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the decision in State of Madhya Pradesh and Others v. Amit Shrivas [(2020) 10 SCC 496], wherein
the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as follows:
“15. In our opinion, the only issue which has to be examined is whether the late father
of the respondent who admittedly was employed as a work-charged/contingency
employee in the Tribal Welfare Department was entitled to the compassionate
appointment as per the existing policy on the date of his demise.
16. It is trite to say that there cannot be any inherent right to compassionate
appointment but rather, it is a right based on certain criteria, especially to provide
succour to a needy family.
This has to be in terms of the applicable policy as existing on the date of demise, unless a subsequent
policy is made applicable retrospectively. [State of Gujarat v. Arvindkumar T. Tiwari,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (2012) 9 SCC 545 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 795] Insofar as providing
succour is concerned, unfortunately, since the demise of the late father of the respondent, 11 years
have passed and really speaking, the aspect of providing succour to the family immediately does not
survive. We have still examined the matter in the conspectus of the applicable policy. It is not in
question that the Policy prevailing was one dated 18-8-2008. Clause 12.1 clearly proscribes
work-charge/contingency fund and daily wager employees from compassionate appointment. The
gravamen of the submission of the respondent is based on the classification of his late father as a
permanent employee on account of having worked for more than 15 years and the consequent
regularisation of his service.
17. In our view, the aforesaid plea misses the point of distinction between a work-charged employee,
a permanent employee and a regular employee. The late father of the respondent was undoubtedly a
work-charged employee and it is nobody's case that he has not been paid out of work-
charged/contingency fund. He attained the status of a permanent employee on account of having
completed 15 years of service, which entitled him to certain benefits including pension and
krammonati. This will, however, not ipso facto give him the status of a regular employee.
(emphasis supplied) ...
24. We had the occasion of examining the issue of compassionate appointment in a recent judgment
in Indian Bank v. Promila [Indian Bank v. Promila, (2020) 2 SCC 729 : (2020) 1 SCC (L&S) 312] .
We may usefully refer to paras 3, 4, and 5 as under : (SCC p. 731) “3. There has been some confusion
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78950978/ 4
K.Muniammal vs Government Of Tamil Nadu on 2 December, 2021
as to the scheme applicable and, thus, this Court directed the scheme prevalent, on the date of the
death, to be placed before this Court for consideration, as the High Court appears to have dealt with
a scheme which was of a subsequent date. The need for this also arose on account of the legal
position being settled by the judgment of this Court in Canara Bank v. M. Mahesh Kumar [Canara
Bank v.M. Mahesh https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Kumar, (2015) 7 SCC 412 : (2015) 2 SCC (L&S)
539] , qua what would be the cut-off date for application of such scheme.
4. It is trite to emphasise, based on numerous judicial pronouncements of this Court, that
compassionate appointment is not an alternative to the normal course of appointment, and that
there is no inherent right to seek compassionate appointment. The objective is only to provide solace
and succour to the family in difficult times and, thus, the relevancy is at that stage of time when the
employee passes away.
5. An aspect examined by this judgment [Canara Bank v. M. Mahesh Kumar, (2015) 7 SCC 412 :
(2015) 2 SCC (L&S) 539] is as to whether a claim for compassionate employment under a scheme of
a particular year could be decided based on a subsequent scheme that came into force much after
the claim. The answer to this has been emphatically in the negative. It has also been observed that
the grant of family pension and payment of terminal benefits cannot be treated as a substitute for
providing employment assistance. The crucial aspect is to turn to the scheme itself to consider as to
what are the provisions made in the scheme for such compassionate appointment.”
10. In Umesh Kumar Nagpal vs. State of Haryana [(1994) 4 SCC 138], the Honourable Supreme
Court has held as follows:
“The whole object of granting compassionate employment is thus to enable the family
to tide over the sudden crisis. The object is not to give a member of such family a post
much less a post for post held by the deceased. What is further, mere death of an
employee in harness does not entitle his family to such source of livelihood. The
Government or the public authority concerned has to examine the financial condition
of the family of the deceased, and it is only if it is satisfied, that but for the provision
of employment, the family will not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis be able to meet
the crisis that a job is to be offered to the eligible member of the family.”
11. In Bhawani Prasad Sankar vs. Union of India and Others [2011 (3) LLN 37 (SC)], the Honourable
Supreme Court has held as follows:
“(i) Compassionate employment cannot be made in the absence of Rules or
Regulations issued by the Government or a Public Authority. The request is to be
considered strictly in accordance with the governing scheme, and no discretion as
such is left with any authority to make Compassionate Appointment dehors the
Scheme.
(ii) ...
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78950978/ 5
K.Muniammal vs Government Of Tamil Nadu on 2 December, 2021
(iii) An appointment on compassionate ground is to meet the sudden crisis occurring
in the family on account of the death or medical invalidation of the breadwinner
while in service. Therefore, compassionate employment cannot be granted as a
matter of course by way of largesse irrespective of the financial condition of the
deceased/incapacitated employee's family at the time of his death or incapacity, as
the case may be.”
12. In State of Himachal Pradesh and another vs. Parkash Chand [(2019) 4 SCC 285], the
Honourable Supreme Court has held as follows:
“8.The High Court while deciding issue (ix) has relied upon the decision of this Court
in Govind Prakash Verma v. LIC [(2005) 10 SCC 289] more specifically on the
observation that the mere fact that the elder brother of the applicant was engaged in
agricultural work and was also doing the work of a casual painter, would not be
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis construed as gainful employment. This finding in
Govind Prakash Verma [(2005) 10 SCC 289] is purely on the facts of that case and
cannot be construed to be of any relevance to the present case.
9. The High Court has observed that the State should consider cases for appointment
on compassionate basis by dealing with the applications submitted by sons, or as the
case may be, daughters of deceased government employees, even though, one
member of the family is engaged in the service of the government or an autonomous
board or corporation. This direction of the judgment of the High Court virtually
amounts to a mandamus to the State Government to disregard the terms which have
been stipulated in paragraph 5(c) of its Policy dated 18-1-1990. The policy contains a
limited exception which is available only to a widow of a deceased employee who
seeks compassionate appointment even though one of the children of the deceased
employee is gainfully employed with the State. The basis for this exception is to deal
with cases where the widow is not being supported financially by her children.
10. In the exercise of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution, it was not
open to the High Court to re-write the terms of the policy. It is well-settled that
compassionate appointment is not a matter of right, but must be governed by the
terms on which the State lays down the policy of offering employment assistance to a
member of the family of a deceased government employee. [Umesh Kumar Nagpal v.
State of Haryana [(1994) 4 SCC 138], SBI v. Kunti Tiwary [(2004) 7 SCC 271, Punjab
National Bank v. Ashwini Kumar Teneja [(2004) 7 SCC 265], SBI v. Somvir Singh
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis [(2007) 4 SCC 778, Mumtaz Yunus Mulani v. State
of Maharashtra [(2008) 11 SCC 384], Union of India v. Shashank Goswami [(2012) 11
SCC 307, SBI v. Surya Narain Tripathi [(2014) 15 SCC 739 and Canara Bank v.
M.Mahesh Kumar [(2015) 7 SCC 412].
11. For the above reasons, we are of the view that the judgment of the High Court is
unsustainable. The High Court has virtually rewritten the terms of the Policy and has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78950978/ 6
K.Muniammal vs Government Of Tamil Nadu on 2 December, 2021
issued a direction to the State to consider applications which do not fulfill the terms
of the policy. This is impermissible.”
13. Furthermore, G.O.(Ms) No.18, Labour and Employment (Q1) Department, dated 23.01.2020,
has clearly prescribed various guidelines for considering the applications for compassionate ground
appointment and it is useful to quote the following guidelines in the said Government Order:
PERSONS WHOSE LEGAL HEIRS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION
UNDER COMPASSIONATE GROUND APPOINTMENT:
(i) Persons who are retained in service under Fundamental Rule 56(1)(c) after the
date of superannuation;
(ii)Persons who are under temporary appointments, consolidated pay, daily wages,
contract appointments and whose services are not regularized.
(iii) Persons who do not come under regular time scale of pay.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
14. In the case on hand, the petitioner's husband worked as NMR from the year 1979 till his demise
on 02.01.2005. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision in Amit Shrivas case (cited supra) has
observed that attainment of status of permanent employee by a work-charged employee, on account
of having completed 15 years of service will however, not ipso facto give him the status of a regular
employee and hence, the service of the petitioner's husband, cannot be treated as regularized.
15. Further, Clause (ii) of the guidelines in G.O.Ms.No.18 extracted above also clearly specifies that
persons who are under temporary appointments, consolidated pay, daily wages, contract
appointments and whose services are not regularized are not entitled for compassionate ground
appointment. Moreover, the object of giving compassionate ground appointment is to meet out the
sudden crisis occurring in the family on account of death or medical invalidation of the breadwinner
while in service. In the case on hand, the deceased family was able to survive for about 16 years after
the demise of the employee and the object of giving of compassionate ground appointment would
get defeated, if this Court directs https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the respondents to consider the
claim of the petitioner.

16. In view of the aforesaid reasons, this Writ Petition fails and according it is dismissed. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is also dismissed.
