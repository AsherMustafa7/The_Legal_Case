2006 dated 15th December 2006.
4. The Trial Court vide order dated 25th April 2007 framed charge against accused/appellant, to
which he pleaded not guilty, thus, prosecution was directed to adduce evidence in support of its
case. Prosecution adduced twelve witnesses. The resume of the statement of witnesses produced by
prosecution is given as under:
(a) PW-1, Mudasir Ahmad Wani, who is also complainant, in his statement recorded
by Trial Court on 23rd July 2007 stated that when he went to the office of CA&PD to
submit monthly statement, accused refused to accept his statement and demanded a
bribe of Rs.1000/-. He, however, refused to pay bribe. Then he approached VOK with
a complaint. He admitted contents of seizure memo. He admitted prosecution story.
He admits seizure of money from accused. According to witness, the handwash was
conducted.
In cross-examination witness has stated that complaint has been scribed by him and was written by
him at his home. The witness upon being asked to read contents of EXPW-1, read the same, wherein
it has been mentioned that at the end of every month commission @ 10% was to be given along with
the statement as bribe and that the accused used to demand bribe from him @ 10%. The witness has
stated that prior to the said date he had been depositing the statement with the accused at the end of
respective months but at that time the accused neither demanded bribe from Page 4 him nor he
made any such payment. The witness has stated that he could not recollect as to on how many
occasions he deposited the monthly statement with the accused and that he had been in the said
business for last one year and thereafter stated that he presented the statement before accused on a
couple of occasions. It has been however stated by the witness that since the statement used to be
deposited on the 30th of every month, as such he had gone to the office of the accused on 30th June
2006. It has further been stated by him that he could not recollect as to whether search of the
members of the trap team had been conducted or not, nor as to whether the hands of any other
person besides him and the independent witness were washed in the office of the VOK and he could
not recollect who treated the currency notes with phenolphthalein powder. It has been stated that
when the accused was trapped at that time ten to twenty persons were present and the post trap
proceedings took place in their presence, but their names could not be recollected by him. At the
time VOK officials entered into the room upon receiving the pre-fixed signal, the bribe amount was
in the hand of the accused while his hand was upon the table. He has stated that it is a fact that the
solution in the bottle is of light pink colour as compared to the solution in the bottle. It has been
stated by the witness that he could not recollect as to whether he saw that person giving the signal
upon which the other members of the trap team entered into the office room of the accused and it
would be wrong to state that when bribe amount was recovered it had been kept underneath a sheet
of paper while in fact the bribe amount was in the hand of the accused which fell from his hand upon
the table. The witness has stated that his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. has been recorded by
the VOK officials. The witness has further stated that as reflected in his statement under section 161
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101162262/ 3
Bashir Ahmad Sheikh Age 65 Years S/O ... vs State Of J&K Through Vok Srinagar on 21 August, 2025
Cr.P.C. that the accused held the money in his hand and told him that if he wanted, he could keep it
but instead of returning the money to him placed it upon the table and kept a sheet of paper over it,
is not correct as he had never made Page 5 such a statement. The time when they left the office of
the accused after completion of the proceedings could not be recollected by him.
(b) PW-2 Mohd Ashraf Bhat (independent witness, the then Orderly, Directorate of Social Welfare
Department), recorded by the court on 02.04.2009, in his statement stated that on 30th June 2006
he was posted in the directorate of Social Welfare as an Orderly and was directed by his higher
officers to attend office of VOK and accordingly he went to the office of the VOK where he met an
Inspector with whom a boy was sitting and he was told that the boy had filed a complaint in
connection with which they had to go somewhere. The complainant produced Rs.1000/- before
Inspector and Inspector handed over the amount to another person Abdul Rashid who treated the
currency notes with powder and handed over the said notes which comprised of ten notes of one
hundred rupee denomination each to the Inspector and the relevant memos were prepared.

signature and also identified the bottle containing the solution. The witness has stated that
thereafter they left for spot and complainant as also officials of VOK accompanied him. He had no
knowledge as to where they had to go and upon reaching Mirhama Kulgam, they were told to come
out of the vehicle and that he was directed to accompany complainant. The complainant went inside
the office of Food and Supplies Mirhama and he accompanied the complainant and they entered
into the office room of the accused/Supervisor where many people were sitting and Page 6 the
accused was also inside the room. The witness has stated that he got seated upon one of the chairs
and the complainant was also there. Thereafter, the complainant produced some statements before
the accused, Bashir Ahmad, who marked the statement and told him to hand them over to some
Clerk and after the statement came back from the Clerk, the complainant handed over Rs.1000/- to
the accused. The accused asked the complainant reason for payment of money upon which the
complainant told him to keep the money but the accused refused to take the same. Thereafter,
accused kept it on the table and accused was holding a paper in his hand which he was reading and
said paper was placed by accused upon bribe amount. The witness has stated that there after he gave
a signal towards the other members of the team who were waiting outside and they immediately
entered into the room and held the accused. The accused was asked about the bribe amount who
told them that the money was lying upon the table. Thereafter, the seizure memo prepared. The
personal search of the accused was conducted. In cross-examination, witness has stated that the
trap team was headed by an Inspector who effected the arrest of the accused. The said officer did not
show on spot any order by virtue of which he had been authorized to arrest the accused nor has any

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101162262/ 4
Bashir Ahmad Sheikh Age 65 Years S/O ... vs State Of J&K Through Vok Srinagar on 21 August, 2025
his experience he could state that the colour of the hand wash of the complainant is of dark pink
colour, whereas the colour of the hand wash of the accused is of lighter hue and it is due to slips
affixed upon the bottle that he could identify the solution as hand wash of the complainant. The
witness has stated that in his examination-in-chief he could identify the bottles since Prosecuting
Officer told him as to which bottle pertained to demonstration No.1 and which bottle pertained to
demonstration No.2. He has stated that he could not himself read out as to what was written upon
the slips Page 7 affixed upon the bottles containing the solution. The witness has however stated that
three or four officials of the VOK besides the complainant and he himself comprised the trap party.
It has been stated by him that it is a fact that when the complainant paid the money to accused, the
accused refused to accept the same resulting in some tussle between the duo and the complainant
was holding the money in his hands and the accused was trying to ward off the hands of the
complainant away from him. He has stated that he could not recollect as to whether the paper which
was kept on the currency notes by the accused seized or not. The seal used upon the bottles during
the proceedings was handed over to him. In a query raised by the court, the witness has stated that
during the pre-trap demonstration solution obtained was sealed in a bottle, but no slip was affixed
upon it which would bear his signature and had the Investigating Officer written pre-trap solution
upon the bottle for identification purposes and obtained his signature upon it, in that eventuality, he
would have identified the bottle and in like manner during post-trap demonstration I/O did not affix
any slip upon the bottle. In re-examination, the witness has stated that he has no knowledge as to
what conversation took-place between the accused and the complainant when the money was being
handed over by the complainant to the accused and it could also be inferred that the amount might
have appeared to the accused to be meager for acceptance. The witness has stated that he however
did not hear anything being spoken by the accused, whereby he would have said that the amount
was meagre.

(l) PW-12, Qazi Syed Mehmood, IO, the then Inspector, VOK, has stated that on 30.06.2006, the
investigation of the case FIR no.25/2006 P/S VOK was entrusted to him. During investigation he
questioned the complainant in light of his complaint, upon which FIR had been registered, which
revealed that the complainant Mudasir Ahmad Wani had been running a commission-based Centre
on behalf of the CA&PD at Mirhama, Kulgam and at the end of the month a monthly statement used
to be submitted to the Supervisor concerned and for receipt of which the Supervisor Bashir Ahmad
Sheikh had demanded an amount of Rs. 1000/- from him, upon which he filed a complaint with the
P/S VOK and sought legal action against the accused. A trap team was constituted by the SSP (ABP)
and the services of an independent witness were requisitioned and associated with the trap team as
such. The complainant produced an amount of Rs. 1000/- which was seized and a seizure-memo
EXPW- 1/1 prepared, contents of which have been admitted by the witness as true and correct, as
also identified his signature upon it. The witness has also admitted the contents of the handing over
memo EXPW-1/2 and the pre-trap demonstration memo EXPW-1/3 as true and correct and
identified his signatures upon said memos. The complainant was directed to hand over the notes to
the accused only upon his demand. Thereafter the members of the team except Ct. Abdul Rashid
accompanied by the complainant proceeded towards the office of the Supervisor CA&PD Circle
Mirhama, Kulgam and upon reaching there the complainant accompanied by the independent
witness were sent to the said office of the accused Supervisor and the other members of the team
walked at some distance and Ct. Zamir Ahmad was placed nearby the office of the Supervisor
concerned and was nominated as the shadow witness.
Page 22 The complainant accompanied by the independent witness entered into the office room of
the Supervisor concerned and after sometime the independent. witness gave a pre-fixed signal
towards the other members of the team while he came out of the room of accused and other
members of the team immediately entered into the office room of the Supervisor CA&PD Circle
Mirhama, Kulgqm where f at the instance of the independent witness and the complainant, the
accused Bashir Ahmad was directed to raise his hands. A demonstration was conducted and in the
solution of water and sodium carbonate handwash of the independent witness was conducted in the
first instance upon which the colour of the solution remained unchanged and thereafter in the some
solution hand wash of the accused was conducted which tested positive and the post- trap
demonstration memo EXPW-1/5 prepared, contents whereof have been admitted by the witness as
true and correct and identified his signature upon it. The witness has stated that upon the disclosure
of the accused Bashir Ahmad Sheikh the tainted amount of Rs.1000/- was recovered from his table
which was seized on spot and seizure memo prepared. The witness has admitted the contents of the
recovery memo EXPW-1/4 as true and correct and identified his signature upon it. Also contents of
seizure memo pertaining to monthly grain bag statement EXPW-1/7 and memo pertaining to the
personal search of the accused EXPW-1/6 have been admitted by the witness to be true and correct
and identified his signatures upon the said memos. The witness has also identified the contents of
the site plan Ext.P12 to be true and correct and identified his signature upon it. During
investigation, statements of the witness were recorded and pre-tap and post trap solutions were sent

accused, Bashir Ahmad Sheikh, were obtained. He states that during investigation it was established
that the accused in his capacity as Supervisor CA&PD Mirhama Circle, Kulgam demanded an illegal
gratification of Rs. 1000/- from the complainant for receiving his monthly grain bag statement and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101162262/ 13
Bashir Ahmad Sheikh Age 65 Years S/O ... vs State Of J&K Through Vok Srinagar on 21 August, 2025
Page 23 thereby committed the offence u/S 5(2) P.C. Act and Section 161 R.P.C. and accordingly the
challan was compiled and submitted to the higher authorities for obtaining the requisite sanction
from the government and upon receiving the sanction challan has been produced in court.
In cross-examination, witness has stated that he had been posted in VOK for quite some time and
had full knowledge about the trap cases and that he fully recollected the events and proceedings
which took place on the day of occurrence. That when the case was entrusted to him for
investigation, he held the rank of an Inspector and when the investigation of the case was completed
by him at that time also, he held the same rank. He has stated that it is a fact that an officer of the
rank of an Inspector under Section 5 P.C. Act, cannot effect arrest. The witness has stated that he
had been authorized by N.D. Wani in this regard. It has been stated that in a trap case neither IO
nor any other officer of VOK knows as to whether the trap would be successful or not. He states that
order, Ext.P11/1 was provided to him by SSP (ABP) before they left for spot and as per the said order
the name of the accused had been mentioned prior to the proceeding on spot authorizing him to
effect his arrest and when the said order was handed over to him he was not in know of the fact as to
whether Bashir Ahmad Sheikh would be trapped or not. The witness has stated that in his
examination-in- chief he did not mention that accused after keeping bribe amount on the table
placed a sheet of paper upon it. The said paper underneath which the accused kept the bribe amount
was not seized as it was not considered necessary. He has stated that when he entered into room, the
bribe amount was not covered by any paper and prior to him Constable Zamir Ahmad went inside
the office room of accused to whom accused said that the bribe amount was lying on the table and as
per Zamir Ahmad paper had been placed upon the bribe amount which was removed by Constable
Zamior Ahmad. The witness has stated that the accused did not point towards bribe amount in his
presence and when he entered into the room, the bribe Page 24 amount was seized from the table
upon the instance of accused on the basis of statement of Constable Zamir Ahmad and as the
complainant and independent witness narrated so. The witness upon being question as to whether
at the time of preparing seizure memo, it was in his knowledge as per investigation that the bribe
amount was being seized from table upon identification of accused, the witness has replied in
affirmative and stated that it was well within his knowledge that the bribe amount was lying on the
table of the accused which was before one and all present and the accused had been seen keeping the
bribe amount on the table by the complainant as well as independent witness and as such he did not
consider it necessary to mention it in the seizure memo that tainted amount was seized upon
identification of accused and it has come in the statements of the witnesses that the accused was
fully in know about the bribe amount being kept on the table. The witness has stated that he
deposed about the recovery of bribe amount at the instance of accused as same came out as the crux
of investigation. The witness stated that in his presence neither accused accepted money nor made
any such demand nor did he see accused placing bribe amount upon table and it is a fact that no
other trap member besides complainant and independent witness had witnessed the demand for
bribe being made by accused or its acceptance by him or bribe amount being kept upon table after
its acceptance by accused.
5. After recording statement of prosecution witnesses, accused/ appellant was explained evidence on
record against him in terms of Section 342 Cr.P.C. He maintained that he neither demanded nor
accepted any bribe from complainant. He stated that in fact complainant came to his office room
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101162262/ 14
Bashir Ahmad Sheikh Age 65 Years S/O ... vs State Of J&K Through Vok Srinagar on 21 August, 2025
with his grain bag statement and shook hands with him and placed the grain bag statement upon his
table, which resulted in some scuffle between him and complainant and in the meantime some
officials entered into his office room and seized the money which had been Page 25 concealed under
the grain bag statement which was lying on the table.
He also stated that complainant was running a sale centre of CA&PD in Mirhama Circle, Kulgam
and was indulging in black marketing of rice etc. and upon his raising objection, complainant lodged
a false case against him in VOK. Accused/ appellant in his defence produced three witnesses. Trial
Court by impugned judgement
6. To challenge impugned conviction and sentence, it is being averred that respondents have
concocted a false and frivolous case against appellant as regards demand of Rs.1000/- from
complainant to accept monthly statement of distribution of ration among people of the aera. He
neither demanded bribe nor accepted it and in fact on presentation of statement by complainant he
as usual initiated it and returned it to complainant for onward necessary action at the end of
concerned clerk as is evident from the record. Allegations levelled against appellant by prosecution
and complainant are not based on reality and entire case set up against him was concocted and
manipulation to cause harm to him and spoil his future. Prosecution is stated to have failed to
establish guilt against appellant that too beyond reasonable doubt. There has been lot of
contradiction on material facts which have not been appreciated by Trial Court. Independent
witness has himself stated that complainant of his own thrusted bribe amount to appellant which
appellant refused to accept and resisted and threw it back but Trial Court has not appreciated the
said statement of independent.
7. Learned counsel for appellant would contend that the Trial Court has not appreciated the fact that
prosecution has failed to establish at trial the guilt of accused/appellant inasmuch as there was no
question of Page 26 demanding bribe from complainant as it was in fact complainant who
approached office of appellant with his grain bag statement and shook hands with him and placed
his grain bag statement upon the table, which resulted in some argument between appellant and
complainant and in the meantime officials of VOK entered into room and seized the money
concealed under the grain bag statement and with regard to which appellant had no knowledge till
the same was seized. Learned counsel for appellant also claims that the tainted currency notes were
taken out by complainant himself out of his own packet and placed those notes on the table and
shook hands with appellant and therefore appellant came in contact with phenolphthalein powder.
According to learned counsel, prosecution case is full of contradictions. He has invited attention of
this Court to independent prosecution witness-2, namely, Mohd Ashraf Bhat, who was then Orderly
in Directorate of Social Welfare Department, whose statement was recorded by Trial Court on 2nd
April 2009. During cross examination he stated that the trap team was headed by an Inspector who
effected the arrest of the accused. The said officer did not show on spot any order by virtue of which
he had been authorized to arrest the accused nor has any such order been shown to him in the court.
The witness has stated that prior to being associated as a member of the trap team in the instant
case, he has participated in like matters and has been associated as an independent witness a
number of times. The witness has stated that on account of his experience he could state that the
colour of the hand wash of the complainant is of dark pink colour, whereas the colour of the hand
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101162262/ 15
Bashir Ahmad Sheikh Age 65 Years S/O ... vs State Of J&K Through Vok Srinagar on 21 August, 2025
wash of the accused is of lighter hue and it is due to slips affixed Page 27 upon the bottle that he
could identify the solution as hand wash of the complainant. The witness has stated that in his
examination-in-chief he could identify the bottles since Prosecuting Officer told him as to which
bottle pertained to demonstration No.1 and which bottle pertained to demonstration No.2. He has
stated that he could not himself read out as to what was written upon the slips affixed upon the
bottles containing the solution. The witness has however stated that three or four officials of the
VOK besides the complainant and he himself comprised the trap party. It has been stated by him
that it is a fact that when the complainant paid the money to accused, the accused refused to accept
the same resulting in some tussle between the duo and the complainant was holding the money in
his hands and the accused was trying to ward off the hands of the complainant away from him.
According to learned counsel for appellant, there is absence of demand and acceptance of bribe on
the part of accused/appellant.
8. From the statement of independent witness of prosecution, it is vividly evident that there had
been no evidence of both demand and/or acceptance of bribe by accused/appellant. It is not enough
to simply prove a public official misused their authority; there should be concrete proof that public
official solicited or received something of value in exchange for an official act. The Prevention of
Corruption Act (PC Act) requires proof that a public servant demanded and accepted the bribe.
9. In the present case from the materials produced before the Trial Court there is nothing to indicate
that a demand or acceptance of bribe by appellant which would clearly infer that there is no question
of any proof being provided, on that aspect, at the trial. In this context, I have Page 28 to look at the
Constitution Bench decision in Neeraj Dutta v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2012) 4 SCC 731. Paragraph 88
thereof reads as under:
"88. What emerges from the aforesaid discussion is summarised as under:
88.1. (a) Proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by a public servant as
a fact in issue by the prosecution is a sine qua non in order to establish the guilt of the
accused public servant under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act.
88.2. (b) In order to bring home the guilt of the accused, the prosecution has to first
prove the demand of illegal gratification and the subsequent acceptance as a matter
of fact. This fact in issue can be proved either by direct evidence which can be in the
nature of oral evidence or documentary evidence.
88.3. (c) Further, the fact in issue, namely, the proof of demand and acceptance of
illegal gratification can also be proved by circumstantial evidence in the absence of
direct oral and documentary evidence.
88.4. (d) In order to prove the fact in issue, namely, the demand and acceptance of
illegal gratification by the public servant, the following aspects have to be borne in
mind:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101162262/ 16
Bashir Ahmad Sheikh Age 65 Years S/O ... vs State Of J&K Through Vok Srinagar on 21 August, 2025
(i) if there is an offer to pay by the bribe-giver without there being any demand from
the public servant and the latter simply accepts the offer and receives the illegal
gratification, it is a case of acceptance as per Section 7 of the Act. In such a case, there
need not be a prior demand by the public servant.
(ii) On the other hand, if the public servant makes a demand and the bribe-giver
accepts the demand and tenders the demanded gratification which in turn is received
by the public servant, it is a case of obtainment. In the case of obtainment, the prior
demand for illegal gratification emanates from the public servant. This is an offence
under Sections 13(1)
(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act.
(iii) In both cases of (i) and (ii) above, the offer by the bribe-giver and the demand by
the public servant respectively have to be proved by the prosecution as a fact in issue.
In other words, mere acceptance or receipt of an illegal gratification without anything
more would not make it an offence under Section 7 or Sections 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii),
respectively of the Act. Therefore, under Section 7 of the Act, in order to bring home
the offence, there must be an offer which emanates from the bribe-giver which is
accepted by the public servant which would make it an offence. Similarly, a prior
demand by the public servant when accepted by the bribegiver and in turn there is a
payment made which Page 29 is received by the public servant, would be an offence
of obtainment under Sections 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act.
88.5. (e) The presumption of fact with regard to the demand and acceptance or obtainment of an
illegal gratification may be made by a court of law by way of an inference only when the foundational
facts have been proved by relevant oral and documentary evidence and not in the absence thereof.
On the basis of the material on record, the court has the discretion to raise a presumption of fact
while considering whether the fact of demand has been proved by the prosecution or not. Of course,
a presumption of fact is subject to rebuttal by the accused and in the absence of rebuttal
presumption stands. 88.6. (f) In the event the complainant turns "hostile", or has died or is
unavailable to let in his evidence during trial, demand of illegal gratification can be proved by letting
in the evidence of any other witness who can again let in evidence, either orally or by documentary
evidence or the prosecution can prove the case by circumstantial evidence. The trial does not abate
nor does it result in an order of acquittal of the accused public servant.
88.7. (g) Insofar as Section 7 of the Act is concerned, on the proof of the facts in issue, Section 20
mandates the court to raise a presumption that the illegal gratification was for the purpose of a
motive or reward as mentioned in the said Section. The said presumption has to be raised by the
court as a legal presumption or a presumption in law. Of course, the said presumption is also subject
to rebuttal. Section 20 does not apply to Sections 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act. 88.8. (h) We clarify
that the presumption in law under Section 20 of the Act is distinct from presumption of fact referred
to above in sub-para 88.5 (e), above, as the former is a mandatory presumption while the latter is
discretionary in nature."

10. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has held that the proof of demand or an offer and
acceptance of illegal gratification by a public servant is a fact in issue in the criminal proceeding and
is a sine qua non to establish the guilt of accused public servant under PC Act.
Unless proof is offered to the satisfaction of the court that there is a demand and acceptance of
illegal gratification, the presumption would not arise. The presumption under the Act cannot arise
on the mere allegation of a demand and acceptance of illegal gratification as rightly Page 30 pointed
out by appellant. The question of presumption does not arise in the present case where the Trial
Court has merely examined the complainant and also summoned the witnesses, the officers/officials
of the trap team and investigation team for the purpose of recording their statements; even the
independent witness produced and examined by prosecution does not corroborate prosecution
story.
11. Perusal of impugned judgement reveals that Trial Court has observed that appellant demanded
and accepted the bribe, whereas, as a matter of fact, independent witness adduced and examined by
prosecution has stated contrary to it. From his statement, it is in unequivocal terms evident that
appellant did neither make any demand nor did he accept the bribe. It is also evident from the
statement of independent prosecution witness that alleged bribe amount was not recovered from
possession of appellant inasmuch as the amount was lying on the table as is stated by independent
witness of prosecution as well.
12. The Trial Court has ignored the fact from the statement of independent witness of prosecution
that there was no demand or acceptance of bribe by accused/ appellant inasmuch as the Trial court
has misdirected itself in going through the statement of independent witness of prosecution;
even official witnesses of prosecution have not been able to prove and establish demand and
acceptance of bribe by appellant.
13. In B. Jayaraj v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 2014 (13) SCC 55, it was said by the Supreme Court that
is a settled position in law that demand of illegal gratification is sine qua non to constitute the
offence as contemplated under Prevention of Corruption Act and mere recovery of currency notes
cannot constitute the offence thereunder unless it is Page 31 proved beyond all reasonable doubt
that accused voluntarily accepted the money knowing it to be a bribe. The proof of demand of illegal
gratification, thus, is the gravamen of the offence under the provision of P. C. Act and in absence
thereof, unmistakably the charge therefor, would fail.
14. The above position has also been laid down in several judgements of the Supreme Court.
Reference in this regard is made to C.M. Sharma v.
State of A.P. 2010 (15) SCC 1; C. M. Girish Babu v. CBI, 2009 (3) SCC 779. It is likewise well settled
that mere recovery by itself cannot prove the charge of prosecution against accused. [See: N.
Vijaykumar v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 2021 SC 766]. In the aforesaid matters, it has been
reiterated that to prove the charge, it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused
voluntarily accepted money knowing it to be bribe. Absence of proof of demand for illegal

gratification and mere possession or recovery of currency notes is not sufficient to constitute such
offence. In the abovesaid judgments it has also been held that even the presumption can be drawn
only after demand for and acceptance of illegal gratification is proved. It is also fairly well settled
that initial presumption of innocence in the criminal jurisprudence gets doubled by acquittal
recorded by the trial court.
15. Before recording conviction under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the courts
have to take utmost care in scanning the evidence. Once conviction is recorded under the provisions
of Prevention of Corruption Act, it casts a social stigma on the person in the society apart from
serious consequences on the service rendered.

16. The Supreme Court, in the case of K. Shanthamma v. State of Telangana, AIR 2022 SC 1134, has
held as follows:
"10. We have given careful consideration to the submissions. We have perused the
depositions of the prosecution witnesses. The offence under Section 7 of the PC Act
relating to public servants taking bribe requires a demand of illegal gratification and
the acceptance thereof. The proof of demand of bribe by a public servant and its
acceptance by him is sine qua non for establishing the offence under Section 7 of the
PC Act."
17. In P. Satyanarayana Murthy v. State of A.P., (2015) 10 SCC 152, the Supreme Court has
summarised the well- settled law on the subject in para 23 which reads thus:
"23. The proof of demand of illegal gratification, thus, is the gravamen of the offence
under Sections 7 and 13 (1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act and in absence thereof,
unmistakably the charge therefor, would fail.
Mere acceptance of any amount allegedly by way of illegal gratification or recovery
thereof, dehors the proof of demand, ipso facto, would thus not be sufficient to bring
home the charge under these two sections of the Act. As a corollary, failure of the
prosecution to prove the demand for illegal gratification would be fatal and mere
recovery of the amount from the person accused of the offence under Section 7 or 13
of the Act would not entail his conviction thereunder."
18. In A. Subair v. State of Kerala, (2009) 6 SCC 587 , the Supreme Court while dwelling on the
purport of the statutory prescription of Section 7 and 13 (1)(d) of the P.C. Act ruled that the
prosecution has to prove the charge thereunder beyond reasonable doubt like any other criminal
offence and that the accused should be considered to be innocent till it is established otherwise by
proper proof of demand and acceptance of illegal gratification, which are vital ingredients necessary
to be proved to record a conviction.

19. In State of Kerala and another v. C. P. Rao, (2011) 6 SCC 450 , the Supreme Court reiterating its
earlier dictum, vis-à-vis the same offences, held that mere recovery by itself, would not prove the
charge Page 33 against the accused and in absence of any evidence to prove payment of bribe or to
show that the accused had voluntarily accepted the money knowing it to be bribe, conviction cannot
be sustained.
20. In the present case, independent witness of prosecution did not support prosecution case insofar
as demand by accused is concerned. Even in his examination in chief deposition, he has stated that
complainant handed over Rs.1000/- to accused but accused asked complainant reason for payment
of money, upon which complainant told him to keep money but accused refused to take the same.
The said independent witness has also stated that he gave a signal to other members of the team
who were waiting outside and they immediately entered into the room and held the accused. The
accused was asked about bribe amount who told them that money was lying upon the table. On his
cross-
examination, independent witness of prosecution has stated that it is a fact that when complainant
paid money to accused, the accused refused to accept the same resulting in some tussle between duo
and that complainant was holding money in his hands and accused was trying to ward-off the hands
of complainant away from him.
21. The other witnesses adduced and examined by prosecution are official witnesses and they had
not been present when complainant is alleged to have tried to give money to accused and they
entered the room only after they were given signal. In such situation, the Trial Court is not correct to
hold that demand allegedly made by accused has been proved. The only other material available is
the recovery of the tainted currency notes not from the possession of the accused but from the table.
Thus, there is no proof of demand to bring home the offence Page 34 punishable under the
provisions of the P.C. Act. The above also will be conclusive insofar as the offence under Section
5(1)(d) read with Section 5(2) of J&K P.C. Act, 2006, is concerned as in absence of any proof of
demand for illegal gratification, the use of corrupt or illegal means or abuse of position as a public
servant to obtain any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage cannot be held to be established.
22. In any event, it is only on proof of acceptance of illegal gratification that presumption can be
drawn that such gratification was received for doing or forbearing to do any official act. Proof of
acceptance of illegal gratification can follow only if there is proof of demand. As the same is lacking
in the present case, the primary facts on the basis of which the legal presumption can be drawn are
wholly absent. In view of the contradictions noticed above in the depositions of key witnesses
examined on behalf of prosecution, I am of the view that the demand for and acceptance of bribe
amount by appellant is not proved beyond reasonable doubt.
23. Having regard to such evidence on record, the acquittal of accused/ appellant is a possible view,
as such, the judgment of the Trial Court is fit to be set aside.
24. In reiteration of the golden principle which runs through the web of administration of justice in
criminal cases, the Supreme Court in Sujit Biswas v. State of Assam (2013) 12 SCC 406, has held

Bashir Ahmad Sheikh Age 65 Years S/O ... vs State Of J&K Through Vok Srinagar on 21 August, 2025
that suspicion, however grave, cannot take the place of proof and the prosecution cannot afford to
rest its case in the realm of "may be" true but has to upgrade it in the domain of "must be" true in
order to steer clear of any possible surmise or conjecture. It was held, that the Court must ensure
Page 35 that miscarriage of justice is avoided and if in the facts and circumstances, two views are
plausible, then the benefit of doubt must be given to the accused.
25. The materials on record when judged on the touch stone of the legal principles adumbrated
hereinabove, leave no manner of doubt that prosecution, in the instant case, has failed to prove
unequivocally, demand of illegal gratification and, thus, I am constrained to hold that it would be
wholly unsafe to sustain the conviction of the appellant under Section 5(1)(d) read with Section 5(2)
of the J&K Prevention of Corruption Act, 2006 Svt and Section 161 RPC as well.
26. In the result, appeal succeeds. Impugned judgment and order dated 20th October 2014, of the
court of Additional Special Judge, Anticorruption, Kashmir, Srinagar is set-aside. Appellant is on
bail. His bail bond stands discharged.
27. Trial record be sent back.
