ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 26-04-2016 The present application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for
short „CrPC(cid:129)), has been filed by the petitioners for quashing the order dated 1st May, 2015 passed
by the learned A.C.J.M., Patna City in G.R. No. 330 of 2015 arising out of Gandhi Maidan P.S.Case
No. 18 of 2015, whereby he has taken cognizance of the offences punishable under Sections 420, 406
and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (for short „IPC(cid:129)) as against the petitioners and summoned
them to face trial.
2. The brief facts of the case are that on the basis of a written information of one Yuvraj Singh, the
Opposite Party No.2, the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 S.H.O. of

3. The informant Yuvraj Singh has stated in his written report that his father Late Raghuraj Singh
was an employee of the Reserve Bank of India, Patna. In 1980, the Reserve Bank Employees
Cooperative Thrift & Credit Society Limited (for short „the Society(cid:129)) purchased land at Mauza
Kurkuri and allotted the same to the employees of the Reserve Bank of India. In the said allotment,
his father was allotted two plots i.e. plots no. 169 and 170 each measuring 2000 sq ft. The said
allotments were made on 27th June, 1989 for Rs.16,087/- each. The membership number of his
father was
724. According to the demand of the then General Secretary of the Society and other members of the
Committee, his father deposited the entire price of both the plots including the registration expenses
with the Society. Thereafter, the Society executed a registered sale deed relating to plot no. 170 in
the name of his father and assured to register the other plot no. 169 also in his name in future, which
could not be registered in his name due to some reason. The members of the Committee, however,
kept on postponing the registration of plot no. Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015
dt.26-04-2016 169 on the ground that the registrations of lands of others are also pending. In the
meantime, elections of the Committee kept on taking place and the members of the Committee kept
on changing and what his father got from them was only assurances. Thereafter, unfortunately, his
father died on 7th August, 1991 and his family began facing a lot of problem.
4. The informant has further averred in his written statement that on 6th September, 2011 the
present General Secretary Mr. Deepak Kumar Sinha (Petitioner No.1) sold plot no. 169 to one
employee Ramanuj Singh (Petitioner No.2) after taking handsome money from him. The informant
has further averred that he came to know that Ramanuj Singh is close associate of one Shailesh
Kumar Singh, co-accused, who was previously General Secretary of the Society and he has further
come to know that Ramanuj Singh never filed any application before the Society for purchase of
land in Mauza Kurkuri nor the Society issued any allotment letter to him allotting the said plot to
him. Thus, the allegation is that the registered sale deed was executed in the name of the accused
Ramanuj Singh without any valid papers.
5. The informant has further contended that the present General Secretary Deepak Kumar Sinha
(Petitioner No.1), previous General Secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh (co-accused since dead) and
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 the witness to the sale deed Kumar
Rajesh @ Bablu (Petitioner No.3), in conspiracy with each other for making handsome money, have
sold the land allotted to his father to Ramanuj Singh and the said Ramanuj Singh, after few months
on 9th April, 2012, executed a registered power of attorney relating to the said land in favour of Smt.
Veena Singh, the wife of the previous General Secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh and few months
thereafter the said Smt. Veena Singh sold half of the land measuring 1000 sq ft to one Sanjeev
Kumar by registered sale deed dated 24th March, 2013.
6. Thus, on the basis of the aforesaid averments, the informant has alleged that it is crystal clear that
Deepak Kumar Sinha (Petitioner No.1), Shailesh Kumar Singh (since dead), Ramanuj Singh
(Petitioner No.2) and Kumar Rajesh @ Bablu (Petitioner No.3) in conspiracy with each other out of
greed for money have sold plot no.169 allotted to his father illegally. Lastly, in his written report, the
informant has stated that action may be taken against the accused persons so that the said plot may

Deepak Kumar Sinha & Ors vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 26 April, 2016
be registered in the name of his mother Draupadi Devi.
7. After institution of the case, the police investigated the same and on completion of investigation
the Investigating Officer of the case submitted police report, vide Charge-sheet No. 52/15 dated 30th
March, 2015, in the court of A.C.J.M., Patna City. Having Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of
2015 dt.26-04-2016 considered the allegations made in the FIR, the statements of witnesses
recorded under Section 161(3) of the CrPC and the police report submitted under Section 173(2) of
the CrPC, the learned A.C.J.M., Patna City took cognizance of the offences punishable under
Sections 420, 406 and 120-B of the IPC as against the petitioners and summoned them to face trial
vide order dated 1st May, 2015.
8. The aforesaid order dated 1st May, 2015 is under challenge in the present application preferred
under Section 482 of the CrPC.
9. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the papers on record.
10. The impugned order dated 1st May, 2015 passed by the learned A.C.J.M., Patna City has been
challenged before this Court by the learned counsel for the petitioners mainly on the following
grounds :
(i) From the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Society held
on 17th August, 1989, it would be evident that it was decided in the meeting that in
view of the increasing demand of the land at Mouza Kurkuri only one plot would be
allotted to its members and the allotment of more than one plot to its members Patna
High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 was cancelled by the Executive
Committee of the Society.
(ii) From the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Committee held on 26th
September, 1989, it would be further evident that it was decided at the meeting that
plot no. 169 returned by Raghuraj Singh, father of the informant, be allotted to
Ramanuj Singh (Petitioner No.2).
(iii) From the photo copy of the Savings Bank Pass Book of Ramanuj Singh
(Petitioner No.2) it would be clear that Ramanuj Singh was also a member of the
Society and his Account/Registration number was 507 and therefore he was entitled
to allotment of a plot at Kurkuri and accordingly an allotment letter was issued to
him allotting plot no. 169.
(iv) From the certificate dated 28th July, 1991 issued under the signature of the then
Director of the Society, namely, Bishwajeet Gawtia, it would be also evident that
Raghuraj Singh, father of the informant Yuvraj Singh had willfully taken back his
money i.e. cost of the plot which he had paid but he failed to return the allotment
letter/token, probably because after registration of the Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 sale deed in his favour regarding plot no. 170 on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166415825/ 3
Deepak Kumar Sinha & Ors vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 26 April, 2016
18th July, 1991, he died soon thereafter on 7th August, 1991.
(v) Raghuraj Singh, father of the informant having got back his money from the
Society which he had paid for getting plot no. 169 registered in his name, had no
grievance against the Society. If he would have any grievance regarding
non-registration of plot no.169 in his name and the allotment of the same to Ramanuj
Singh (Petitioner No.2), he would have easily approached the Registrar, Co-operative
Society for solving the dispute under the Bihar and Orissa Co-operative Societies Act,
but he did not do so.
(vi) The learned A.C.J.M. has erred in law in not appreciating the fact that the
criminal proceeding has been launched more than 24 years after the death of
Raghuraj Singh, father of the informant, just to wage a personal vendetta against the
Secretary of the Society and others.
(vii) The learned A.C.J.M. has further erred in not considering the fact that the
dispute between the parties is essentially a civil dispute and the ingredients of the
offences punishable under Sections 406, 420 and 120-B Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 of the IPC are not attracted as against the
petitioners.
(viii) The learned A.C.J.M. also erred in not appreciating the fact that the alleged
amount of Rs.16,087/- was deposited by the father of the informant in the account of
the Society and it was the Society which had executed the sale deed in favour of
petitioner no.2 Ramanuj Singh but the Society has not been made an accused in the
case and in its absence, the office bearers cannot be prosecuted in a criminal case as
they cannot be held vicariously liable for any offence committed by the Society itself.
(ix) Even going by the allegations made by the informant in the FIR and the
statements of the witnesses recorded during investigation, no offence under Sections
406, 420 and 120-B of the IPC is made out against the petitioners.
11. Per contra, learned counsel for the Opposite Party No.2 Yuvraj Singh has contended that the
claim of transfer of the plot of original allottee (father of the informant) which involves the Ex-
Secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh (since dead), his wife Smt. Veena Singh, a non-member and a close
associate of Ex-Secretary of the Society Ramanuj Singh (Petitioner No.2), the Secretary Deepak
Kumar Sinha (Petitioner No.1) and the identifier of both the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of
2015 dt.26-04-2016 registered sale deeds dated 6th September, 2011 and 24th March, 2013 Kumar
Rajesh @ Bablu (Petitioner No.3), prima facie suggest that they all conspired together in selling the
plot of the original allottee for wrongful gain. He has further contended that there is no question of
personal vendetta and the delay was caused in launching the criminal prosecution because in the
year 2014 when the Opposite Party No.2 and his mother (wife of the original allottee) came to know
about the registration of their plot in the name of one Ramanuj Singh (Petitioner No.2) by the
Secretary of the Society Deepak Kumar Sinha (Petitioner No.1), an objection was raised before the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166415825/ 4
Deepak Kumar Sinha & Ors vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 26 April, 2016
Registrar, Co-operative Societies and the I. G. Registration, Bihar. He has contended that the
minutes of the meeting of the Society dated 26th September, 1989 creates suspicion that when in the
final list dated 31st July, 1991 the name of Raghuraj Singh, father of the informant was mentioned,
how the said plot was allotted in the name of Ramanuj Singh (Petitioner No.2) in place of original
allottee Raghuraj Singh. These materials suggest that some forgery was made in the document
which can be looked into during trial by the trial court.
12. Learned counsel for the Opposite Party No.2 has further contended that for redressal of the
grievance, the opposite party no.2 and his mother have also filed Title Suit No. 185 of 2015 before
the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 civil court four months after
registration of the police case and the same has been filed when no steps were taken by the I.G.
Registration and the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Bihar on the applications submitted by the
Opposite Party No.2.
13. Lastly, it has been contended by the learned counsel for the Opposite Party No.2 that the present
case cannot be treated or said to be dispute of purely civil nature in any manner because there are
several materials on record to show that the intention of the petitioners were dishonest since
beginning. He has contended that the criminal proceedings cannot be thwarted merely because civil
proceedings are pending and should not be quashed merely because of pendency of civil proceedings
between the parties.
14. Having considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties, what is important in
the present case is that the father of the informant, namely, Raghuraj Singh was an employee of the
Reserve Bank of India, Gandhi Maidan, Patna. He was one of the members of the Society in
question, which was registered under the Society Registration Act, 1860. The Society had purchased
lands at Mouza Kurkuri and allotted the same to its members. In the said allotment, Raghuraj Singh
was allotted two plots, i.e. Plots No. 169 and 170 each measuring 2000 sq ft. The said allotments
were made on 27th June, 1989 for Rs.16,087/- each. According to the demand of Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 the then General Secretary of the Society, the father of the
informant had deposited price of both the plots. Thereafter, the Society executed a registered sale
deed relating to Plot no.170 in the name of his father on 18th July, 1991. The allegation is that the
Society failed to register the other plot i.e. Plot No.169 due to some reason.
15. It is an admitted fact that the father of the informant died on 7th August, 1991. The contention of
the informant is that in spite of request being made, the Society and its officials failed to execute the
sale deed in respect of plot no. 169 either in his favour or in favour of his mother and dishonestly the
said plot was sold to the petitioner no.2 Ramanuj Singh by the Society through the then General
Secretary Deepak Kumar Sinha (Petitioner No.1).
16. On the other hand, referring to the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Committee of the
Society held on different dates including 17th August, 1989 and 26th September, 1989, the
petitioners have submitted that in the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Committee dated
17th August, 1989 it was decided that in view of the increasing demand of the land at Mauza Kurkuri
only one plot would be allotted to its members and allotment of more than one plot to its members
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166415825/ 5
Deepak Kumar Sinha & Ors vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 26 April, 2016
was cancelled. It was also decided in the meeting of the Executive Committee held on 26th
September, 1989 that plot no.169 returned by Raghuraj Singh, father of the informant be Patna
High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 allotted to Ramanuj Singh (Petitioner No.2),
who was also a member of the Society and his Account Number was 507 and therefore, he was
entitled to allotment of a plot at Kurkuri and accordingly allotment letter was issued to him allotting
him plot no. 169.
17. Referring to the certificate dated 28th July, 1991 issued under the signature of the then Director
of the Society, it has been submitted that Raghuraj Singh, father of the informant Yuvraj Singh had
willfully taken back his money i.e. cost of the plot which he had paid.
18. Even otherwise, it is not disputed that the allotment of plot no. 169 was made in the name of the
father of the informant, who died way back on 7th August, 1991. It is also not disputed that neither
the sale deed was executed in the name of his father during his life time nor the informant or his
mother took any steps in this regard before filing of the present FIR. The issue, in question, has been
raised by the informant, who is not even a member of the Society, after a long gap of over 24 years.
19. When I look to the sale deed dated 6th September, 2011, as contained in Annexure-A to the
counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Opposite Party No.2, it would be evident that the deed of
absolute sale was executed by the Society in question in favour of the Petitioner No.2, meaning
thereby, that the Society was the vendor Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016
whereas Petitioner No.2 Ramanuj Singh was the vendee of the plot in question. It is true that the
sale deed in question discloses that the Petitioner No.1 Deepak Kumar Sinha had signed the deed in
the capacity of General Secretary of the Society.
20. It is also an admitted fact that four months after instituting the complaint, the informant and his
mother Mostt. Draupadi Devi had filed Title Suit No.185 of 2015 in the court of Munsif-I, Patna. A
copy of the plaint of Title Suit No.185 of 2015 has been brought on record as Annexure-8 to the
present application filed under Section 482 of the CrPC. The cause title of the aforesaid title suit
would make it evident that the Society in question has been impleaded as Defendant No.1 through
its General Secretary Deepak Kumar Sinha (Petitioner No.1). It would be pertinent to note the
averments made by the plaintiffs in paragraph 10 of the plaint of the aforesaid Title Suit, which
reads as under :-
"10. That some time in last month of 2013 the plaintiff got knowledge that the society
executed and registered the sale deed of society plot no.169 in favour of Ramanuj
Singh defendant no.3 who was neither member of society nor he ever (sic) any
application for allotment of said society plot in his favour and the execution and
registration of sale deed for the land of society plot no.169 is void, illegal, fraudulent
and no title and possession passed in defendant no.3 Ram Anuj Singh by such illegal
and fraudulent document. ..."

21. The reliefs prayed for in the aforesaid title suit read as under :
"a. That on adjudication of facts and law as stated above the sale deed dated
06/09/2011 executed and registered by the society with regard to society plot no. 169
in favour of Ram Anuj Singh, the details whereof are given at the foot of the plaint in
schedule 1 be declared illegal, void abinitio and no title and possession passed in
defendant no.3 and defendant no.6 on the basis of sale deed executed by Ram Anuj
Singh in favour of defendant no.6 Sanjeev Kumar with regard to portion of society
plot no.169 area 1000 square feet details whereof given in schedule II to the plaints is
also illegal, void.
b. That on grant of relief no.1 defendant no. 1 and 2 be directed to execute and
register sale deed with respect to society plot no.169 in favour of plaintiffs as heirs of
deceased Raghu Raj Singh as per allotment letter issued to him on 27/06/1989.
c. That the defendants be restrained by issuing temporary injunction from alienating
the suit properties by any of mode or changing the nature in the same during
pendency of suit.
d. That the cost of suit be also awarded in favour of the plaintiffs against the
defendants.
e. To other relief or reliefs be also granted to the plaintiffs as entitled."
(underlining mine) Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016
22. It is pertinent to note here that it is an admitted fact that the Society in question is registered
under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The registration gives the Society a legal status. When
the Society is registered, it and its members become bound to such extent as if each member had
signed the memorandum. All Societies registered under the Societies Registration Act enjoy the
status of legal entity apart from the members constituting it. Every registered Society, being a legal
entity, is capable to acquire and hold the property and it can sue and be sued. There is no concept of
partnership or ownership in case of a registered Society. There may be Executive Committee and the
office bearers may be from amongst the members of the Society. However, a Society registered
under the Societies Registration Act is not a body-corporate as in the case in respect of a Company
registered under the Companies Act. In that view of the matter, a Society is not a juristic person. It is
to be sued in the name of such person as shall be appointed by the Governing Body such as
President, Chairman, Secretary or Trustees. A registered Society may not be prosecuted in criminal
court and that itself cannot be a ground to hold prosecution of its General Secretary to be bad.
23. However, what is of importance in the present case is that the sale deed, in question, is
registered one and has not been declared null and void by any court of law.
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166415825/ 7
Deepak Kumar Sinha & Ors vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 26 April, 2016
24. Further, it is needless to say that before a person can be said to have committed criminal breach
of trust within the meaning of Section 406 of the IPC, it must be established that he was either
entrusted with the property or entrusted with dominion over the property, which he is said to have
converted for his own use. It must be further shown that such dominion was the result of
entrustment. The act of breach of trust per se may involve a civil wrong but a breach of trust with an
ingredient of mens rea would give rise to criminal prosecution. The basic requirements to bring
home accusation under Section 406 of the IPC are the requirements to prove that the accused was
entrusted with the property and he dishonestly used or disposed of that property.
25. As noted above, the Society is registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, having right
to sue and liability to be sued. There is nothing on record on the basis of which it can be said that the
petitioners dishonestly converted the amount deposited by the father of the informant for his own
use so as to satisfy the ingredients of Section 406 of the IPC.
26. From the averments made in the FIR as also from the materials on record, I find that there is
vague and bald allegation that the accused persons with dishonest intention in conspiracy with each
other have sold plot no. 169 allotted to the father of the informant. Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 The last two lines of the written report submitted by the informant,
which is in Hindi and which is of extreme importance, are quoted as under :-
"
"
(English Translation) (An appropriate step may be taken so that said plot no.169 may be registered
in the name of my old mother Draupadi Devi.)
27. From the above contention made in the written report, it would be apparent that the prime
concern of the informant is that the plot in question i.e. plot no.169 be registered in the name of his
mother. It is pertinent to note here that for the aforesaid relief, the aggrieved party has to approach
the civil court for cancellation of the sale deed executed in favour of petitioner no.2 Ramanuj Singh.
As already noted above, the informant along with his mother Mostt. Draupadi Devi has already
taken steps in this regard by filing Title Suit No. 185 of 2015 before the court of Munsif, Patna.
28. As far as the offence of cheating is concerned, the same is defined under Section 415 of the IPC
for which punishment is provided under Section 420 of the IPC. Section 415 of the IPC reads as
under :
"415. Cheating --
Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 dishonestly induces the person so deceived to
deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any
property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166415825/ 8
Deepak Kumar Sinha & Ors vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 26 April, 2016
which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission
causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation
or property, is said to "cheat"."
29. From the above language of the Section, it would be evident that the offence of cheating is made
of two ingredients; (i) deception of any person; (ii) fraudulently or dishonestly inducing any person
to deliver a property to any person or persons to retain any property. To put it differently, the
ingredients of the offence are that the person deceived delivers to someone a valuable security or
property, that the person so deceived was induced to do so, that such persons acted on such
inducement in consequence of his having deceived by the accused acted fraudulently or dishonestly
when so inducing the person.
30. In Hridaya Ranjan Prasad Verma & Ors. Vs. State of Bihar & Anr., [(2000) 4 SCC 168], in
paragraph 15, the Supreme Court observed as under :-
"15. In determining the question it has to be kept in mind that the distinction
between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine one. It depends
upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by
his subsequent conduct but for this subsequent conduct is not the sole test. Mere
breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless Patna
High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 fraudulent or dishonest
intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction, that is the time when the
offence is said to have been committed. Therefore it is the intention which is the gist
of the offence. To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had
fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From his mere
failure to keep up promise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the
beginning, that is, when he made the promise cannot be presumed."
31. In Murari Lal Gupta Vs. Gopi Singh, [(2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 430], the Supreme Court quashed the
criminal complaint instituted under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC on the following analysis :
"The complaint does not make any averment so as to infer any fraudulent or
dishonest inducement having been made by the petitioner pursuant to which the
respondent parted with the money. It is not the case of the respondent that the
petitioner does not have the property or that the petitioner was not competent to
enter into an agreement to sell or could not have transferred title in the property to
the respondent. Merely because an agreement to sell was entered into which
agreement the petitioner failed to honour, it cannot be said that the petitioner has
cheated the respondent. No case for prosecution under Section 420 or Section 406
IPC is made out even prima facie. The complaint filed by the respondent and that too
at Madhepura against the petitioner, who is a resident of Delhi, seems to be an
attempt to pressurize the petitioner for coming to terms with the respondent."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166415825/ 9
Deepak Kumar Sinha & Ors vs State Of Bihar & Anr on 26 April, 2016
32. From the aforesaid decisions, it is quite clear that unless there is an allegation that there was
intention to deceive right from the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016
beginning or dishonest intention having been made by the accused pursuant to which the
complainant parted with the money, the offences punishable under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC
would not be attracted.
33. The facts of the present case clearly suggest that the informant was never deceived nor he or
anyone else was induced to deliver the property. What was done was so reflected in the resolution
and minutes of the Executive Committee of the Society and the sale deed in question.
34. Here, in the present case, it is not the case of the informant that the plot in question was not the
property of the Society or that the petitioner no.1 Deepak Kumar Sinha in the capacity of the General
Secretary of the Society was not competent to sell the plot or could not have transferred the title in
the property to the petitioner no.2 Ramanuj Singh. Merely because initial allotment of the plot in
question was made in the name of the father of the informant on 27th June, 1989 by the Society,
which was subsequently cancelled by the Society and further allotment of the said plot was made in
the name of another member of the Society (Petitioner No.2) and the same was ultimately
transferred in his name by executing the sale deed, it cannot be said that the petitioners have
cheated the informant.
35. As far as the offence of criminal conspiracy for which Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25752 of
2015 dt.26-04-2016 punishment is prescribed under Section 120-B of the IPC is concerned, the
ingredients of the criminal conspiracy are that there should be an agreement between the persons
who are alleged to have conspired and the said agreement should be for the doing of an illegal act or
for doing by illegal means an act which by itself may not be illegal. Here, in the present case,
execution of sale deed by the Society through its General Secretary in favour of one of its members
for consideration cannot be termed to be an illegal act or an act done by illegal means. Hence, in the
opinion of this Court, the offence punishable under Section 120-B of the IPC is also not attracted in
the present case.
36. Regard being had to the facts of the present case, this Court has no doubt in its mind that the
dispute raised in the present case is essentially and purely a dispute of civil nature.
37. In that view of the matter, the institution of a criminal case against the petitioners and taking
cognizance of the offences mentioned above, vide impugned order dated 1st May, 2015, is clearly an
abuse of the process of the court.
38. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 1st May, 2015 passed by the learned A.C.J.M., Patna City
in G.R. No. 330 of 2015 arising out of Gandhi Maidan P.S.Case No. 18 of 2015 summoning the
petitioners to face prosecution for the offences punishable under Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25752 of 2015 dt.26-04-2016 Sections 406, 420 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code is, hereby,
quashed.
39. The application stands allowed.
