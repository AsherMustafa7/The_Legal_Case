The following observations of Justice Krishna Iyer, in STATE OF KARNATAKA vs. RANGANATHA
REDDY1, at paragraph 53, should prelude the framing of this judgment:
"...a glance at the raw realities, to abolish which Article 31(2), Article 31C and Articles
38 and 39 have been enacted, is necessary. Poverty has, for ages, been the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 7
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
omnipresent reality of Indian life. Stark inequalities have been chronic and the
'hidden hunger' (to use Myrdal's phrase) of the people have pushed the Freedom
Movement forward in the socialistic direction toward a better life. The fasciculus of
clauses in the Constitution we have referred to is calculated to prevent the revolution
of rising expectations from becoming a revolution of (1977) 4 SCC 471 C/W
W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 rising frustrations.
These compulsions must inform legal interpretation..."
Petitioners claiming to be owners of tenanted non- agricultural lands, are invoking writ jurisdiction
of this court for laying a challenge to the constitutionality of the Karnataka Conferment of
Ownership on Mulageni or Volamulageni Tenants Act, 2011 (hereafter 'impugned Act'), whereby full
ownership is sought to be bestowed on the tenants/sub-tenants on payment of compensation to be
determined by the Competent Authority on normative basis. After service of notice, the
Respondent-State has entered appearance through the learned AGA and the private Respondents
are represented through their Advocates on record. Statements of Objections, Addl. Statements of
Objections, Replies/Rejoinders & Statements of Facts have been filed voluminously. II.
SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS:
(a) The State Legislature lacks competence to enact the impugned Act inasmuch as
the subject matter thereof is relatable to Entries 6 & 7, List-III of Seventh Schedule to
the Constitution of India and that the field is already occupied by the Central
Legislations namely the Transfer
- 10 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 of Property Act, 1882 & the
Registration Act, 1908. Respondents' reliance on Entry 18, List-II of Seventh Schedule for
supporting legislative competence is misplaced since it does not authorize acquisition of property.
(b) Presidential Assent purportedly granted under Article 254(2) of the Constitution, is without due
application of mind; there was no sufficient material made available to the President whilst securing
his Assent. This apart, purportedly the Assent being for a specific purpose, its efficacy would be
confined to that purpose only and therefore, does not put the Act under the protective umbrella of
Article 31C, more particularly when it is not intended to give effect to Article 39(b) & (c).
(c) Although after the 44th Amendment to the Constitution in 1978, the Right to Property is no
longer a Fundamental Right in terms of erstwhile Article 19(1)(f), its being recognized as a human
right, assumes the character of a Fundamental Right to the extent other Fundamental Rights
guaranteed under Articles 19(1) & 21 depend upon the property for their meaningful exercise; under
Article 26, the religious denominations too have a Fundamental Right to own property. The
impugned Act being in gross violation of these rights, is liable to be struck down.
(d) The impugned Act is violative of Article 300A that guarantees Right to Property inasmuch as
there are no elements of public purpose/public interest; the doctrine of eminent domain recognized
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 8
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
under the said Article is not invocable; further, the compensation normatively determinable under
the Act being apparently illusory, renders the legislative action as a confiscatory measure
unsustainable on the anvil of Constitution.
(e) The impugned Act is grossly discriminatory inasmuch as it singles out only permanent leases for
a
- 11 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 detrimental treatment leaving
out leases of long tenures such as 99 years, 999 years or the like. It is discriminatory also because of
its selective application to the districts of Dakshina Kannada & Udupi, when leases of the kind do
obtain in all parts of the State if not the country.
(f) The impugned Act has been hastily made without ascertaining the relevant factors such as the
number of mulagenidars that are intended to be benefited, the number of muldars that would be
detrimented, the critical adjustment of financial positions of muldars & mulagenidars, the number
of litigations concerning the mulageni and such other things; the legislature has been swayed away
by the untrue statistical data and other factors; thus, the impugned Act suffers from a 'manifest
arbitrariness' and a 'massive unjustness' that render it vulnerable for challenge under Article 14 of
the Constitution.
III. SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS:
(a) The State has legislative competence for making the impugned Act whose subject
matter essentially relates to Entry 18, List-II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution,
since admittedly, it concerns non-agricultural lands; the Entries in the legislative lists
being only the fields of legislation and not the units of legislative enablement, have to
be construed in their widest amplitude and that there is a strong presumption in
favour of constitutionality of the plenary legislations.
(b) There was letter correspondence between the legislative department of the State
and the office of the President of India which eventually resulted into the grant of
Assent to the impugned Act inter alia under Article 254(2); the said Assent being in
general terms would extend to other protective provisions of the Constitution such as
Article 31C; whether the President had applied his
- 12 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 mind before according consent
cannot be the subject matter of deeper examination in judicial review.
(c) Petitioners cannot much bank upon Articles 14 & 19 of the Constitution for assailing the
impugned Act once President has Assented thereto; the very purpose of Assent of the President
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 9
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
under Article 31C is to insulate the legislation from attack under these Articles, subject to all just
exceptions into which argued case of the Petitioners does not fit.
(d) After 44th Amendment to the Constitution, the Right to Property is no longer a Fundamental
Right although it enjoys constitutional protection under Article 300A; there is no property that is
immune from acquisition for public purpose and ordinarily, on payment of compensation. 'Right to
Property is a human right' does not make much sense qua muldars in the context of the case;
mulagenidars too have human rights that need to be protected and the impugned Act intends to do
that by giving effect to the Directive Principles enshrined in Clauses (b) & (c) of Article 39.
(e) There is a very strong presumption that the legislature understands needs of the people and
legislations are made to address such needs; the impugned Act is made after ascertaining all the
relevant factors including the statistical data as to muldars & mulagenidars and of the mulageni
litigations pending or potential, as broadly indicated in its Premble; Preambular version of a plenary
legislation cannot be challenged; 'manifest arbitrariness' is not a constitutional ground for
invalidating the legislation; even otherwise, such a ground is not made out; no enactment can be
struck down by just saying that it is unjust & unreasonable especially when because of Presidential
Assent under Article 31C, invocation of Articles 14 & 19 is barred.
- 13 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016
(f) The impugned Act is not confiscatory in nature; it is a piece of acquisition law that is recognized
under Article 300A; it is made to effectuate a public purpose; it provides for payment of
compensation on capitalization method, which is popularly operated in matters like this; by no
stretch of imagination, compensation determined at the rate of 500 or 1000 times of the annual rent
can be said to be illusory; our Constitution does not require that the compensation should be
determined on the basis of market value; muldars are not the absolute owners of the properties in
question, the absolute ownership being vested in the State; in extreme cases, there can be
acquisition sans compensation too.
IV. Having extensively heard learned Advocates appearing for the parties and having perused the
Petition Papers, in the light of relevant of the Rulings cited at the Bar, the following questions are
broadly framed for consideration:
1. Whether the State has legislative competence to enact the Karnataka Conferment
of Ownership on Mulageni or Volamulageni Tenants Act, 2011...?
2. Whether the Presidential Assent accorded to the Act under Article 254(2) of the
Constitution suffers from any infirmity...?
3. If the Presidential Assent is secured to the impugned Act under Article 254(2) of
the Constitution, does it extend to the protective

4. Whether the impugned Act is discriminatory inasmuch as it does not critically differentiate
between the leases in perpetuity and leases of very long tenures such as 99 years or above and
therefore falls foul of Article 14...?
5. Whether the impugned Act is manifestly arbitrary & massively unjust and therefore, is liable to be
struck down in the light of Triple Talaq Judgment of Apex Court...?
6. Whether the impugned Act providing for transfer of property from muldars to
mulagenidars/volamulagenidars lacks in public purpose and therefore, is violative of Articles 26 &
300A of the Constitution...?
7. Whether the compensation payable to the muldars is illusory so as to render the impugned Act
void under Article 300A of the Constitution...?
V. AS TO THE CONCEPT OF MULAGENI LEASES:
(a) Canara is the coastal region of Karnataka State.
It came under British Rule in 1799 after the defeat of Tippu Sultan. In 1863 Canara was divided into
two
- 15 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 districts: The Northern part was
brought under the Bombay Presidency and the South Canara continued under the Madras
Presidency. The history of mulageni lands in South Canara dates back to Vijayanagara Dynasty
(1336) of the fame of 'A Forgotten Empire'2 by Robert Sewell. Harihara Raaya's Minister had
published an official manual on the basis of 'Paraashara Smruti' with copious description about the
assessment of the lands and conversion of grain revenue/rent into money. Normally, the tenant was
paying 1/6th of the crop as rent3. At page 118, John Sturrock, Harold A Stuart4 write: "...The 'muli'
tenure is the characteristic tenure of Canara and the position of the mulavargdar with regard to
Government has been definitely settled in the suit Vyakunta Bapuji v. Government of
Bombay5...1876. In the judgment ... the origin of the term is explained...Mula is derived from the

a root and figuratively, inter alia, the root of a tree or origin of a family. Hence arises the character of
permanence or perpetuity which we find in it when used in composition as in mulavarga and
mulvargdar...in mul-gaini...". Further, at page 119, they write "...during the time of the Mysore
government, when the exactions of Hyder and Tippu and their officers were more than many a
States could bear, such escheats were very numerous, but in large number of cases, the lands were
still cultivated by tenants or 'genigars' who were either the old tenants or new occupiers put in by
government...".
(b) A Coordinate Bench of this court in S.NARAYANACHARYA vs. KALIYAMARDHANA SRI
KRISHNADEVARU OF SRIKRISHNAPUR MUTT6 reproduced an extract from the Standing Orders
of the Board of Revenue of Madras as under:
"A mulgenidar is a lessee of the registered holder. The lease is called mulgeni and the
registered holder's right muli. A mulgenidar has a perpetual lease and is not

the lease..."
While discussing the nature of mulageni, the Apex Court in RAGHURAM RAO vs. ERIC P
MATHIAS7 quoted the following observations in VYAKANTRAYA BIN RAMKRISHNAPPA vs.
SHIVARAMBHAT BIN NAGABHAI8, '...the mulagenis were only tenants, although tenants in
perpetuity holding under their superior landlords, the mulgars, whose estate like that of tenants in
fee simple in England, would appear to have been the highest estates in the land known to the law in
Kanara; and, further, that originally mulageni tenants were not restricted by the terms of their
leases from alienation, the practice had grown up - of leasing the land in perpetuity at a fixed rent,
coupled with such and other restrictions.' Similarly, another Coordinate Bench in CHARLES REGO
vs. FATHER MULLERS CHARITABLE INSTITUTE9, referring to 'the law or land tenure in kanara'
by J.H.A. Mascurenhas quotes the following:
'A mulgenidar is a tenant holding a perpetual lease not removable so long as he pays
his rent and so long as he does not violate the stipulations of the lease entailing
forfeiture"

Council11 held that it operated either as a permanent lease, or as a lease from year to year and that
no intermediate position was open.' The sum & substance of the above discussion is: a mulageni in
the South Canara is a kind of permanent lease or a lease in perpetuity;

(a) There was a statute called The Madras Mulgeni Rent Enhancement Act, 1920 passed by the then
Madras Legislature. Its objects & reasons being relevant are reproduced here:
"Under the terms of MULGENI lease in South Kanara, the land is held in perpetuity
at a fixed rent. In most of such lease deeds granted before the introduction of the
settlement of 1902, the rent was fixed with reference to the old assessment charged at
the settlement of 1819, the lessors not having made any provision for the contingency
of increase.... 3. It is therefore considered desirable to pass a short enactment
providing for the enhancement of mulgeni rents, so as to secure an equitable
distribution of the increased assessment imposed by the resettlement. 4. The scheme
of the Bill is to enable landlord whose lands were leased on MULGENI tenures before
the late settlement to apply to the Collector to enhance the rent payable on the lands
by an amount not exceeding the difference between the old and the new assessment.
The method proposed for the distribution of the increase is the most equitable that
can be arrived at in view of the difficulty of assessing the benefit derived by either
party from the land at the time when the MULGENI lease was originally granted."
South Canara being part of Madras Presidency, this Act was applicable to the mulageni leases in the
region. After the Reorganization of States, this region came to be

Karnataka. This Act came to be repealed by the State Legislature vide the Karnataka Repealing
(Regional Laws) Act of 2011 w.e.f. 16.7.2011, as a prelude to making of the impugned Act. Its
Statement of Objects & Reasons reads as under:
"In the districts of Dakshnina Kannada and Udupi, some types of mulageni leases in
respect of non-agricultural lands mainly house sites are prevailing for various
reasons. The mulgar's or intermediary's right to recover possession being a remote
possibility, the only right available is to receive annual rent. Mulgenidars or
volamulgenidars have already invested considerable amount by putting up
structures, and improvements to the property either residential or commercial, but
are unable to enjoy the holding, to its full extent, on account of reluctance of mulgar
or intermediary to give consent for putting up structures or alienation of interest of
mulgenidars or volamulgenidars. Therefore, the prevailing system of mulgeni lease is
neither advantageous to mulgenidars or volamulagendiars, nor really beneficial to
mulgars or intermediary... Therefore, in public interest, it is proposed to provide for
conferment of ownership on mulgenidars or volamulgenidars and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto. Hence the Bill..."
This Bill passed by the State Legislature, having been reserved by the Governor under Article 200

been accordingly assented to under Article 201 of the Constitution on 13.07.2012.
(b) The salient features of the impugned Act are:
There is no dispute at the Bar as to subject lands being non-agricultural in nature.
Objects and Reasons as also the very Preamble to the impugned Act employ the
expression 'mulageni leases in respect of non-agricultural lands, mainly house sites'.
Sec. 1(1) gives title to the Act;
sub-section (2) gives power to the State Government to specify by Notification the
date with effect from which the Act shall come into force. Sub-section (3) provides for
the initial application of the Act to the district of Dakshina Kannada & Udupi and
authorizes the State Government to extend its application to other parts of the State.
Section 2 is the dictionary clause of the Act. Sec. 3 confers full ownership on
mulagenidar or volamulagenidar, who is in possession of the leasehold, by the
extinguishment of interest of mulgar; the proviso preserves mortgage or charge
affecting such property. Sec. 4 requires payment of compensation by the mulagenidar

claims for ownership. Sec. 7(1) provides for determination of compensation;
sub-section (2) provides for compensation at the rate of 500 times of the rental where
there is no 'non-alienation clause' and 1,000 times of the lease rent where there is
such a clause. Sec. 8 provides for the issuance of certificate of ownership. Sec. 9
provides for appeal within thirty days. Sec.10(1) bars jurisdiction of Civil Courts;
sub-section (2) provides for transfer of pending suits to the Competent Authority.
Sec. 11 enacts removal of difficulties clause. Lastly, Sec. 12(1) is rule making power;
sub-section (2) provides for laying procedure. In the case of mulageni, the lessor is
called 'mulgar' or 'mulidar'; the lessee is called 'mulagenidar';
sub-lessee who is in possession, is called 'volamulagenidar'. These terms along with
other such as 'mulageni lease', 'mulageni rent', 'Competent Authority' are defined in
Sec. 2 of the Act. The Act is published in the Karnataka Gazette dated 25.7.2012.

LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCE:
(a) Article 1(1) of our Constitution says 'India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of
States'. It means a federation of States, may be with peculiarities of its own.
Every federation requires a division of powers between the federal government and the provincial
ones. In our system, this is effected by Part XI of the Constitution. Articles 245 to 255 deal with the
distribution of legislative powers. As was under the Government of India Act, 1935, there is a
three-fold distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States under this Article in
terms of three Legislative Lists in the Seventh Schedule. List-I i.e., Union List includes subjects
which the Union shall have exclusive power of legislation including 98 items/subjects. List-II i.e.,
State List comprises 59 items or Entries over which the State Legislature shall have exclusive power
of legislation. List-III i.e., Concurrent List simultaneously gives power of legislation to the Union
and the State Legislatures over 52 items; the repugnancy between the Central Law and the State Law
is resolved in

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 terms of Article 254. This matter
has been succinctly discussed by the Apex Court in UNION OF INDIA vs. RAJENDRA N SHAH12:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 15
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
"A cursory reading of these Articles would show that whereas Parliament may make
laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India, the legislation of a State may
make laws for the whole or any part of the State. Article 246 then goes on to refer to
laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in 3 Lists contained in the 7th
schedule to the Constitution of India. List I contains subjects or topics on which
Parliament has exclusive power to make laws; List III in the Concurrent List contains
topics on which both Legislatures may make laws; and List II ... gives the States
exclusive power to make laws for such State or part thereof with respect to any of the
matters contained therein. So far as Union territories are concerned, Parliament is
given power under Article 246(4) without constraint as to subject matter as it may
also legislate with respect to topics covered by List II... In a catena of judgments of
this Court, it has been declared that whereas Article 246 contains the power to
legislate, the topics of legislation contained in the three Lists are described as 'fields
of legislation'...It is equally well settled that the various entries in the three Lists are
not 'powers' of legislation, but 'fields' of legislation. The power to legislate is given by
Article 246 and other Articles of the Constitution..."

(b) Learned Sr. Advocate Mr.Uday Holla who led the arguments on behalf of the Petitioners
questioned legislative competence of the State to make the impugned Act. Placing reliance on INDU
BHUSHAN BOSE vs. RAMA SUNDARI DEVI13, he argued that the impugned Act is referable to
Entries 6 & 7 of Concurrent List which relate to transfer of property other than agricultural lands,
whereas Entry 18 of State List relates to agricultural lands. In the second half of paragraph 13 of the
decision, the Apex Court has observed as under:
"We have felt considerable doubt whether the power of legislating on relationship
between landlord and tenant in respect of house accommodation or buildings would
appropriately fall in Entry 21 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of
India Act, 1935, or in the corresponding Entry 18 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to
the Constitution. These Entries permit legislation in respect of land and explain the
scope by equating it with rights in or over land, land tenures including the relation of
landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents. It is to be noted that the relation of
landlord and tenant is mentioned as being included in land tenures and the
expression "land tenures" would not, in our opinion, appropriately cover tenancy of
buildings or of house accommodation. That (1969) 2 SCC 289

reference to relationship between landlord and tenant in respect of vacant lands. In fact, leases in
respect of non-agricultural property are dealt with in the Transfer of Property Act and would much
more appropriately fall within the scope of Entry 8 of List III in the seventh Schedule to the
Government of India Act read with Entry 10 in the same List, or within the scope of Entry 6 of List
III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution read with Entry 7 in the same List. Leases and all
rights governed by leases, including the termination of leases and eviction from property leased,
would be covered by the field of transfer of property and contracts relating thereto..."
(c) Mr.B.V.Acharya, learned Sr. Advocate appearing for the State and Mr.A.G.Holla, learned Sr.
Advocate appearing for the private Respondents per contra contended that the subject matter of
impugned Act is not the private transfer of property by way of contract as is contemplated under
Sec. 5 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (hereafter '1882 Act') but, it is statutory transfer; Entry
18, List II is widely phrased and therefore, needs to be construed expansively to include transfer of
all kinds of land by operation of law. In support of this, they bank upon UNION OF INDIA vs.

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 CHAUDHARY14. Mr.A.G.Holla
submitted that strictly speaking, the subject matter of the Act does not involve transfer of property
as is understood in the realm of law of contract. He reasons out this by telling that there is extinction
of the interest of muldars and enlargement of that of mulagenidar to the level of full ownership.
(d) This court is broadly in agreement with the submissions made on behalf of the Respondents.
Reasons for this are concisely stated as under:
(i) The Five Judge Bench in INDU BHUSHAN, supra had said something about Entry
18, List II, sans articulation, and rightly so because, that case apparently related to
regulation of house accommodation in cantonment area in terms of Entry 3, List I. In
the middle of paragraph 13, the Bench specifically clarified the position: '...However,
it is not necessary for us to express any definite opinion in this case on this point
because of our view that the relationship of landlord and tenant in respect of house
accommodation situated in cantonment area is clearly covered by the Entries in List
I...' That being the position, a passing observation on which Mr.Uday AIR 1979 SC

cannot be treated as "the law declared" for the realm under Article 141 of the Constitution nor as the
ratio decidendi; In view of said clarification, remark of the kind would not partake the character of
an obiter dicta, too. This view gains support from what Salmond on Jurisprudence15 at page 27
writes:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 17
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
"...A precedent is not destroyed merely because it was broadly argued, inadequately
considered, and fallaciously reasoned. Thus, a rather arbitrary line has to be drawn
between total absence of argument on a particular point, which vitiates the
precedent, and inadequate argument, which is a ground for impugning the precedent
only if it is absolutely binding and indistinguishable. There appears to be an
exception if the court in deciding the precedent expressly intimated that the matter
had not been fully considered..."
(ii) The observations made in VALLURI BASAVAIAH, supra by another Five Judge Bench as to
State's legislative competence under Entry 18, List II renders the question no longer res integra, the
same having been answered in so many words in the affirmative; following are the observations at
paragraphs 27, 28 & 29:

- 29 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 "Next, it is urged
that the impugned Act passed by the Parliament was without legislative competence.
It is said that the resolution, as passed by the State Legislature, gave authority to
Parliament to legislate on a particular subject, i.e., 'ceiling on immovable property',
whereas the Parliament contrary to the resolution, passed a law on a different subject
i.e., 'ceiling on urban land'...It is, accordingly, urged that the impugned Act, insofar as
it provides for ceiling for acquisition of vacant land by the State was not in conformity
with the real intendment of the resolution.
We are afraid, the contention cannot be accepted. It is not disputed that the subject
matter of Entry 18, List II of the Seventh Schedule i.e., 'land' covers 'land and
buildings' and would, therefore, necessarily include 'vacant land'. The expression
'urban immovable property' may mean 'land and buildings', or 'buildings' or 'land'. It
would take in lands of every description, i.e., agricultural land, urban land or any
other kind and it necessarily includes vacant land.
...The State Legislatures were, therefore, aware of the position when they passed a
resolution authorising the Parliament to make a law in respect of urban immovable
property. Their intention was to include the lands within the territorial area of a
municipality or other local body of an urban area and also its peripheral area..."

KHACHAR vs. STATE OF GUJARAT16, at paragraphs 10 & 12 has said as follows:
"Land in Entry 18 is not restricted to agricultural land alone but includes non-
agricultural land etc. The words "rights in" or "over land" confer very wide power
which are not limited by rights between the land holders inter se or the land holder or
the State or the land holder or the tenant. It is seen that restriction or extinction of
existing interest in the land includes provision for abolition and extinguishment of
the rights in or over the land... 12. Land in its widest signification would therefore
include not only the surface of the ground, cultivable, uncultivable or waste lands but
also everything on or under it. In Jagannath Singh v. State of U.P., AIR (1960) SC
1563 p. 1568, this Court held that the word "land" is wide enough to include all lands
whether agricultural or non-agricultural land..."
(iv) In RAM KRISHAN GROVER vs. UNION OF INDIA17, which Mr.A.G.Holla pressed into service
a three Judge Bench of the Apex Court inter alia having considered INDU BHUSHAN, has made the
following observations at paragraph 27:
"A Constitutional Bench judgment of this Court in Indu Bhushan Bose v. Rama
Sundari Debi and Another 8 had inter alia examined Entry 3 in List I, Entry 18 in List
II and Entries 6, 7 and 13 in List III to observe that the general power of legislating in

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 be traced either under Entry 18
of List II or Entries 6 and 7 of List III. The expression 'land tenures including the relation of
landlord and tenant' appearing in Entry 18 of List II, it was observed, was used only with reference
to the relationship of landlord and tenant in respect of vacant lands and does not cover tenancy of
buildings or house accommodation.
Nevertheless, the Court did not give a finding in definite terms as the relationship of landlord and
tenant in question was in respect of a house accommodation situated in a cantonment area and
therefore was covered by Entry 3 of List I which vests exclusive power to make laws for the
cantonment areas in the Parliament..."
(v) It has been a settled position of law that ordinarily, when a decision of a larger Bench is
construed by a smaller Bench of the Apex Court in a particular way, it is not open to any court lower
in the hierarchy to construe it in variance thereof. Added, the Division Bench of this court in
H.MUNISWAMY GOWDA vs. MANAGEMENT OF KARNATAKA STATE ROAD TRANSPORT
CORPORATION18 while stressing the need for Smaller Benches to follow the decisions of larger
Benches, reiterated the position that the hierarchical system of courts prevalent in our country
mandates upon each lower tier including the High Court to accept loyally the decisions of the

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Holla vehemently pressed into
service, has to remain miles away.
In the light of above discussion, this court answers the first question as to legislative competence of
the State to make the impugned Act, in the affirmative. VIII. AS TO INVALIDITY OF ASSENT OF
THE PRESIDENT:
(a) It was argued on behalf of the Petitioners that Assent of the President is no Assent
in its true sense and therefore, the impugned Act is not a legislation; Assent was
secured without furnishing necessary & relevant material; due application of mind in
the assenting process is not demonstrable by records; the Assent of the President
being even otherwise unsustainable, the impugned Act is liable to be struck down in
its entirety. In support of this, they pressed into service the doctrine of occupied field.
Learned Sr. Advocates Mr.B.V.Acharya and Mr.A.G.Holla controverted the same,
adding that the
- 33 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Assent of the President having
been secured in general terms, is in lieu of that of the Governor and therefore, there need not be
duplication of Assent by the Governor; Assent of the President under Article 254(2) is essentially
that of the Central Government which had a dozen letters of the State Government as to the subject
matter; the very clarification sought for by the Central Government and furnished by the State
Government demonstrates due application of mind; even otherwise, the constitutional functions like
the assenting should be presumed to have been done with due application of mind and in
accordance with law. In support of these rival contentions, they banked upon certain rulings.
(b) Petitioners' contention as to invalidity of Presidential Assent granted under Article 254(2) of the
Constitution is essentially structured on a premise that the subject matter of impugned Act relates to
Entries 6 & 7, List III, with which the 1882 Act & the 1908 Act are relatable. However, as already
discussed above, the impugned Act is relatable exclusively to Entry 18, List II.
- 34 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 This court finds it difficult to
agree with Petitioners' plea as to there being any repugnancy of the kind because:
Firstly, the impugned Act provides for 'compulsive transfer' by the competent
authority in favour of mulagenidar/volamulagenidar by order to be made under Sec.
3 read with Sec. 8. Thus, not only there is no essential element of choice with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 20
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
muldars but transfer happens despite their dissent/objection. The 1882 Act, subject
to certain exceptions, does not apply to the cases of transfer by operation of law; the
very Preamble to the said Act employs the expression 'law relating to the transfer of
property by act of parties'. Sec. 5 of the Act reads: '...transfer of property means an act
by which a living person conveys property... to one or more other living persons;..."
Added, Sec. 2(d) also excludes cases of transfer of property by operation of law vide
BHARAT PETROLEUM CORPORATION LIMITED vs. P.KESAVAN19 wherein, it is
observed:
"As would appear from the preamble of the Transfer of Property Act, the same
applies (2004) 9 SCC 772
- 35 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 only to transfer by act of parties.
A transfer by operation of law is not validated or invalidated by anything contained in the Act. A
transfer which takes place by operation of law, therefore, need not meet the requirement of the
provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or Indian Registration Act."
(c) There is force in the submission of Mr.A.G.Holla that extinguishment of landlords' interest in the
subject property and simultaneous enlargement of lessee's to full ownership that happen by
operation of law, may not amount to 'transfer' even in the generic sense of the term. It is more so in
view of very distinct scheme of the impugned Act which unlike in several kindred statutes does not
provide for vesting of the property in the State first and then conveying it to the intended
beneficiaries. Further, what is payable to the landlord is not the price as understood in common
parlance but the compensation whose determination has nothing to do with the market value,
notwithstanding its normative determination. On the same analogy, the 1908 Act too essentially
focuses on the transfer of property by 'act of parties' and not by operation of law, regardless of
dissent of its owner. This
- 36 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Act arguably has the trappings of
fiscal legislation, does not make it any the less adjective law vis-a-vis the 1882 Act. Section 90 of the
1908 Act, inter alia exempts documents executed by the State effecting transfer of property be it
realty or chattel. Whatever reasons for treating the subject matter of impugned Act as not relating to
transfer of property stricto sensu, as discussed in the immediately preceding sub-paragraph, would
hold good for this Act, as well.
(d) There is a wealth of material that repels Petitioners' contention of repugnancy and as to non-
application of mind by the President to the material on record:
(i) The letter correspondence between legislative department of the State and office
of the President reveals that the impugned Act relates to Entry 18, List II [wrongly

printed in this Bill as List III]. In fact, the very Bill itself mentions this. When
President's office vide letter dated 18.4.2011, had sought for clarification, the State
Govt., vide letter dated 2.5.2011 specifically stated "...the subject matter of the
- 37 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Bill falls under entry 18 of list II
of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India which relate to land... no other Articles of
Constitution of India are attracted to any of the provisions of the Bill, other than those already
mentioned in letter dated 23.3.2011". This letter of March also states '...The subject matter of the Bill
falls under entry 18 of list II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.' It further reads
'Accordingly, His Excellency, the Governor of Karnataka is pleased to reserve the said Bill for the
consideration of the President under Article 200 as required by clause (2) of Article 254 and Article
300A of the Constitution of India.' This was on the assumption of the Government Officials (not of
Governor) that clause 3 of the Bill which provides for conferment of ownership was repugnant to the
provisions of 1882 Act and clause 8 which provides for issuance of ownership certificate to the
mulagenidars/volamulagenidars, was repugnant to the provisions of 1908 Act, even when there was
no question of such repugnancy. It is pertinent to note that the Principal Secretary to the Governor
on 21.2.2011 only stated "H.E. the Governor has reserved the Bill for the

and nothing was mentioned about Article 254. It is only from the State Government's letter dated
23.03.2011 that was addressed to the Central Government that the word 'repugnant', and Articles
200, 254(2) & 300A are forthcoming. In other eight letters dated 2/7.05.2011, 18.06.2011,
19.07.2011, 26.08.2011, 24.10.2011, 22.11.2011, 23.12.2011 & 19.01.2012, there is not even a whisper
as to repugnancy, Article 200, Article 254(2), Article 300A or Article 304(b).
(ii) Of the above letters, one dated 7.5.2011, only rectifies Entry 18 of List III as Entry 18 of List II, by
way of reply to the clarification sought for by the Central Government vide letter dated 18.04.2011.
In view of this, court has to assume that the Governor had reserved the Bill in his discretion under
Article 200 and not under Article 254(2), more particularly when no material is placed on record
that these letters were prepared after drawing advertence of the office of Governor. Noticeably, each
of these letters enlists the offices to which copies thereof were marked/mailed and that the office of
Governor is conspicuously absent therein.

(iii) The expression 'reserves for consideration' employed in Article 200 and an almost identical
term 'reserved for consideration' occuring in Article 201 are of significant import. In D.D.BASU's
'Shorter Constitution of India'20, it is aptly stated:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 22
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
"Reserved for consideration.-The words 'reserved for consideration' indicate that
there should be active application of mind by the President to the repugnancy
pointed out between the proposed State law and the earlier law made by Parliament
and necessity of having such a law, in the facts and circumstances of the matter,
which is repugnant to a law enacted by Parliament. The word 'consideration' would
manifest that after careful thinking over and due to application of mind regarding the
necessity of having State law which is repugnant to the law made by Parliament, the
President may grant assent. This aspect is further reaffirmed by the use of word
'assent' in Art.254(2) which implies knowledge of the President to the repugnancy
between the State law and the earlier law made by Parliament on the same
subject-matter and the reasons for grant of such assent. The word 'assent' would
mean in the context as an express agreement of mind to what is proposed by the
State. It indicates the affirmative action of the proposal made by the State for having
law repugnant to the earlier law made by Parliament. It would amount to accepting
or conceding and D.D.Basu, 'Shorter Constitution Of India' 15th Edition, Lexis Nexis,

of the relevant material."
In KAISAR-I-HIND (P) LTD vs. NATIONAL TEXTILE CORPORATION21 supra, at paragraph 73,
the Apex Court echoed the same as under:
'The assent of the President envisaged under Article 254(2) is neither an idle or
empty formality, nor an automatic event, necessitated or to be given for the mere
asking, in whatever form or manner and whether specific, vague, general of indefinite

particular State law vis-a-vis or with reference to any particular or specified law on
the same subject made by the Parliament or an existing law, in force. The repugnancy
envisaged under Clause (1) or enabled under Clause (2) to get excepted from under
the protective coverage of the assent obtained from the President, is such that there is

identical subject matter made by both the Union and the State, both of them being

(iv) The substantive part of Article 200 vests discretion in the Governor to Assent to
or reserve the Bill for the consideration of President. Apparently, it is his individual
discretion vide M/S HOECHST PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED vs. STATE OF
BIHAR22, unlike in other matters where the Governor acts on the aid and advice of
the State Government as discussed in MARU RAM vs. UNION OF INDIA23. This
court is not sure if such a discretion avails to the Governor when it comes to his
reserving the Bill for the consideration of President under Article 254(2) if the
government so requests him on account of repugnancy. The Bill itself having
mentioned Entry 18, List II specifically, one can safely assume that the Governor had
reserved the same for the consideration of President in his individual discretion
under Article 200, and the matter did not travel to the precincts of Article 254(2),
State Official's letter dated 23.3.2011 to the contra, notwithstanding.
(e) It is also relevant to state that a Bill passed by the State Legislature may be
reserved for consideration of (1983) 4 SCC 45 (1981) 1 SCC 107

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 the President inter alia under
Article 200, Article 254(2), Article 31A or Article 31C of the Constitution. The process of
consideration that takes place at the hands of the President i.e., the Central Government, arguably
varies in degrees though not in kind, depending upon the provision under which such Assent has
been sought for and granted. If there was no repugnancy question, why at all the Bill was referred by
the Governor for the Assent of President, is answered in the immediately preceding paragraph.
There is yet another perspective to the same. A Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in
ANDHRA PRADESH STEEL WOOL INDUSTRIES COOPERATIVE SOCIETY LIMITED vs.
LABOUR COURT24, at paragraph 15, has observed as under:
"15. We do not find any substance in the argument that the very fact that the
President's assent was sought and obtained, established beyond doubt that there was
repugnancy between the two legislations. There is no provision in the Constitution
which lays down that a Bill which has been assented to by the President would be
ineffective as an Act if there was no compelling necessity for the Governor to reserve
it for the assent of the President. There AIR 1987 AP 182

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 might be a
genuine doubt about the applicability of any of the provisions of the Constitution
which required the assent of the President to be given to it in order that it might be
effective as an Act. If the Governor in exercise of his discretion decided to reserve the

Bill in such a situation for consideration of the President to avoid any future
complication, that act could not be put forward as a proof of the existence of
repugancy between the parliamentary enactment and the Bill which had been
reserved for the assent of the President."
(f) Such precaution of securing Presidential Assent was warranted because of arguable confusion
owing to some passing observation in INDU BHUSHAN, supra, as to which item of which
Legislative List, the subject matter of the impugned Act in essence was falling into. Bifurcation of
legislative powers is not a thing of ease since the legislative power is one thing and the subject
matter upon which it is exercised is another. Entries in several Legislative Lists have blurred
contours. The legislative items at times keep their arms on each other's shoulders, like row houses
leaning on each other. Entry 18 in List II and Entries 6 & 7 in List III may arguably have a common
penumbra. In this regard, if conflict arises, it can be
- 44 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 likened to the case of boundary
dispute; such a dispute is not as to the existence of boundary but only as to where the blurred
boundary lines lie. It is not uncommon for the Governors to reserve certain Bills in their discretion
under Article 200 for the consideration of President, if there is a genuine doubt as to repugnancy.
What the Apex Court observed in HOESCHT PHARMACEUTICALS, supra, at paragraph 86 being
instructive is reproduced:
"There may also be a Bill passed by the State Legislature where there may be a
genuine doubt about the applicability of any of the provisions of the Constitution
which require the assent of the President to be given to it in order that it may be
effective as an Act. In such a case, it is for the Governor to exercise his discretion and
to decide whether he should assent to the Bill or should reserve it for consideration of
the President to avoid any future complication. Even if it ultimately turns out that
there was no necessity for the Governor to have reserved a Bill for the consideration
of the President, still he having done so and obtained the assent of the President, the
Act so passed cannot be held to be unconstitutional on the ground of want of proper
assent. This aspect of the matter, as the law now stands, is not open to scrutiny by the
courts..."
- 45 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 In KAISAR-I-HIND, supra, at
paragraph 73, it is pertinently observed:
"...The repugnancy envisaged under Clause (1) or enabled under Clause (2) to get
excepted from under the protective coverage of the assent obtained from the
President, is such that there is a legislation or legislative provision(s), covering and
operating on the same field or identical subject matter made by both the Union and

the State, both of them being competent to enact in respect of the same subject
matter or the legislative field, but the legislation by the Parliament has come to
occupy the entire field..."
Article 254(2) deals with the question of supremacy and not of legislative competence. In respect of
conflicting legislation under the Concurrent List, if the State legislation has received the assent of
the President, it will prevail over the Central legislation in that State. The article does not provide
that the State legislation without the assent of the President is incompetent vide ITC LTD vs.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE MARKET COMMITTEE25. Merely because a law is assented to by the
President, at times by abundant caution, one cannot hastily jump to the conclusion that such a law
invariably fits into some or the (2002) 9 SCC 232

Otherwise, one would be putting the cart before the horse.
(g) A perusal of copies of these letters produced by both the sides leaves no manner of doubt that
due consideration of the Bill took place at the hands of President followed by his Assent. No case is
made out as to the non-application of mind. Allegations of non- application of mind against high
constitutional functionaries discharging constitutional functions associated with legislative process,
cannot be entertained as a matter of course. One has to keep in mind the constitutional dignity of
such functionaries, before taking up contentions of the kind. There may be qualitative difference
between Assent of the President to a Bill reserved by the Governor in his discretion under Article
200 and to the one reserved as compulsorily required under the second Proviso to Article 200 or
Article 254(2). However, in the context of case, this aspect of the matter does not assume
significance, especially when the subject matter of the impugned Act relates to Entry 18, List II and
- 47 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 apparently, not to Entries 6 & 7,
List III and as a consequence, Article 254(2) stricto sensu was not required to be invoked. The Bill
passed by the State Legislature having been reserved by the Governor on 20.2.2011 for the
consideration of President under Article 200 of the Constitution, has secured Assent thereto under
Article 201 on 30.7.2012. The President wrote "I assent to this Bill". There was letter
correspondence between the State Government and the Central Government that inter alia
mentioned Article 254(2), on the assumption that the impugned Act was in derogation of 1882 Act &
1908 Act. As already mentioned above, none of these letters was written with the concurrence of the
Governor, nor any copy thereof was marked to his office.
(h) Added, the Certificate issued by the State Government through its Secretary, Department of
Parliamentary Affairs, as a matter of protocol in the proforma as prescribed in Letter
No.19/23/17/JUDL dated 3.8.1972 of the Ministry of Home Affairs of Government of India,
mentioned no Article under which Assent of the

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 President was solicited. This is
immensely significant. There being no repugnancy, as already observed, this Assent of the President
cannot be referred to Article 254(2), stricto sensu. Further, the entire Bill as passed by the State
Legislature was sent to the President, is not in dispute. That being the position, it can be safely
assumed that the Assent of the President has been given under Article 201 in lieu of Assent of the
Governor under Article 200 and resultantly, the Bill became a choate enactment. It is now well
settled position of law that a Bill passed by a State Assembly becomes law if the Governor gives his
Assent to it or if, having been reserved by the Governor for consideration of the President under
Article 200, it is assented to by the President under Article 201. Therefore, Petitioners' contention
that in the absence of any question of repugnancy, the impugned Act being relatable only to Entry
18, List II, Assent of the President secured under Article 254(2) is no Assent and therefore, there is
no choate statute, is liable to be rejected.
- 49 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 In view of the above discussion,
the second question as to the argued infirmity in the Presidential Assent is answered in the negative.
IX. AS TO PROTECTION OF THE IMPUGNED ACT UNDER ARTICLE 31C OF THE
CONSTITUTION AND CONSEQUENT NON-INVOCABILITY OF ARTICLE 14 FOR ITS
INVALIDATION:
(a) Mr.Uday Holla & Mr.Abhinav Ramanand appearing for the Petitioners sought to
falter the impugned Act on the grounds of 'manifest arbitrariness' in the light of
SHAYARA BANO vs. UNION OF INDIA26, and 'massive unjustness'.
Mr.B.V.Acharya & Mr.A.G.Holla per contra repelled the contention and its invocation
contending that the impugned Act is made to effectuate the Directive Principles
enshrining in Article 39(b) & (c) of the Constitution and therefore, it enjoys
protection under proviso to Article 31C, since President has accorded Assent in
general terms. They read aloud what the Apex Court said in SANJEEV COKE

- 50 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 "When Article 31-C comes in,
Article 14 goes out. There is no scope for bringing in Article 14 by a side wind as it were, that is, by
equating the rule of equality before the law of Article 14 with the broad egalitarianism of Article
39(b) or by treating the principle of Article 14, as included in the principle of Article 39(b)..." They
also quoted what TINSUKHIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY CO. LTD VS STATE OF ASSAM28 observed:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 27
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
"...Articles 31-A and 31-C were significant Constitutional milestones in the harnessing
and socialisation of the concept of the right to property which, in its laissez-faire
trappings, became an unruly horse. Article 31-C in effect and substance is to urban
property what Article 31-A is to agricultural-property..."
Mr.Uday Holla countered them by saying that SANJEEV COKE to the extent of being in variance
with MINERVA MILLS, is per incuriam and therefore, impugned Act cannot seek refuge under its
umbrella. He also argued that the added provisions of Article 31C vide 42nd Amendment Act, 1976
which extended protection to the statutes made to give effect to any of the Directive Principles in
Part IV having been struck down in MINERVA MILLS, the original (1989) 3 SCC 709
- 51 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 position therein is restored and
that does not extend protection to the impugned Act under Article 31C.
(b) A question arises as to whether the said Assent of the President can be construed as the one inter
alia referable to the proviso to Article 31C so that the impugned Act would get insulation from attack
on the grounds that traditionally fall under Article 14 of the Constitution. The significance of Assent
and the sanctity of assenting process have been discussed by the Apex Court in KAISAR-I-HIND,
supra, at paragraph 77, as under:
"The assent of the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is considered to be
part of the legislative process only for the limited purpose that the legislative process
is incomplete without them for enacting a law and in the absence of the assent the
Bill passed could not be considered to be an Act or a piece of legislation, effective and
enforceable and not to extend the immunity in respect of procedural formalities to be
observed inside the respective houses and certification by the presiding officer
concerned of their due compliance, to areas or acts outside the besides those
formalities. The powers actually exercised by the President, at any rate under Articles
31A, 31C, 254(2) and 304(b) is a special constituent power vested with the Head of
the Union, as the protector and defender of the Constitution and safety valve to
safeguard the Fundamental Right of

Federal structure of the country's policy as adopted in the Constitution. A genuine,
real and effective consideration would depend upon specific and sufficient
information being provided to him inviting, at any rate, his attention to the Central
law with which the State law is considered or apprehended to be repugnant, and in
the absence of any effort or exercise shown to have been undertaken, when
questioned before courts, the State law cannot be permitted or allowed to have
predominance or overriding effect over that Central enactment of the Parliament to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 28
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
which no specific reference of the President at all has been invited to. This, in my
view, is a must and an essential requirement to be satisfied; in the absence of which
the 'consideration' claimed would be one in vacuum and really oblivious to the hoard
of Legislations falling under the Concurrent List in force in the country and enacted
by the Parliament. To uphold as valid the claim for any such blanket assent or all
round predominance over any and every such law - whether brought to the notice of
the President or not, would amount to legitimization of what was not even in the
contemplation or consideration on the basis of some assumed 'consideration'..."
(c) There is absolutely no material placed on record from the side of Respondents to indicate that
the consideration of the Bill at the hands of the President was sought for under the Proviso to Article
31C or that the President having otherwise adverted to that aspect of the matter has accorded the
Assent. In none of the letters
- 53 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 (i.e., nine from the State
Government & one from the Central Government) that constituted the official correspondence,
there is any whisper as to Article 31C nor to Article 39(b) & (c). The expression 'general term'
occurring in RAJIV SARIN vs. STATE OF UTTARAKHAND29 cannot be construed out of the
context. It has to be understood keeping in view the broad theme of the said decision. That being the
position, the contention that the subject Assent of the President arguably granted in general terms
could be effective for all purposes including the Proviso to Article 31C and therefore, the impugned
Act is insulated from challenge on the grounds that normally fall under Article 14, cannot be
countenanced. An argument to the contrary would undermine the significance of the Assent and its
processual sanctity which the Apex Court has emphasized several times. Courts have to keep in
mind that the provisions of the Constitution cannot be construed as those of a Cattle Trespass Act.

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016
(d) The other contention of Mr.Uday Holla as to SANJEEV COKE arguably being in variance with
MINERVA MILLS, is per incuriam and therefore, the impugned Act does not get any protection in
terms of Proviso to Article 31C, does not merit examination, because: Firstly the impugned Act is
made to give effect to the Directive Principles in Articles 39(b) & (c) which figured in the original
text of Article 31C and continue till date; if that be so, one need not see what happened to 42nd
Amendment of 1976 in MINERVA MILLS. Secondly, whether such a protection extends to the laws
made to give effect to all other Directive Principles contained in Part IV is being examined by a
Bench of Nine Judges in PROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA30.
Thirdly, as already discussed above, no Assent of the President is secured to the impugned Act in
terms of proviso to Article 31C. Fourthly, SANJEEV COKE, supra, having adverted to MINERVA
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 29
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023

- 55 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Directive Principles in Part IV of
the Constitution, of course subject to Assent under the Proviso to Article 31C. Even in the latest
decision in UNION OF INDIA vs. TARSEEM SINGH31, the view of SANJEEV COKE is not diluted.
D.D.BASU, supra, at page 539, writes:
"5. But the decision of the majority in the Minerva Mills case to the effect that the
1976 amendment, extending the shield of Art. 31C to all the Directives included in
Part IV was unconstitutional, so that Art. 31C is confined to its pre-1976 position,
namely, protecting only laws implementing Art. 39(b)-(c), has not yet been overruled
by any larger Bench."
In view of the above, the third question as to Assent of the President being in general terms can be
construed as the one given under Proviso to Article 31C and therefore, challenge to the impugned
Act under Article 14 does not lie, is answered in the negative. X. AS TO IMPUGNED ACT DOING
RANK DISCRIMINATION & THEREFORE, FALLING FOUL OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE
CONSTITUTION:
(a) Learned Sr. Advocate Mr.Uday Holla vehemently argued that the impugned Act
suffers from the vice of a blatant discrimination and therefore, the same is liable to be
struck down under Article 14. He submitted (2019) 9 SCC 304
- 56 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 that all leases of immovable
property constitute one homogenous class and therefore, singling out only leases in perpetuity for a
detrimental treatment offends the rule of reasonable classification. He highlighted that when leases
of 99 years and 999 years are permissible and do obtain all over the country, there is no logic in
putting an end to mulagenies, artificially treating them as a class apart. M/s B.V.Acharya &
A.G.Holla appearing for the Respondents per contra contended that the impugned Act having been
made to give effect to the Directive Principle specified in clauses (b) & (c) of Article 39, the State has
done the classification of the leases on normative basis in its legislative wisdom and therefore, it
cannot be struck down as being discriminatory. Mr.Uday Holla disputed the 'argument of nexus'
between the Act & Article 39 contending that there is not even a whisper in the text of impugned Act
about this Article. Mr.Acharya rightly retorted that there is no such requirement in the Legislative
Practice and that even otherwise, nexus can be ascertained from the text & context of such a statute.

Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
(b) Article 14 of the Constitution which guarantees equal protection of the laws and equality before
the law does not prohibit reasonable classification founded on the basis of intelligible differentia
which bears a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the legislation. When a statute
is challenged as being violative of Article 14, it is necessary in the first place to ascertain its
underlying policy and the object which it seeks to achieve; thereafter, the Court has to apply the dual
test namely, whether the classification is rational and based upon an intelligible differentia which
distinguished the persons or things that are grouped together from others left out and whether the
basis of differentiation has rational nexus with its avowed policy & objects. Added, Article 14 does
not insist that the legislative classification should be scientifically perfect or logically complete, since
the legislature & the judiciary are not doing their exercise in the realm of theoretical physics. The
legislature in its wisdom has chosen mulagenidars/volamulagenidars for a protective discrimination
keeping in view the enormous
- 58 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 difficulty being faced by them
despite holding the subject properties on the basis of lease in perpetuity. All other leases are left out
by the legislature in its wisdom and court cannot falter the same, when these lessees constitute a
separate class. Which group of people being distinct requires preferential or protective
discrimination, again is a matter falling within the domain of legislature which understands the
difficulty of its people and knows how it should be tackled. The Apex Court in RAM KRISHNA
DALMIA vs. JUSTICE S.R.TENDOLKAR32 observed as under:
"...that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an
enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a
clear transgression of the constitutional principles; that it must be presumed that the
legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its
laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its
discriminations are based on adequate grounds; that the legislature is free to
recognise degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the
need is deemed to be the clearest..."

down on the ground that Court thinks it to be unwise or unwarranted. Legislatures being composed
of the elected representatives of the people are supposed to know what is good for the citizenry.
(c) The impugned Act conferring ownership on the mulagenidars/volamulagenidars is to
non-agricultural property what the agrarian laws which confer occupancy on the tillers of the land
or abolish zamindari is to the agricultural land, the difference in modalities of accomplishment of

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 come to his aid: Firstly, it did not
relate to 'estate' as defined under Article 31A and therefore, did not enjoy its protection; secondly, it
simply intended to give property of one to another without any real compensation; thirdly, it was
apparently arbitrary in taking possession of the property of poor persons that too with a clock
running reverse by three decades. That is not the case here and thus, the fact matrix of the case at
hands is miles away. It hardly needs to be stated that a decision is an authority for a proposition that
it actually lays down in a given fact matrix and not for all that which logically follows from what has
been laid down vide QUINN vs. LEATHEM34. The said decision is affirmed by the Apex Court in
S.L.P.No.2018-2042/2005 dismissed on 28.2.2005, is of no consequence. The aspects of
compensation are dealt with separately infra wherein, Petitioners' argument as to compensation
being illusory, is repelled.

(d) The objects & reasons specifically mention why the Act is made and what it seeks to achieve. The
Preambular text of the Act is as under:
"Whereas some types of mulageni leases in respect of non-agricultural lands mainly
house sites are mostly prevailing in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts; Whereas,
for various reasons the mulgar's or intermediary's right to recover possession being a
remote possibility, the only right available is to receive annual rent; Whereas,
mulgenidars or volamulgenidars have already invested considerable amount by
putting up structures, and improvements to the property either residential or
commercial, but are unable to enjoy the holding to its full extent, on account of
reluctance of mulgar or intermediary to give consent for putting up structures or
alienation of interest of mulgenidars or volamulgenidars; Whereas, the prevailing
system of mulgeni lease is neither advantageous to mulgenidars or volamulagendiars
nor really beneficial to mulgars or intermediary, but on the other hand differences
between the two have given rise to speculative transactions. Whereas, conferment of
ownership on mulagenidars or volamulagenidars on their paying certain amount to
mulgars or intermediary in respect of conferment of their rights and interests in the
holdings will put an end to multiplicity of litigation and eliminate scope for vested

interests to indulge in speculative transactions and thus benefit mulgars,
intermediary, mulagenidars or volamulgenidars; And whereas, for the purposes
hereinbefore stated, it is expedient in the public interest to provide for conferment of
ownership on mulgenidars and volamulgenidars..."

(e) The vehement submission of Mr.Uday Holla that the very contents of Preamble are not true, and
that the legislature without any basis has assumed certain things on the basis of which the impugned
Act is enacted, is a bit difficult to countenance. In English Legislative Practice, ordinarily the
Preamble to the legislation is not quoted in the Parliament and therefore, is not treated as part of the
statute unlike in our Legislative Practice. A Preamble unless inserted to a statute retrospectively is a
key to open the mind of a legislature. True it is that it has some ideal elements and something in it
may not be true too. 'A Preamble cannot be used to control or qualify precise & unambiguous
language of the enactment' said Apex Court in TRIBUVAN PRAKASH NAYYAR vs. UNION OF
INDIA35. The repeal of the preamble simplicitor will not affect the construction of the statute36. As

AUGUSTUS37 observed, there may be no exact correspondence between Preamble and the
enactment. No judicial authority nor any juristic opinion is cited at the Bar to the effect that a
statute can be struck down on the ground that what is stated in its Preamble is demonstrably untrue
or runs counter to its avowed policy content. Mr.A.G.Holla is right in drawing attention of the court
to the observations in SARDAN INDER SINGH vs. STATE OF RAJASTHAN38 wherein, at latter
part of paragraph 13, it is observed: "...We should add that the petitioners sought to dispute the
correctness of the recitals in the preamble. This they clearly cannot do vide observations of Holmes
J. in Block v. Hirsh [1920] 256 U.S. 135..."
(f) Mr.Uday Holla's contention that mulageni leases i.e., leases in perpetuity, do obtain all over the
country in general and in several regions of the State in particular, is supported by a catena of
decisions cited by him namely:

made applicable to Mangalore & Udupi Districts, can be extended by the government vide
notification, to other parts of the State. The enabling provision in this regard i.e., sub-section (3) of
section 1 reads:

- 65 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 The impugned Act can be termed
as a 'Conditional Legislation' notion of which is not alien to jurisprudence, world over. The
Australian High Court speaking through O'Connor J., in BAXTER vs. A.H.WAY44 observed as
under:
"Legislation from the very earliest times, and particularly in modern times has taken
the form of conditional legislation leaving it to some specified authority to determine
the circumstances in which the law shall be applied, or to what its operation shall be
extended, or the particular class of persons or goods to which it shall be applied."
This view of the Foreign Court has been approved by our Apex Court in EDWARD MILLS
COMPANY vs. STATE OF AJMER45. Hon'ble Justice Alok Aradhe who edited G.P.Singh's
PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION46, having referred to IN RE DELHI LAWS
ACT47 eruditely states as under:
"A distinction is said to exist between what is called conditional legislation and
delegated legislation proper. In case of conditional legislation, the legislation is
complete in itself (1909) 8 CLR 626 (1955) 1 SCR 735 G.P. Singh, 'Principles of

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 but its operation is made to
depend on fulfillment of certain conditions and what is delegated to an outside authority, is the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 34
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
power to determine according to its own judgment whether or not those conditions are fulfilled...
The distinction between the two exists in this that whereas conditional legislation contains no
element of delegation of legislative power and is, therefore, not open to attack on the ground of
excessive delegation, delegated legislation proper does confer some legislative power on some
outside authority and is therefore open to attack on the ground of excessive delegation..."
(g) All the above having been said, what the 46th Law Commission Report had said about the
introduction of Article 31C assumes relevance:
""By introducing this clause (31-C), Parliament is taking the first major and
significant step towards implementing two of the Directive Principles enshrined in
clause (b) and
(c) of Article 39 in Part IV of the Constitution, and , in that sense, the clause under
consideration can be appropriately described as historic. After it is adopted,
Parliament will have heralded a new era in the pursuit of the goal placed before the
nation by the Constitution to establish social and economic justice in this country...
In the Directive Principles, however, one finds an even clearer statement of the social
revolution. They aim at making the Indian masses free in the positive sense, free
from the passivity engendered by- centuries of coercion by society and by nature, free
from the abject physical conditions that had prevented them from fulfilling their best
selves."

In KESAVANANDA BHARATI vs. STATE OF KERALA48, at pages 502-503, it is observed:
"Part IV of the Constitution is designed to bring about the social and economic
revolution that remained to be fulfilled after independence. The aim of the
Constitution is not to guarantee certain liberties to only a few of the citizens but for
all... To ignore Part IV is to ignore the substance provided for in the Constitution, the
hopes held out to the Nation and the very ideals on which our Constitution is built.
Without faithfully implementing the Directive Principles, it is not possible to achieve
the Welfare State contemplated by the Constitution, a society like ours steeped in
poverty and ignorance satisfying the minimum economic needs of every citizen of
this country. Any Government which fails to fulfil the pledge taken under the
Constitution cannot be said to have been faithful to the Constitution and to its
commitments..."
That being the position, while adjudging vires of a socio- welfare legislation like the one at hands,

XI. AS TO IMPUGNED ACT BEING MANIFESTLY ARBITRARY & MASSIVELY UNJUST:
(a) Mr.Uday Holla vehemently argued that the impugned Act suffers from a 'manifest
arbitrariness' & 'massive unjustness' and therefore, is liable to be struck down in
terms of SHAYARA BANO, supra. He contended that without ascertaining the
socio-economic status of muldars & mulagenidars, the legislature has brought about
the impugned Act, being swayed away by certain statistics furnished by the officials
despite their apparent falsity. He presses into service the 'doctrine of proportionality'
contending that the arguable difficulties of the mulagenidars would have been
trimmed off by making suitable provisions in the impugned Act itself like the one that
voids the restraint on alienation in absoluto.
- 69 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Employing an old English adage
from John Wycliffe's Select English Works (1380), he said, the Act provides for 'robbing Peter to pay
Paul'. He also highlighted about frugality of the compensation payable under the Act which aspect
will be dealt with in due course under a separate heading. Lastly, he said that in the legislative
history of the State, there is no parallel to the Act in question. Learned Sr. Advocates
Mr.B.V.Acharya & A.G.Holla per contra contended to the contrary and thereby, sought to justify the
impugned Act. They reiterated that Apex Court decisions which broke new ground namely 'manifest
arbitrariness' for invalidation of statutes are simply per incuriam, being contrary to half a decade of
constitutional jurisprudence.
(b) It has been a well settled position of law that arbitrariness, being opposed to reasonableness, is
an antithesis to law. There cannot, however, be any exact definition of arbitrariness neither can
there be any strait- jacket formula evolved therefor, since the same is dependent on the varying facts
and circumstances of each

described as one that is irrational and not based on sound reason or as one that is unreasonable.
Any decision, be it a simple administrative decision or a policy decision, if taken without considering
the relevant facts, can only be termed as an arbitrary decision and violative of the mandate of Art. 14
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 36
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
of the Constitution. Actions of the State or its instrumentality uninformed by reason, may amount to
being arbitrary and be liable to be questioned. Arbitrariness is contrary to rule of law, equity, fair
play and justice. In SHAYARA BANO, the Apex Court delineated the idea of 'manifest arbitrariness'
with the following observations:
"Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something done by the legislature
capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle. Also, when
something is done which is excessive and disproportionate, such legislation would be
manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the view that arbitrariness in the sense of
manifest arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would apply to negate legislation as
well under Article 14".
Legislative action that is too disproportionate or excessive, may suffer invalidation on the ground of
'manifest
- 71 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 arbitrariness' under Article 14.
Judge Aharon Barak of Supreme Court of Israel in his book 'PROPORTIONALITY:
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS', succinctly delineates the
doctrine as: "...It requires that a rights-limiting measure should be pursuing a proper
purpose, through means that are suitable and necessary for achieving that purpose
and that there is a proper balance between the importance of achieving that purpose
and the harm caused by limiting the right...". A Five Judge Bench of the Apex Court
in SHAYARA BANO, supra, reiterated that 'manifest arbitrariness' avails as a ground
for invalidation of plenary legislation. That being the position, this court rejects the
contention that this decision and other, are per incuriam. It is not that what the Apex
Court said is for the first time and in a sporadic way and therefore, this decision lacks
precedential value. Contra contention of Mr.B.V.Acharya & Mr.A.G.Holla cannot be
accepted without offending the text of Article 141 of the Constitution and the
rudiments of law of precedent as discussed in H.MUNISWAMY GOWDA, supra.
- 72 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016
(c) Manifest arbitrariness availing as a ground for invalidation of a legislation is one
thing and substantiation of such a ground is another. Contention of the kind needs to
be substantiated by cogent material with which the impugned Act is woven or by
demonstrating that it brings about massively unjust result which no legislature in any
circumstances would have intended, in the constitutional scheme. Despite strenuous
submission, counsel for the Petitioners could not make out such a case, to say the
least. If tenants of agricultural lands can be conferred with permanent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 37
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
occupancy/ownership under the agrarian legislations like Sec. 48A of the Karnataka
Land Reforms Act, 1961, this court sees no reason or rhyme as to why something of
that kind cannot be done in respect of urban/housing lands, so that the suffering
tenants in actual possession thereof get emancipation from the clutches of
landlords/lessors. Therefore, the argument of 'no parallel' does not merit acceptance.
Even otherwise, plenary power of legislation does not admit an argument of the kind
inasmuch as it is always open to the legislature
- 73 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 to enact whatever measure it
wants to and that the exercise of such power is not controlled by availability or non-availability of
precedent or form of the kind. That is how the legislative power conferred by the Constitution
becomes plenary in nature and restrictions de hors constitutional jurisprudence are spurned in any
civilized jurisdictions. No ruling nor any authority to the contrary is cited from the side of
Petitioners. This Act is made apparently to give effect to the Directive Principles enshrined in Article
39(b) & (c), as widely interpreted by the Apex Court in decisions that galore. What Krishna Iyer J.,
eruditely said in RANGANATHA REDDY, supra, is profitably reproduced:
"...The social philosophy of the Constitution shapes creative judicial vision and
orientation. Our nation has, as its dynamic doctrine,, economic democracy sans
which political democracy is chimerical. We say so because our Constitution, in Parts
III and IV and elsewhere, ensouls such a value system and the debate in this case puts
precisely this soul in peril... Our thesis is that the dialectics of social justice should
not be missed if the synthesis of Part III and Part IV is to influence State action and
court pronouncements. Constitutional problems cannot be studied in a
socio-economic vacuum,
- 74 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 since
socio-cultural changes are the source of the new values, and sloughing off old legal
thought is part of the process of the new equity-loaded legality... The credal essence
of the Constitution consists in its Preamble, Articles 38, 39 (b) and (c), 31 and the
bunch of Articles 31A, 31B and 31C... Our emphasis is on abandoning formal
legalistics or sterile logomachy in assessing the vires of statutes regulating vital
economic areas, and adopting instead a dynamic,, goal-based approach to problems
of constitutionality. It is right that the rule of law enshrined in our Constitution must
and does reckon with the roaring current of change which shifts our social values and
shrivels our feudal roots, invades our lives and fashions our destiny... So we have to
view the impugned provisions from the vantage point of socio-legal perception."
(d) The impugned Act intends to relieve the tenants in actual possession by excluding all the
intermediaries from any interference whatsoever, so that they become absolute owners of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 38
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
subject properties and therefore, are no longer subject to any form of feudalistic shackles at the
hands of 'landlords'. It hardly needs to be stated that full ownership enables persons make optimum
use of properties. When nature of holding of a property, agricultural or non-agricultural, undergoes
statutory change as a matter of State Policy, there will be some

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 victimization which is inevitable.
That is the price the victims, if any, pay for being members of a civilized society, that is opening up
to the new constitutional order. After all, it is not a case of acquisition sans compensation, to brand
the impugned measure as being massively unjust. The Apex Court in JILU BHAI, supra which
Petitioners too banked upon observed at paragraph 47 as under:
"It is accordingly clear that in a welfare State envisioned in the directive principles of
State policy, the basic perquisites are that everyone is entitled to minimum material
well being, such as food, clothing, and decent housing. Expanding living standard are
possible with the existing or expanding physical resources and scientific knowledge
etc., and the State has right and duty to act when private initiative fails. In a
democratic society, every individual needs legal protection for the beneficial
enjoyment of what he has discovered and appropriated; has created by his own
labour (in wider sense); and what he has acquired under the existing social and
economic order subject to law and order. Equally welfare consists in adjusting
individual interests with social interest by the aid of law as social engineering, which
would mean public restraints on property designed to mitigate the privileges which
property offers in enjoyment of the things that life has to offer. Restraints on the
power to use the property as a delegated power
- 76 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 of command is
means as of quasi-
governmental private control over the major assets of a nation. Properly, thereby, is
subject to regulation. The directive principles enjoin the State to reorganise the
economic system by law or administrative means and the Fundamental rights are
means to that end to make right to life meaningful, equality of opportunity and of
status and dignity of person a reality...".
Mr.A.G.Holla appearing for the private Respondents is right in telling the court that the legislative
measure in question would bolster the psyche of mulagenidars/volamulagenidars and even such
factors lend legitimacy to legislative the actions of the State. In support of this submission, he is
more than justified in banking upon STATE OF BIHAR vs. SIR KAMESHWAR SINGH wherein, at
concluding portion of paragraph 208, it is observed as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 39
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
"In my opinion, legislation which aims at elevating the status of tenants by conferring
upon them the bhumidari rights to which status the big zamindars have also been
leveled down cannot be said as wanting in public purposes in a democratic State. It
aims at destroying the inferiority complex in a large number of citizens of the State
and giving them a status of equality with their former lords and prevents the
accumulation of big tracts of land in the

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 hands of a few
individuals which is contrary to the expressed intentions of the Constitution..."
Mr.Uday Holla's reliance on MANISH KUMAR vs. UNION OF INDIA49 instead of supporting his
case, adumbrates that of his opponents. The Apex Court, in the said case reiterated the rule of
non-invocability of malice or capriciousness, qua legislature. It also observed at paragraph 211 as
under:
"...It is well settled that a legislature which has to deal with diverse problems arising
out of an infinite variety of human relations must, of necessity, have the power of
making special laws to attain particulars objects; and for that purpose it must have
large powers of selection or classification of persons and things upon which such laws
are to operate. Mere differentiation or inequality of treatment does not per se amount
to discrimination within the inhibition of the equal protection clause..."
(e) The vehement submission of Mr.Uday Holla that the tenants in possession of the property could
have been relieved by making restrictive conditions of lease void, appears attractive at a first blush.
However, a deeper examination thereof shows its demerits. Firstly, by what measure difficulty of
citizenry should be diminished is a (2021) 5 SCC 1

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 matter of legislative policy and
judiciary as of necessity has to show due deference to such decisions consistent with the 'doctrine of
separation of powers' which is recognized as a Basic Feature of the Constitution vide INDIRA
NEHRU GANDHI vs. RAJ NARAIN50. Secondly, this court is not sure if by voiding the restrictive
conditions of non-alienation or the like, the interference of the landlord would be minimized.
Measures of the kind are taken in the accumulated wisdom of the legislatures and that cannot be
substituted by the views of Judges. Accepting Petitioners' argument of the kind, would virtually
amount to judiciary evolving a policy much in variance with the one enacted by the legislature in its
domain. It hardly needs to be stated that power of the State to change its policy from time to time
consistent with changing circumstances cannot be subjected to judicial review even when the
changed policy deviated from pronouncements of the Apex Court vide STATE OF PUNJAB vs.

(f) Petitioners' contention as to impugned Act being massively unjust, is not substantiated. It is not
that the impugned Act snatches away their possession & enjoyment and put the property at the
hands of mulagenidars/volamulagenidars. It is tritely said:
'possession, is nine points of law'52. The lessees of mulagenies have been possessing
and enjoying the properties since decades and many of them have put up structures
by investing money. Whatever development has been made, does not ipso facto
belong to muldars, who will be paid compensation for only the land lost. After all, law
shuns concentration of material resources at the hands of few. If distribution of these
resources amongst the needy is aimed at, the holders cannot complain especially
when the compensation is being paid. The impugned legislative measure is fair both
in substance and procedure. The contention of the kind as advanced by the
Petitioners can be answered also by adverting to what an G.W.Keeton, 'The
Elementary Principles of Jurisprudence' 2nd Edition, Chapter XV, (1949)
- 80 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 acclaimed
American jurist T.M.Cooley53 [1824-1898] wrote. The same is profitably reproduced:
"The rule of law upon this subject appears to be, that, except where the constitution
has imposed limits upon the legislative power, it must be considered as practically
absolute, whether it operate according to natural justice or not in any particular case.
The courts are not the guardians of the rights of the people of the State, unless those
rights are secured by some constitutional provision which comes within the judicial
cognizance. The remedy for unwise or oppressive legislation, within constitutional
bounds, is by an appeal to the justice and patriotism of the representatives of the
people. If this fail, the people in their sovereign capacity can correct the evil; but
courts cannot assume their rights. The judiciary can only arrest the execution of a
statute when it conflicts with the constitution. It cannot run a race of opinions upon
points of right, reason, and expediency with the law-making power..."
In view of the above, the fifth question, as to the impugned Act being manifestly arbitrary and
massively unjust, is liable to be struck down as violating Article 14 of the Constitution, is answered
in the negative.

(a) Mr.Uday Holla, Mr.Keshav Bhat, Mr.Abhinav Ramanand & Mr.Ravindra Kamath,
learned Sr. Advocates vehemently argued that notwithstanding relegation of right to
property from Part III to Part XII, it enjoys the constitutional guarantee as a human
right/basic right vide STATE OF HARYANA vs. MUKESH KUMAR54; public purpose
& just compensation though not textually prescribed, they are indispensible
components of valid acquisition of property under Article 300A; that being the
position, by a stroke of legislative pen, the subject properties would not have been
snatched away from the muldars and handed to mulagenidars by paying illusory
compensation that is determinable on irrelevant principles, when over the decades,
rupee value has slided abysmally low. Mr.Uday Holla argued that the official number
of mulagenidars being less than muldars, the pleaded public purpose is liable to be
brushed aside; viewed from any angle, the impugned Act cannot be sustained on the
touchstone of doctrine of Basic Structure. Learned Sr. Advocates (2011) 10 SCC 404

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Mr.B.V.Acharya & Mr.A.G.Holla
controverted these submissions contending that the Act is made for public purpose; the
compensation payable thereunder is determinable & payable thereunder, is normative & reasonable;
Petitioners argument as to sliding rupee value is irrelevant; in a social welfare legislation,
acquisition of private property for public purpose even sans payment of any compensation, is
permissible vide K.T.PLANTATION PVT. LTD vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA55; strictly speaking,
Article 300A is not invocable since impugned Act is not a case of acquisition of property. They too
cited certain decisions.
(b) The terms 'public purpose' & 'public interest' that are at times interchangeably employed in
legislative instruments and executive decisions do not have fixed contours. The very concept is of
variable import. The Apex Court in KAMESHWAR SINGH, supra, paragraphs 208 & 210:
"...The expression 'public purpose' is not capable of a precise definition and has not a
rigid (2011) 9 SCC 1
- 83 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 meaning. It can only be defined
by a process of judicial inclusion and exclusion. In other words, the definition of the expression is
elastic and takes its colour from the statute from which it occurs, the concept varying with time and
society and its needs... In my opinion, the contentions raised by Dr. Ambedkar, though interesting,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 42
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
are not sound because they are based on the assumption that the concept of public purpose is a rigid
concept and has a settled meaning, Dr. Ambedkar is right in saying that in the concept of public
purpose there is a negative element in that no private interest will be created in the property
acquired compulsorily; in other words, property of A cannot be acquired to be given to B of his own
private purpose and that there is a positive element in the concept that the property taken must be
for public benefit...."
An acclaimed jurist Dr.D.D.Basu56 having surveyed a catena of decisions has succinctly stated the
legal position in the following words:
"Public purpose, which is part of the concept of eminent domain, is a condition
precedent for invoking Article 300A of the Constitution and therefore a person can be
deprived of his property by the legislature only for a public purpose. The question
whether the purpose is primarily public or private, however, has to be decided by the
Legislature. It is primarily for the State to decide whether for acquiring land there
exists a "public purpose" or not. Where D.D.Basu, 'Shorter Constitution Of India' 15th
Edition, Lexis Nexis, 1517-1518, (2019)
- 84 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 such power of the
State is exercised mala fide or for collateral purposes or the purported action is de
hors the Act, irrational or otherwise unreasonable, or the so-called purpose is "no
public purpose" at all and fraud on the Statute is apparent, a writ Court can interfere
under Arts. 32 and 226 of the Constitution, but except in such cases, the declaration
of public purpose made by the Government is not subject to judicial review. The
Court while exercising powers under Arts. 32, 226 or 136 of the Constitution cannot
be substitute its own judgement for the judgement of the Government, as to what
constitutes public purpose..."
To the above needs to be superadded that when it comes to legislative decision as to public purpose,
whether articulate or inarticulate, the scope of its scrutiny in writ jurisdiction is further diminished
consistent with the doctrine of separation of powers. In K.T.PLANTATION, at paragraph 92, it is
observed:
"Our Constitution makers were greatly influenced by the Western doctrine of
eminent domain when they drafted the Indian Constitution and incorporated the
right to property as a Fundamental Right in Article 19(1)(f), and the element of public
purpose and compensation in Articles 31(2). Of late, it was felt that some of the
principles laid down in the Directive Principles of State Policy, which had its
influence in the governance of the country, would not be achieved if those articles
were

Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 literally
interpreted and applied. The Directive Principles of the state policy lay down the
fundamental principles for the governance of the country, and through those
principles, the state is directed to secure that the ownership and control of the
material resources of the community are so distributed as best to sub- serve the
common good and that the operation of the economic system does not result in the
concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. Further,
it was also noticed that the fundamental rights are not absolute but subject to law of
reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public to achieve the above
objectives specially to eliminate Zamindari system..."
(c) In the light of delineation of this aspect of law as above, let me examine if the impugned Act is
structured on public purpose: Firstly, the Act intends to address the difficulties of
mulagenidars/volamulagenidars who, because of restrictive clauses in the lease such as
non-alienation, non-development, etc., are put to massive disadvantage; they are not in a position to
exploit the leasehold properties to their fullest potential, despite holding the same in eternity. As
already mentioned above, the muldars & intermediaries were taking undue advantage of servient
position of these persons by denying
- 86 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 permission for alienation or
development of the holdings; at times, they were requiring them to pay exorbitant monies for
securing such permission; the persons who apparently constitute a class of small-holders had been
in the predicament of an otherwise vulnerable position also, as rightly contended by Mr.A.G.Holla.
Therefore, the government having secured necessary information & data in this regard, introduced
the Bill; there were interactive sessions between the government and the stakeholders; it is not that
the impugned Act came overnight, as a bolt from the blue. The Bill was preluded by the objects &
reasons that are duplicated in Preamble to the Act. This statute intends to extinguish interest of the
muldars and enlarge that of the mulagenidars/volamulagenidars to the level of full ownership. As of
necessity, it excludes all intermediaries in a wholesale way so that the vulnerable section of
occupants does not suffer any longer at their hand. It is pertinent to see paragraph 89 of
K.T.PLANTATION:
- 87 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 "The US Supreme
Court in Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 US 229 (1984) allowed the use of
eminent domain to transfer land from lesser to lessees. In that ruling the court held
the government does not itself have the use the property to legitimate taking, it is a
takings purpose and not its mechanics that must pass the muster under the public
use clause...."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 44
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
This legislative measure would relieve the vulnerable section of the society from the
aforementioned predicament.
A careful examination of the purpose & policy content of the impugned Act
unmistakably brings to the fore abundant elements of public purpose, in the light of
Apex Court observations in the following two cases:
In K.T.PLANTATION, supra at paragraph 117:
"Deprivation of property within the meaning of Art.300A, generally speaking, must
take place for public purpose or public interest. The concept of eminent domain
which applies when a person is deprived of his property postulates that the purpose
must be primarily public and not primarily of private interest and merely incidentally
beneficial to the public. Any law, which deprives a person of his private property for
private interest, will be unlawful and unfair and undermines the rule of law and can
be subjected to judicial review. But the question as to whether the purpose is
primarily public or private, has to be decided by the legislature,
- 88 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 which of course
should be made known. The concept of public purpose has been given fairly
expansive meaning which has to be justified upon the purpose and object of statute
and the policy of the legislation..."
In RANGANATHA REDDY, supra at paragraph 6:
"It is indisputable and beyond the pale of any controversy now as held by this Court
in several decisions including the decision in the case of His Holiness Kesavananda
Bharati Sripadagalaveru v. State of Kerala(1) popularly known as Fundamental
Rights case-that any law providing for acquisition of property must be, for a public
purpose. Whether the law of acquisition is for public purpose, or not is a justiciable
issue. But the decision in that regard is not to be given by any detailed inquiry or
investigation of facts. The intention of the legislature has to be gathered mainly from
the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act and its Preamble. The matter has to
be examined with reference to the various provisions of the, Act, its context and set
up, the purpose of acquisition has to be culled out therefrom and then, it has to be
judged whether the acquisition is for a public purpose within the meaning of Article
31(2) and the law providing for such acquisition."
(d) The vehement submission of Mr.Uday Holla and other advocates appearing for
the Petitioners that the number of mulagenidars being less than muldars, the idea of
public interest stands logically excluded, cannot be accepted. Firstly, in matters like
this, numerics are not the

- 89 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 decisive factors as to there being
public purpose. Secondly, official statistical data relating to muldars and mulagenidars which the
Petitioners heavily banked upon, is confined only to Dakshina Kannada & Udupi districts; however,
as already mentioned above, the Act keeps in view the vulnerable sections of mulagenidars kind
throughout the State. In a particular region, number of beneficiaries of a legislation may be arguably
less, but that does not assume much relevance in adjudging elements of public purpose, as rightly
contended by Mr.A.G.Holla. Any legislative measure intended to give effect to any of the Directive
Principles will cause some prejudice to a small section of people. This invariably & inevitably
happens in any civilized jurisdiction. Ours being a constitutionally ordained Welfare State, a
sectarian utilitarianism has no significant role in matters like this. The following observations at
paragraphs 47 of JILUBHAI, supra in this background assume importance:
"It is accordingly clear that in a welfare State envisioned in the directive principles of
State policy, the basic perquisites are that everyone
- 90 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 is entitled to
minimum material well being, such as food, clothing, and decent housing. Expanding
living standard are possible with the existing or expanding physical resources and
scientific knowledge etc., and the State has right and duty to act when private
initiative fails. In a democratic society, every individual needs legal protection for the
beneficial enjoyment of what he has discovered and appropriated; has created by his
own labour (in wider sense); and what he has acquired under the existing social and
economic order subject to law and order. Equally welfare consists in adjusting
individual interests with social interest by the aid of law as social engineering, which
would mean public restraints on property designed to mitigate the privileges which
property offers in enjoyment of the things that life has to offer. Restraints on the
power to use the property as a delegated power of command is means as of quasi-
governmental private control over the major assets of a nation. Properly, thereby, is
subject to regulation. The directive principles enjoin the State to reorganise the
economic system by law or administrative means and the Fundamental rights are
means to that end to make right to life meaningful, equality of opportunity and of
status and dignity of person a reality. The fundamental rights and the directive
principles are the two wheels of the chariot as an aid to make social and economic
democracy a truism..."
In view of the above discussion, the sixth question, as to the absence of public purpose in the
impugned Act, is answered in the negative.

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 XIII. AS TO FRUGALITY OF
COMPENSATION PAYABLE TO MULDARS AND CONSEQUENT INVALIDATION OF THE
IMPUGNED ACT:
(a) All the learned advocates appearing for the Petitioners vehemently contended that
the right to property is guaranteed as a Fundamental Right under Article 26 to the
religious institutions/denominations and it enjoys constitutional protection under
Article 300A, even after the 44th Amendment of 1978 and therefore, the frugality of
the compensation strikes at the validity of impugned Act. In support of this
submission, they heavily banked upon certain observations in COMMISSIONER,
HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, vs. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA
SWAMIAR57 in re Article 26 and K.T.PLANTATION in re Article 300A. Mr.Uday
Holla and Mr.Abhinav Ramanand apprised the court of apportionment of
compensation amount as between the lessor and lessee in the ratio of 40:60 when the
property is acquired and that even this norm is also spurned by the scheme of
impugned AIR 1954 SC 282
- 92 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 Act. Mr.Uday Holla &
Mr.Keshava Bhat invoked the idea of devaluation of rupee over the decades and this aspect has not
been taken care of by the Act while providing the framework for determination of compensation. To
put it shortly, in their opinion, what is payable to the muldars is an illusory compensation and
therefore, the Act is a fraud on the constitutional guarantee. Mr.B.V.Acharya & Mr.A.G.Holla per
contra contended that Articles 26 & 300A do not guarantee against acquisition of private property
for public purpose especially when compensation is being paid; the determination of compensation
is on the norms usually obtaining in the realm; the interest of the muldars is frugal; muldars getting
the property back is almost unthinkable; the Fundamental Right to Property in the sense of
erstwhile Article 19(1)(f) is not guaranteed to the religious institutions/denominations and what is
protected is their right to own/acquire & administer property vide Article 26(c) & (d). In any
circumstance, the property is taken away from the land owners by paying compensation
- 93 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 that is determined normatively;
lastly, the idea of rupee devaluation is alien to the matter.
(b) Sub-section (2) of section 7 of the impugned Act reads:
"The amount payable under sub-section (1) shall be 500 times of the lease rental as is
evidenced in the records. However, where the Mulageni lease is conditional requiring
the permission of the Mulgar for alienation of the property the amount payable shall
be calculated at 1000 times of the lease rent."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 47
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
Thus, at the outset, it is not a case of acquisition of property sans compensation. Whether the
amount to be determined as compensation, is illusory, as argued by the Petitioners needs a deeper
examination. It has been observed in K.T.PLANTATION that the obligation of State to pay
compensation to a person who is deprived of his property in acquisition is in-built in Article 300A of
the Constitution. Ordinarily, a law providing for acquisition of private property for public purpose
cannot say that no compensation shall be paid. Though in the scheme of constitutional guarantee to
right to property, acquisition sans payment of compensation is not totally excluded.
- 94 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 However, the State in such
extreme cases will have a very burden to justify a measure of the kind; otherwise, such a confiscatory
legislation is liable to be voided on the touchstone of constitutional guarantees. In LAKSHMINDRA
THIRTHA SWAMIAR, there is some discussion about the scope & invocability of Article 26(c) & (d),
is true. This Article inter alia guarantees the right of religious institutions/denominations to own,
acquire & manage their property; but this right too, as any other, is not absolute and does not
insulate such properties from acquisition by authority of law. The observations at paragraph 3 of
MAHANT RAM KISHAN DASS vs. STATE OF PUNJAB58 are aptly reproduced:
"The second objection, grounded on a decision of this Court and using a Constitution
missile is that the freedom guaranteed under Article 26(c) of the Constitution to own
and acquire property by a religious denomination is imperilled on account of this
acquisition, and also has no basis. It is not as if a religious denomination cannot own
land. It can under our Constitution hold properties. But such a right is not an
absolute one nor unlimited altogether... One thing is, however, clear that Article 26
guarantees inter alia the right to own and (1983) 1 SCC 377
- 95 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 acquire movable and immovable
property for managing religious affairs. This right, however, cannot take away the right of the State
to compulsorily acquire property in accordance with the provisions of Article 31(2). If, on the other
hand, acquisition of property of a religious denomination by the Stale can be proved to be such as to
destroy or completely negative its right to own and acquire movable and immovable properly for
even the survival of a religious institution the question may have to be examined in a different
light..."
It is not the case of Petitioners that the properties that are subject matter of the impugned Act are
required for the survival & maintenance of the religious institutions, be they Mutt, Church or
Mosque. There is no specific plea in the petitions, nor any evidentiary material on record in this
regard. The Apex Court in BIRA KISHORE DEB. RAJA vs. STATE OF ORISSA59, said that this
Article cannot be casually invoked unless the Petitioners claim the property in question on behalf of
a denomination and such denomination is specified in the pleadings, with full particulars. The right
guaranteed by clauses (c) & (d) of Article 26 not being absolute is subject to reasonable regulation by

the State provided the substance of such (1964) 7 SCR 32
- 96 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 right is not affected. The power
of State to regulate interests of social welfare as a whole, comes from the Directive Principles
enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution; court's duty is to strike a golden balance between
competing claims of different interests. That is how properties of religious denominations are
permitted to be regulated and at times, taken away by legislative measures devised for implementing
any of the Directive Principles so long as the core of religion is not interfered with. The following
observations in KHAJAMIAN WAKF ESTATES vs. STATE OF MADRAS60, lend support to this
view:
"...It was next urged that by acquiring the properties belonging to religious
denominations the legislature violated Art. 26(c) and (d) which provide that religious
denominations shall have the right to own and acquire movable and immovable
property and administer such property in accordance with law. These provisions do
not take away the right of the State to acquire property belonging to religious
denominations. Those denominations can own acquire properties and administer
them in accordance with law. That does not mean that the property owned by them
cannot be acquired. As a result of acquisition they cease to own that (1970) 3 SCC 894
- 97 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 property. Thereafter their right
to administer that property ceases because it is no longer their property. Art. 26 does not interfere
with the right of the State to acquire property..."
(c) The vehement submission advanced on behalf of Petitioners that decades ago, the properties
were given on lease prescribing frugal sums of money as the annual rents, when the purchasing
power of rupee was high and the rental income was being used by the religious institutions (Mutts &
Churches), may be true; but is irrelevant, to say the least. Firstly, it is not their case that the rentals
fixed in mulagenies are variable on the basis of fluctuating rupee value. Secondly, the compensation
on normative determination payable under the Act if deposited in any Nationalized Bank, the
interest that would accrue even at lesser rates would far exceed the fixed rentals, as rightly shown by
Mr.A.G.Holla by arithmetical calculation. Even if Act is struck down, the rentals payable under the
mulageni arrangements would be the same as originally fixed. Lastly, this question is no

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 longer res integra in view of
following observations in JILUBHAI at paragraph 56:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 49
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
"... the loss of rupee value is not relevant consideration to adjudge the principle laid
by the statute. Giving acceptance to the contention renders every statute ultra vires
by the nature of the litigation that the time lag inevitably intervenes an rupee value,
during the interregnum gets eroded and every Act thereby because, on its account,
unworkable. In normal acquisition, the principle of depletion of rupee value has
repeatedly been held to be not relevant to determine market value..."
(d) The contention of Petitioners that real estate prices having skyrocketed, their properties are very
valuable and therefore, the rental values long time ago stipulated in mulageni arrangements, cannot
be the basis for determination of compensation, again is difficult to agree with. A plea of
unreasonableness, arbitrariness, proportionality, etc., always raises an element of subjectivity and
therefore, courts cannot strike down a statute that too when the right to property is no longer a
fundamental right. In each case, courts have to examine the scheme of impugned Act, its object
while treating plea of the kind. In legislative measures designed for giving
- 99 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 effect to the Directive Principles
of the kind, the compensation need not be determined on the basis of market value, nor be it just or
adequate in common parlance. Different statutes prescribe different norms to determine the
amount payable to the deprived owner. If these norms bear a just relation to the object of
determining the compensation, further examination in judicial review is ordinarily barred. While
examining the land owners challenge to the acquisition in a petition filed under Article 226 of the
Constitution, courts should not adopt a pedantic approach but should decide the matter keeping in
view the constitutional goals of social & economic justice. A host of factors enter the fray whilst
adjudging validity of norms prescribed by the statute for determining the compensation.
Pragmatically speaking, the real worth of muldars interest in the property is not that great or worthy
when compared to a case of any other lease where the prospects of regaining the property by sheer
efflux of time, are concrete and assuring. Where rental values decades ago stipulated in these
mulagenies
- 100 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 being admittedly frugal [in fact,
that is the ground urged by the Petitioners for faltering the normative basis enacted for determining
the compensation], it is unrealistic to assume that the mulagenidars/volamulagenidars would not
pay such rents and thereby, venture the risk of termination of lease. Even in breach, it is not that,
muldar would invariably get right of re-entry in no time, reprieve/protection arguably availing
under Section 111 of the 1882 Act or the Karnataka Rent Act, 1999. Thus, the possibility of muldars
getting the property to their supardi despite breach of covenants, are too remote to be mentioned.
The Apex Court in a case involving mulageni i.e., AMBALAL MANSUKHRAM JOSHI vs. THE
ADDITIONAL SPECIAL LAND ACQUISITION OFFICER, AHMEDABAD61 at paragraph 3 observed
about the interest of muldar: '...The value of his right to reversion - a remote one - is a little or
nothing...'. It negatived the contention as to frugality of compensation when the amount if deposited

(e) There is lot of force in the submission of Mr.B.V.Acharya & Mr.A.G.Holla that the method of
capitalization of income derived from the land is a popularly accepted norm for determination of
compensation payable to the land losers. The Apex Court in RAJIV SARIN, supra, at paragraph 68,
observed:
"...It is to be noted that Article 300A was inserted by the Constitution (44th
Amendment) Act, 1978 by practically reinserting Article 31(1) .... Therefore, right to
property is no longer a fundamental right but a right envisaged and conferred by the
Constitution and that also by retaining only Article 31(1)... and specifically deleting
Article 31(2), as it stood. In view of the aforesaid position the entire concept to right
to property has to be viewed with a different mindset than the mindset which was
prevalent during the period when the concept of eminent domain was the embodied
provision of fundamental rights. But even now as provided under Article 300A of the
Constitution the State can proceed to acquire land for specified use... When the State
exercises the power of acquisition of a private property thereby depriving the private
person of the property, provision is generally made in the statute to pay
compensation to be fixed or determined according to the criteria laid down in the
statute itself. It must be understood in this context that the acquisition of the
property by the State in furtherance of the Directive Principles of State Policy was to
distribute the material resources of the community including
- 102 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 acquisition and
taking possession of private property for public purpose. It does not require payment
of market value or indemnification to the owner of the property expropriated.
Payment of market value in lieu of acquired property is not a condition precedent or
sine qua non for acquisition. It must be clearly understood that the acquisition and
payment of amount are part of the same scheme and they cannot be separated. It is
true that the adequacy of compensation cannot be questioned in a court of law, but at
the same time the compensation cannot be illusory..."
Even the compensation payable to landlords under Section 40 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act,
1961 after vesting of the agricultural land in the State is also structured on capitalization method.

In view of this, the seventh question, as to illusory or frugal compensation payable to the muldars
under the XIV. AS impugned TO Act is answered SOME MISCELLANEOUS in the negative.
CONTENTIONS:
(a) This court does not agree with Petitioners' contention that the idea enacted in the
impugned Act has nothing to do with 'distribution of material resources of
community' in the sense of Article 39(b) of the Constitution since the said expression
has been expansively construed by the Apex Court in decisions that
- 103 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 galore e.g. RANGANATHA
REDDY, supra. Petitioners' contention that right to property is treated as the 'basic right' or 'human
right' by the Apex Court in a catena of decisions, may be true when exercise of other fundamental
rights guaranteed inter alia under Articles 19 & 21 is dependent upon property, and not otherwise. It
is not the case of Petitioners that the mulageni properties are the only source of livelihood and if
they are taken away, it amounts to taking away the means of livelihood. The contention that where
the tenanted properties are acquired, the lessor and the lessee generally apportion the compensation
in the ratio of 40:60, does not advance case of the Petitioners' even in the least. Added, such a
contention is speculative, there being no plea or material on record as to any mulageni property
having been acquired, there is claim by the muldars for apportionment of compensation and the
mulagenidar/volamulagenidar is repudiating the same.
(b) This court does not cotton with the submission of Mr.A.G.Holla appearing for the private
Respondents that
- 104 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 the interest of muldars in the
subject properties is not of full ownership and that it is akin to 'ryotwari tenure'. The text & context
of the impugned Act presuppose that muldars are full owners of subject properties. His reliance on
BALMADIES PLANTATIONS LTD. vs. THE STATE OF T.N62 which essentially involved agrarian
lands unlike the case at hands, does not much support his canvass. In the said decision, the court
was examining the status of land holders under ryotwari settlement brought about by Col. Read in
1792 consequent to ceding of territories by Tippu Sultan, as described in the Manual of
Administration quoted by Baden-Powell, in Vol. III of Land Systems of British India. His reliance on
Full Bench decision of Kerala High Court in SUKAPURAM SABHAYOGAM vs. STATE OF
KERALA63, again is of no avail. Conversely, the Bench treated 'mulgar' or 'mulga' as meaning the
owner of land keeping in view observation of Justice Gajendragadkar as he then was in LAKSHMAN

Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 RAGHOBA64. It observed at the
latter half of paragraph 61:
"...the point to be noted is that in the decision of the Bombay High Court, referred to
above, a mulawargadar has always been understood in South Canara to be an owner
or original proprietor...". At the same time, it referred to a variant view of the Apex
Court in KARIMBIL KUNHIKOMAN vs. STATE OF KERALA65, does not make much
difference. Mr.A.G.Holla's contention that despite breach of covenant by the
mulagenidar/volamulagenidar, no right of entry accrues in favour of muldar being of
peripheral significance, does not merit examination.
However, his contention that there is no cognizable prejudice to the muldars by
statutory adoption of capitalization method for determination of compensation has
force, since as already discussed infra, what they get as interest by investing such
amount in any financial institution would be far in excess of the fixed rental value.
He is also right in submitting that one need not keep in mind the value of whatever
constructions the AIR 1951 Bom. 355 AIR 1962 SC 723
- 106 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016
mulagenidars/volamulagenidars have done in the subject property and that what
needs to be focused is only the bare land comprising in mulageni, more particularly
when the doctrine of dual ownership obtaining in the realm of 1882 Act. He is also
right in contending that the idea of adequacy or reasonableness of compensation
does not have much place where a legislative measure is to give effect to the Directive
Principle in Article 39(b), even when right to property is constitutionally guaranteed
under Article 300A. Lastly, this court does not agree with Mr.B.V.Acharya &
Mr.A.G.Holla that 'manifest arbitrariness' cannot be a ground for invalidation of
plenary legislation, such a ground having been reiterated by the Apex Court in
K.S.PUTTASWAMY vs. UNION OF INDIA66.
XV. A FEW WORDS BEFORE PARTING WITH THE CASE:
(a) In RANGANATHA REDDY supra, the Apex Court quoted the following words of
Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, a prominent member of Constituent Assembly:
(2017) 10 SCC 1
- 107 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 "..Law, according to me, if it is to
fulfil its larger purpose, must serve as an instrument of social progress. It must reflect the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132142580/ 53
Mr Giselle D Mehta vs Union Of India on 22 May, 2023
progressive social tendencies of the age. Our ancients never regarded the institution of property as
an end in itself. Property exists for dharma... the duty which the individual owes to the society from
the whole basis of social framework. Dharma is the law of social well-being and varies from yuga to
yuga. Capitalism as it is practised in the West came in the wake of the Industrial Revolution and is
alien to the root idea of our civilisation. The sole end of the property is yagna and to serve a social
purpose..."
In an organized State, law operates as an instrument of social change which the Fundamental
Document of the country aspires for. Any such change invariably affects a few, and at times, badly.
This cannot be more aptly answered than by the following words of Justice Krishna Iyer at the fag
end of paragraph 67 in RANGANATNHA REDDY, supra.
"These extreme lurid, recondite picturisations cannot be transformed into
probabilities and realities, especially in a case where we find little to complain in
fairness of procedure or delivery of the end product. Of course, in a 'radical change'
situation, certain classes, invoking varnishing values, may cry 'wolf' and in any
welfare legislation stray injustice is unavoidable. Perfection is God's property, to aim
at it is
- 108 -
C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 human progress.
We find no legal flaw in the measure under attack."
(b) All the above having been said, this court is of a considered view that ours being a
constitutionally ordained Welfare Governance, State action be it legislative, executive or otherwise
should not give scope for grievance of the kind which muldars are debating in these cases. Their
arguable grievance regardless of its legal tenability would hopefully disappear, if the rate of
compensation i.e., 500 times the rental value in the absence of non- restrictive clause in the lease
and 1000 times in the case of restrictive clauses, is upwardly revised. After all, State can legislate
mass justice, courts not being the only sanctuary in a democracy. Matter essentially lies in the
domain of legislature. This court hopes and trusts that something in this regard would happen at the
hands of Powers That Be, before long.
In the above circumstances, challenge to the impugned Act fails and all these Petitions are
dismissed, costs having been made easy.

C/W W.P.Nos.43928/2012, 11966/2013 23287/2013, 62434/2016 This Court places on record its
deep appreciation for the research and assistance rendered by its official Law Clerk Cum Research
Assistant, Mr. Faiz Afsar Sait.
