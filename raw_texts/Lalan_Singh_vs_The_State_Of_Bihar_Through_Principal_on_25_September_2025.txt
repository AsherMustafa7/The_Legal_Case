Lalan Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through Principal ... on 25 September, 2025
CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN KUMAR JHA
ORAL JUDGMENT
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.20 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 Date : 25-09-2025 The petitioner has filed
the present petition seeking direction to the respondents to provide adequate security and
protection in regard to the land owned and possessed by the petitioner having exclusive right, title
and interest over the said land and property. In paragraph no. 1, it has also been submitted that one
representation dated 01.12.2020 is pending before respondent no. 3 who is sitting over the matter
for reasons best known to the respondent.
02. Perusal of representation dated 01.12.2020 shows the said representation was given to the
Superintendent of Police, Rohtas with prayer to take action against the S.H.O., Bikramganj Police
Station and to ensure handing over the paddy crop which was kept by the accused persons and for
further ensuring that the petitioner was allowed to cut the paddy crop and take the produce to his
possession. Learned counsel further submits that pursuant thereto by the orders of the learned
A.C.J.M.-1st, Bikramganj the paddy crop which was kept in the police station has been handed over
to the petitioner and the petitioner also harvested the remaining crop.
03. I am unable to understand after so many years what remains in the matter when the allegation
was made Patna High Court CR. WJC No.20 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 against certain persons and
prayer was made to ensure handing over of the paddy crop to the petitioner of the land claimed by
the petitioner and the same was done. Hence, the representation has been acted upon and nothing
remains in the matter.
04. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State submits that thereafter on complaint of this
petitioner, Bikramganj P.S. Case No. 39 of 2022 under Section 147, 149, 341, 342, 323, 379, 427,
504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against Babban Singh and others. Therefore
the grievances of the petitioner stands redressed. If the petitioner is having any grievances against
the private respondent he could take the course of law in case there is any dispute over title and
ownership of the land.
05. This contention has been opposed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner
who submits that the petitioner has won the title suit still the private respondents are obstructing
cropping of his land and its harvesting.
06. From the submission made on behalf of the parties, it is apparent that the petitioner is aggrieved
by the acts of private respondents and also the official respondents in helping the private
respondents so far as harvesting of crop is concerned. But there could not be any standing order to
the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.20 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 State authorities to provide 24 x 7
protection for 365 days of the year in favour of the petitioner. Still, the State authorities are duty
bound to protect the lawful possession of the property of each citizen including this petitioner. If any
infringement is reported, the State authorities are duty bound to take action. If in future, the
petitioner is aggrieved by infringement of any of his rights whether of body or property, he may
approach the State authorities and the State authorities are directed to act upon such complaints in
accordance with law.
