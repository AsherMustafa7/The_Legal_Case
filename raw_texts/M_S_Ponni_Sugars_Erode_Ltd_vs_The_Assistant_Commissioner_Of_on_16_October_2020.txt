Mr.N.Muthukumar
For Respondent :Mrs.Hema Muralikrishnan
Standing counsel for IT
C O M M ON O R D E R
With the consent of both parties, the Writ Petitions are taken up and heard through Video
Conferencing.
2. The brief facts of the case are as follows:
M/s.Ponni Sugars & Chemicals Limited (PSCL) had set up Erode Sugar Mill in Tamil
Nadu in the year 1984. Subsequently, another Sugar Mill was set up in Orissa in 1994.
In view of the losses to the Sugar Mill at Orissa, PSCL became a 'sick industrial
company'.
Consequently, a Scheme of Arrangement for demerging Erode Unit by spinning it off
to Ponni Sugars (Erode) Limited (PEL) was conceived in order to restructure the
operations and revive the prospects of PEL.
Accordingly, a Scheme of Arrangement was arrived and in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956, Company Petition
Nos.118 and 119 of 2000 was filed before this Court and on 10.09.2001, the Scheme
was sanctioned by the Company Court. Some of the salient features of the scheme
sanctioned by the Company Court are as follows:-
http://www.judis.nic.in i. The Erode Undertaking of PSCL was transferred to PEL
with effect from 01.04.1999;
ii. The consideration for transfer shall be for the aggregate value of Rs.7500 lakhs;
iii. All contingent liabilities shall vest only with PSCL;
iv. Term debts and bank borrowings are transferred that include transfer of debts
specifically contracted for Bolangir unit to the Erode Undertaking of Transferee
Company;
v. A part of debit balance (Rs.923 lakhs) in P&L A/c was transferred to PEL;
vi. A part of General Reserve (Rs.1004 lakhs) was transferred to PEL;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 2
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
vii. Sugar stocks were recorded in PSCL Books at net selling price. This, however, was
recorded in the books of PEL as per reinstated value (lower of cost or net selling
price) in accordance with Accounting Standard-2 (Inventories) of Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India;
viii. Pursuant to the Scheme, proportionate shares of PEL were issued to the
shareholders of PSCL in the ratio of 3:5. In addition, the Scheme also provides for
conversion of part of debt (funded interest) contracted for Bolangir Unit but getting
http://www.judis.nic.in transferred to PEL. Accordingly, additional 18,40,000
Equity Shares are issued to FIs besides issue of 0% Optionally Fully Convertible
Debentures or Term Loans by PEL to FIs aggregating Rs.1183 lakhs.
3. The statement, as required under Section 393 of the Companies Act states, inter-alia, that the
Scheme involving transfer of Erode Unit is not one of 'demerger' within the meaning of Section
2(19AA) or a “slump sale” under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act 1961 and that the Transferee
Company, upon transfer of Erode Unit to it at fair value, will be entitled to claim depreciation in its
Tax Returns on the basis of fair market value of fixed assets as on 01.04.1999 arrived at on the basis
of independent valuation to be undertaken by the Transferee Company. The relevant portion is
extracted hereunder:-
“INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS
14. The information on income-tax implications is given based on the interpretation
of Law as prevailing and per legal advice received. This cannot be construed as final
and binding.
(a) The Scheme involving the transfer of EU is http://www.judis.nic.in not one of
'demerger' within the meaning of section 2(19AA) or a “slump sale” under Section
2(42C) of the Income Tax Act,1961.
(b) the transfer of EU in terms of this Scheme will not give rise to a taxable income or
gain in the hands of the TRANSFEROR COMPANY.
(c) The issue and allotment of equity shares by the TRANSFEREE COMPANY to the
members of the TRANSFEROR COMPANY and also the concurrent change in the
corresponding number of shares for the members in the TRANSFEROR COMPANY
will not give rise to any tax liability in the hands of the members. However the
members are advised to seek independent tax advice as they would consider relevant
and necessary in the matter.
(d) The balance of unabsorbed loss/depreciation as at EFFECTIVE DATE and upon
completion of the Scheme shall in entirely vest with the TRANSFEROR COMPANY
and continue to enure for its set-off in future as permissible.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 3
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
(e) The TRANSFEREE COMPANY , upon transfer of EU to it at fair value will be
entitled to claim depreciation in its Tax Returns on the basis of fair market value of
fixed assets as of EFFECTIVE DATE arrived at on the basis of independent valuation
to be undertaken by the TRANSFEREE http://www.judis.nic.in COMPANY at the
appropriate time for this purpose.”
4. When PEL filed its returns of income for the assessment year 2000-01, the transfer of Erode
undertaking was for an aggregate consideration of Rs.7500 lakhs and the itemised value of fixed
assets comprising land, building and plant & machinery was determined based on the Chartered
Engineer's Certificate. Accordingly, it claimed depreciation on buildings, plant & machinery, based
on the value of assets so acquired/transferred in terms of the Scheme. The Assessing Officer had
disallowed the depreciation claim by treating the Scheme as one of 'demerger' under Section
2(19AA) of the Income Tax Act, thereby restricting the claim for depreciation only on the Written
Down Value (WDL) of assets being transferred from PSCL to PEL.
5. The same stand was adopted by the Department for the subsequent years also. All these
assessment orders and notices, treating the Scheme as 'demerger' under Section 2(19AA) of the Act
and disallowing the claim for depreciation, are put under challenge in these Writ Petitions.
http://www.judis.nic.in
6. Mr.A.L.Somayaji, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the
Company Court order sanctioning a Scheme of Arrangement pursuant to Sections 391 to 394 of the
Companies Act, 1956 is a code by itself and when the scheme is sanctioned with effect from a
particular date, it is binding on everyone, including the statutory authorities. According to the
learned Senior Counsel, since the proceeding for sanction of a Scheme under Sections 391 to 394 of
the Act is a code by itself, the proceedings, as well as the order sanctioning the Scheme, is a
judgment in rem.
7. To such a submission, Mrs.Hema Muralikrishnan, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the
respondent submitted that there was no explicit pronouncement in the sanction ordered by the
Company Court to the effect that the transaction is not a demerger and that the “income tax
implications” referred to in the statement under Section 393 of the Companies Act will not form a
part of the “Scheme of Arrangement” and therefore, the Scheme itself is to be treated as one of
'demerger' under Section 2(19AA) of the Income Tax Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in
8. Before addressing the core issue involved in these writ petitions, it would be appropriate to touch
upon the preliminary issued raised by the learned Standing Counsel for the respondent on the
maintainability of the writ petitions, on the ground of non-availment of the alternate statutory
appeal remedy.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 4
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
9. The issue with regard to non-availment of alternate remedy as a bar to file a writ petition, has
been dealt in various decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, by holding that the presence of an
alternate remedy is not an absolute bar in entertaining a writ petition and that the exceptions with
regard to violation of the principles of natural justice, lack of jurisdiction, manner of exercise of
power by the statutory authorities, correctness and propriety of the decision making process, etc.,
have been spelt out as grounds for entertaining a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India.
10. The Madras High Court in the case of Nokia India Private Ltd. Vs Deputy Commissioner (CT)-IV
reported in (2015) 79 VST 137 (Mad), has made a consolidated reference to some of the decisions of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court and held that the non- http://www.judis.nic.in availment of the
statutory appeal remedy will not be a bar for filing a writ petition. The relevant portion of the order
reads as follows:-
26.In the light of the above facts and the contentions raised by both sides, this Court
is of the view that the petitioner need not be relegated to avail the alternate remedy as
it has been held in all cases that necessity to avail the alternative remedy may not
arise and it is not a bar to exercise the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. As regards the objection of the Revenue that alternative
remedy is available to the petitioner, it is no doubt true that the Act provides for an
alternative remedy of filing an appeal. In a recent decision reported in [2011] 5 SCC
697 (Union of India (UOI vs.Tantia Construction Private Limited), on the issue of
maintainability of a writ petition in the face of an alternative remedy provided under
the Act, the apex court held that the presence of an alternative remedy is not an
absolute bar in entertaining a writ petition. The apex court considered the decisions
reported in [2003] 2 SCC 107 Harbanslal Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.),
[2001] 10 SCC 491 (Modern Steel Industries v. State of U.P.), [2010] 3 SCC 321
(Hindustan Petroleum Corporation http://www.judis.nic.in Limited v. Super
Highway Services), [2009] 14 SCC 451 (National SampleSurvey Organization v.
Champa Properties Limited) as well as [1998] 8 SCC 1 (Whirlpool Corporation v.
Registrar of Trade Marks ) and held that the rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an
alternative remedy, is a rule of discretion and not one of compulsion and there could be
contingencies in which the jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution of India could be
exercised in spite of availability of an alternative remedy. The question to be decided is relating to
the jurisdiction, manner of exercise of power by the Assessing Officer and the correctness and
propriety of the decision making process and whether principles of natural justice was adhered.
Therefore, it is held that the Writ Petitions are maintainable and cannot be rejected solely on the
ground that as against the impugned assessment orders, the statute provides for alternate remedy.
Accordingly, issue No.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner.

M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
11. The grounds raised in the present writ petitions are some of the exceptions cited in the aforesaid
decision for maintaining a writ petition without availing the alternate remedy and hence, I am of the
view that the petitioner can maintain the writ petitions without availing the statutory appeal
remedy.
12. The core issue involved in the present writ petitions is as to whether the statement under Section
393 of the Companies Act, 1956 would form a part of the Scheme of Arrangement and if so, whether
the proceedings for sanctioning of the Scheme under Sections 391 to 394 would be a proceeding in
rem?
13. The proposition that the sanction of a Scheme will have a binding effect on the statutory
authorities, is not seriously disputed. Nevertheless, for the sake of clarity, I deem it appropriate to
explicate the legal position with regard to the binding effect of sanction of a Scheme of Arrangement
on the statutory authorities and such a sanction is judgment in rem.
http://www.judis.nic.in
14. In Marshall Sons & Co. (India) Ltd. Vs Income Tax Officer reported in (1997) 223 ITR 809 (SC),
it was held that the sanction of a Scheme under the provisions of the Companies Act is binding on all
concerned. This ratio decidendi came to be followed by this Court in Pentamedia Graphics Ltd. Vs
Income Tax Officer reported in (2011) 236 CTR 204 (Mad) in the following manner:-
“In this connection, the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision
reported in Marshall Sons & Co. (India) Ltd. v. ITO (supra) needs reference. Dealing
with the question of relevancy of effective date in a scheme sanctioned by the Court,
the apex Court held that once the scheme had been sanctioned with effect from a
particular date, it is binding on everyone including the statutory authorities. Having
regard to the law declared by the apex Court as to the effect of the scheme sanctioned
by the Court, the only course open to the Revenue would be to act as per the scheme
sanctioned effective from 1st Jan., 2004, which means that the tax authorities are
bound to take note of the state of affairs of the applicant as on 1st Jan., 2004 and a
return filed reflecting the same cannot be ignored on the strength of s. 139(5) of the
http://www.judis.nic.in IT Act. The merits or otherwise on the returns filed, however,
is a matter of assessment for the authorities to consider and pass order in accordance
with law.”
15. The Calcutta High Court in Maan concast Pvt. Ltd. & anr. Vs West Bengal Industrial
Development Corporation Ltd. & Ors. Reported in (2017) SCC Online Cal 19426 also took a similar
view in the following manner:-
“A transfer which takes place by operation of law, therefore, need not meet the
requirement of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or the Indian
Registration Act, 1908. J.K. (Bombay) Private Ltd. (supra) has held that, a scheme
under Sections 391 and 392 of the Companies Act, 1956 framed by the Court in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 6
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
respect of a company, to pay of its creditors, would be binding upon the creditors and
the shareholders of such company. It has held that, a scheme sanctioned by the Court
does not operate as a mere agreement between the parties. It becomes binding on the
company, creditors and the shareholders and has statutory force.” .......
“A scheme of amalgamation or arrangement http://www.judis.nic.in documents the
compromise arrived at between the parties to the scheme inter vivos. A scheme may
be between two or more companies. It may also be between a company and its
shareholders or creditors. A proceeding for sanction of a scheme relating to a
company under the Companies Act, 1956 is a proceeding in rem.”
16. Similarly, in Bhavita Jitendra Mehta Vs Sudera Enterprises Private reported in (2004) 51 SCL
290 Cal, it was held that the order of amalgamation passed by the Company Court is a judgment in
rem.
17. In Dalmia Power Ltd. Vs Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle-1, Trichy reported in
(2019) 418 ITR 221 (Mad), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had referred to one of its own decisions and
held that such Schemes sanctioned under the Companies Act has a statutory force and the order is a
judgment in rem. The relevant portion of the observation reads as hereunder:-
4.6 Pursuant thereto, the Schemes were sanctioned by the NCLT, Chennai vide
Orders 16.10.2017, 20.10.2017, 26.10.2017, http://www.judis.nic.in 28.12.2017,
10.01.2018, 20.04.2018 and 01.05.2018; and, vide Orders dated
18.05.2017 and 30.08.2017 by the NCLT, Guwahati. Accordingly, the Schemes attaines statutory
force J.K. (Bom.) (P.) Ltd. v. New Kaiser-I-Hind Spg. & Wvg. Co. Ltd. [1970] 40 Comp. Cas. 689 not
only inter se the Transferor and Transferee Companies, but also in rem, since there was no objection
raised either by the statutory authorities, the Department, or other regulators or authorities, likely
to be affected by the Schemes.
18. On a comprehensive enumeration of the aforesaid judicial precedents, it can be summarised and
held that the order sanctioning a Scheme of Arrangement pursuant to Sections 391 to 394 of the
Companies Act will have a statutory force, binding on all concerned and the sanction of the Court
would operate as a judgment in rem.
19. Above all, the Company Court, while sanctioning the Scheme of arrangement through its order
dated 10.09.2001 in C.P.Nos.118 & 119 of 2000, had held in paragraph 5 that the Scheme of
Arrangement between the transferor and transferee companies, shall form part of the order.
http://www.judis.nic.in
20. The core objection of the respondent is to the effect that the statement under Section 393 of the
Companies Act, 1956 will not form a part of the Scheme of Arrangement sanctioned by the Court
and the Scheme would be one of 'demerger', as defined under Section 2(19AA) of the Income Tax
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 7
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
Act.
21. The Assessing Officer had disallowed the depreciation claim made by the petitioner and treated
the Scheme as one of 'demerger' under Section 2(19AA), thereby restricting the claim for
depreciation, only on the Written Down Value (WDV) of the assets being transferred from PSCL to
PEL, for the assessment year 2000-01. This stand was maintained by the Assessing Officer in
respect of the subsequent assessment years, namely 2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2005-06 and
2006-07 also.
22. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the provisions of
Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act is a code by itself and that the statement under Section
393 of the Act would be a part of the order sanctioning the Scheme. For such a proposition, the only
reliance placed was on the decision of http://www.judis.nic.in a learned Single Judge of the
Karnataka High Court in the case of Reserve Bank of India Vs Tulunadu Finance and Developments
Ltd., reported in ILR 2010 Kar 4328. On this proposition, the learned Senior counsel fairly stated
that, the finding by the learned Single Judge therein that the statement under Section 393 of the
Companies Act would form a part of the Scheme, is not supported by reasons. The Karnataka High
Court had made such an observation, in the following manner:-
19. .......
In Clause-22 of the Explanatory
Statement under Section 393 of the
Companies Act, which forms part of the
scheme clearly reveals that since the company could not fulfill all the norms set by
the RBI, the RBI vide its letter dated 11.5.2000 has prohibited the company from
accepting of fresh public deposits, renewing existing deposits on maturity or
alienating any assets of the company without the permission of RBI.
(emphasis supplied)
23. Apart from the above observation, no ratio has been formulated in the entire decision to render
the proposition that the statement under Section 393 of the Act will have a statutory force, as
http://www.judis.nic.in a ratio decidendi. At the most, the observation of the Karnataka High Court
could be termed as obiter dictum.
24. In Sanjay Singh & Anr. Vs U.P. Public Service Commission reported in (2007) 3 SCC 720, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court had held that it is the ratio decidendi of the judgment and not the final
order of the judgment, which forms a precedent. Likewise, in Rajbir Singh Dalal Vs Chaudhari
Devilal University reported in (2008) 9 SCC 284, it was observed that mere casual observations or
directions, without laying down any principles of law and without giving reasons would not amount
to a precedent. Thus, the decision of the Karnataka High Court may not have a persuasive effect, for
the purpose of this proposition and hence its imperative to analyse the scope and object of the
proposition. Barring the reliance placed on the Karnataka High Court's decision in Tulunadu F & D
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 8
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
Ltd., (supra), no other decisions were relied upon by either side on this proposition.
25. In the Scheme of Arrangement between PSCL and PEL, the transfer and vesting of Erode
Undertaking (EU) in PEL, was for the aggregated value of Rs.7,500 lakhs. In the statement under
Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956, the Income Tax implications were http://www.judis.nic.in
explained, whereby, the scheme involving transfer of EU was construed to be not one of “Demerger”,
within the meaning of Section 2(19AA). The statement also explained that the PEL, upon transfer of
EU to it at fair value, will be entitled to claim depreciation in its tax returns on the basis of fair
market value or fixed assets as of effective dates arrived at on the basis of independent valuation
undertaken by the PEL, at the appropriate time for this purpose. The Company Court, had taken
note of this aspect in paragraph 4 of its order dated 10.09.2001 in C.P.Nos.118 & 119 of 2000 while
sanctioning the arrangement, by observing that the transfer of EU is contemplated at a fair value
reckoned at Rs.7,500 lakhs, based on the valuation report of the Chartered Accountants and the
surplus arising to the transferor companies on EU being transferred to PEL, shall be used to
write-off the deferred revenue expenditure and to improve its financial position.
26. Though the income tax implications has been explained to the creditors or members in the
statement under Section 393 of the Act, the objections of the respondent is that the Company Court
has not explicitly pronounced that the transaction is not a Demerger. It is the argument of the
respondent that the sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement will not include the statement under
Section 393 of the http://www.judis.nic.in Act.
27. Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956 reads as follows:-
“393. Information as to compromises or arrangements with creditors and members.--
1) Where a meeting of creditors or any class of creditors, or of members or any class
of members, is called under section 391,-
a)with every notice calling the meeting which is sent to a creditor or member, there
shall be sent also a statement setting forth the terms of the compromise or
arrangement and explaining its effect; and in particular, stating any material
interests of the directors, managing director, managing agent, secretaries and
treasurers or manager of the company, whether in their capacity as such or as
members or creditors of the company or otherwise, and the effect on those interests,
of the compromise or arrangement, if, and in so far as, it is different from the effect
on the like interests of other persons; and
b) in every notice calling the meeting which is given by advertisement, there shall be
included either such a statement as aforesaid or a notification of the place at which
and the manner http://www.judis.nic.in in which creditors or members entitled to
attend the meeting may obtain copies of such a statement as aforesaid.
2) Where the compromise or arrangement affects the rights of debenture holders of
the company, the said statement shall give the like information and explanation as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 9
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
respects the trustees of any deed for securing the issue of the debentures as it is
required to give as respects the company' s directors.
3) Where a notice given by advertisement includes a notification that copies of a
statement setting forth the terms of the compromise or arrangement proposed and
explaining its effect can be obtained by creditors or members entitled to attend the
meeting, every creditor or member so entitled shall, on making an application in the
manner indicated by the notice, be furnished by the company, free of charge, with a
copy of the statement.
4) Where default is made in complying with any of the requirements of this section,
the company, and every officer of the company who is in default, shall be punishable
with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees; and for the purpose of this sub-
section any liquidator of the company and any trustee of a deed for securing
http://www.judis.nic.in the issue of debentures of the company shall be deemed to be
an officer of the company:
Provided that a person shall not be punishable under this sub- section if he shows
that the default was due to the refusal of any other person, being a director, managing
director, managing agent, secretaries and treasurers, manager or trustee for
debenture holders, to supply the necessary particulars as to his material interests.
5) Every director, managing director, managing agent, secretaries and treasurers or
manager of the company, and every trustee for debenture holders of the company,
shall give notice to the company of such matters relating to himself as may be
necessary for the purposes of this section; and if he falls to do so, he shall be
punishable with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees.”
28. The statement referred to in Section 393 is a mandatory statement to be served on the creditors
or members, along with the notice calling the meeting under Section 391. The object of the
statement under Section 393 is to explain to all the members of the proposed meeting about the
nuances and implications of the terms of the arrangement and its effect. Unless, it is established to
the http://www.judis.nic.in subjective satisfaction of the Court that such a statement under Section
393 has been sent to the creditors and members along with the notice calling the meeting under
Section 391, the sanction itself may not be granted.
29. The provision also indicates the limitations on the contents of the statement. It shall contain the
terms of the compromise or arrangement and the effects of such terms could be explained. In other
words, the contents of the statement should be in conformity with the main Scheme of Arrangement
and cannot bring in such terms that are not in conformity with the scheme. Thus, the proceedings
sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 is a
Code by itself. As such, when it is a settled proposition that the Scheme of Arrangement would also
form a part of the order of the Court sanctioning the scheme and such an sanction acts as a
“judgment in rem”, the statement under Section 393 of the Act would also merge with the Scheme of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30443673/ 10
M/S. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 16 October, 2020
Arrangement and thus, be a part of the order of the Court sanctioning the scheme. Since the object
behind the statement under Section 393 is to explain to the stakeholders on the effect of the
proposed terms of settlement, such a explanatory statement cannot be contradictory to the scope of
http://www.judis.nic.in the Scheme of arrangement.
30. As stated earlier, under the Scheme of Arrangement, the value of the EU for transfer, was for
aggregate value of Rs.7,500 lakhs and this aspect has also been taken note of by the Company Court,
while sanctioning the Scheme. The income tax implications have been explained to the creditors or
members in the statement under Section 393, to the effect that the scheme involving the transfer of
EU is not one of a Demerger. Upon transfer of EU to PEL at a fair value, PEL will be entitled to claim
depreciation on the basis of fair market value of the fixed assets. In view of the legal principles
unequivocally settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dalmia's case (supra), as well as, various
other decisions dealt with in the earlier portion of this order, the Scheme of Arrangement between
PSCL and PEL, which expressly states that the Scheme is not a Demerger, within the meaning of
Income Tax Act, has attained finality and statutory force not only “inter se” PSCL or PEL but also “in
rem”. Accordingly, the Scheme, that includes the Income Tax implications given in the statement
and which explanatory statements are in conformity with the scope of the terms of arrangement,
would be binding on the Tax Department. http://www.judis.nic.in
31. On a conjecture that the Scheme is one of Demerger under Section 2(19AA), the Assessing
Officer had disallowed the depreciation claim made by the petitioner and thereby restricted the
claim for depreciation only on the WDV of the assets transferred from PSCL to PEL. The Company
Court, while considering the petition for sanction under the Companies Act, had approved the
Scheme of Demerger and the statement under Section 393 of the Companies Act. As held in the
preceding paragraphs, the statements, being in conformity with the scope of the terms of the
Scheme of Arrangement, becomes an integral part of the Scheme, which was sanctioned by the
Company Court, and thus, the transfer of the undertakings will not be considered to be one of the
Demerger within the meaning of Section 2(19AA) of the IT Act. As such, the basis of the impugned
proceedings itself is fallacious and the further proceedings thereon, cannot be sustained.
32. Accordingly, the impugned proceedings dated 23.03.2004, 27.03.2006, 28.12.2006, 28.12.2007
& 20.01.2009 respectively are quashed. The concerned Assessing Authority shall taken into
consideration of the findings of this Court that the Scheme of Arrangement is not a Demerger,
within the meaning of Section 2 (19AA) and take further course of proceedings, in accordance with
law. http://www.judis.nic.in
