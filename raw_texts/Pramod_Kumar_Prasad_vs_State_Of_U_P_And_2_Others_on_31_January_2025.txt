digital format.
ii. to issue any other writ order or direction as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and
proper in the facts and circumstances of the case."
3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the Tehsildar has no right to
carry on a verification with regard to the manual caste certificate issued to the petitioner and the
Tehsildar is required to upload the manual caste certificate on a digital platform without entering
into the merits of the validity of the said caste certificate. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner has relied upon the decision in Raj Mangal Gond vs. State of U.P. and others reported in
2023 (2) ADJ 490 (DB). The relevant paragraphs thereof are delineated below :-
"7. Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, Sri H.R. Misra, learned
Senior Advocate assisted by Sri K.M. Misra and Sri Swatantra Pratap Singh, learned
counsel for the petitioners and the learned Standing Counsel, the Court is definitely
of the view that when the Tehsildar had already earlier issued a certificate and was
only issuing a fresh certificate "On-line" then he could not enter into the merits of the
matter. The jurisdiction to verify the Caste Certificate and as to whether it should be
validated or in-validated lay with the Caste Scrutiny Committee under the
Government Order dated 28.02.2011. The authority i.e. the Tehsildar, which had
earlier issued the Caste Certificate had no jurisdiction to cancel the same except when
the Caste Certificate had been obtained by playing fraud or by concealing any
relevant fact. In the instant case when the Tehsildar had cancelled the Caste
Certificate issued by him on 27.11.2014, there was no finding in the impugned order
that the earlier certificate was obtained by the petitioner by playing fraud on any
authority. As a result, the impugned order dated 26.02.2021, so far as its relates to
the petitioner is quashed and is set aside.
8. With these observations the writ petition stands allowed.
4. The Tehsildar shall issue the "Online" Certificate forthwith. If, however, the Tehsildar doubts the
caste or the tribe of the petitioner he may refer the matter to the District Level Caste Scrutiny
Committee, Maharajganj."
4. Considering the facts of the present case and after perusal of the judgment cited by the petitioner
in Ram Mangal Gond (supra), we are at consensus ad idem with the aforesaid judgment and
accordingly quash and set aside the impugned orders dated September 8, 2024 and December 23,
2024. We direct respondent No. 3/ Tehsildar, Tehsil Bansdeeh, Ballia, to act in terms of the
judgment passed by the coordinate Bench in Ram Mangal Gond (supra) within a period of four
weeks from date.
5. With the aforesaid direction, this writ petition is disposed of.
