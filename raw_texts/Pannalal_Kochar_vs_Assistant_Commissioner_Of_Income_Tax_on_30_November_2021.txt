3.The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the respondent had issued notices to the
respective Writ Petitioners under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act on 31.03.2019 being the last
date of expiry of the limitation for reopening of the assessment under Section 143(3) r/w Section 147
of Income Tax Act, 1961 and has thereafter, proceeded to pass the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.1604 & 1606 of 2020 impugned order in violation of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd reported in 259 ITR 119 (SC).
4.The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the dispute relates to the sale of land and the
claim of long term capital gain under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and was subject matter of
scrutiny assessment in the year 2014 and assessment orders dated 03.04.2014 were passed by the
Assessing Officer under Section 143(3) of the Income Tax Act.
5.The case of the petitioners is that both the petitioners i.e., husband and wife had entered into a
Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with the builder on 01.05.2007. It is submitted that over a
period of time, they ended up selling their shares i.e., 4 villas allotted to them and 50% of sale
consideration in another villa. It is the further case of the petitioners that after notice under Section
148 of the Income Tax Act were issued on 31.03.2019, the petitioners replied to the aforesaid notice
on 15.04.2019, pursuant to which a notice under Section 142(1) r/w Section 129 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 was issued for re-assessment by a different officer. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.1604 & 1606 of 2020
6.It is submitted that though the respondent has issued the reasons for reopening the assessment,
the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd
reported in 259 ITR 119 (SC) were not followed. On the other hand, the respondent straightaway
proceeded to issue the show cause notice and thereafter, disposed the objection on 24.12.2019, copy
of which was not served on the petitioner. It is further submitted that the notice dated 27.12.2019
was issued in the forenoon asking the petitioners to appear before the respondent in the evening by
05.15 P.M on the same date. It is submitted that the respondent thereafter proceeded to pass the
impugned orders wherein the objection of the petitioners against reopening the assessment was
discussed for the first time.
7.The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the reasons for rejecting the objection
vide communication dated 24.12.2019 was merely based on the decision of the Division Bench of
this Court in the case of Dayanidhi Maran vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in
W.P.Nos.3405 and 43944 of 2016 vide order dated 10.10.2018. It is
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.1604 & 1606 of 2020 further submitted that the entire
procedure followed by the respondent while passing the impugned assessment order was irregular
and contrary to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India)
Ltd reported in 259 ITR 119 (SC) and also without considering the objection as to why the
assessment cannot be revised in terms of the reasons given for reopening the assessment. The
learned counsel for the petitioners therefore submits that the impugned orders are liable to be
quashed.

8.Appearing on behalf of the respondent, the learned Senior Standing Counsel submits that the
communication dated 24.12.2019 rejecting/over- ruling the objection of the petitioner for reopening
the assessment for the assessment year 2012-13 and the subsequent communication dated
27.12.2019 was communicated to the respective petitioners through their designated email id given
by them and therefore, there is no question of any violation of principles of natural justice and
hence, these Writ Petitions are devoid of merits.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.1604 & 1606 of 2020
9.The learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondent further submits that there are several
disputed question of facts involved in this case. It is submitted that the petitioners have declared the
sale of agricultural land, whereas the petitioners had sold Villas and therefore, there is
misrepresentation to the Department both at the time of filing the returns under Section 139 of the
Act and thereafter, when the assessment orders came to be passed under Section 143(1) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 on 10.09.2013 and at the time when the subsequent assessment order came to
be passed under Section 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the first time on 03.04.2014 for the
petitioner in W.P.No.1604 of 2020.
10.It is further submitted that the petitioners failed to participate and for the first time when the
show cause notices were issued on 19.12.2019 and wanted to reset the clock by asking the
Department to furnish the reasons for reopening the assessment in terms of decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd reported in 259 ITR 119 (SC). The learned
Senior Standing Counsel appearing for the respondent would therefore submit that the Writ
Petitions are liable to be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.1604 & 1606 of 2020 dismissed.
11.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Senior Standing Counsel for the
respondent. Perused the notices issued under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1960 and the
reasons given for reopening of the assessment on 28.10.2019 and the subsequent communications
which culminated in the issuance of the show cause notices and the disposal of the proceedings vide
impugned assessment orders dated 30.12.2019.
12.It is the case where there is slight irregularity in the proceedings carried out by the respondent in
as much as the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd
reported in 259 ITR 119 (SC) was not followed. Though the requirement for giving a speaking order
is pursuant to the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts
(India) Ltd reported in 259 ITR 119 (SC), is doubtful in the light of the change in the method of
assessment under the e-assessment. Nevertheless, assessment ought not to have been carried out in
a mechanical manner. Though the petitioners have also not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.1604 & 1606 of 2020 replied to the show cause notices, the fact remains that the objections
to reopening of the assessment was conveyed after issuing the show cause notices. The petitioners
were also not given sufficient time. Thus, there is procedural irregularity while passing the
impugned orders.
