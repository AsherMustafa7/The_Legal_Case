Gautam Dhar vs The Officer In Charge on 5 February, 2024
complainant, Brajabidhu Singh, be summoned for an offence committed by the
complainant in accordance with the provisions of Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The Ld.
CJM of Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, thereafter took notice of the offence
and summoned him on various days to appear. However, despite receiving the same,
the complainant refused to attend, and as a result, a bailable warrant was issued
against him by the S.P of Police, Imphal West, which is still pending execution to this
day.
During the pendency of the foregoing, on March 20, 2023, the complainant filed a
false and contrived Complaint to the Imphal Police Station, saying that he met the
petitioner/accused at an alumni gathering in Kolkata. During the meeting, the
petitioner/accused described himself as a wealthy businessman with links to central
ministries and high-level government officials. The complainant was then persuaded
to form a business partnership. Accordingly, "Brajakon Organics Private Limited,"
was founded on October 19, 2017, which has an operating office in Delhi and a
registered office e in Kids World Complex, Airport Road, Imphal, under the brand
name "Divine Organics." The petitioner has been appointed as a company's managing
director, although the complainant, Brajabidhu Singh, is the managing director on
the board of directors. In terms of ownership, the complainant, his friends, and
family controlled 80% of the company's shares, with the current petitioner holding
20%.
In the complaint the complainant claimed that the petitioner and his wife defrauded
him of Rs. 4 crores through a criminal conspiracy, committed forgery by preparing
false and fabricated books of accounts and other money receipts, and committed
criminal breach of trust, and that the petitioner should be held accountable for the
same. That the current case is based on a FIR filed by complainant Mr. Brajabidhu
Singh. It is alleged that the FIR No. 91(03) 2023 IPS U/s 420/406/468/471/34 IPC,
which was registered at Imphal Police Station on March 21, 2023 under Section
420/406/468/471/34 IPC.
Hence this petition for seeking Anticipatory Bail before this Hon'ble High Court.
Issue notice, returnable on 16.02.2024.
Notice is accepted by the learned PP for the State respondents.
The learned counsel for the petitioner is to take steps to the private respondent by
speed post.
The Investigating Officer of the case is directed not to arrest the accused till the next
date of hearing.
