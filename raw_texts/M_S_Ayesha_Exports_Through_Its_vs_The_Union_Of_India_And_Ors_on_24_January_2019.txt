M/S Ayesha Exports Through Its ... vs The Union Of India And Ors on 24 January, 2019
for quashing of the order dated 30.03.2018 contained in
Memo No. 900 dated 30.03.2018 passed by the Deputy
Commissioner, Land Customs Station, Jobgani, Araria,
Bihar (respondent no. 3) by which he has rejected the
representation dated 03.02.2018 filed by the petitioner
and refused to release the Betel Nuts. The petitioner has
also prayed for quashing of the seizure report dated
30.03.2018
and the test report of Arecanut Research and Development Foundation (in short 'ARDF'),
Mangalore on 23.02.2018 on the basis of which the consignment of the petitioner is said to have
been put under seizure alleging that the same seems to be of 'Indonesian Origin'.
3. Learned senior counsel representing the petitioner has drawn the attention of this court towards
the impugned order as contained in Annexure-P/1. It is submitted that even though the narrations
of the impugned order at first instance pretends to provide plausible explanation as to why the
customs authorities have seized the Betel Nuts in question but a careful perusal thereof would show
that what have been narrated Patna High Court CWJC No.7589 of 2018 dt.24-01-2019 in the
impugned order are a mere pious wish of the authorities without there being any law to support
them in their views.
4. Learned senior counsel submits that when the customs authorities had seized the Betel Nuts on
earlier occasion relying upon the report of M/s Arecanut Research & Development Foundation,
Mangalore, on a challenge made to that in the case of Union of India and others Vs. Salsar Transport
Company and Another (MJC No. 2185/2013 arising out of CWJC No. 3784/2013; the learned
coordinate Bench of this court vide it's judgment and order dated 24.07.2013 held that the Union of
India and it's authorities who were the petitioners in the said case had totally failed to bring on
record any material to show that it is an accredited laboratory by a competent authority under the
Act and Rules. The learned coordinate Bench thus concluded that no legal liability can flow from the
report of such an institution.
5. The learned senior counsel has also pointed out from Annexure-P/12 to the writ application Patna
High Court CWJC No.7589 of 2018 dt.24-01-2019 that on an application under the Right to
Information Act (in short the "RTI") when the Directorate of Arecanut & Spices Development,
Government of India was called upon to inform as to, whether a 'Betel Nut' is indigenously grown or
is of foreign origin (for example from Burma/Myanmar from Indonesia) can be determined by
means of any laboratory test, answer supplied by the Government says "No laboratory test have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4943780/ 2
M/S Ayesha Exports Through Its ... vs The Union Of India And Ors on 24 January, 2019
been standardized for tracing the country of origin".
6. From the materials available on the record in the form of certificate of origin for exports free of
customs duties under the treaty of trade between the Government of Nepal and the Government of
India as also from the import release order issued by the Directorate of Plant Protection, Quatantine
Storage, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, learned senior counsel submits that it would
appear that so far these documents are concerned there is no dispute with regard to their
genuineness. The import release order issued by the Officer Incharge, Plant Quatantine Station,
Jogbani, Bihar Patna High Court CWJC No.7589 of 2018 dt.24-01-2019 would show that after
holding inspection on 19.12.2017 he had recommended for release of the vehicle bearing No.
UP66E-9171 which is said to be loaded with Betel Nuts.
7. It is further pointed out that once again the Plant Protection Officer has conducted inspection on
08.02.2018 and gave his remarks 'recommended for release'. A reading of this order present at
page-105 of the writ application would show that the same has been issued in accordance with the
provisions of Clause 3(16) of the Plant Quatantine (Regulation of Import into India) Order, 2003.
8. It is submitted that even from the reading of the impugned order (Annexure-P/1) it would appear
that respondent no. 3 has recorded his opinion based on the ARDF test report saying that the 'Betel
Nuts' seemed to be of Indonesian origin. Learned senior counsel thus submits that once this court
has held that the report of ADRF Mangalore has got no legal sanctity, the authorities of the
Department of Customs are not justified in seizing the Betel Nuts imported from Nepal having Patna
High Court CWJC No.7589 of 2018 dt.24-01-2019 certificate of country of origin as Nepal.
9. It is submitted that after this specific adjudication by the learned coordinate Bench of this court in
MJC No. 2185/2013 at the instance of the Union of India, seizure of Betel Nuts taking into
consideration the report of ADRF Mangalore alone would be unjust, improper and in the teeth of
the judgment of the learned coordinate Bench. A copy of the said judgment is available at
Annexure-P/21 of the writ application.
10. It is also informed that said order present at Annexure-P/21 was challenged before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. CC7331/2014, which was dismissed on
08.05.2014 keeping the question of law open.
11. On the other hand, Sri S.D. Sanjay, learned Additional Solicitor General of India submitted that a
perusal of the impugned order would show the mode and manner in which the Betel Nuts are being
traded from Nepal. He has read out some of the paragraphs of the impugned order in his attempt to
save it. However, at Patna High Court CWJC No.7589 of 2018 dt.24-01-2019 the end, learned
Additional Solicitor General could not satisfy this court from the materials available on record as to
the basis of reaching to a conclusion that the 'Betel Nuts' in question is of Indonesian origin. It was
all the more difficult for him when it was found that in the impugned order itself it has been referred
that the ARDF test report reported that the Betel Nuts seemed to be of Indonesian origin. The word
'seemed to be' clearly provides the indecisiveness of the report. Again, on the face of the information
furnished under Right to Information present at Annexure-P/12 wherein it is provided that no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4943780/ 3
M/S Ayesha Exports Through Its ... vs The Union Of India And Ors on 24 January, 2019
laboratory tests have been standardized for tracing the country of origin, he could not satisfactorily
explain that how the test report of ARDF Mangalore which is not a accredited Lab alone will be a
document sufficient to bring the case within the scope and ambit of the custom duty.
12. Having heard learned Senior counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional Solicitor General
of India, this court is of the considered opinion that once the Patna High Court CWJC No.7589 of
2018 dt.24-01-2019 learned coordinate Bench of this court has held that in absence of there being
any material to show that M/s Arecanut Research & Development Foundation, Mangalore is an
accredited laboratory by competent authority under the Act and Rules, it's report cannot have a
consequence of fastening of any legal liability and 'No legal liability can flow from the report of such
an institution' the respondent authorities were not justified in again relying upon the ADRF
Mangalore's report to justify the seizure in question. In fact such an attempt of the respondent
authorities would be contemptuous in nature as it is likely to cause harassment to the traders, by not
following the judgment of the court.
13. This court also finds from Annexure-
P/12 that it is a reply of the Directorate of Arecanut & Spices Development, Government of India
which clearly provides that no laboratory test have been standardized for tracing the country of
origin.
14. As stated above even the learned Additional Solicitor General had the difficulty in answering
Patna High Court CWJC No.7589 of 2018 dt.24-01-2019 as to what will be the situation on the face
of this reply.
15. This court is of the opinion that in absence of there being a standardized laboratory test for
tracing the country of origin, established under some statute and such Labs have been accredited by
the competent authority and the Labs could have the scientific method to come to a conclusion that
a Betel Nut is of a particular country's origin, it would not be in the interest of justice to direct the
petitioner to pay the custom's duty.
16. At this stage, learned Additional Solicitor General submits that in fact on the basis of materials
which are available on the record, in his opinion now the time has come when the Government of
India will have to think over either continuing with the treaty in question or to develop a scientific
method to find out the country of origin to save the government's revenue.
17. In the opinion of this court, it is for the Government of India to think over it. So far as the
present position is concerned, this court would have no hesitation in coming to a conclusion that the
petitioner would be Patna High Court CWJC No.7589 of 2018 dt.24-01-2019 entitled for the reliefs
prayed in the writ application.
18. This writ application is thus allowed. The impugned orders are quashed.
