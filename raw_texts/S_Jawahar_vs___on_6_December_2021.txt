In Crl.O.P.No.30513 of 2015, the petitioners, who are the accused 1 to 3 in a private ccomplaint filed
for the offences under Sections 463, 464, 120-A, 120-B, 465, 470, 471, 192, 193, 196, 211, 107, 109,
34, 499 and 500 of IPC in C.C.No.6 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate, Coonoor, have filed
this Criminal Original Petition to quash the same. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.26928 and 30513 of 2015 & & Crl.M.P.Nos.1 and 2 of 2015
2.The allegation in the complaint is that, the complainant's wife borrowed Rs.15,000/- from the
accused on two occasions. A sum of Rs.5000/- has been paid in the name of her son Johannan
Michale alias Manoj and another Rs.5000/- in the name of her daughter Michelle alias Jyotsna. By
way of security, the complainant has given five cheques on four separate occasions to the accused
herein. Subsequently, discharged the loan. Despite the same, the accused have filled up the said
blank cheques and presented the same for collection and the same were dishonoured by the bank for
“insufficent funds”. Then, the fourth accused filed a complaint before the Judicial Magistrate,
Coonoor against the respondent/de-facto complainant in C.C.No.35 of 2011 on the file of the Fast
Track Magistrate, Coonoor under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and the same ended
in conviction. Challenging the said conviction and sentence, an appeal in Crl.A.No.10 of 2012 has
been filed before the District Court, Ooty. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.26928 and
30513 of 2015 & & Crl.M.P.Nos.1 and 2 of 2015 The defacto complainant has filed the present
private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
3.In the complaint, it is alleged that the petitioners fraudlently filled up the blank cheques issued by
the respondent, thereby committed the aforesaid offences. The learned Judicial Magistrate has
taken cognizance of the offences and issued summons to the accused persons. To quash the
complaint, the present Criminal Original Petitions have been filed.
4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that, the petitioner filed a complaint
against the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which is pending in
C.C.No.6 of 2015, on the file of the Judicial Magistrate, Coonoor, wherein the respondent has raised
a similar plea that, he had discharged the loan and a blank cheque given by him as security has been
used by the petitioners. In such circumstances, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.26928
and 30513 of 2015 & & Crl.M.P.Nos.1 and 2 of 2015 untill a finding is given by that court on that
issue as against the petitioners, the petitioners cannot maintain their complaint and there cannot be
a parallal proceeding on the very same allegations, and as such no offence is made out against the
petitioners. Hence, the complaint is liable to be quashed.
5.The learned counsel appearing for the respondent vehemently contended that, despite the entire
amount having been repaid, the accused used the earlier cheques, which have been issued for
security, thereby committed forgery and hence, the respondent has filed the private complaint. In
such circumstances, the present complaint has been filed under Sections 463, 464, 120-A, 120-B,
465, 470, 471, 192, 193, 196, 211, 107, 109, 34, 499 and 500 of IPC. The learned Judicial Magistrate,
after applying his mind, had taken cognizance of offence and issued summons to the accused and
there is no reason to interefere with it.

6.This Court considered the rival submissons made by the learned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.26928 and 30513 of 2015 & & Crl.M.P.Nos.1 and 2 of 2015 counsel appearing for the
petitioners and the learned counsel appearing for the respondent and carefully perused the
materials available on record.
7.As rightly contended by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, the allegation made in
the present complaint is the subject matter of the another criminal proceedings, wherein the
respondent raised the similar plea and the same is pending.
8.In such circumstances, with the very same allegation, the respondent cannot initiate a parallal
proceeding against the petitioners. It is nothing but an abuse of process of law. Hence, the complaint
in C.C.No.6 of 2015 is liable to be quashed. Accordingly, the complaint in C.C.No.6 of 2015 is
quashed.
9.In the result, these Criminal Original Petitions are allowed. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.26928 and 30513 of 2015 & & Crl.M.P.Nos.1 and 2 of 2015
10.It is made clear that it is always open to the respondent to raise all the defence available to him in
the criminal case filed by the petitioners/accused under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.
Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
