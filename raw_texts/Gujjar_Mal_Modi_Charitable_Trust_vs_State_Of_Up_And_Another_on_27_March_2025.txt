Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust vs State Of Up And Another on 27 March, 2025
"i) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned
order dated 11.03.2024 passed by the respondent no. 2 (Annexure No. 1);
ii) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the
respondent no. 2 to allow the application dated 28.08.2023 moved by the petitioner
trust under Section 34 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006 and enter the name
of the petitioner trust against the land in question situated at Village Mukarrabpur,
Pallera, Pargana Daurala, Tehsil Sardhana, District Meerut."
4. By the order impugned dated 11.03.2024 passed by respondent No. 2, the application of the
petitioner for recording petitioner's name in the revenue records has been rejected by respondent
No. 2.
5. Brief facts of the case are that petitioner- Trust purchased land bearing Khasra No. 85/A (85/1)
measuring 0.5750 hectares and 85/B (85/2) measuring 7-11-7 Bighas situated at village
Mukarrabpur Pallera, Pargana Daurala, Tehsil Sardhana, District Meerut from its recorded tenure
holder- Zulfikar and others by means of a registered sale deed dated 23.12.1978. After the purchase,
land was mutated in the revenue records in the name of the petitioner-Trust. The petitioner-Trust
constructed a building for establishing school in the name of Dayawati Modi Academy and the
school started in the year 1981 and is being run on the said land by the Trust. An order dated
30.03.1998 was passed by the competent authority- Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut under Section
10(3) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 against the vendors of the petitioner and
the land was declared surplus and in view of Section 10(3) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and
Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred as Act of 1976), the land stood vested with the State
Government. Though, the petitioner was recorded tenure holder but the order dated 30.03.1998 was
not served upon the petitioner. After the order dated 30.03.1998 passed by Urban Land Ceiling,
Meerut, the land was recorded in the name of State Government after expunging the entry, which
was in the name of the petitioner. On 12.10.1999, a notice was issued by the Revenue Inspector for
taking the possession of the land in dispute fixing 27.10.1999 the date for delivery of possession. The
petitioner-Trust challenged the order dated 30.03.1998 passed by the Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut
and the consequential notice dated 12.10.1999 issued by the Revenue Inspector by means of Writ C
No. 45403 of 1999 (Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust Vs. State of U.P. and others). The
aforementioned writ petition was allowed by this Court vide order dated 24.01.2023 holding inter
alia that the notice dated 12.10.1999 was issued after the commencement of Urban Land (Ceiling
and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred as Act of 1999) (Repeal Act came enforce
with effect from 18.03.1999). It was held by this Court that notice issued by the State under Section
10(5) of the Act of 1976 was void ab initio and therefore, the notice dated 12.10.1999 was quashed.
Against the judgment dated 24.01.2023 passed by this Court in Writ C No. 45403 of 1999, Special
Leave Petition being S.L.P. No. 35345 of 2024 (State of U.P. and others Vs. Gujjar Mal Modi
Charitable Trust) was filed by the State of U.P. before the Supreme Court, which was also dismissed
by the Supreme Court. After the judgment of this Court dated 24.01.2023 passed in Writ C No.
45403 of 1999, on 24.08.2023, an application was moved by the petitioner under Section 34 of the
U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 for entering its name in the revenue records after deleting the name of the
State Government. The said application has been rejected by respondent no. 2 by its order dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21070781/ 2
Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust vs State Of Up And Another on 27 March, 2025
11.03.2024. Hence, the present writ petition.
6. It has been contended by learned counsel for the petitioner that application of the petitioner has
been rejected only on the ground that since the order dated 30.03.1998 was passed by the
competent authority-Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut, therefore, the petitioner can approach the
competent authority for the relief claimed and there is no requirement of interference by respondent
no. 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that admittedly, the notice dated
12.10.1999 issued under Section 10(5) of the Act of 1976 was quashed by this Court in view of
provisions of Act of 1999 and the entire proceedings stood abated as the possession was not taken by
the State Government under Section 10(5) of the Act of 1976 before commencement of the Act of
1999. Once the proceedings abated, the order dated 30.03.1998 passed by the competent authority
-Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut under Section 10(3) of the Act of 1976 also abated as the entire
proceedings abated. It has been further submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that in view
of the statutory provisions of the Act of 1999, when the entire ceiling proceedings abated, there was
no impediment in mutating the name of the petitioner in the revenue records after deleting the
name of the State Government which was entered into on the basis of an order passed under Section
10(3) of the Act 1976 and respondent no. 2 has erroneously dismissed the application filed by the
petitioner and relegated it to approach the competent authority -Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut for
redressal of its grievances.
7. It has also been submitted by counsel for the petitioner that under Section 31 of the U.P. Revenue
Code, 2006, Collector has been assigned the duty to maintain the record of rights (khatauni) for
each village. It has been further contended by counsel for the petitioner that in view of Section 32 of
the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006, it is the statutory duty of the revenue authorities (Collector, Tehsildar
and Revenue Inspector) to record all changes in the record of rights (Khatauni) the field book
(Khasra) and the map that may take place, and all transactions that may affect any of the rights or
interests recorded and correct therein any errors proved to have been made in the records
previously prepared. It has been submitted by counsel for the petitioner that though the application
was filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 and there was no
impediment in deciding the same or otherwise treating the application to be under Section 32 of the
U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 to correct the revenue entry in view of the judgment passed by this Court
in Writ C No. 45403 of 1999, which was a transaction affecting the rights of the parties. Since the
name of the State Government was recorded only on the basis of an order passed under Section
10(3) of the Act of 1976, once the entire proceedings abated, there was no justification for keeping
the entry in the name of the State Government by the respondents and they ought to have corrected
the entry by themselves even without any application being moved by the petitioner, as they had
knowledge of the order which is clear from the fact that the State Government has preferred a
Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court, which was admittedly dismissed. Even otherwise,
when the matter was brought to the knowledge of the respondents by the petitioner itself by moving
an application, there was no occasion for rejecting the same and directing the petitioner to approach
the competent authority- Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut. The order of the competent authority also
stood abated in view of provisions of Act of 1999, as the entire proceedings abated.

8. Learned Additional Chief Standing Counsel on the other hand submitted that since the entry of
the State Government was made only on the basis of an order dated 30.03.1998 passed by the
competent authority- Urban Land Ceiling, Merut, the application of the petitioner has been rightly
rejected by respondent No. 2 and petitioner has been rightly relegated to move an appropriate
application before the competent authority -Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut for redressal of its
grievances. It has been further contended by learned Standing Counsel that the applications filed by
the petitioner was under Section 34 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006. Section 34 of the U.P. Revenue
Code, 2006 provides that every person obtaining possession of any land by transfer, other than
transfer referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 33 shall report such transfer, in the manner
prescribed, to the Tahsildar of the Tahsil in which the land as situate and therefore, on an
application made under Section 34 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 revenue entry in the name of
State Government cannot be corrected.
9. Before considering the rival submissions, it would be appropriate to consider the relevant
statutory provisions in this regard.
10. Section 31 of U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 is quoted as under:-
"31. Record of Rights. [(1)] The Collector shall maintain, in the form and manner
prescribed, a record of rights (Khatauni) for each village, which shall contain the

(d)particulars of all land (other than holdings) belonging to or vested in the [State
Government, Central Government, Gram Panchayat] or a local authority.
(e)such other particulars as may be prescribed.
(2)[ Shares of the co-tenureholders shall be determined in the manner prescribed.]"
11. Rule 27 of U.P. Revenue Code Rules, 2016 provides for the procedure. Rule 27 of the U.P.

[Provided that order for correction in map shall be passed by the Collector.] (2) No
application for correction of error under sub-section (1) [where the claim] is based

the circle in which the land is situate in such form as may be prescribed.
(2) On receipt of a report under sub-section (1) or on facts otherwise coming to his

Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust vs State Of Up And Another on 27 March, 2025
16. After considering the rival submissions, I am of the view that the stand taken by the learned
Standing Counsel is wholly erroneous and cannot be sustained. Once the ceiling proceedings, which
were initiated under the Act of 1976 stood repealed by the enforcement of Act of 1999 as the
possession was never taken by the Government under Section 10(5) or Section 10(6) of the Act of
1976, all the orders passed previously in the aforesaid proceedings also stood abated and therefore, a
revenue entry made in the name of the State Government on the basis of an order dated 30.03.1998
passed by the competent authority stood abated by the commencement of the Act of 1999, has to be
corrected by the revenue authorities and as the Collector is the person, who has been entrusted with
the duty of maintenance of revenue records, khasra, khatauni etc. under Section 31 read with
Section 32 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006. Once the basis on which the revenue entry in favour of
the State has vanished, there was no occasion for the Collector or the revenue authorities to have
continued with the entry. They should by themselves have corrected the entry and recorded the
name of the petitioner as it was recorded prior to the aforesaid order.
17. When an Officer is under duty to maintain a particular record or register, he is under further
obligation to maintain it correctly, incorporating all the changes that might take place. In this
context, Section 32(1) of the U.P. Revenue Code 2006 provides that subject to the control of
Collector, the Sub Divisional Officer, the Tehsildar or the Revenue Inspector shall record in the
manner hereinafter provided in this chapter:-
a. all changes in the record of rights (Khatauni), the field book (Khasra) and the map
that may take place;
b. all transactions that may affect any of the rights or interests already recorded;
c. Such Officer shall also correct therein any errors proved to have been made in the
records previously prepared.
18. The fore-runners of Section 32 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 are Section 33 and Section 39 of
the U.P. Land Revenue Act, 1901. Section 33 and Section 39 of the U.P. Land Revenue Act, 1901 are
quoted as under:-
"33. The annual registers. - (1)The Collector shall maintain the record-of-rights, and
for that purpose shall annually, or at such longer intervals as the State Government
may prescribe, cause to be prepared an amended in Section 32.
The register so prepared shall be called the annual register.
(2) The Collector shall cause to be recorded in the annual register.
(a) all successions and transfers in accordance with the provisions of Section 35; or
(b)other changes that may take place in respect of any land ; and shall also correct all
errors and omissions in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21070781/ 7
Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust vs State Of Up And Another on 27 March, 2025
Provided that the power to record a change under clause (b) shall not be construed to
include the power to decide a dispute involving any question of title.
(3)No such change or transaction shall be recorded without tire order of the Collector
or as hereinafter provided, of tire Tahsildar or the Kanungo.
39. Correction of mistakes in the annual register. - (1) An application for correction of any error or
omission in the annual register shall be made to the Tahsildar.
(2)On receiving an application under sub-section (1) or any error or omission in the annual register
coming to his knowledge otherwise, the Tahsildar shall make such inquiry as appears necessary and
then refer the case to the Collector, who shall dispose it of, after deciding the dispute in accordance
with the provisions of Section 40.
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be construed to empower the Collector to decide a
dispute involving any question of title.
(3)The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall prevail, notwithstanding anything contained in
the U.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1947."
19. This Court in case of Mohammad Anis Vs. The Additional Commissioner Allahabad Division and
others, reported in 2001 (92) R.D. 761 has considered the provisions of Section 33/39 of the U.P.
Land Revenue Act, 1901. Paragraph Nos. 13, 14 and 15 of the judgment is quoted as under:
"13. It is to be noticed that the Collector of a district is charged under Section 33 of
Act of 1901 to maintain the record of rights, and for that purpose is annually, or at
such longer intervals as the State Government may prescribe, cause to be prepared an
amended register mentioned in Section 32. The register so prepared is to be called
the annual register. The Collector is expected to cause to record in the annual register
all successions and transfers in accordance with the provisions of Section 35 and
other changes that may take place in respect of any land and is also to correct all
errors and omissions in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 provided that
the power to record a change under clause (b) shall not be construed to include the
power to decide a dispute involving any question of title.
14. A close scrutiny of Section 39 of the Act of 1901 reveals that when an application
for correction of any error or omission in the annual register is made to the Tahsildar,
then on receiving such application under subsection (1) or any error or omission in
the annual register coming to his knowledge otherwise, the Tahsildar shall make such
inquiry as appears necessary and refer the case to the Collector, who shall dispose it
of, after deciding the dispute in accordance with the provisions of Section 40
provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be construed to empower the Collector
to decide the dispute involving any question of title.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21070781/ 8
Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust vs State Of Up And Another on 27 March, 2025
15. Conjoint reading of Sections 33, 39 and 40 of the Act of 1901 reveal that either on
application or otherwise coming to the knowledge of the Tahsildar, if any change
takes place in respect of any land or error or omission is found in the record of rights,
which requires correction, then he is to refer to the Collector after making such
enquiry as appears necessary to him and after receiving reference Collector is
required to dispose it of in accordance with the provisions of Section 40 of the Act of
1901, provided that correction in the record of rights does not involve any question of
title. In the instant case dispute is squarely covered with expression "other changes
that may take place in respect of any land" used under clause (b) of sub-section (2) of
Section 33 of the U.P Act of 1901."
20. The facts in case of Mohammad Anis Vs. The Additional Commissioner Allahabad Division
(supra) were that one Hakimuddin got his name mutated on the basis of sale deeds dated
07.05.1960 and 04.06.1960 in the revenue records which were declared void ab initio by the first
appellate court, by the second appellate court and also by the Supreme Court in a suit filed by Mhd.
Anis. Thus, the question relating to title between the petitioner Mhd. Anis and Hakimuddin was
already decided which attained finality. In view of these facts, this Court in paragraph No. 19 of the
judgment has observed as under:-
"19. It is held that whenever and wherever on the basis of a sale deed a person got his
name recorded in Khatauni and such sale deed is cancelled by compe-tent civil court,
then in such a situation, the Collector or Sub-Divisional Officer, as the case may be,
has no option except to correct the Khatauni in pursuant to judgment and decree
passed by civil court provided such judgment and decree has attained finality, instead
of relegating the parties to initiate proceeding under Section 34 of the Act of 1901
wasting public time of courts and causing unnecessary financial burden on the
parties. It is to be imbibed by all Revenue Courts exercising powers under Section
33/39 of the Act of 1901 that if technicalities are pitted against substantial justice
then substantial justice should not be allowed either to escape or slide on mere
technicalities as has been done in the present case. It is well to remember that courts
of law are not respected by the public in general and litigant public in particular
because courts are capable to legalize injustice but courts of law are respected
because the courts are expected to advance justice between the parties in accordance
with law after ironing out the creases of law in correct perspective bringing it to the
side of truth, justice and fair play. In the present case the lis between the petitioner.
Mohammad Anis and Hakimuddin has attained finality up to Supreme Court even
then with close mind, the respondents No. 1 and 2 are shirking their responsibilities
to correct the Khatauni which they are required to correct immediately either on the
basis of an application moved by the petitioner, Mohammad Anis under Section
33/39 of Act of 1901 or otherwise coming to their knowledge after giving notice to
Hakimuddin and providing him also an opportunity of hearing."
21. Coming to the facts of the case, it is not in dispute that after an order was passed under Section
10(3) of Act of 1976 by the competent authority-Urban Land Ceiling, the name of the petitioner was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21070781/ 9
Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust vs State Of Up And Another on 27 March, 2025
expunged from the revenue records and the revenue entry in the name of the State was made. Once
this Court in Writ C No. 45403 of 1999 (Gujjar Mal Modi Charitable Trust Vs. State of U.P. and
others) has held that the entire ceiling proceedings abated as the possession was not taken by the
State before the date of commencement of Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999
and has quashed the notice dated 12.10.1999 under sub-Section 5 of Section 10 of Act of 1976, the
effect of abatement of proceedings under the Repeal Act of 1999 would be that all the previous
orders passed under the Act of 1976 also stood abated and therefore, the order dated 30.03.1998
passed under Section 10(3) of Act of 1976 also abated. The basis of entering the name of State by
expunging the name of the petitioner was the order dated 30.03.1998 passed by the prescribed
authority under sub-Section 3 of Section 10 of Act of 1976. Once the order on the basis of which the
revenue entry in favour of the petitioner was expunged, goes itself, there is no justification for
maintaining the revenue entry made in pursuance of the order passed under sub-Section 3 of
Section 10 of the Act of 1976.
22. In my considered opinion, respondent No. 2 has erred in law in relegating the petitioner to
competent authority-Urban Land Ceiling, Meerut for redressal of its grievances. Once because of the
provisions of Repeal Act of 1999, the ceiling proceedings including the orders passed therein stood
abated by the statutory force, there was no occasion for relegating the petitioner to the competent
authority for redressal of its grievances.
23. So far as contention of learned Standing Counsel that the application filed by the petitioner
under Section 34 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 was misconceived as under Section 34 of the U.P.
Revenue Code, 2006, the revenue entry cannot be corrected is concerned, even if the contention is
accepted at best it can be said that the petitioner has approached the respondent authority by means
of an application given under a wrong section. Mere mentioning of a wrong section in the
application will not deprive the petitioner to the relief which he otherwise is entitled. It was open for
the respondent authorities to have considered application to be under Section 32 of the U.P.
Revenue Code, 2006 and have passed order therein.
24. In view of the discussions made above, the order dated 11.03.2024 passed by respondent No. 2 is
quashed. The writ petition is allowed.
25. Respondent No. 2- Tehsildar, Tehsil-Sardan, District Meerut is directed to correct the revenue
entry in view of the discussions made above within a period of four weeks from the date of
production of certified copy of this order before him provided there is no other legal impediment.
