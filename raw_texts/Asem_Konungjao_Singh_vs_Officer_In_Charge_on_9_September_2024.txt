"On 4.10.2023, learned counsel for the accused orally made a submission for default
bail before this Court on the ground that charge sheet has not been submitted till
date. However, as per order dated 27.09.2023 charge sheet was submitted before the
Trial Court on 12.09.2023 and hence, the prayer for default bail is no longer available
to the accused person.
Mr. Achouba, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has
been in custody for 10 (ten) months without any trial and relevant papers have not
been furnished to him and next date is fixed on 23.10.2023 for appearance of the
accused and it is submitted that it may take a considerable time for completion of the
trial and the accused may be released.
This Court is of the opinion that the present bail application may be disposed of with a direction to
the learned Special Court (POCSO), Thoubal to decide the charge hearing as expeditiously as
possible keeping in view the provisions of Section 35 of the POCSO Act 2012.
With this observation, the bail application is disposed of. It is made clear that this Court does not
express any opinion on the merit of the case except for making an endeavour for early decision and
disposal of the charge hearing."
On perusal of record, a copy of the said order was furnished to the learned Special Judge (POCSO),
Thoubal on 18.10.2023. Inspite the direction of the Ld. Single Judge, the learned Special Judge
(POCSO), Thoubal failed to take further proceeding of the case.
Page 2|3 In the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court has taken serious view with regard to
the inaction of the learned Special Judge (POCSO), Thoubal for not taking further proceeding of the
case.
Md. Ajmal Hussain, learned pro bono for the private respondent submits that in view of the
provision of section 35 of POCSO Act, the statutory period of 1(one) year is not yet over from the
date of taking cognizance of the case.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the opinion that the present bail
application may be disposed of with a direction to the learned Special Judge (POCSO), Thoubal to
seriously deal with the matter for disposal of the case as fast as possible and the learned Special
Judge (POCSO), Thoubal is also directed to dispose of the present Spl. T./POCSO/6/2023 within a
period of 5(five) months from today itself.
Send an extract copy of this order to the Court of learned Special Judge (POCSO), Thoubal during
the course of the day.
The learned counsel for the petitioner is given liberty to approach this Court, if the learned Special
Judge (POCSO), Thoubal does not comply with the direction to the order of this Court.
