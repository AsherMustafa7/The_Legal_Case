Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176977958/ 3
Unknown vs The Manipur Public School Society ... on 24 May, 2024
and budget estimate of the school and in the said letter, the principal of the school reflected the facts
and circumstances of the school since its establishment till the written of the said letter and also
giving instalment and remaining amount may be paid as per the availability of fund.
[12] The respondent filed counter affidavit stating that the Manipur Public School is run by a society
namely the Manipur Public School Society WP(C) No. 749 of 2022 Page 6 and the society was
registered on 28.03.1979 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 by framing its Rules and
Regulations. As the school is run by the MPS Society, the conditions of service of its employees are
governed by the Rules and Regulations framed by the society and the conditions of service of the
State employees are not automatically applicable to them. It is stated that as per the resolutions
taken under Agenda No. 9 in the meeting of the Internal Finance Monitoring Committee (IFMC)
held on 24.09.2018, 1/3 of the payable amount is to be released as 1st instalment and remaining
amount to be paid as per the availability of funds to Mangla Rana (petitioner No. 4), A. Daneswari
Devi (petitioner No. 1), L. Sabita Devi (petitioner No. 9) and Y. Sunita Devi (petitioner No. 3).
Further, it is sated that all the retired employees are being paid a sum of Rs. 10,000/- per month on
every release of pay and allowances to regular staff as per a decision taken by the IFMC in its
meeting held on 12.11.2019 and the sum of Rs. 10,000/- per month has been paid to the petitioners
till September, 2022. It is stated that the society is processing for payments of the monthly benefit of
Rs. 10,000/- from October, 2022 to March, 2023 payable to the petitioners. It is stated that the
IFMC in its meeting held on 12.11.2019 decided under Agenda No. 3 for payment of Rs. 10,000/- per
month to the retired officials as recurring payment for the time being on every release of pay and
allowances of the regular staff and this will be continued till the financial position of the school is
improved. Accordingly, all retired employees were paid a sum of Rs. 10,000/- on very release of pay
and allowances to the regular staff. The School is committed to pay salaries etc. to its current staff
WP(C) No. 749 of 2022 Page 7 and post-retirement benefits to all retired staff as per Rules and
Regulations of the society. However, as on date, the school is in deep financial difficulties, incurring
a huge deficit estimated to be about Rs. 5 crores. It is further stated that payment of 1/3 of the
payment due to retired employees, payment of an amount of Rs. 10,000/- per month each to the
retired employees on every release of salaries and allowances to current staff and so on are
temporary measures adopted by the school to provide some financial solace to the retired
employees. It is prayed that the present writ petition may be dismissed.
[13] Mrs. A. Noutuneshari Devi, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that there is no reason
for withholding the retiral benefits of the petitioners. It is pointed out that such benefits can be
withheld during the pendency of any enquiry or criminal proceedings against the petitioners and
can be denied upon verdict of guilty against the pensioners in such proceedings. Learned counsel
draws the attention of this Court to the sole reason of withholding the retiral benefits as due to acute
financial constraints of the school management. It is prayed that the respondent be directed to
release the retiral benefits of the petitioners forthwith. [14] Mr. Dennis Tokpam, learned counsel for
the respondent submits that the retiral benefits are not withheld in true sense, but non- release of
the same is due to acute financial situation faced by the school management coupled with
non-functional managing committee for a considerable long period. It is pointed out that whenever
funds are available, a sum of Rs. 10,000/- is released to all retired employees of the school. It is
WP(C) No. 749 of 2022 Page 8 prayed that some more time be given to the school management to

clear the due amount.
[15] This Court has perused the materials on record and considered the submissions made at bar. It
is an admitted fact that the petitioners are retired employees of the respondent school. Further, it is
not in dispute that no disciplinary and/or criminal proceedings are pending against the petitioners.
It is the case of the respondent that failure to clear the retiral benefits is due to acute financial
problem faced by the school management. It is the settled proposition of law in service
jurisprudence that retiral benefit of a pensioner cannot be withheld except upon found guilty in a
departmental proceeding and/or criminal case initiated against the pensioner. Right to pensionary
benefit is a constitutional right guaranteed under Article 300A of the Constitution of India.
[16] In the case of K. Boni Mao v. State of Manipur [WP(C) No. 633 of 2023, Order dated
29.11.2023]- MANU/MN/0222/2023, this Court held that right and payment of pension does not
depend upon the discretion of the employer and poor financial condition is not a ground to deny
pensionary benefit and other entitlement to the pensioner, unless the pensioner is found guilty of
grave misconduct or negligence during service period in a departmental or criminal proceeding.
Para 10, 11 and 12 are reproduced below for reference.
[10] In the case of Jharkhand & Ors. v. Jitendra Kumar Srivastava & Anr. reported as
MANU/SC/0801/2013 : (2013) 12 SCC 210 Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the right to pensionary
benefit is a constitutional right as as such cannot be taken away without proper justification.
Further, in the case of Dr. Uma Agarwal v. State of U.P. reported as MANU/SC/0184/1999 : (1999)
3 SCC 438, it was held that grant of pensionary benefits is not a bounty, but a right of the employee,
WP(C) No. 749 of 2022 Page 9 and as such cannot be denied without proper jurisdiction. In the case
of D.S. Nakara & Ors. v. Union of India reported as MANU/SC/0237/1982 : (1983) 1 SCC 3005, a 5
Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court held that "31.......(i) that pension is neither a bounty nor a
matter of grace depending upon the sweet will of the employer and that it creates a vested right
subject to 1972 Rules which are statutory in character because they are enacted in exercise of powers
conferred by the proviso to Article 309 and clause (5) of Article 148 of the Constitution; (ii) that the
pension is not an ex gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered; and (ii) it is a
social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice to those who in the hey-day of their life
ceaselessly toiled for the employer on an assurance that in their old age they would not be left in
lurch. It must also be noticed that the quantum of pension is a certain percentage correlated to the
average emoluments drawn during last three years of service reduced to 10 months under liberalised
pension scheme, Its payment is dependent upon an additional condition of impeccable behaviour
even subsequent to retirement, that is, since the cessation of the contract of service and that it can
be reduced or withdrawn as a disciplinary measure". In the case of Sudhir Chandra Sarkar v. Tata
Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. reported as MANU/SC/0208/1984 : (1984) 3 SCC 369, it was held that "18.
For centuries the courts swung in favour of the view that pension is either a bounty or a gratuitous
payment for loyal service rendered depending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer not
claimable as a right and therefore, no right to pension can be enforced through court. This view held
the field and a suit to recover pension was held not maintainable. With the modern notions of social
justice and social security, concept of pension underwent a radical change and it is now well-settled
that pension is a right and payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of the employer, nor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176977958/ 5
Unknown vs The Manipur Public School Society ... on 24 May, 2024
can it be denied at the sweet will or fancy of the employer."
[11] Poor financial condition of the State and non-receiving of the instruction from the higher
authority is not a ground to deny pensionary benefit and other entitlement to the pensioner. The
contention of the State Government for releasing the pensionary benefit of the petitioner is without
any substance and perverse on the face of it.
[12] Reference may be made to Rule 9 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 which empowers withholding of
pension or gratuity or both, if the pensioner is found guilty of grave misconduct or negligence during
the period of service in a departmental or judicial proceeding. Apart from Rule 9, there is no other
provisions which stipulate withholding of pension or gratuity or any other pensionary benefit. In the
present case, the reason cited for not releasing the pensionary benefit is the poor financial condition
of the State and non-clearance for the payment from higher authority. The contents of the letter
dated 24.10.2023 sent by the Treasury Officer, Imphal West to the Office of Govt. Advocate, High
Court are not within the scope of Rule 9 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 for the simple reason that
there was no departmental or judicial proceeding against the petitioner holding her of guilty of grave
misconduct. This Court is of firmed opinion that withholding the pensionary benefit of the
petitioner by the State authority is without any substance and the same is in violation of aforesaid
Rule 9 and also WP(C) No. 749 of 2022 Page 10 against the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court. Such illegal action cannot be sustained in a welfare State.
[17] This Court is aware of the fact that the school management is run by a Society, whose members
are top bureaucrats of the State and the financial problem can be sorted using the good office of the
members. As held in the case of Boni Mao (supra) as reproduced in para 16 above, this Court is of
firmed opinion that poor financial condition is not a ground to deny retiral benefit. Payment of
Rs.10,000/- whenever fund is available is not contemplated by any rule or precedent.
[18] In the circumstances and in view of the settled law in this regard, this Court directs the
respondent to release balance amount of retiral benefits to the petitioners forthwith. The payment
shall be completed within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order,
failing which interest @ 6% per annum shall be payable from the date of initial entitlement. Writ
petition is allowed. No cost. [19] Send a copy of this order to the Secretary, Manipur Public School
Society for information and necessary compliance.
