Udaybhan Singh vs State Of M.P. on 11 March, 2019
2. At the out set, it is to be pointed out that during pendency of the appeal, appellant No.1 in
Criminal Appeal No.572/2008, namely Veerbahadur S/o Govind Singh passed away and therefore
appeal has abated for him.
3. Prosecution case in short is that on 23.07.2006 at about 3.30 p.m. prosecution witness Padam
Singh (P.W.5) had lodged FIR (Ex.P/6) that his son Kailash Singh had 4 Cr.A.572/2008 &
Cr.A.No.597/2008 gone to sow Bajra crop on the field close to the house of the accused
Veerbahadur Singh when it was disclosed that some dispute had taken place between his son and
Veerbahadur. At the relevant point of time, he was also going towards that direction when he saw
his son Kailash coming on the road close to the field of Prahlad Singh. At that time, Veerbahadur
armed with a mauser gun, Shiv Kumar with mauser gun, Sanjay with 12 bore double barrel gun,
Bhanu with licenced gun, Raju with 12 bore double barrel gun, Udaybhan @ Pappu with 12 bore
double barrel gun, Sauram Bhadoria armed with a katta of 315 bore, surrounded his son Kailash and
fired shots on him with intention to kill him. Bullet had pierced in right arm and ribs on the right
hand side. This incident was seen by witnesses Rammohan (P.W.7), Indrajeet (P.W.8) and
Shyambihari (P.W.6). Kailash was admitted in District Hospital Bhind, where he died, on which
intimation was sent vide Ex.P/4 to the City Kotwali Bhind. Spot Map (Ex.P/7) was prepared. Dead
body was sent for post mortem and post mortem was conducted vide Ex.P/16. Thereafter, after
carrying out the investigation, charge sheet was filed. Accused had abjured their guilt.
5 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008
4. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the prosecution witnesses are not reliable
witnesses and all the eye witnesses are related to each others. It is submitted that Padam Singh
(P.W.5), who had lodged the FIR (Ex.P/6) at about 16.30 hours, is father of the deceased.
Shyambihari (P.W.6) is the cousin brother of deceased Kailash. Rammohan Singh (P.W.7) is the real
younger brother of the deceased Kailash. Indrajeet (P.W.8) is also a cousin brother of deceased
Kailash.
5. It is also submitted that though arms were sent for examination vide Ex.P/26 but empties were
not sent for examination so to corroborate as to which of the bullet/ cartridge were fired from which
of the weapons alleged to have been used in the commission of the crime.
6. It is also submitted that no crime number is mentioned on Ex.P/2, which is Nazri Naksha, Ex.P/3
- information of incidental death, Ex.P/4 - letter to T.I. and Ex.P/5 - Medical Report of Kailash
Singh, gives rise to a bona fide doubt that such documents were prepared on a subsequent date.
7. It is also submitted that as per the post mortem report (Ex.P/16), death was caused due to gun
shot injury leading to injury to vital organs resulting in excessive haemorrhage 6 Cr.A.572/2008 &
Cr.A.No.597/2008 and shock causing death. Though mode of death is mentioned as homicidal but
Dr.Ajeet Mishra (P.W.9), who conducted post mortem, admitted that there was an entry wound
measuring 2 x 2 cm. on the right arm with inverted corners. There was blackening around the
wound. There was an exit wound measuring 4 x 3 x 1/2 cm. in the center of the right arm. There was
fracture in the humerus bone of the right hand and there was an entry wound on the right hand side
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33440121/ 3
Udaybhan Singh vs State Of M.P. on 11 March, 2019
of the chest with inverted margins and blackening but there was no exit wound but in the post
mortem, no bullet was found in the body. It is submitted that Dr.R.K.Agarwal (P.W.4), who had
conducted MLC at District Hospital Bhind, had clearly opined that if immediate medical help would
have been made available to the deceased, then his life could have been saved.
8. It is also submitted that the timing and place of lodging of the FIR is also doubtful, inasmuch as
Padam Singh (P.W.5) has deposed that T.I. had come out side the police station and had recorded
the report and after this Kailash was sent alongwith his brother for treatment to Bhind Hospital. It is
submitted that conduct of Padam Singh (P.W.5), father of the deceased, is suspicious, inasmuch as 7
Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 instead of going to hospital to take care of his son, he admitted
to have returned back to the village alongwith Daroga for further investigation.
9. It is also submitted that it is a case of false accusations where all the persons have been falsely
implicated and all the members of the family of Veerbahadur have been falsely implicated.
10. It is also submitted that two witnesses have been examined in defence, namely; Balbeer Singh
(D.W.1) and Ripudaman (D.W.2). Balbeer Singh (D.W.1) has deposed that Kailash, Jaspal,
Indrajeet, Rammohan were armed with guns and had fired gun shots at Udaybhan, who is accused
in the present case. Since Udaybhan was barehanded and one of the bullets fired by them had stuck
Kailash, therefore, Kailash has not died of any act of the accused but due to he being entrapped in a
cross-fire of his own party. Similarly, it is pointed out that Ripudaman (D.W.2) has deposed that on
23.07.2006 accused Veerbahadur, Shivkumar, Raju @ Rajkumar, Sanju @ Sangramsingh had
participated in the 13th day ceremony of his grandmother on 23.07.2006, for which they had
reached his village Kotharvala on 22.7.2006 at about 4.00 p.m. and had stayed at his house on
23.7.2006 8 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 and thereafter had left his house on 24.7.2006. In
support of his claim, he has exhibited invitation card of such 13 th day ceremony as Ex.D/4, in which
his name is mentioned from 'A' to 'A' part.
11. Learned counsel for the appellants have placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of State of M.P. Vs. Kriparam, as reported in 2004 (1) CCSC 188, wherein Hon'ble
Supreme Court has upheld the judgment of acquittal recorded by the High Court of M.P. on the
ground that there was no eye witness and even Serologist had not corroborated the recoveries as he
had not stated that any human blood was found on the recovered articles.
Similarly, reliance has been placed to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
State of Punjab Vs. Sucha Singh and others as reported in 2003 (1) CCSC 346, wherein again
acquittal recorded by the High Court of Punjab has been upheld on the ground that there was
discrepancy between the ocular testimony and medical evidence and treating the animosity to be
double edged weapon, Supreme Court has refused to interfere in the finding of the acquittal.
Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of the 9 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Bhanwar Singh as reported in 2004 (3) CCSC
1479 is also on the same basis that there was discrepancy in the ocular evidence and the medical
evidence, therefore, finding of the acquittal of the High Court was upheld. In the case of State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33440121/ 4
Udaybhan Singh vs State Of M.P. on 11 March, 2019
Uttar Pradesh Vs. Shiv Kumar and others as reported in 2005 (2) CCSC 592, Hon'ble Supreme Court
after finding the evidence of so called eye witnesses doubtful refused to disturb the finding of
acquittal recorded by the High Court.
Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mathura
Yadav Vs. State of Bihar as reported in 2003 (I) MPWN SN 75, wherein it has been held that glaring
omissions and discrepancies in the statement of related eye-witnesses can not be ignored and
though independent eye witnesses were present but have not been examined by the prosecution
renders its case doubtful.
Similarly, in the case of Daljit Singh Vs. State of Punjab as reported in 1999 (I) MPWN SN 122, it has
been held that when conduct of alleged eye-witness son of the deceased is not natural and statement
of another eye-witness 10 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 is not consistent, no conviction can
be recorded.
In the case of Narayan and another Vs. State of M.P. as reported in 2005 Cr.L.R. (M.P.).219, it has
been held that two eye- witnesses of the offence being brothers and close relatives of the deceased
were examined but prosecution did not furnish any explanation for not examining independent
witnesses who were present on the spot. Also finding the motive of crime alleged by the prosecution
to be weak and not helpful to the prosecution, conviction was set aside.
In the case of Mujabir Khan Vs. State of M.P. as reported in 2005 Cr.L.R. (M.P.) 877, observing
material contradictions and omissions in the statement of prosecution witnesses accused appellants
were acquitted. In the case of Balram and others Vs. State of M.P. as reported in 2018 (3) CDHC
1498 (M.P.). 1498, it has been held that in the absence of any evidence to prove factum of common
object between all the appellants, it is unsafe to convict any appellant with the aid of Section 149 of
IPC even for causing injury much less murder.
12. Learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand submits that this is not a case of circumstantial
evidence but a case of direct eye-witness account. It is submitted that conduct of 11 Cr.A.572/2008 &
Cr.A.No.597/2008 none of the witnesses is unnatural and there was enmity over cultivating the land
over which such incident has taken place. It is submitted that argument of learned counsel for the
appellants that Dr.R.K.Agarwal (P.W.4) had opined that if treatment would have been received by
the deceased in time, then his life could have been saved with a consequential prayer to convert the
offence from one Section 302/149 of IPC to Section 304 Part II of IPC is not made out specially
when Dr.Ajeet Mishra (P.W.9), who conducted the post mortem, has categorically deposed in para 7
of his cross-examination that after sustaining injuries, as were sustained by the deceased, he could
have survived for 10-15 minutes and even if he would have been given immediate treatment, there
were no chances of his survival. This witness has not been confronted with the deposition of
Dr.R.K.Agarwal (P.W.4), whose statements were recorded on 22.3.2007, whereas statement of
P.W.9 were recorded on 17.5.2007.
13. As regards to the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that FIR was ante-dated,
as there was no mention of crime number on Ex.P/2, P/3, P/4 and P/5, it is submitted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33440121/ 5
Udaybhan Singh vs State Of M.P. on 11 March, 2019
learned Public Prosecutor that report was timely sent to the JMFC concerned and this aspect has not
12 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 been disputed. Further Ex.P/2 was prepared by Patwari and
therefore, there was no occasion for Patwari to have put crime number on such documents. It is also
submitted that prosecution case can not be thrown out merely because certain documents do not
contain crime number. It is submitted that it is a case of brutal murder by an unlawful assembly of
five or more persons and therefore the conviction, which has been recorded by the trial court, is just
and correct and does not call for any interference.
14. As far as submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that certain documents were not
having crime number described on them is concerned, this aspect has been dealt with by the
Division Bench of this court in the case of Ramsingh and others Vs. State of M.P. decided on
27.10.2006, wherein it has been held that such mistake is not fatal to the case of the prosecution.
15. As far as the judgments in the case of Kriparam (supra), Sucha Singh (supra), Bhanwar Singh
(supra) and Shiv Kumar (supra) are concerned, they have no relevance to the facts of the present
case, inasmuch as convicted accused died of gun shot injuries and ocular evidence is duly
corroborated by the medical evidence.
13 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008
16. Arguments of the learned counsel for the appellants that Dr.R.K.Agarwal (P.W.4) had opined
that if the deceased would have received immediate treatment then his life could have been saved is
not correct, inasmuch as this statement is contradicted by Dr.Ajeet Mishra (P.W.9), who conducted
post mortem and he was never confronted with such statement of Dr.R.K.Agarwal (P.W.4).
17. As far as the judgments in the case of Mathura Yadav (supra), Daljit Singh (supra), Mujabir Khan
(supra) and Narayan (supra) are concerned, they are on different facts because even the defence
witnesses have done a good job to discredit their own case as will be apparent from the testimony of
Balbeer Singh (D.W.1) and Ripudaman (D.W.2). Balbeer Singh (D.W.1) has taken a line of defence
that the deceased died being trapped in the cross fire of his own members who fired shots on
Udaybhan, whereas Ripudaman (D.W.2) has deposed that accused were not present on the scene of
crime and were participating in 13th day ceremony of his grandmother at his village. Thus, Balbeer
Singh (D.W.1) and Ripudaman (D.W.2) have taken two different hypothesis. Alibi of absence could
not be proved by just producing a card of 13 th day ceremony of 14 Cr.A.572/2008 &
Cr.A.No.597/2008 grandmother of Ripudaman (D.W.2). There is consistency in the evidence of the
eye witnesses. FSL Report (Ex.P/26) has proved that guns, which were seized from the accused
contained remnants of their earlier use and therefore onus was on the appellant to point out as to
where they had used such licensed gun on an earlier occasion and account for the bullets so
consumed. This report of the FSL has also not been contradicted through any cogent reliable
evidence and therefore when ocular evidence corroborates with the medical evidence as well as
scientific evidence, no authority can fault but to accept the judgment of the trial court.
18. The death was homicidal and this fact has not been challenged by the defence counsel at any
point of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33440121/ 6
Udaybhan Singh vs State Of M.P. on 11 March, 2019
19. There was no delay in lodging of the FIR so to demonstrate that there was sufficient time leg to
implicate others, who were not present on the scene of incident. Even the names of the other
prosecution witnesses, who were present at the scene of crime, have been mentioned in the FIR
(Ex.P/6) and therefore it can not be said that such witnesses were nurtured at a later point of time.
Though it is true that prosecution witnesses have not been able to point 15 Cr.A.572/2008 &
Cr.A.No.597/2008 out as to which of the accused fired from which of the gun and which had hit at
which place of the body of the deceased, but that is not such a major omission so as to render the
presence of the accused doubtful at the scene of crime.
20. The plea of the appellants that all the eye witnesses being related to the deceased and no
independent witness is examined is also not such a material omission so to render the prosecution
story completely irrelevant. In the case of Dalip Singh Vs. State of Punjab as reported in AIR 1953
SC 364, it has been held that mere fact that witness is a relation of a victim is not sufficient to
discard his testimony. It has also been held that when feelings run high and there is personal cause
for enmity, that there is a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a
grudge along with the guilty, but there should be foundation for such a criticism and the mere fact of
relationship far from being a foundation for such criticism is often sure guarantee of truth.
Similarly, in the case of Gurcharan Singh Vs. State of Punjab as reported in AIR 1956 SC 460, it has
been held that relationship of the three out of four prosecution witnesses to the murdered man is no
ground for 16 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 not acting upon their testimony if it is otherwise
reliable in the sense that the witnesses were competent witnesses who could be expected to be near
about the place of occurrence and could have seen what happened there at the scene of occurrence.
In this regard, Ex.P/7, Crime Details form and the spot map is relevant, wherefrom it is apparent
that the house of Veerbahadur is in close proximity to the place of the occurrence of the incident.
Similarly, house of accused Sauram is also in close proximity of the place of the incident and
therefore their presence at the relevant place can not be doubted. Moreover, in his statement under
Section 313 Cr.P.C. accused Udaybhan have not taken a plea of his absence from the scene of crime.
To advance such plea of absence, no independent witness has been examined inasmuch Ripudaman
(D.W.2) has admitted that he is cousin brother of Veerbahadur, who happened to be son of his
maternal uncle. In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs. State of Punjab as reported in AIR 1976 SC 2304, it
has been held that relationship by itself is not a ground to discredit the testimony of the witnesses if
it was otherwise found to be consistent and true.
21. In the case of Chandrika Prasad Singh Vs. State of 17 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 Bihar
as reported in AIR 1972 SC 109, it has been held that onus to establish alibi is on the accused and if
it is not discharged the appellate court will not interfere in the finding of the lower court. In the case
of State of Haryana Vs. Sher Singh as reported in AIR 1981 SC 1021, it has been held that when an
accused pleads alibi, the burden is on him to prove it under Section 103 of the Evidence Act.
18. Learned counsel's last argument is that with the aid of Section 149 of IPC, all the accused could
not have been convicted and he has also placed reliance on the judgment of the Division Bench of
this court in the case of Balram (supra), but here the facts are slightly different, inasmuch as per the
post mortem report (Ex.P/16), testified by Dr.Ajeet Mishra (P.W.9), there were two entry wounds on
the body of the deceased. This witness has clearly opined that both the injuries could not have been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33440121/ 7
Udaybhan Singh vs State Of M.P. on 11 March, 2019
caused through a single gun shot. Specific role has been ascribed by the eye witnesses and therefore
facts of the case of Balram (supra) are different. It is not the case of the appellants that it was a
sudden action of the one of the members of the assembly and therefore all are not liable. As per the
recitals in the FIR and the evidence, which has been adduced that the deceased 18 Cr.A.572/2008 &
Cr.A.No.597/2008 was surrounded by all the accused, who were armed with deadly weapons and
therefore common object can be gathered from the facts and circumstances of the case. In fact, once
it has been proved that there was an unlawful assembly and the offence was by a member of
unlawful assembly and in prosecution of the common object of the assembly, then conviction can
not be interfered with. In the present case all the ingredients of Section 149 are made out and merely
because witnesses are related to the deceased is not sufficient to discard their otherwise cogent
testimony.
22. Reliance can be placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Anup Lal
Yadav Vs. State of Bihar as reported in (2014) 10 SCC 275, wherein a concept of constructive liability
for being part of unlawful assembly has been propagated and it has been held that there is no
necessity to show overt act by all. It has been held that it is well settled that once it is established
that unlawful assembly had a common object, it is not necessary that all persons forming unlawful
assembly must be shown to have committed some overt act, rather they can be convicted under
Section 149 of IPC.
23. Reliance can also be placed on the judgment of the 19 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. Vs. Keshav Chand and others as reported in AIR
2004 SC 4671, wherein it has been held that there is difference between Section 34 and Section 149,
inasmuch as Section 149 deals with common object and Section 34 travels far beyond it and one has
to gather common intention to convict a person. Moreover, under Section 149, only being member
of unlawful assembly is sufficient to record conviction and therefore individual act becomes
secondary unlike section 34, where individual act is equally important to record any finding of
conviction. Thus, when there is no inconsistency in the prosecution story that all the
accused/appellants were present on the scene of the crime and were part of unlawful assembly and
with a common object fired several bullets on the deceased, the conviction under Section 302 or 302
with the aid of Section 149 can not be faulted with.
24. Therefore, the appellants have failed to make out a case to substantiate either alibi of absence or
the case that deceased died because of injury caused by cross fire of members of his own party. Thus,
no fault can be attributed to the judgment of conviction passed by the trial court. Both the appeals
fail and are dismissed. Appellants Raju @ 20 Cr.A.572/2008 & Cr.A.No.597/2008 Rajkumar and
Sanju @ Samrat Singh in Cr.A. No.572/2008 and appellants Udaybhan Singh and Sauram in
Cr.A.No.597/2008 are on bail. Their bail bonds stand cancelled. They are directed to surrender
before the trial court on or before 25th March 2019 to serve remaining sentence.
Let a copy of the judgment and the record be sent to the trial court.
