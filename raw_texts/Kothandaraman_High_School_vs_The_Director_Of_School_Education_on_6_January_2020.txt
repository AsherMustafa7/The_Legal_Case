2. Based on the consent given by both sides and also considering the limited issue that is involved in
all these Writ Petitions, the Writ Petitions are taken up for final hearing.
3. The case of the petitioner is that, three non teaching vacancies arose in the school and the
petitioner school has sought for permission from the second respondent to fill up the vacancies. The
second respondent by his proceedings dated 27.09.2018, 04.10.2018 and 22.10.2018 granted
permission to the petitioner school to fill up the post of Junior Assistant, Watchman and Sweeper.
The petitioner school, thereafter, issued advertisement and based on the list furnished by the
Employment Exchange, proceeded further with the selection and by virtue of the appointment
orders dated 26.11.2018, appointed a Junior Assistant, http://www.judis.nic.in Watchman and
Sweeper and all the three persons joined the duty.
4. The petitioner, thereafter, sent a proposal for the approval of the persons who were appointed on
05.12.2018. The second respondent rejected the approval of the appointment that was made on the
ground that the post are to be filled up with the surplus staff available in the other aided Schools.
Aggrieved by the same, the present Writ Petitions have been filed before this Court.
5. Mr.S.N.Ravichandran, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that all the
three posts were filled up after getting approval from the second respondent and the selection was
conducted by publishing an advertisement and calling for the list from Employment Exchange. The
learned counsel submitted that the second respondent has rejected the approval based on a
subsequent G.O. which came to be passed and which is sought to be given a retrospective effect.
Learned counsel further submitted that the issue involved in this Writ Petition is squarely covered
by an earlier decision rendered by this Court in K.Balamurugan Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu and
four others in W.P.No.23950 of 2018, dated 25.06.2019. The learned counsel submitted
http://www.judis.nic.in that the impugned order passed by the second respondent requires
interference and direction must be given to the second respondent to approve the appointment
made by the petitioner.
6. Per contra, Mrs.V.Annalakshmi, learned Government Advocate, appearing on behalf of the
respondents submitted that the present appointment is governed by G.O.Ms.No.238 dated
13.11.2018. Learned Counsel submitted that as per the said G.O., the appointment can be made only
after accommodating the surplus staff who are available in other aided schools. Learned counsel
submitted that as on today, there are surplus staff, who are available, to be accommodated in the
other aided schools where there is vacancy. Learned counsel submitted that the approval for the
appointment was rejected by the second respondent only based on this G.O.Ms.238 dated 13.11.2018
and therefore, the order passed by the second respondent does not require any interference.
7. This Court has carefully considered the submissions made by either side and perused the entire
materials available on record.
8. Before this Court ventures into considering the merits of the case, http://www.judis.nic.in it will
be beneficial to rely upon the judgment that has been cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner
in K.Balamurugan Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu and four others in W.P.No.23950 of 2018, dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10147966/ 3
Kothandaraman High School vs The Director Of School Education on 6 January, 2020
25.06.2019, referred supra.
The relevant paragraphs of the judgment are extracted hereunder:
“...9. The learned counsel for the petitioner would also rely on the decision of this
Court reported in (2007) 4 MLJ 561 (A.Murugesan V. State of Tamil Nadu, rep. By its
Secretary, Department of School Education, Chennai and others), wherein the
learned counsel would draw the attention of this Court to the following passage in
support of his contention that for non- teaching staff, there is no provision in the Act
or Rules for getting prior permission which is extracted hereunder:
“6. ... As far as non-teaching staff are concerned, as rightly contended by the learned
counsel for the petitioner, there is no provision for seeking prior permission for
making an appointment cannot be held as not in conformity with the provisions of
the Private Schools Regulation Act.” http://www.judis.nic.in
10.This Court has considered the submissions made on behalf of the petitioner as
well as the learned Government Advocate for respondents 1 to 4.
11.From the facts as mentioned above and also the legal principle as relied on by the
learned counsel for the petitioner, it becomes very clear that as far as the
appointment of the non- teaching staff is concerned, either the Tamil Nadu
Recognised in Private Schools (Regulation) Act or Rules provide for any such
requirement and therefore, the rejection order stating that the School has not
obtained prior permission, would be per se illegal and cannot be sustained in law.
12.Moreover, as far as the facts of this case are concerned, the original proposal was
forwarded by the School on 26.02.2018 itself i.e., much prior to the coming into force
the G.O.Ms.No.101 dated 18.05.2018.
Therefore, even assuming for the sake of argument that the requirement is mandatory, such
requirement cannot be pressed into service as far as the present appointment of the petitioner is
concerned. Therefore, on facts, this http://www.judis.nic.in Court is of the view that the
appointment of the petitioner prior to coming into force of G.O.Ms.No.101 dated 18.05.2018 cannot
be unsettled only on the basis of requirement which is made mandatory subsequent to the proposal.
This Court when enquired with the Government Advocate as to what was the prevailing situation
before 18.05.2018 that whether any such requirement was there in any Government Orders, there
was no specific answer or material produced except stating that there was such requirement prior to
18.05.2018.
13.Even otherwise, as far as the above cited decisions are concerned, the ratio laid down thereon and
the observations made by the Division Bench of this Court as well as the learned Single Judge, it
emerges that unless the Act or Rules are amended correspondingly in line with the Government
Orders, the same cannot be insisted upon by the authorities. In fact, the learned Judge of this Court,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10147966/ 4
Kothandaraman High School vs The Director Of School Education on 6 January, 2020
in one of the aforesaid decisions, has held that such requirement cannot be insisted upon for
appointment of the non-teaching staff, since nothing has http://www.judis.nic.in been provided in
the Act or Rules for complying with such requirement. Therefore, in all fours, the petitioner has
made out a clear case for grant of relief. The objection of the official respondents has no legs to stand
and the same has to be rejected as without any merits or substance.
14. For the above said reasons, this Court is of the considered view that the impugned proceeding is
liable to be quashed and therefore, the order of the 4th respondent in Na.Ka.No.3469/A2/ 2018
dated 24.07.2018 is hereby set aside. The 4th respondent is directed to grant approval to the
appointment of the petitioner as Lab Assistant in the 5th respondent School and disburse the grant-
in-aid towards salary and allowances with effect from the date of his appointment i.e. 26.02.2018.
The consequential order is to be passed by the authorities within a period of four weeks from the
date of receipt of a copy of this order.”
9. It is clear from the above judgment that in so far as non teaching staff are concerned, there is no
requirement for seeking prior permission http://www.judis.nic.in for making any appointment. In
order to come to such a conclusion, the learned Single Judge has relied upon the judgment of the
Division Bench. The learned Single Judge had also recorded that a similar order was passed and had
directed the authority to grant approval to the appointment of non teaching staff in the concerned
school.
10. In the considered view of this Court, the above judgment will squarely apply to the facts of the
present case. In fact, the petitioner school is placed in a better footing in the present case. The
petitioner school has approached the second respondent even before proceeding further with the
appointment and had sought for permission to fill up the posts. The second respondent had granted
permission to fill up the post of non- teaching staff by his proceedings dated 27.09.2018, 04.10.2018
and 22.10.2018 respectively. Only after obtaining such a permission, the petitioner school had
proceeded to call for applications and thereafter, it has appointed a Junior Assistant, Watchman and
Sweeper on 26.11.2018. Therefore, the approval for the appointment only becomes a formality since
even before the appointment, approval was granted by the second respondent. Even on this ground,
the impugned proceedings of the second respondent is liable to be interfered with.
http://www.judis.nic.in
11. For the above stated reasons, this Court is of the considered opinion that the impugned
proceedings of the second respondent dated 04.11.2019 is liable to be quashed and accordingly, the
same is quashed. The second respondent is directed to grant approval to the appointments made by
the petitioner school to the post of Junior Assistant, Watchman and Sweeper and disburse the
grant-in-aid towards salary and allowances with effect from the date of appointment. The
consequential orders shall be passed within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy
of this order.
12. All the above Writ Petitions are allowed with the above directions. No costs. Consequently,
connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
