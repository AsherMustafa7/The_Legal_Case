This petition coming on for hearing this day, Hon'ble Shri Justice
Ravi Malimath, Chief Justice passed the following:
ORDER
By the order dated 24.08.2020 passed in W.P. No.4118 of 2020, the learned Single Judge referred
the following four questions to the Larger Bench for consideration:-
"a) Whether, the pronouncement of law by the Division Bench of this Court i.e. the
judgment delivered in Writ Appeal No.717/2016 on 10/07/2017 is binding upon
another Division Bench of the same number of judges keeping in view the principles
of the doctrine of binding precedent, especially when in the subsequent judgment
delivered in Writ Appeal No.363/2020 the Division Bench has not taken into account
the earlier judgment delivered in Writ Appeal No.717/2016, meaning thereby,
whether the judgment delivered prior in time by Bench of same strength holds the
field and the subsequent judgment delivered on the same subject by the same
strength of Bench is not a binding precedent?
b) Whether, the Government servant, who is no longer in service, is entitled for
increment after his retirement keeping in view the judgment delivered in Writ Appeal
No.363/2020, decided on 06/03/2020?

c) Whether, the Government servant is entitled for increment after his retirement
and enhanced pension, especially when the pension has to be granted by taking into
account the emoluments paid to the Government servant in the last year or part of
last year of his service as such Government servant in light of Madhya Pradesh Civil
Services (Pension) Rules, 1976?
d) Whether, the decision in the case of State of M. P. and Others Vs. Rajendra Prasad
Tiwari (Writ Appeal No.363/2020, decided on 06/03/2020) lays down the correct
law?"
Thereafter, the Larger Bench was constituted. In terms of the order dated 28.01.2021, the matter
was adjourned in view of the fact that the questions referred to the Larger Bench were the very same
questions which were being considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP(C) No.8219 of 2020
(Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission Company Limited and another vs. S.R. Ramchandran &
others).
Presently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment dated 11.04.2023 have answered questions
No.(b) and (c).
In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, question Nos.(b) and (c) are answered in
terms of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, as aforesaid.
So far as questions No.(a) and (d) are concerned, we are of the considered view that these questions
may not be considered by this Bench. The appropriate court would decide the said questions in view
of the judgment of this Court in the case of Jabalpur Bus Operators Association vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh and another reported in 2003 (1) MPHT 226.
The questions so referred are answered accordingly.
