Biraja Prasanna Satapathy, J.
I.A. No.418 of 2019 This is an application filed by the appellants seeking condonation of delay of
around 1904 days in filing of the appeal in question.
1. It is contended that GIA Case No.576 of 2011 was filed by the sole respondent seeking extension of
the benefit // 2 // of grant-in-aid w.e.f. 01.06.1994 under GIA Order, 1994 instead of covering the
same under Grant-In-Aid Order 2004.

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
2. It is contended that this Court vide order dated 11.07.2023 was pleased to issue notice on the
question of limitation subject to the appellants depositing a sum of Rs.50,000/- before the Registry
on or before 24.07.2023.
Pursuant to the said order an Account Payee Cheque bearing No.696740 dated 21.07.2023 for
Rs.50,000/- was deposited before the Registry. The said amount so deposited by the Appellants
after being en-cashed has been deposited in an interest-bearing account in terms of the order passed
by this Court on 11.07.2023.
2.1. It is also contended that after receipt of the Judgment so passed by the Tribunal on 30.12.2013,
Appellant No.2 vide letter dated 12.04.2019 instructed Appellant No.3 to file the appeal which was
ultimately filed before this Court on 17.05.2019. It is accordingly contended that since the delay in
filing the appeal is neither intentional nor deliberate, rather a bonafide one, the same is liable to be
condoned by this Court.
2.2. In support of his contention with regard to condonation of delay, learned State Counsel relied
on the // 3 // stand taken in Para- 3 & 4 of the interim application, which are reproduced
hereunder:-
"3. That it is respectfully submitted that in the aforesaid Execution Case, notices were issued but the
State Opp. Parties, on several occasion, taken time to file response, as a result, no fruitful result has
come out from the aforesaid execution proceeding, in such circumstances, the
Respondent-cum-Applicant of the GIA Case No.576/2011 was constrained to approach the Hon'ble
High Court in W.P.(C) No.661/2018, seeking a direction for yearly disposal of the execution case
NO.51/2015. The aforesaid W.P.(C) No.661/2018 was disposed of vide order dtd.21.3.2018 with a
direction to the State Education Tribunal for disposal of the Execution Case No.51/2015 within a
period of three months from the date of production of certified copy of this order. For appreciation,
a copy of the order dtd.21.3.2018 passed in W.P.(C) No.661/2018 is filed herewith as Annexure-A/1.
4. That it is respectfully submitted that the certified copy of the aforesaid order dtd.21.3.2018 passed
in W.P.(C) NO.661/2018 was produced before the State Education Tribunal on 08.06.2018. It is
pertinent to mention here that the learned Tribunal has also thereafter passed several orders for
compliance of the judgment dtd.30.12.2013 passed in GIA Case No.576/2011, notwithstanding the
direction of the State Education Tribunal, no action was taken, on the other hand, the State Opp.
Parties took step thereafter to challenge the judgment dtd.30.12.2013 passed in GIA Case
No.576/2011 by filing FOA under Section 24(C) of the Education Act beyond the prescribed
limitation period of 60 days, with an inordinate delay of 1963 days, bearing FAO No.422/2019 (filed
on 17.5.2019). In the aforesaid FAO, the Appellant (State Opp. Parties) have filed the I.A.
No.418/2019 for condonation of delay of 1963 days. The notices being issued on the aforesaid I.A.
No.418/2019, the Respondent has already entered appearance and accordingly, filed this objection
to the limitation petition bearing I.A. No.418/2019 as follows".
2.3. It is also contended that similar application seeking condonation of delay of around 1011 days
when was not condoned by this Court in FAO No.125 of 2016, the matter was carried to the Hon'ble
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192192970/ 2
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
Apex Court. Hon'ble Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.11080-81 of 2017 set aside the order // 4 //
passed by this court on 25.01.2017 and allowed the Appeal by condoning the delay.
2.4. Not only that learned Addl. Govt. Advocate relied on the orders passed by the Hon'ble Apex
Court on 22.11.2019 in SLP (Civil) Diary No.33245 of 2018 and similar SLPs.
It is contended that in all the aforesaid three order, Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to condone the
delay in filing the Special Leave Petition by imposing a cost of Rs.50,000/- on the State. Order
passed in SLP (Civil) Diary No.33245 of 2018 and similar SLPs are reproduced hereunder:-
"Delay condoned.
Subject to the Petitioner-State depositing a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty
thousand only) in the Registry of this Court within four weeks from today, issue
notice, returnable on 13.01.2020, Dasti service, in addition, is permitted.
If the amount is not deposited within the stipulated time, the special leave petition
shall stand dismissed without further reference to the Court.
Upon deposit, the amount shall be invested in a fixed deposit receipt with a
nationalized bank initially for a period of 90 days with auto renewal facility.

NO.31098/2019; and Diary No.33665/2019 // 5 // Mr. Ashok Parija, learned Senior
Counsel invited out attention to the judgment and order dated 16.09.2019 passed in
Civil Appeal No.7295 of 2019 and all other connected matters. The issue involved in
the matter was set out in para 1 of the said judgment as under:
"1. The question involved in the appeals is whether the employees are entitled to
claim grant-in-aid as admissible under the Orissa (Non-Government Colleges, Junior
Colleges and Higher Secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order, 1994 (hereinafter
referred to as the ' the order of 1994), after its repeal in the year 2004 by virtue of
provisions contained in Orissa (Non-government Coleges, Junior Colleges and
Higher secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the
'the order of 2004'). The order of 2004 has also been repealed by Orissa (Aided
Colleges, Aided Junior Colleges, and Higher Secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order,
2008."
The conclusion drawn by the Court as set out in para 31 was as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192192970/ 3
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
"31. It is apparent on consideration of Paragrapha 4 of order of 2004 that only saving
of the right is to receive the block grant and only in case grant in aid had been
received on or before the repeal of the Order of 2004, it shall not be affected and the
Order of 1994 shall continue only for that purpose and no other rights are saved.
Thus, we approve the decision of the High Court in Lok Nath Behera (supra) on the
aforesaid aspect for the aforesaid reasons mentioned by us."
Relying on the aforesaid observations, it is submitted that the only right that was saved was to
receive the block grant and only in case the grant-in-aid was received on or before the repeal of the
Order of 2004. It is further submitted that the decision of the High Court in Loknath Behera was
approved by this Court. Exactly contrary situation has now been accepted by the High Court in the
orders presently under appeal.
We must however state that the matters were disposed of by the High Court as the petition in every
case was delayed by at least 800 days. In the circumstances, we pass following order:-
a) Delay condoned.
Subject to the petitioner-state depositing a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only), to the
account of every petition in the Registry of this Court within four weeks from today, let notices be
issued to the respondents, returnable on 13.01.2020.
Dasti service, in addition, is permitted.
b) If the amount is not deposited within the stipulated time, the special leave petitions shall stand
dismissed without further reference to the Court.
// 6 //
c) Upon deposit, the amount shall be invested in a fixed deposit receipt with a nationalized bank
initially for a period of 90 days with auto renewal facility.
Mr. Subhasish Mohanty, learned Advocate-on-Record, who has appeared on behalf of Caveator/
Sole respondent in SLP (Civil) Diary No.31098 of 2019, accepts notice on behalf of sole respondent.
He prays for and is granted three weeks' time to put in affidavit in reply.
Rejoinder, if any, be filed within two weeks' thereafter.
List all the matters on 213.01.2020".
2.5. Learned State Counsel also relied on the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court on
09.10.2023 in Civil Appeal No.5867 of 2015 (Sheo Raj Singh (Deceased) Through Lrs. & Ors. vs.
Union of India & Anr.) Placing reliance on the decision in Sheo Raj Singh as provided under
Section-5 of the Limitation Act, it is contended that, the term sufficient cause is elastic enough for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192192970/ 4
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
Courts to do substantial justice. Further, when substantial justice and technical considerations are
pitted against one and another, the former would prevail. Since in the present case the Tribunal
allowed the claim of the respondent without following the decision of this Court in the case of
Laxmidhar Pati vs. State of Orissa & Others (1996) (I) OLR- 152 as well as other decisions rendered
by this Court, in view of the ratio decided in the case Sheo Raj Singh and the order passed by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP (Civil) Diary No.33245 of 2018, 38574 of 2015 and // 7 // 11604 of 2020
in condoning the delay, subject to payment of cost of Rs.50,000/- the delay in filing of the present
appeal is required to be condoned as substantial question of law is involved.
2.6. Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-31(b) and 37 of the Judgment in Sheo Raj Singh has held as
follows:-
"31.b. The expression sufficient cause is elastic enough for courts to do substantial
justice. Further, when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted
against one another, the former would prevail".

37. Having bestowed serious consideration to the rival contentions, we feel that the
High Court's decision to condone the delay on account of the first respondent's
inability to present the appeal within time, for the reasons assigned therein, does not
suffer from any error warranting interference. As the aforementioned judgments
have shown, such an exercise of discretion does, at times, call for a illiberal and
justice-oriented approach by the Courts, where certain leeway could be provided to
the State. The hidden forces that are at work in preventing an appeal by the State
being presented within the prescribed period of limitation so as not to allow a higher
court to pronounce upon the legality and validity of an order of a lower court and
thereby secure unholy gains, can hardly be ignored. Impediments in the working of
the grand scheme of governmental functions have to be removed by taking a
pragmatic view on balancing of the competing interests".
3. Mr. M.K. Sahoo, learned counsel appearing for the sole Respondent on the other hand contended
that after filing the appeal, this Court vide order dated 21.10.2019 issued notice of the I.A. on the
question of limitation. But on the face of the order passed by this Court on 21.10.2019 and the
appearance of the sole respondent on 06.04.2023, // 8 // notice was issued for the second time on
11.07.2023 subject to the conditions that the appellants shall deposit a sum of Rs.50,000/- on or
before 24.07.2023. It is contended that on the face of the order passed by this court on 21.10.2019
and the appearance of the Respondent which was already made since 06.04.2023, no fresh notice
was required to be issued by this Court on 11.07.2023 with the condition.
3.1. Be that as it may, learned counsel appearing for the sole Respondent contended that the claim
made by the Respondent was allowed by the Tribunal vide its judgment dated 30.12.2013. Even
though the judgment was duly passed in presence of the learned counsel for the appellants, but a
plea has been taken that after receipt of the order, Govt.-Appellant No.2 vide letter dated 12.04.2019
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192192970/ 5
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
instructed Appellant No.3 to prefer the appeal, which was filed on 17.05.2019.
3.2. It is contended that neither in the Interim Application nor in the memo of appeal, any cause has
been shown with regard to the delay for the period from 30.12.2013 to 12.04.2019 and as to why the
order passed by the Tribunal on 30.12.2013 come to the knowledge of the department on // 9 //
12.04.2019. Not only that no explanation has also been given for the delay from 12.04.2019 to
17.05.2019.
3.3. It is accordingly contended that since the delay for the period from 30.12.2013 to 12.04.2019
and 12.04.2019 to 17.05.2019 has not at all been explained by assigning sufficient cause, the delay in
filing of the appeal is not required to be condoned by this Court as prayed for.
3.4. Learned counsel appearing for the Respondent also contended that the delay in filing the appeal
has not been properly explained by showing sufficient cause and in view of the decision of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Postmaster General & Ors. Vs. Living Media Ltd. & Anr. ((2012) 3
SCC 563) and the decision of this Court in State of Odisha & Ors. Vs. Sales Tax Officer, Cuttack II
(W.P.(C) No. 15763 of 2021), the delay is not required to be condoned.
3.5. Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 27 and 29 of the Judgment in the case of Postmaster General & Ors.
has held as follows:-
"27. It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or conversant
with the issues involved including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up
the matter by way of filing a special leave petition in this Court. They cannot claim
that they have a separate period of // 10 // limitation when the Department was
possessed with competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the absence of
plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be
condoned mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of the Government
is a party before us.
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies
and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation
for the delay and there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual
explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to
considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process. The government
departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties
with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not
be used as an anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters
everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few."
Similarly this Court in the case of State of Odisha & Ors in Para -5 has held as follows:-
"5. The Supreme Court has recently in a series of matters reiterated that the
explanation usually offered by the State and its entities for the delay on account of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192192970/ 6
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
administrative exigencies should not be accepted unless they are shown to be
justified. A sampling of such orders is as under:
(i) Order dated 13th January 2021 in SLP No.17559 of 2020 (State of Gujarat v.
Tushar Jagdish Chandra Vyas & Anr.)
(ii) Order dated 22nd January 2021 in SLP No.11989 of 2020 (The Commissioner of Public
Instruction & Ors. v.
Shamshuddin)
(iii) Order dated 22nd January 2021 in SLP No.25743 of 2020 (State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors v.
Sabha Narain & Ors.) // 11 //
(iv) Order dated 4th February 2021 in SLP No.19846 of 2020 (Union of India v.
Central Tibetan Schools Admin & Ors)
(v) Order dated 11th January 2021 in SLP No.22605 of 2020 (The State of Odisha & Ors v. Sunanda
Mahakuda)"
3.6. Learned counsel appearing for the Respondent also relied on the decision in the
case of State of Uttar Pradesh & Others vs. Sabha Narain & Others reported in (2022)
9 SCC 266 . Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-3 to 5 of the said judgment has held as
follows:-
"3. We have repeatedly discouraged State Governments and public authorities in
adopting an approach that they can walk in to the Supreme Court as and when they
please, ignoring the period of limitation prescribed by the statutes, as if the
Limitation statute does not apply to them. In this behalf, suffice to refer to our
judgments in State of M.P. v. Bherulal [State of M.P. v. Bherulal, (2020) 10 SCC 654 :
(2021) 1 SCC (Cri) 117 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 101 : (2021) 1 SCC (L&S) 84] and State of
Odisha v. Sunanda Mahakuda [State of Odisha v. Sunanda Mahakuda, (2021) 11 SCC
560 : (2022) 1 SCC (Cri) 300 : (2022) 2 SCC (L&S) 393] . The leeway which was given
to the Government/public authorities on account of innate inefficiencies was the
result of certain orders of this Court which came at a time when technology had not
advanced and thus, greater indulgence was shown. This position is no more prevalent
and the current legal position has been elucidated by the judgment of this Court in
Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd. [Postmaster General v. Living Media
India Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 327 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 580 :
(2012) 1 SCC (L&S) 649] Despite this, there seems to be little change in the approach
of the Government and public authorities.

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
4. We have also categorised such kind of cases as "certificate cases" filed with the only object to
obtain a // 12 // quietus from the Supreme Court on the ground that nothing could be done because
the highest Court has dismissed the appeal. The objective is to complete a mere formality and save
the skin of the officers who may be in default in following the due process or may have done it
deliberately. We have deprecated such practice and process and we do so again. We refuse to grant
such certificates and if the Government/public authorities suffer losses, it is time when officers
concerned responsible for the same, bear the consequences. The irony, emphasised by us repeatedly,
is that no action is ever taken against the officers and if the Court pushes it, some mild warning is all
that happens.
5. Looking to the period of delay and the casual manner in which the application has been worded,
we consider appropriate to impose costs on the petitioner(s) of Rs 25,000 for wastage of judicial
time which has its own value and the same be deposited with the Supreme Court
Advocates-on-Record Welfare Fund within four weeks. The amount be recovered from the officers
responsible for the delay in filing the special leave petition and a certificate of recovery of the said
amount be also filed in this Court within the same period of time".
3.7. Learned counsel for the Respondent also relied on another decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of State of Kerala vs. Akshaya Jewellers reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1437. Hon'ble
Apex Court in Para-4 & 5 of the said order has held as follows:-
"4. We have considered the rival contentions of the parties. At the outset, we find that delay of 390
days in filing the Special Leave Petition, now converted into Civil Appeal, has not been explained to
the satisfaction of this Court, inasmuch as there is no narration as to what happened between
18.02.2019, the date on which the impugned order was passed till 25.04.2019. Thereafter the only
explanation given is that the file had got mixed up with some other files and, therefore, ultimately
only on 13.01.2021, the same was noticed and steps were taken to send a letter to the Office of // 13
// the Advocate General of the State of Kerala and a copy to the Special Govt. Pleader (Taxes) and
thereafter, steps were taken to file the appeal on 22.07.2021.
5. We find that the reason cited for the gross delay of 390 days in filing the Special Leave Petition,
now converted into a Civil Appeal, does not pursuade us to condone the delay. The explanation
offered is not satisfactory and not sufficient in the eye of law to condone the delay".
3.8. Learned counsel for the Respondent also relied on the decision reported in (2020) 13 SCC 745,
Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-19 to 24 and 31 has held as follows:-
"19. Though we have exhaustively referred to the pleadings and the contentions of the
parties, including contentions put forth on merits, the same is only for completeness
and to put the matter in perspective before considering the issue relating to delay and
laches. In the instant case, considering that the Division Bench [University of Delhi v.
Union of India, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 12085] of the High Court has dismissed the
LPA on the ground of delay of 916 days, that aspect of the matter would require
consideration at the outset and the facts on merits are noted to the limited extent to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192192970/ 8
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
find out whether in that background the public interest would suffer.
20. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant in order to impress upon this Court
the principle relating to consideration of "sufficient cause" for condonation of delay
and the factors that are required to be kept in view, has relied on the decision in LAO
v. Katiji [LAO v. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107] wherein it is held as hereunder : (SCC pp.
108-09, para 3) "3. The legislature has conferred the power to condone delay by
enacting Section 5 [ Any appeal or any application, other than an application under
any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be
admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the
court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the
application within such period.] // 14 // of the Limitation Act, 1963 in order to
enable the courts to do substantial justice to parties by disposing of matters on
"merits". The expression "sufficient cause"
employed by the legislature is adequately elastic to enable the courts to apply the law in a
meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice--that being the life-purpose for the
existence of the institution of courts. It is common knowledge that this Court has been making a
justifiably liberal approach in matters instituted in this Court. But the message does not appear to
have percolated down to all the other courts in the hierarchy. And such a liberal approach is adopted
on principle as it is realised that:
1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at
the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is
condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits
after hearing the parties.
3. "Every day's delay must be explained" does not mean that a pedantic approach
should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must
be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of
culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit
by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalise
injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is
expected to do so.

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 14 March, 2024
Making a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause for condoning
the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that it was the "State" which was seeking
condonation and not a private party was altogether irrelevant. The doctrine of equality before law
demands that all litigants, including the State as a litigant, are accorded the same treatment and the
law is administered in an even-handed manner. There is no warrant for according a step-motherly
treatment when the "State"
// 15 // is the applicant praying for condonation of delay. In fact experience shows that on account
of an impersonal machinery (no one in charge of the matter is directly hit or hurt by the judgment
sought to be subjected to appeal) and the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the
note-making, file- pushing and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on its part is less difficult to
understand though more difficult to approve. In any event, the State which represents the collective
cause of the community, does not deserve a litigant-nongrata status. The courts therefore have to be
informed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in the course of the interpretation of the
expression "sufficient cause". So also the same approach has to be evidenced in its application to
matters at hand with the end in view to do even-handed justice on merits in preference to the
approach which scuttles a decision on merits. Turning to the facts of the matter giving rise to the
present appeal, we are satisfied that sufficient cause exists for the delay. The order of the High Court
dismissing the appeal before it as time-barred, is therefore, set aside. Delay is condoned. And the
matter is remitted to the High Court. The High Court will now dispose of the appeal on merits after
affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to both the sides."
(emphasis in original)
21. Further the decision in Dehri Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpur [Dehri
Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpur, (1992) 2 SCC 598] is relied upon, wherein
this Court has indicated the real test to determine the delay is that the petitioner should come to
Court before a parallel right is created and that the lapse of time is not attributable to any laches or
negligence.
22. The learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 13, on the other hand, has relied upon the decision
in Postmaster General v. Living Media (India) Ltd. [Postmaster General v. Living Media (India)
Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 327 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 580 : (2012) 1 SCC (L&S) 649]
wherein it is held as hereunder : (SCC p. 574, paras 28-29) "28. Though we are conscious of the fact
that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction
or lack of bona fides, a liberal concession has to be adopted to advance substantial justice, we are of
the view that in the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of various
earlier decisions. The claim // 16 // on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic
methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the modern technologies being
used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody, including the Government.
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and
instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and
there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept

pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process.
The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties
with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an
anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light
and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few."
23. From a consideration of the view taken by this Court through the decisions cited supra the
position is clear that, by and large, a liberal approach is to be taken in the matter of condonation of
delay. The consideration for condonation of delay would not depend on the status of the party,
namely, the Government or the public bodies so as to apply a different yardstick but the ultimate
consideration should be to render even-handed justice to the parties. Even in such case the
condonation of long delay should not be automatic since the accrued right or the adverse
consequence to the opposite party is also to be kept in perspective. In that background while
considering condonation of delay, the routine explanation would not be enough but it should be in
the nature of indicating "sufficient cause" to justify the delay which will depend on the backdrop of
each case and will have to be weighed carefully by the courts based on the fact situation. In Katiji
[LAO v. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107] the entire conspectus relating to condonation of delay has been
kept in focus. However, what cannot also be lost sight of is that the consideration therein was in the
background of dismissal of the application seeking condonation of delay in a case where there was
delay of four days pitted against the consideration that was required to be made on merits regarding
the upward revision of compensation amounting to 800%.
// 17 //
24. As against the same, the delay in the instant facts in filing the LPA is 916 days and as such the
consideration to condone can be made only if there is reasonable explanation and the condonation
cannot be merely because the appellant is public body. The entire explanation noticed above, depicts
the casual approach unmindful of the law of limitation despite being aware of the position of law.
That apart when there is such a long delay and there is no proper explanation, laches would also
come into play while noticing as to the manner in which a party has proceeded before filing an
appeal. In addition in the instant facts not only the delay and laches in filing the appeal is contended
on behalf of the respondents seeking dismissal of the instant appeal but it is also contended that
there was delay and laches in filing the writ petition itself at the first instance from which the
present appeal had arisen. In that view, it would be necessary for us to advert to those aspects of the
matter and notice the nature of consideration made in the writ petition as well as the LPA to arrive
at a conclusion as to whether the High Court was justified.

31. In the matter of condonation of delay and laches, the well-accepted position is also that the
accrued right of the opposite party cannot be lightly dealt with. In that regard, rather than taking
note of the hardship that would be caused to Respondent 13 as contended by the learned Senior
Counsel, what is necessary to be taken note of is the manner in which Respondent 11, DMRC has
proceeded in the matter. Respondent 11, DMRC is engaged in providing the public transport and for

the said purpose the Government through policy decision has granted approval to generate
resources through property development and in that regard the development as earlier indicated, is
taken up. Pursuant thereto Respondent 11 has received a sum of Rs 218.20 crores from Respondent
13 as far back as in the year 2008. The said amount as indicated is used for its projects providing
metro rail service to the commuting public. In such circumstance, if at this stage the inordinate
delay is condoned unmindful of the lackadaisical manner in which the appellant has proceeded in
the matter, it would also be contrary to public interest".
// 18 // 3.9. Similarly reliance was placed in the decision in Civil Appeal No.4440/2008 (Arising out
of SLP (C) No.6111 of 2006, Perumon Bhagvathy Devaswom, Perinadu Village vs. Bhargavi Amma
(Dead) by Lrs. & Ors.
3.10. Placing reliance on the aforesaid decisions, learned counsel appearing for the Respondent
contended that since while filing the appeal with delay of more than 1904 days, no cause lest
sufficient cause has been explained with regard to delay for the period 30.12.2013 to 12.04.2019 and
12.04.2019 to 31.05.2019, the delay in filing of the appeal is not to be condoned.
4. Having heard learned counsel for the Parties and after going through the materials placed before
this Court, this Court finds that the claim raised by the respondent in GIA Case No.576 of 2011 was
allowed by the Tribunal vide its judgment dtd.30.12.2013. The appeal against such an order was
filed before this Court on 17.05.2019. But it is found that no explanation has been given by assigning
any cause lest sufficient cause with regard to the delay staring from 30.12.2013 to 12.04.2019 and
the reason on the part of the Department coming across the judgment only on 12.04.2019. Not only
that no explanation has also been given for the period from 12.04.2019 to 17.05.2019. Since // 19 //
no reason has been assigned by assigning any cause lest sufficient cause with regard to the delay for
the period from 30.12.2013 to 12.04.2019 and 12.04.2019 to 17.05.2019, this Court placing reliance
on the decisions so cited by the learned counsel for the Respondent is not inclined to condone the
delay in filing of the appeal. Accordingly, the I.A stands dismissed. Cost deposited by the State be
refunded on proper identification.

1. Since this Court is not inclined to condone the delay in filing the appeal, the appeal is accordingly
