Law laid down:
1. Under the M.P. Public Health and Family Welfare (Gazetted) Service
Recruitment Rules, 2007, the Medical Officers and Specialists or Dental
Surgeons and Dental Specialists are entitled to get the junior grade scale, senior
grade scale, selection grade scale and senior selection grade scale on
completion of tenure from the date of appointment and getting the higher grade
scale of pay as per the recommendation of the Screening Committee, cannot be
withdrawn. The Circular dated 30.5.2012 being contrary to the spirit of the said
Rules, is quashed. The genesis to grant the benefit of time scale of pay is the
tenure of the service rendered in a particular grade scale and after completion of
the said tenure, they may be entitled to get the benefit of higher grade scale.
2. The effect of substitution of Schedule brought on 15.2.2011 would co-
relate from the date of commencement of the Rules i.e. 4.1.2008.
3. The pecuniary benefit given to the petitioners affects the civil
consequences, it cannot be withdrawn without following the principle of natural
justice.

ORDER
(20/12/2017) All these writ petitions have been filed by the petitioners under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India being aggrieved by the order dated 30.5.2012 passed by respondent No. 1 and
the consequential orders dated 1.6.2012, 25.6.2012 and 23.7.2013 whereby the recovery along with
the interest @ 12% per annum have been ordered and also directed for the adjustment of the arrears
of 6 th Pay Commission from the proposed recovery. The order dated 14.1.2016 issued to explain the
Rules is also under challenge, however, seeking directions to quash those orders, the petitioners who
are Association of Doctors, Medical Officers, Dental Surgeons, Specialists and Dental Specialists in
individual, have come before this Court seeking appropriate reliefs.
2. The petitioners and members of the Association were appointed on the post of Medical Officer in
Public Health and Family Welfare Department; while some of them were appointed as Dental
Surgeons. Some members of Association and some petitioners were promoted as Specialists and
Dental Specialists. Their appointments were made under the M.P. Public Health and Family Welfare
(Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1988 (hereinafter shall be referred as "the old Rules")
prevalent at the time of their appointment or promotion. It is not in dispute that after repeal of the
old Rules, the new Rules known as M.P. Public Health and Family Welfare (Gazetted) Service
Recruitment Rules, 2007 (hereinafter shall be referred as "the new Rules) came into existence
w.e.f.4.1.2008. Rule 4 and Rule 5 of the new Rules deals the Constitution of the Service,
Classification and scale of pay as specified in Clauses 10, 11, 12 and 13 of Schedule I. Learned counsel
representing the petitioners have vehemently argued that on perusal of column 6 of Schedule I, after
completing six years of service in the junior grade scale as per the recommendation of the Screening
Committee, the employee can get senior grade scale, selection grade scale and senior selection grade
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77134275/ 3
Dr. D.K. Pippal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 December, 2017
scale on completion of tenure of six years in each cadre. Under the Rules the cut-off date to grant
grade scale of pay has not been prescribed. The Rules merely specify the tenure of service in each
cadre for granting the benefit of four tier grade scales of pay to the Doctors.
3. It is said, the State Government has itself issued the order dated 26.8.2008 explaining that all the
Medical Officers, Dental Surgeons and officers of Special cadre may be entitled to get four tier grade
scale of pay on completion of the tenure so specified. On issuing the said order the State
Government has issued the clarification vide Annexure P-7 dated 23.5.2009 stating that the real
benefit of four tier grade scale of pay may be allowed w.e.f. 26.8.2008, though notional fixation of
pay may be made from the date of entitlement. In furtherance to it, petitioners were given the
benefit on 7.7.2009 as per the recommendation of the Screening Committee in furtherance to the
orders of the State Government. Surprisingly by the order impugned dated 30.5.2012 without any
reason or rhyme and affording opportunity to the petitioners, the State Government has cancelled
the order dated 23.5.2009. In the order dated 30.5.2012, it is specified that the benefit of four tier
grade scale of pay allowed to the Doctors w.e.f. 26.8.2008 shall remain unchanged but the benefit of
grade scale of pay is withdrawn however the said circular is contrary to the spirit of the new Rules
and in violation of the principle of natural justice, therefore, it may be quashed.
4. It is urged that by the consequential orders dated 1.6.2012 and 25.6.2012 the amount of arrears of
grade scale of pay given to the petitioners have been instructed to adjust in the arrears of 6 th Pay
Commission in place of recovery. It is further urged that the clarification issued by the Government
on 23.7.2013 to the order dated 26.8.2008 is also contrary to the spirit of the new Rules, therefore
the order of recovery with interest passed on 14.1.2016 may also order to be quashed.
5. On the other hand the respondent State has filed their reply in W.P. No. 10047/2013, which is
adopted in all the cases. In the reply it is said that the plea taken by the petitioners is misconceived
and bereft of any substance. They have not disputed the applicability of the new Rules. The State
Government referring unamended new Rules said that the eligibility for the respective grade scales
of pay, as specified shall be subject to the recommendation of the Screening Committee after six
years of service in each cadre to the extent of percentage of posts of the junior grade scale, senior
grade scale and selection grade scale. But the nature of duties and the posts of the Doctors as they
were performing earlier would remain unchanged. It is said that the instructions dated 23.5.2009
were issued for implementation of the scale of pay w.e.f. 26.8.2008 but it was not in confirmity to
the statutory rules and runs contrary. More so, prior to issuing these instructions, sanction from the
Finance Department contemplated under Rule 60 of the M.P. Financial Code Vol-I was not taken. It
is said that looking to the contents of the circular dated 23.5.2009, pay fixation of the petitioners
were made with retrospective date even including the period prior to 26.8.2008, which may cause
financial burden on the State exchequer, however, looking to the Audit Report, the instructions
dated 23.5.2009 were found defective, hence it was withdrawn vide order Annexure P-1 dated
30.5.2012. In consequence to it, fixation done earlier were found defective, however, withdrawing
the benefit given, order of recovery and its adjustment in the amount of arrears of 6th Pay
Commission have rightly been directed. In support of the said contention, reliance is placed on the
judgment of Chandi Pd. Oniyal Vs. State of Uttarakhand reported in (2012) 7 SCC 412, to submit
that any defective order passed by the Government can be withdrawn and it is within their domain,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77134275/ 4
Dr. D.K. Pippal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 December, 2017
therefore, issuance of consequential order would not give any cause to the petitioners to file these
petitions asking the reliefs prayed in these petitions. In view of the said submission, it is said, the
order impugned passed by the State Government may not be interfered with, dismissing all the writ
petitions.
6. After having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the pleadings, it is not in
dispute, the appointments of the petitioners were made under the old Rules applicable at the time of
their appointment or promotion. Now after commencement of the new Rules w.e.f. 4.1.2008, their
service conditions are governed by these Rules. Rule 2(L) of the new rules deals the service, which
means the Madhya Pradesh Public Health and Family Welfare (Gazetted) Service. Rule 4 specifies
the constitution of service, which consists the persons who at the time of commencement of the new
rules were holding, substantively or in the officiating capacity, the posts specified in Schedule I. It is
not in dispute that petitioners who were appointed either as Medical Officers and Dental Surgeon or
the Specialists and Dental Specialists are holding the post specified in Schedule I. Rule 5 deals the
classification of scale of pay of the service, meaning thereby the scale of pay attached thereto and the
number of posts included in services shall be in accordance with the Schedule I. However, it cannot
be doubted that the service conditions with respect to the grade scale of pay of the petitioners would
be governed by Schedule I of the new Rules w.e.f. 4.1.2008. Schedule I of the new Rules has again
been substituted by notification dated 15.2.2011. Prior to the substitution of the Schedule the posts
of Specialists, Dental Specialists, Medical Officers and Dental Surgeons were differently placed in
the context of the percentage of the posts in the cadre and tiers of grade scale of pay. The substituted
and the old Schedule I may have material bearing to adjudicate the issue involved looking to the
averments made in the petition as well as return, however, they are reproduced to the extent of
relevancy of the posts of these cases.

7. On perusal of the old and substituted Schedule I, the benefits of the junior grade scale, senior
grade scale, selection grade scale on the posts namely Specialists, Dental Specialists, Medical
Officers, Dental Surgeon are available to all the 100% posts. Thereafter in the cadre of Specialists
and Dental Specialists, 5% of the total posts in the selection grade scale may get the benefit of senior
selection grade scale; while in the cadre of Medical Officer and Dental Surgeon, only 2% of total
posts may get the benefit of the senior selection grade scale. In addition, by the substituted schedule
I of the new Rules either in the cadre of Medical Officer and Specialist or in the cadre of Dental
Surgeon and Dental Specialist, the benefit of four tier grade scales of pay are made available to the
post holders. Although in the old schedule I of the new rules in the cadre of Dental Surgeon and
Dental Specialist, the benefit of three tier scales were specified, discriminating with the posts of
Medical officers and specialists because they were having benefit of four tier grade scale of pay.
8. By the unamended Schedule of new Rules in the cadre of Medical Officer and Specialists out of
the total posts, 60% posts as specified were available to get the benefit of junior grade scale, 23%
posts for senior grade scale, 15% posts for selection grade scale and 2% posts for senior selection
grade scale; while in the cadre of Dental Specialist and Dental Surgeon, 60%, posts were for junior
grade scale, 25% posts for senior grade scale and 15% posts for selection grade scale. Now by the
substituted Schedule I of the new Rules relaxing the percentage of the posts, the benefit of junior
grade scale, senior grade scale and selection grade scale is made available to 100% posts of the
Doctor posted either in the cadre of Medical Officer and specialists or Dental Surgeon and Dental
Specialists. Only for grant of senior selection grade scale, the ceiling of 5% posts were specified for
the Specialists and Dental Specialists, while 2% posts for the Medical Officer and Dental Surgeons.
Thus, looking to the totality of the aforesaid circumstances, it can safely be observed that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77134275/ 10
Dr. D.K. Pippal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 December, 2017
substituted Schedule I of the new Rules is more rational, equitable and reasonable.
9. It is made clear here that the benefit of four tier grade scale of pay i.e. junior grade scale, senior
grade scale, selection grade scale and senior selection grade scale shall be available on completion of
tenure of service i.e. six years in the each grade scale of pay as per the recommendation of the
Screening Committee to get benefit of the just higher grade scale of pay in ratio to the percentage of
the posts as specified in the substituted Schedule I of new Rules. Thus, in nut shell as per the Rules,
for consideration to extend the benefit of junior grade scale, senior grade scale, selection grade scale
and senior selection grade scale, the tenure of service of six years in individual cadre and the
performance may be assessed by the Screening Committee to make recommendation for grant of
higher grade scale. The said fact also finds support from the language of the circular dated
26.8.2008. Thus, either in the unamended Schedule I or in the substituted Schedule I, the cut-off
date to apply four tier scales of pay have not been specified. In the given facts, if we see Rule 4(1),
which deals with constitution of service and specifies that after commencement of these Rules if a
person is holding the post substantively or in the officiating capacity, the post specified in Schedule
I, shall be included in the connotation "service" under the new Rules. Meaning thereby if a Doctor
appointed under the new Rules or prior to the same after commencement of these Rules, be treated
in the "service" and hold the post as specified in Schedule I. If the tier of pay scale as specified may
be given to the individual cadre of the Specialists, Medical Officers, Dental Specialist and Dental
Surgeon then it may be taken in consideration on completion of the tenure of six years of the service
relates back to their date of appointment and the benefit of particular grade scale of pay would be
available as per the recommendations of the Screening Committee, on completion of the tenure of
service in the respective cadre of grade scale of pay and its real benefit may be given w.e.f.
26.8.2008 as directed by the Government circular.
10. Now the effect of the substituted Schedule I to unamended Schedule I of new Rules, is also
required to be explained. On substitution of Schedule I, it would apply from the date as it exists on
the date of commencement of the new Rules i.e. 4.1.2008. Thus, persons who are holding the post of
Schedule I and comes within the definition of "service" would be benefited as per substituted
Schedule w.e.f. the date of commencement of the new Rules i.e. 4.1.2008 and not from 15.2.2011 i.e.
the date of substitution. The effect of substitution of the Schedule or any provision has been
considered by the Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of Government of India and others Vs.
Indian Tobacco Association reported in (2005) 7 SCC 396 whereby it has been held that in case
substitution is made in the existing statutory provision, it would relate back to the date on which the
law came into existence. However, considering the aforesaid, it can safely be held that the
substituted Schedule brought in the new Rules w.e.f. 15.2.2011 would be given effect w.e.f. 4.1.2008
i.e. the date on which the new Rules came into existence and the percentage of the post to extend the
benefit of grade scale of pay specified in unamended Schedule I of the new Rules would not have any
bearing after the substituted Schedule I.
11. Reverting to the context and looking to the discussion of the Rules as made hereinabove, the
justification to cancel the order dated 23.5.2009 vide order dated 30.5.2012, is required to be seen.
The order dated 23.5.2009 was issued for explaining the order dated 26.8.2008 to say how the
execution in the matter of grant of grade scale of pay may be made to the Medical Officers,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77134275/ 11
Dr. D.K. Pippal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 December, 2017
Specialists, Dental Surgeons and Dental Specialists. It is said that from the date of appointment and
on completion of the tenure of six years, the notional pay fixation in each tier of the grade scale of
pay may be done but actual benefit would accrue w.e.f. 26.8.2008. In case notional period came
with effect from the date of implementation of the instructions i.e. 26.8.2008, the said date would
be relevant for grant of the actual benefit in that particular grade scale of pay. It has also been
clarified that on account of extending the benefit of higher grade scale of pay in any of the particular
tier of the grade of scale of pay, the duties and posts of the employees would not change and they
will continue to perform their duties as they were performing earlier. As per the said instructions the
benefit was extended vide order dated 7.7.2009 to all the petitioners. But after about 2 years and 10
months vide order Annexure P-1 dated 30.5.2012, the order dated 23.5.2009 was cancelled and the
benefits given to the petitioners have been withdrawn. On perusal of the order impugned dated
30.5.2012 the reason of cancellation of the order has not been mentioned, however, it is an
unreasoned order.
12. If we examine the justification of the order in the context of stand taken by the
respondents/State, then as per new Rules the benefit of four tier scale of pay is available to the
Specialists and the Medical Officers or Dental Specialists and Dental Surgeons on having their
eligibility as specified in Column No. 6 of said Schedule I. However, the benefit available either in
the cadre of the Specialists, Medical Officers, Dental Surgeons or Dental Specialists in all four tier of
the grade scales of pay on completion of six years service in individual cadre as per recommendation
of the Screening Committee and for the next higher scale following the similar procedure. However,
on substitution of Schedule I of the new Rules, all the Post holders who are in the junior grade scale
would be entitled to get senior grade scale, selection grade scale and senior selection grade scale on
completion of the tenure of six years of service as per recommendation of the Screening Committee.
But to extend the benefit of senior selection grade scale, out of total posts 5% and 2% respectively
would be filled up from the cadre of selection grade scale. Therefore, in the context of the Rules,
contents of the circular dated 23.5.2009 may be incorrect but after substitution of Schedule I in the
new Rules, it would not make any change as discussed above and the benefit would be available to
the Doctors irrespective to the percentage of their post from the date of their initial appointment
and on completion of their tenure of six years, based on the recommendation of the Screening
Committee. Therefore, cancellation of the earlier circular dated 23.5.2009 vide unreasoned order
dated 30.5.2012 is arbitrary, unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of the new Rules. In view of the
above discussion, the order impugned dated 30.5.2012 is held as contrary to the new Rules,
therefore, the judgment of Chandi Pd. Oniyal Vs. State of Uttarakhand (supra) relied by the
respondents is of no help to them.
13. Simultaneously prior to passing the said circular neither any show cause notice nor an
opportunity of hearing were afforded to any of the beneficiary. Considering the aforesaid, it can
safely be observed that if the employees have been given the benefit of grade scale of pay, and any
adverse order is passed withdrawing the said benefit, it may have civil consequences, which cannot
be passed in non-observance of the principle of natural justice. In this regard guidance can be taken
from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Gajanan L. Parnekar Vs. State of Goa and
another reported in 1999 (8) SCC 378. In the said judgment the Apex Court has observed as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77134275/ 12
Dr. D.K. Pippal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 December, 2017
"8. The manner in which the order dated 21.1.1999/22- 1-1999 came to be made was,
to say the least, not proper. The appellant was denuded of the benefits of the order
dated 16-2-1994 unheard. There has been a breach of the principle of natural justice
and a violation of fair play in action. The earlier order made in favour of the appellant
as early as on 16-2-1994 was rescinded without giving any opportunity to the
appellant to show cause against it. Absorption of the appellant as Headmaster of
Government High School by the order dated 16-2-1994 had not been put in issue
through any proceedings by any party at any point of time. That benefit could not
have been taken away from the appellant without affording him any opportunity of
hearing, even where the absorption as Headmaster of the High School had been put
in issue. The Principles of natural justice have been respected in their breach."
Thus, on this count also the order impugned Annexure P-1 dated 30.5.2012 cannot be allowed to
stand.
14. As per the discussion made hereinabove the order impugned/circular dated 30.5.2012 is hereby
quashed. On account of quashing the said circular, the consequential orders dated 1.6.2012 and
25.6.2012 directing recovery and the adjustment of the amount of grade scale of pay with the arrears
of 6 th Pay Commission also stand quashed. The State Government by issuing notifications dated
23.7.2013 and order dated 14.1.2016 made an attempt to clarify the Rules inter alia explaining the
applicability of the benefit of four tier scale of pay but as discussed above the Rules are self
explanatory and as per the discussion made hereinabove the benefit shall be given as per circular of
the Government dated 26.8.2008 applying the substituted Schedule I of the new Rules. Therefore,
the clarification issued by the Government and the direction of recovery with interest is contrary to
the spirit of the Rules.
15. In view of the foregoing discussion, all these petitions succeed and are hereby allowed. Orders
dated 30.5.2012, 1.6.2012, 25.6.2012, 23.7.2013 and 14.1.2016 are hereby quashed. It is hereby
directed that the benefit of four tier grade scale of pay would be available to the Specialists, the
Medical Officers, the Dental Specialists and the Dental Surgeons as per substituted Schedule I of the
new Rules on completion of six years of their service in the respective grade scale of pay from the
date of their initial appointment on recommendation of the Screening Committee. On account of
quashing the orders dated 30.5.2012 and consequential orders dated 1.6.2012, 25.6.2012, 23.7.2013
and 14.1.2016 of recovery and adjustment of the amount of the grade scale of pay with the arrears of
6th Pay Commission are also quashed,
16. Consequent upon quashing the aforesaid orders, it is hereby directed that the Government shall
extend the benefit of respective grade scale of pay to the petitioners as per their entitlement and
shall finalize the same as per the substituted Schedule I of the new Rules in view of the discussion
made hereinabove. The said exercise must be completed within a period of four months reviving the
order dated 7.7.2009. Accordingly the arrears of the grade scale of pay be paid to them within a
period of two months and shall not be adjusted in the arrears of 6th Pay Commission. In case the
recovery is already made, it be reimbursed. Let this entire exercise be complete within six months
from today otherwise the petitioners would be entitled to claim interest on the amount of arrears as

per the prevalent Bank rate. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the parties are directed to
bear their own costs.
Let a photocopy of this order be placed in the record of each petition for its record.
