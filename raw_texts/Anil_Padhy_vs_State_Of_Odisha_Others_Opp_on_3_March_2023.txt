S.K. Mishra, J. The Petitioner has preferred the Writ Petition
seeking for a direction to the Opposite Parties to appoint him
in any Group-C post in terms of the Orissa Civil Service
(Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990, shortly, 1990 Rules,
keeping in view the distress condition of his family and
approval of his application for appointment under the 1990
Rules by the Excise Commissioner, Odisha (Opposite Party
No.3).

2. The factual matrix of the case, at hand, is that
Petitioner is the son of Late Surendra Kumar Padhy, who was
working as Assistant Sub-Inspector, Excise under
Superintendent of Excise, Puri and expired on 02.08.2011
while in service. At the time of his death, the father of the
Petitioner left behind his ailing widow, two sons and two
daughters including the Petitioner. Though the elder sister of
the Petitioner got married however, the Petitioner, his brother
and younger sister are yet to marry. The father of the
Petitioner was the sole bread earner of the family and after his
death; the family of the Petitioner is in deep distress due to
untimely death of the sole bread earner of the family. As the
mother of the Petitioner and his brother were not in a position
to work because of ailments and the elder sister then was
about to marry, as per the decision of the family members,
the Petitioner submitted the application for appointment
under the Rehabilitation Assistance Rules, 1990 on
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 2 of 24
27.09.2011 along with necessary documents for his
appointment under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme.
The other family members submitted their no objection in the
said regard supported with affidavits. The Petitioner also
furnished an undertaking to take care the family members.
3. After scrutiny of the documents submitted by the
Petitioner, the matter was referred to the Collector, Ganjam to
issue Distress Certificate, as required. Thereafter, the matter
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 2
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
was transmitted to the Excise Commissioner for appropriate
action at his end. The mother of the Petitioner is suffering
from different diseases including brain stem hemorrhage. To
ascertain the truth regarding her ailment, the authority asked
her twice to appear before the Medical Board. Accordingly,
she was also produced before the Board and both the Medical
Boards declared the mother of the Petitioner to be unfit for
any government job because of her serious ailment. Other
than the pension, the family has no other source of income.
Therefore, the Petitioner approached different offices
regarding his appointment under the 1990 Rules. As he was
not eligible for appointment in the post of Excise Constable,
the authorities promised him to appoint in a Group-C post.
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 3 of 24
Accordingly, the application of the Petitioner was approved
and he was informed vide letter dated 26.06.2013 that he is
to be given posting in the post of Junior Clerk in Excise
Department under Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme.
4. After the said decision was taken to give
appointment to the Petitioner, without providing him
employment, once again he was asked to submit another
application for appointment under the Rehabilitation
Assistance Rules which was also duly complied by the
Petitioner. Being satisfied with the distress condition of the
family of the Petitioner and verifying other documents, the
Excise Commissioner being the appointing authority,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 3
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
approved the prayer of the Petitioner for his appointment
under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme. The further case
of the Petitioner is that, as per the Annual Establishment
Review of Finance Department as on 31.03.2017, there were
5,83,021 sanctioned posts under the State Government out of
which 1,31,518 posts were laying vacant. From the said
report it is made clear that at the relevant point of time, in the
Excise Department, there were 2,119 sanctioned posts out of
which 1,843 were Group-C and 31 were Group-D posts. From
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 4 of 24
amongst the sanctioned posts in Excise Department, 446
posts were laying vacant as on 31.03.2017, out of which 373
were Group-C and 6 were Group-D posts. The said
information regarding vacancy was gathered by the Petitioner
being provided in the Odisha Legislative Assembly on
11.09.2017 in response to one un-starred question bearing
No.422. The case of the Petitioner is that in one hand, good
number of posts are laying vacant and in the other hand, the
family of Petitioner are passing their days in deep distress due
to delay in providing appointment under the Rehabilitation
Assistance Scheme, as for treatment of his deceased father,
who was suffering from different serious ailments and for
solemnizing the marriage of his elder sister, the family is in
deep debt and has incurred huge loan. That apart, for
survival of widow mother, major portion of the family pension
amount is being spent for her treatment which is well known
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 4
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
to the Opposite Parties.
5. It is further stand of the Petitioner that he is very
much covered within the ambit of Rule-2(b) of Orissa Civil
Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 read with
Rule-3 and being the son of the deceased employee, his case
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 5 of 24
deserves to be considered favourably as the family is in deep
distress as certified by the concerned district Collector. The
rehabilitation assistance is conceived as a compassionate
measure to save the family of the Government servant from
immediate distress when the Government servant suddenly
dies while in service. But unfortunately, despite availability of
vacant posts under the Opposite Parties, the matter is
unnecessarily lingering.
6. It has also been averred that in the meantime, as
per the kind direction of this Court, so also Administrative
Tribunal, several similarly situated applicants have been
appointed under Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme in
different posts. To demonstrate the same, some of the
Judgments have been appended to the Writ Petition as
Annexures-7 Series. It has further been averred that father of
the Petitioner died while in service in the year 2011 and the
Petitioner submitted the application for appointment under
the Orissa Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules,
1990 within the time limit and from the communication as at
Annexure-6, it is clear that in the year 2013 the competent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 5
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
authority processed and approved the application of the
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 6 of 24
Petitioner for appointment in the post of Junior Clerk in terms
of 1990 Rules and much after that the said Rule was
amended in the year 2016. As per the settled position of law,
the Petitioner is covered under the pre-amended rule as his
father died prior to such amendment and his application for
appointment under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme was
also processed and approved in the year 2013 i.e. prior to
such amendment.
7. Being noticed, the contesting Opposite Party No.3
has filed Counter Affidavit on 17.02.2020 admitting most of
the averments made in the Writ Petition. However, with regard
to the vacancy position of Junior Clerk in Excise Department,
it has been pleaded that it is learnt from letter dated
31.08.2019 of the Establishment Officer of Excise Directorate
that, there were 11 posts of Junior Clerks vacant by the end
of August, 2019. It is further averred in the Counter Affidavit
that as per the report of the Excise Directorate, out of 21
applicants seeking appointment under Rehabilitation
Assistance Scheme, the serial number of the Petitioner (in
order of date of death of Government Employees) appears at
Sl. No.12 in the eligible list of applicants. Though 11 posts of
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 7 of 24
Junior Clerks were reportedly vacant by the end of August,
2019 as per GAD-SC-Rules Notification No.23345/Gen dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 6
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
05.11.2016, a maximum number of 10% of the existing
vacancy in a year shall be earmarked to be filled up by
applicants under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme.
Accordingly, out of existing vacancies of 11 posts of Junior
Clerks, one post of Junior Clerk was to be filled up from
amongst the applications seeking appointment under the
Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme and serial number of the
Petitioner being 12 in the list, his case shall be considered in
due course. It has also been averred in the Counter Affidavit
that though the application of the Petitioner for appointment
under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme has already been
approved by the Excise Commissioner, the appointment
under rehabilitation assistance to different posts basically
depends on arising of vacancy and the relevant law governing
the policy of the Government on rehabilitation assistance.
Basing on the said G.A. Notification, it has been made clear
by the Excise Directorate that, out of the existing vacancies of
11 posts of Junior Clerks, only one post of Junior Clerk i.e.
10% of the available vacancy is to be considered on
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 8 of 24
compassionate ground and since the name of the Petitioner
finds place at Sl. No.12 in the list of eligible applicant, his
case has not yet been considered as the appointment under
the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme is governed by Odisha
Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Amendment Rules,
2016, and the appointment of the Petitioner virtually depends
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 7
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
on the vacancy as has been decided in HAL Vs. Radhika
Thirumalai, reported in JT 1996(9) SC 197 and HRTC Vs.
Dinesh Kumar, reported in JT 1996 (5) SC 319.
8. It has also been averred in the Counter Affidavit
that the prayer of the Petitioner to consider his case in
accordance with the pre-amended Rules, 1990, as his father
died prior to amendment of the said Rules, 1990, does not
hold good on the pretext of reasonable delay. In keeping with
the availability of vacancy and the list of eligible applicants in
fray i.e. in order of date of death of the deceased employee,
the claim made by the applicant may have serious legal
implications. However, since the appointment under the
Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme chiefly depends on the
contemporaneous arising of vacancy and serial number of the
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 9 of 24
Petitioner in the list of applicants, the Petitioner shall get his
benefit as per his turn at the appropriate time.
9. In response to the Counter Affidavit by the
contesting Opposite Party No.3, the Petitioner has filed
Rejoinder Affidavit on 4th July, 2022. Apart from reiterating
the facts pleaded in the Writ Petition, it has been pleaded that
in view of the Judgments of the apex Court as well as this
Court the issue as to whether the amended or the new Rule
for appointment under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme
in the State of Odisha is to be applied retrospectively or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 8
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
prospectively has been decided in several cases and in the
case of Malaya Nanda Sethy Vs. State of Odisha and Others
in Civil Appeal No.4103 of 2022 decided on 20.05.2022, the
apex Court held that there was no fault and/or delay and/or
negligence on the part of the appellant and he was fulfilling all
the conditions for appointment on compassionate ground
under the 1990 Rules and for no reasons, his application was
kept pending and/or no order was passed on one ground or
the other. Therefore, when there was no fault and/or delay on
the part of the appellant and all through there was delay on
the part of the department/authorities, the appellant should
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 10 of 24
not be made to suffer. It has further been stated in the
Rejoinder Affidavit that pursuant to the direction by the apex
Court in Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), in compliance of the
said Judgment, the Excise Department of Government
Odisha, vide Order dated 13.06.2022, instructed the
authority concerned to give appointment to Malaya Nanda
Sethy in the post of Junior Clerk within the time frame as
stipulated by the apex Court, if he is otherwise found eligible.
It is further stated in the Rejoinder Affidavit that
the father of the Malaya Nanda Sethy and the present
Petitioner, while continuing in service under Excise
Department, died in the year 2010 & 2011 respectively. As
the Petitioner is similarly situated, he deserves issuance of
necessary direction to the State Government to take
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 9
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
necessary steps to appoint him in Group-C post and treat him
at par with Malaya Nanda Sethy as his application for
appointment under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme has
been approved by the Excise Commissioner way back in the
year 2013 and he was assured that he will be appointed in
the post of Junior Clerk as soon as vacancy arises in any part
of the State.
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 11 of 24
10. To substantiate his stands taken in the Writ
Petition, so also Rejoinder Affidavit, learned Counsel for the
Petitioner relied on the Judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of Malaya Nanda Sethy Vs. State of Odisha and Others
passed in Civil Appeal No.4103 of 2022 (Arising out of S.L.P.
(Civil) No.936 of 2022) and State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.
Ashish Awasthi in Civil Appeal No.6902 of 2021 decided on
18.11.2021. Order dated 05.11.2021 of this Court passed in
W.P.(C) No.13459 of 2021 directing for compassionate
appointment, which was confirmed in S.L.P(Civil) No.13459 of
2021 dismissed on 06.09.2021 being preferred against the
said Order by the State Government. Learned Counsel for the
Petitioner submitted that the Order passed by this Court
being confirmed by the apex Court, Sri Subash Chandra
Khatua has been appointed vide Order dated 21.05.2022
issued by the Chief Engineer & Basin Manager, Brahmani
Basin, Samal Barrage Township and in similar cases, relying
upon the Judgments of the apex Court, this Court disposed of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 10
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
umpteen number of Writ Petitions directing to provide the
Petitioners with compassionate appointment in accordance
with the Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance)
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 12 of 24
Rules, 1990. He drew attention of the Court towards two
recent Judgments of this Court annexed to the Rejoinder
Affidavit as Annexure-13 to further substantiate the claim of
the Petitioner.
11. Mr. Samal, learned Counsel for the contesting
Opposite Party No.3 submitted that in view of the divergent
views of the different Benches of the apex Court, the apex
Court in the case of State Bank of India & others Vs. Sheo
Shankar Tewari, reported in (2019) 5 SCC 600 has referred
the matter to the larger Bench.
12. Admittedly, the father of the present Petitioner so
also father of Malaya Nanda Sethy were working under the
Excise Department. The father of Malaya Nanda Sethy died in
the year 2010 (02.01.2010), whereas the father of present
Petitioner died in the year 2011 (02.08.2011). Further, the
approval for appointment under the 1990 Rules dated
26.06.2013, is much prior to coming into force of the Orissa
Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Amendment Rules,
2016, and was duly communicated to the Petitioner. The said
communication dated 26.06.2013 clearly indicates that his
application was approved for appointing him under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 11
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 13 of 24
Rehabilitation Assistance Rules, 1990 in the post of Junior
Clerk in the Excise Department giving him an assurance that
he will be given appointment as soon as vacancy arises in that
category i.e. Junior Clerk, in any part of the State.
Admittedly, after communication dated 26.06.2013, no
further communication has been made to the Petitioner till
date to the effect that till coming into force the Amended
Rules, 2016 there was/were no vacancy(s) and since vacancy
arose after coming into force the Amended Rules, 2016, his
case will be considered as per the said Rules as has been
stated for the first time in the Counter Affidavit. It is
worthwhile to mention here that in the case of Malaya Nanda
Sethy (supra), the apex Court held as follows.
"7. Thus, from the aforesaid, it can be seen that
there was no fault and/or delay and/or negligence
on the part of the appellant at all. He was fulfilling
all the conditions for appointment on compassionate
grounds under the 1990 Rules. For no reason, his
application was kept pending and/or no order was
passed on one ground or the other. Therefore, when
there was no fault and/or delay on the part of the
appellant and all throughout there was a delay on
the part of the department/authorities, the appellant
should not be made to suffer. Not appointing the
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 14 of 24
appellant under the 1990 Rules would be giving
a premium to the delay and/or inaction on the
part of the department/authorities. There was
an absolute callousness on the part of the
department/authorities. The facts are
conspicuous and manifest the grave delay in
entertaining the application submitted by the
appellant in seeking employment which is
indisputably attributable to the
department/authorities. In fact, the appellant has
been deprived of seeking compassionate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 12
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
appointment, which he was otherwise entitled to
under the 1990 Rules. The appellant has become
a victim of the delay and/or inaction on the
part of the department/authorities which may
be deliberate or for reasons best known to the
authorities concerned. Therefore, in the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the case, keeping the
larger question open and aside, as observed
hereinabove, we are of the opinion that the appellant
herein shall not be denied appointment under the
1990 Rules."
(emphasis supplied)
That apart, the apex Court vide paragraph-9 of the said
Judgment was being constrained to observe further as
follows:
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 15 of 24
"9. Before parting with the present order, we are
constrained to observe that considering the object
and purpose of appointment on compassionate
grounds, i.e., a family of a deceased employee
may be placed in a position of financial
hardship upon the untimely death of the
employee while in service and the basis or
policy is immediacy in rendering of financial
assistance to the family of the deceased
consequent upon his untimely death, the
authorities must consider and decide such
applications for appointment on compassionate
grounds as per the policy prevalent, at the
earliest, but not beyond a period of six months
from the date of submission of such completed
applications.
We are constrained to direct as above as we
have found that in several cases, applications for
appointment on compassionate grounds are not
attended in time and are kept pending for years
together. As a result, the applicants in several
cases have to approach the concerned High
Courts seeking a writ of Mandamus for the
consideration of their applications. Even after
such a direction is issued, frivolous or
vexatious reasons are given for rejecting the
applications. Once again, the applicants have to
challenge the order of rejection before the High Court
which leads to pendency of litigation and passage of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 13
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 16 of 24
time, leaving the family of the employee who died in
harness in the lurch and in financial difficulty.
Further, for reasons best known to the authorities
and on irrelevant considerations, applications made
for compassionate appointment are rejected. After
several years or are not considered at all as in the
instant case.
If the object and purpose of appointment on
compassionate grounds as envisaged under the
relevant policies or the rules have to be
achieved then it is just and necessary that such
applications are considered well in time and
not in a tardy way. We have come across cases
where for nearly two decades the controversy
regarding the application made for compassionate
appointment is not resolved. This consequently leads
to the frustration of the very policy of granting
compassionate appointment on the death of the
employee while in service. We have, therefore,
directed that such applications must be
considered at an earliest point of time. The
consideration must be fair, reasonable and
based on relevant consideration. The
application cannot be rejected on the basis of
frivolous and for reasons extraneous to the
facts of the case. Then and then only the object
and purpose of appointment on compassionate
grounds can be achieved."

W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 17 of 24
13. Mr. Samal, learned Counsel for the contesting
Opposite Party No.3, relying on the Judgment of the apex
Court in the case of Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), so also in
the case of N.C. Santosh Vs. State of Karnataka & others,
reported in (2020) 5 SCC 617 submitted that since the case of
the Petitioner is under consideration for appointment under
the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme, as per the said
decision of the apex Court, the case of the Petitioner is to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 14
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
considered in terms of the amended Rules, 2020 as in the
meantime, the said Rule, 2016 for appointment under
Rehabilitation Assistance has further been amended.
14. Admittedly, the application of the Petitioner, on
completion of all the formalities being processed, attained
finality on communication being made to him on 26.06.2013,
vide which the Petitioner was informed that his application is
"approved" for the post of Junior Clerk in the Excise
Department under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme and
he will be given the said post as soon as vacancy arises in
that category i.e. Junior Clerk, in any part of the State. It is
not specific case of the contesting Opposite Party No.3 that
after the said communication was made to the Petitioner till
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 18 of 24
the amended Rules, 2016 came into force, there was no
vacancy for which his case could not be considered before the
said amended rules, 2016 came into force. Rather, without
assigning any cogent reason, simply it has been stated in the
Counter Affidavit that appointment of the Petitioner is
governed under the OCS Amendment Rules, 2016, vide
which, it was stipulated that only 10% of the available
vacancy is to be considered for appointment on
compassionate ground though prior to amended rules, 2016,
there was no such provision/stipulation under 1990 Rules.
Even if the said 1990 Rules was superseded by Orissa Civil
Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Amendment Rules, 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 15
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
well before the said amendment the case of the petitioner was
considered and he was communicated on 26.06.2013 as to
his appointment under the Rehabilitation Assistance Rules,
1990. Contents of the said communication dated 26.06.2013
is extracted below:
"To

With reference to your representation

Junior Clerk in Excise Department under

will be given posting as soon as vacancy
arises in that category i.e. Junior Clerk in

(emphasis supplied)
15. Further, the case of the Petitioner is in a far better
footing than the case of Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra). Though
Malaya Nanda applied in the month of July, 2010, after the
death of his father on 02.01.2010 for appointment on
compassionate ground as Junior Clerk under 1990 Rules and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 16
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
the same was forwarded to the appropriate authority in the
year 2011, but it was kept pending consideration initially for
a period of five years and, thereafter, the Additional Secretary,
vide communication dated 09.09.2016, asked the Collector,
Ganjam to furnish fresh report regarding the financial
condition of the family of the deceased government servant i.e.
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 20 of 24
the father of Malaya Nanda Sethy. Simultaneously, a report
was called for from the CDMO, Ganjam to place the mother of
Malaya Nanda Sethy before the Medical Board for proper
examination, to ascertain whether her inability to perform
government job continues. The Medical Board examined the
mother of Malaya Nanda and furnished a report on
01.11.2016 stating that she was unfit for a government job
and to the said effect, the CDMO, Cuttack also furnished
another report dated 06.02.2017. Thereafter, a report from
Tahasildar, Bellaguntha, which was the native place of
Malaya Nanda, was also called for to ascertain the financial
condition of the family of the deceased. The Tahasildar,
Bellaguntha submitted his report vide communication dated
28.10.2017 indicating therein that family income of the
Malaya Nanda from all sources does not exceed ceiling of
Rs.72,000/- per annum. Despite the said communication and
though Malaya Nanda fulfilled all the eligibility criteria and
condition for appointment on compassionate ground, he was
not appointed as Junior Clerk as per 1990 Rules and in the
meantime, 1990 Rules came to be replaced and 2020 Rules
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25776522/ 17
Anil Padhy vs State Of Odisha & Others ....... Opp. ... on 3 March, 2023
came into force and the application of Malaya Nanda was
W.P.(C) No.25636 of 2019 Page 21 of 24
being sent to the Collector for taking necessary action under
the 2020 Rules by the Office of the Excise Commissioner,
Odisha vide communication dated 26.04.2021. Being
aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said communication dated
26.04.2021, by which the case of Malaya Nanda was directed
to be consider under the 2020 Rules, he preferred Writ
Petition before this Court and vide Order dated 26.10.2021,
W.P.(C) No.28023 of 2021 was dismissed, which was
ultimately set aside by the apex Court in Civil Appeal No.4103
of 2022 at the instance of Malaya Nanda Sethy.
16. Admittedly, the application of the Petitioner for
appointment in terms of 1990 Rules was promptly processed
and a communication was also made to the said effect on
