referred to serve and support a case for seeking preventive detention Page |3 of the petitioner

Kashmir.
7. In addition to the aforesaid two FIRs, the petitioner's booking for proceeding under sections

petitioner good enough to book him for preventive detention.

Muneeb Ahmad Thoker vs Union Territory Of J&K Through ... on 25 March, 2025
17. The preventive detention case of the petitioner was submitted to the Advisory Board under the
Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978, which vide its report No. Home/PB-V/222/2024 dated
15.05.2024 came to opine that there is sufficient cause for detention of the petitioner. In addition,
the Advisory Board also came to opine that there was no merit in the representation of the petitioner
and, as such, warranted rejection.
18. Pursuant to the Advisory Board's opinion upholding sufficiency of cause for preventive detention
of the petitioner, the Home Department, Government of UT of Page |8 J&K vide Government Order
No. Home/PB-V/1092 of 2024 dated 24.05.2024 came to confirm the preventive detention order
No. 14/DMK/PSA/2024 dated 16.04.2024 of the District Magistrate, Kulgam and subjected the
petitioner to suffer six months of preventive detention period at first instance from 18.04.2024 to
17.10.2024 to continue to stay in custody in the Central Jail, Srinagar.
19. It is in this backdrop that the institution of the present writ petition on 17th of May, 2024 came
to take place.
20. In the writ petition, the petitioner has assailed his preventive detention on the grounds as set out
in paragraph No.7.
21. The petitioner assails his preventive detention being co-related with stale incidents related to
FIRs No. 44/2019 and 69/2019.
22. The petitioner has assailed his preventive detention saying that the exercise of power at the end
of the Superintendent of Police, Kulgam followed by District Magistrate, Kulgam being malafide in
law.
23. The purported grounds of detention as formulated by the District Magistrate are assailed to be
fake, irrelevant and non-existent.
Page |9
24. The petitioner, in order to lend support to his plea for quashment of preventive detention, refers
to judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the cases of Dr. Ram Krishan Bhardwaj v.
The State of Delhi & Ors. [1953 SCR 708], Shalini Soni & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. [(1980) 4 SCC
544], Icchu Devi Choraria v. Union of India & Ors. [(1980) 4 SCC 531], Sophia Ghulam Mohammad
Bham v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. [AIR 1999 SC 3051], Thahira Haris v. Government of
Karnataka & Ors. [AIR 2009 SC 2184], Prakash Chandra Mehta v. Commissioner & Secretary,
Government of Kerala & Ors. [AIR 1986 SC 687], Kamleshwar Ishwar Prasad Patel v. Union of India
& Ors. [(1995) 2 SCC 51] and Rattan Singh v. State of Punjab & Ors. [(1981) 4 SCC 481].
25. The petitioner has further thrown a vehement challenge to his preventive detention by terming
the exercise of jurisdiction on the part of the respondent No.2- District Magistrate, Kulgam based
upon fractured facticity in the sense that the fact of the petitioner being granted bail was shared
between the Superintendent of Police, Kulgam and the respondent No.2-District Magistrate,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109001581/ 4
Muneeb Ahmad Thoker vs Union Territory Of J&K Through ... on 25 March, 2025
Kulgam in a suppressed manner without actually sharing P a g e | 10 the orders of bail granted in
favour of the petitioner to let the facts and circumstances leading to the grant of bail in favour of the
petitioner to be known to the respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam.
26. Upon nearing of expiry of first six months detention period, the preventive detention custody of
the petitioner was further extended vide Government Order No. Home/PB-V/1962 of 2024 dated
10.10.2024 passed by Home Department, Government of UT of J&K thereby extending the
petitioner's custody from 18.10.2024 till 17.04.2025, which period is still in currency.
27. The counter affidavit to this writ petition came to be filed on 4th of September, 2024.
28. In his counter affidavit, the respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam came forward with
submissions to justify the preventive detention of the petitioner on account of the so reckoned
objectionable antecedents of the petitioner which rendered him vulnerable to suffer loss of his
personal liberty in order to secure the security of the State.
29. In his counter affidavit, the respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam has nowhere adverted
himself with P a g e | 11 respect to the fate of the representation of the petitioner made against his
preventive detention.
30. A singular fact which vitiates the preventive detention of the petitioner to the point of rendering
it illegal is the fact that at the time of filing of counter affidavit on 4th of September, 2024, the
respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam had come to be apprised by letter No.
Home/PB-V/222/2024 (7456587) dated 2nd of September, 2024 from the end of the Home
Department, Government of Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir to the effect that representation
dated 29th of April, 2024 made by the petitioner against his preventive detention is found without
merit. In fact, on an earlier occasion also, the Home Department, Government of Union Territory of
Jammu & Kashmir vide letter No. Home/PB-V/222/2024 (7456587) dated 24th of May, 2024
addressed to respondent No.2- District Magistrate, Kulgam apprised him about the rejection of the
petitioner's representation against the preventive detention being found without any merit.
31. It is from the perusal of the detention record that the aforesaid aspect related to rejection of the
representation of the petitioner came to be revealed.
P a g e | 12
32. This Court cannot countenance the fact that the respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam
was not aware of the fact of rejection of the representation of the petitioner against his preventive
detention when on two occasions a correspondence to the said effect came to be addressed to his
office from the Home Department, Government of Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.
33. In paragraph No. 7 (4), the petitioner has very categorically registered his objection that
representation filed by him has not yielded any positive result as the same has not been considered
at the end of the respondents. Obviously, the petitioner was right in saying that his representation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109001581/ 5
Muneeb Ahmad Thoker vs Union Territory Of J&K Through ... on 25 March, 2025
was not considered by the respondents when he was not apprised about the fate of his said
representation. The fact that the representation of the petitioner had been rejected by the Home
Department, Government of Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir was well known to the
respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam, but for reasons best known to him he failed to pass
the rejection orders/ communications from the end of the Home Department to the petitioner
leaving him with sense of his constitutional right of representation against P a g e | 13 a preventive
detention only a matter of lip service for no end effect.
34. In addition, in the dossier as well as in the grounds of detention, except for reference of the
petitioner's antecedents in the context of aforesaid two FIRs, there was nothing of factual nature
post FIR No. 69/2019 upto the framing of dossier against the petitioner to show as to which alleged
current activities of the petitioner were serious enough to warrant his preventive detention.
35. Thus, just on a hallowed perception, the Superintendent of Police, Kulgam and the respondent
No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam ventured to use the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978
against the petitioner to subject him to preventive detention thereby rendering exercise of
jurisdiction at their end to be malice in law.
36. In the facts and circumstances aforesaid, the preventive detention of the petitioner is held to be
illegal. Accordingly, the preventive detention order No. 14/DMK/PSA/2024 dated 16th of April,
2024 passed by the respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Kulgam read with Government Order No.
Home/PB-V/1092 of 2024 dated P a g e | 14 24th of May, 2024 read with subsequent extension
order passed by the Home Department, Government of Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir with
respect to the preventive detention of the petitioner are also held to be illegal and the same, as such,
are quashed. The petitioner is held entitled to restoration of his personal liberty forthwith. The
petitioner is, thus, directed to be released from the confinement of concerned Jail and for the said
purpose, the Superintendent, of Police concerned jail to carry out the compliance of the writ of
habeas corpus hereby issued by this Court and release the petitioner.
37. Disposed of.
38. Detention record be returned.
