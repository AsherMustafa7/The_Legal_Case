Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
2. This appeal under Section 100 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (in short the "C.P.C.) is against the concurrent finding
Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
2/28
of fact recorded by the learned courts below in a suit for specific
performance of contract to execute and register sale deed in
respect of immovable property.
3. On 26.11.1987, this Court admitted the appeal for
hearing on following substantial questions of law:-
(i) Whether due to absence of plea of
willingness in the plaint as well as
evidence of plaintiff, the suit is bound to
fail?
(ii) Whether the judgments of the Courts
below are vitiated in law due to lack of
recording a finding on the point of
readiness and willingness of the plaintiff
to perform his part of the contract?
(iii) Whether the judgment of the lower
appellate court is vitiated in law due to
absolute non-consideration of the oral
evidence of the defendants-appellants,
who are twelve in number and those
evidences are vital for reaching at a
correct conclusion?
During hearing of this appeal, one more question was raised.

(iv) Whether the courts below were
consistent with the law that principle of
lis pendens would apply against the claim
of the appellant?
4. Original plaintiff Jamadar Rai brought Title Suit No.
622 of 1974 against sole defendant Sadique Mian pleading therein
that the suit property mentioned in the plaint was owned and
possessed by the sole defendant Sadique Mian. Sadique Mian
agreed to sale the suit property measuring 17 Kathas and 4 Dhurs
in favour of the plaintiff on total consideration money of
Rs.6,500/- (six thousand five hundred). Out of the total
consideration money, Rs.4,000/- (four thousand) of the plaintiff
was already due with Sadique Mian in pursuance of a hand note of
borrowing executed by Sadique Mian in favour of the plaintiff
vide Ext. 3. Rs.700/- (seven hundred) was due against mortgage by
Sadique Mian in respect of a portion of the suit land in favour of
one Kailash Rai. The remaining amount of Rs.1,800/- (one
thousand eight hundred) was to be paid at the time of execution
and registration of the sale deed. The entire terms and conditions
was incorporated in an agreement to sale between the parties dated
06.03.1973
at Ext. G. It is worth to mention that Ext. G is missing from the record and the parties agreed for
hearing of this appeal in Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 absence of Ext. G.
According to the plaintiff, in pursuance of the agreement, a sale deed was drafted on stamp paper on
14.07.1973 at the Registry Office. One Murli Prasad had scribed the deed on the dictate of Sadique
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9608322/ 3
Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
Mian. Thereafter, the deed was read over to Sadique Mian and Sadique Mian put his L.T.I in
presence of witnesses Ramawatar Singh and Awadh Tiwary already examined in the suit. Before
putting his L.T.I., Sadique Mian received Rs.1,500/- (one thousand five hundred) out of the dues of
Rs.1,800/- (one thousand eight hundred) of the consideration money but it was too late, hence, the
document could not be presented for registration before the Registrar. The remaining amount of
Rs.300/- (three hundred) was to be paid at the time of return of the receipt of the sale deed by
Sadique Mian to the plaintiff. However, Sadique Mian insisted for payment of the rest amount of
Rs.300/- (three hundred) pressing his urgent need and the plaintiff paid the said amount to Sadique
Mian and kept the original sale deed with himself. However, Sadique Mian did not turn up ever for
admission of execution before the Registrar and registration of the document which led to the filing
of the suit.
5. During pendency of the suit, the plaintiff came to know that Sadique Mian had sold away the suit
land through registered sale deed to one Janak Rai on 26.09.1974 vide Ext. C. Patna High Court SA
No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 Thereafter, Janak Rai was impleaded as defendant no. 2. The plaintiff
amended the plaint and challenged the sale deed by Sadique Mian in favour of Janak Rai as
collusive, forged and fabricated document and non-operative.
6. Sadique Mian filed written statement disputing claim of the plaintiff that Sadique Mian ever
agreed to sale or executed sale deed to plaintiff. Rather asserted that he had sold the suit property to
Janak Rai for adequate consideration. Thereafter, Sadique Mian did not contest the suit or the
appeal before the court below.
7. Defendant no. 2 Janak Rai filed his separate written statement adopting the case and claim of
Sadique Mian and asserting that, in fact, Sadique Mian had entered into an agreement to sale the
suit property in favour of defendant no. 2 Janak Rai on 06.03.1973 vide Ext. E and thereafter
Sadique Mian went to Kolkata and after his return, he executed the registered sale deed dated
26.09.1974. Moreover, defendant no. 2 is a bona fide purchaser for consideration without notice of
any agreement with the plaintiff, hence, the contract cannot be enforced especially against
defendant no. 2.
8. On consideration of evidence on the record, the learned trial court came to the conclusion that the
plaintiff has Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 proved that the hand note and the
sale deed dated 14.07.1973 (Ext.
2) were executed by Sadique Mian. For coming to the aforesaid conclusion, the trial court
considered the evidence of the witnesses on the documents. The evidence of scribe and the evidence
of expert, who compared the admitted signature of Sadique Mian on Ext.2A, which was a sale deed
executed by Sadique Mian in favour of one Shambhu Nath Kuer with his disputed signature on the
hand note and the sale deed vide Ext. 2.
9. The learned trial court doubted the genuineness of the agreement to sale as well as sale deed in
favour of defendant no. 2 said to be executed by defendant no. 1 on the ground that they were
collusive and created documents. For the aforesaid reasoning, the trial court considered the case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9608322/ 4
Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
defendant no. 2 that after agreement to sale in his favour Sadique Mian went to Kolkata and he
returned only in the month of September to execute registered sale deed dated 26.09.1974 in favour
of defendant no. 2. The Court doubted the correctness of the version for the reason that it is
admitted case of Sadique Mian that he had gone along with brother of the plaintiff to the
Registration Office on 14.07.1973 for getting a loan sanctioned, however, his L.T.I's on stamp papers
and blank papers were used as so-called agreement to sale and sale deed. Therefore, according to
the courts below Sadique Mian was Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 present on
14.07.1973 as well as on 09.08.1974 while executing a registered sale deed in favour of Mukhtar Rai,
the full-brother of the plaintiff vide Ext. 2B. Therefore, according to the trial court, on getting
knowledge of the filing of the suit, defendants created and brought those documents into existence
to defeat the claim of the plaintiff.
10. The learned lower appellate court formulated two points for consideration: (i) Whether Sadique
Mian had really entered into agreement to sale the suit land to the plaintiff Jamadar Rai and
whether the unregistered sale deed dated 14.07.1973 is valid genuine and for consideration? (ii)
Whether defendant no. 2 is a bona fide purchaser of the suit land for value and without notice? The
lower appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on both the points aforesaid and held
that defendant no. 2 is not a bona fide purchaser for consideration. Both the courts below have
observed that the principle of lis pendens would be applicable against defendant no. 2.
11. During pendency of the appeal before the learned court below, the defendant no. 2 died and his
legal heirs were substituted, who are appellants herein. Likewise, the original plaintiff has also died
and legal heirs are contesting this appeal. Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
12. Before adverting to the rival contention of the parties, it would be apt to note that the High Court
cannot interfere with the concurrent finding of fact recorded by the learned courts below unless the
same is found to be perverse being based on no evidence or contrary to the evidence available on the
record or that on the basis of evidence on record, no reasonable person could have come to the
conclusion reached by the learned courts below.
13. This Court cannot substitute its own reason against the reasons of the learned courts below
based on the same evidence on the record.
14. Contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that in a suit for specific performance of
contract, the plaintiff is bound to specifically plead and prove by evidence his willingness and
readiness to perform his part of the contract. In the present case, the plaintiff has failed to discharge
the burden, hence, contrary view of the learned courts below is not sustainable in law.
15. The record reveals that in para 8 of the plaint, the plaintiff has specifically pleaded his readiness
and willingness to perform his part. The plaintiff as P.W. 2 in para 4 has specifically stated that he is
ready and willing to perform his part of the Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
contract. Learned trial court has recorded finding of readiness and willingness in para 5 of the
judgment.

Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
16. To my view, in the facts and circumstances of this case, there is substantial compliance of the
requirement of law for the reason that plaintiff has left nothing to be performed on his part in
pursuance of agreement between the parties. The plaintiff has asserted that he has already paid
entire consideration money to Sadique Mian. He has already taken possession of the land. The sale
deed is already drafted and executed on adequate stamp and only thing left to be performed is on
the part of Sadique Mian to admit the execution before the Registrar and registration of the
document. Accordingly, this question is stand answered against the appeal.
17. Contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the learned lower appellate court was
final Court of fact, as such, was required to discuss all the oral and documentary evidences adduced
on behalf of the parties.
In the present case, learned lower appellate court has not even referred the oral evidences adduced
on behalf of the defendant-appellant, as such, the judgment of the learned lower appellate court is
vitiated in law.
Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
18. On the other hand, contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is that the learned trial
court has referred those evidences and they were not required to be restated as the dispute between
the parties was mainly based on documentary evidences which can not be excluded by oral
witnesses.
19. Learned counsel has drawn attention of the Court that D.W. 1 Md. Usman is a photographer of
L.T.I., D.W. 2 Syed Iqbal Taiyaba Hasan is expert who compared the admitted L.T.I. with disputed
L.T.I., D.W. 3 Bijendra Kishore Prasad is a draftman who has drafted the deed in favour of the
original defendant no. 2, D.W. 4 Brijnandan Sahay is also a draftman, D.W. 5 Janaki Rai is
party-defendant no. 2 and his evidence has been discussed by the leaned lower appellate court, D.W.
6 Sri Bhagwan Singh has supported that Sadique Mian had executed a sale deed in favour of
defendant no. 2 Janaki Rai. Same is the statement of D.W. 7 Indrasan Prasad, D.W. 8 Chandradeo
Singh, D.W. 9 Amla Rai and D.W. 10 Yogendra Rai. D.W. 11 Achuta Nand Prasad and D.W. 12
Birendra Prasad are formal witnesses who have proved the documents.
20. Contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is that no failure of justice has been caused
to the appellant by non-reference of the aforesaid oral evidences, in view of the Patna High Court SA
No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 finding of the learned lower appellate court in para 21 of the judgment
as follows:
"................... According to the plaintiff, it appears that Sadique Mian left for Assam or
Bengal shorty after the execution of the agreement to sale dated 06.03.1973 (wrongly
typed as unregistered sale deed dated 14.07.1973) in favour of the plaintiff. The
written statement of Sadique Mian categorically admits the fact that he was present
here when came to Gopalganj on 13.07.1973 for obtaining bank loan. This clearly goes
to show that Sadique Mian either did not go to Assam or Bengal from March,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9608322/ 6
Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
between 1973 to 13.07.1973 or even if he went to Assam on 06.03.1973 as stated by
the appellant, he was available in his village, during the month of July, 1973 and
more surely at least on 13.07.1973. There is no explanation from the appellant as to
why he did not get his registered sale deed executed during July, 1973 when Sadique
Mian was present in his village. Therefore, the contention of the appellant is that
Sadique Mian left for Assam on 06.03.1973 itself after executing the Mahada and,
hence, the registered sale deed Ext. C could be executed on 26.09.1974. On his return
from Assam does not appear to be true. This amply shows that the Mahada Ext. C has
been antedated by both the defendant no. 1 and 2. Ext. C registered sale deed dated
26.09.1974 might be for value without notice but it cannot obliterate or supersede or
out way or override the valid and genuine unregisteed sale deed Ext. 2 executed in
favour of the plaintiff by Sadique Mian on 14.07.1973. Secondly, this Patna High
Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 Ext. C has been executed during the
pendency of the suit, hence, legally it is not enforceable. However, the appellant is at
liberty to recover from Sadique Mian whatever consideration money was paid by him
to Sadique Mian under Ext. C. Accordingly, this point is decided."
21. Thus, according to the learned lower appellate court even if it is assumed that the transaction
between defendant no. 1 and defendant no. 2 was for value and without notice of the earlier
transaction that is unenforceable as the principle of lis pendens comes in the way.
22. The law is settled that if the learned lower appellate court would have reversed the finding of the
trial court it was bound to go through the evidence and reasoning of the trial court in details. When
the finding of the learned trial court is affirmed the non-discussion of formal evidences by the
learned lower appellate court does not make a case of substantial question of law because the
reference of those evidences could not have led to a different finding recorded in the case by the
learned lower appellate court. Accordingly, it is held that no failure of justice has been caused for
non-discussion of above referred oral evidences by the lower appellate court. Therefore, this
question is also answered against the appellant.
Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
23. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the suit was filed on 26.08.1974 with incomplete
court-fee and the deficit court-fee was paid on 11.10.1974 and on 14.10.1974 and admittedly the suit
was admitted for hearing on 14.10.1974. Therefore, the sale deed executed by defendant no. 1 in
favour of original defendant no. 2-appellant herein on 26.09.1974 vide Ext. C was prior to the
institution of the suit, hence, the principle of lis pendens is not applicable.
24. Learned counsel has drawn attention of the Court on Section 6 of the Court-fees Act, 1970 which
provides that no document of any of the kinds specified as chargeable in the First or Second
Schedule to this Act annexed shall be filed, exhibited or recorded in any Court of Justice, or shall be
received or furnished by any public officer, unless in respect of such document there be paid a fee of
an amount not less than that indicated by either of the said schedules as the proper fee for such
document. According to learned counsel, the plaint is chargeable with court-fee under Schedule-I of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9608322/ 7
Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
the Act and in absence of sufficient court-fee, the plaint should not have been received/accepted. If
it was accepted ignoring the requirement of law, the acceptance was not valid acceptance till entire
court-fee was paid and the plaint was admitted for hearing. Reliance has been placed on case of
Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 Raghunath Ganesh Thakar v. Vaman Vasudev
Chitale reported in AIR (37) 1950 Bombay 234.
25. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the institution of the suit is
deemed from the date of presentation of the plaint. Reference has been made to the provisions of
Section 26 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 which
are being reproduced below:-
"Section 26(1) of the C.P.C. Institution of suits.--- Every suit shall be instituted by the
presentation of a plaint or in such other manner as may be prescribed. Section 26(2)
of the C.P.C. In every plaint, facts shall be proved by affidavit."
26. Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 reads as follows:
"Section 52. Transfer of property pending suit relating thereto. ---- During the
pendency in any Court having authority within the limits of India excluding the State
of Jammu and Kashmir or established beyond such limits by the Central Government
of any suit or proceedings which is not collusive and in which any right to immovable
property is directly and specifically in question, the Patna High Court SA No.717 of
1986 dt.07-03-2019 property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt with by any
party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect the rights of any other party thereto
under any decree or order which may be made therein, except under the authority of
the Court and on such terms as it may impose."
"Explanation.--- For the purposes of this section, the pendency of a suit or
proceeding shall be deemed to commence from the date of the presentation of the
plaint or the institution of the proceeding in a Court of competent jurisdiction, and to
continue until the suit or proceeding has been disposed of by a final decree or order
and complete satisfaction or discharge of such decree or order has been obtained, or
has become unobtainable by reason of the expiration of any period of limitation
prescribed for the execution thereof by any law for the time being in force."
27. The explanation to the aforesaid section as well as Section 26(1) of the C.P.C. clearly provides
that pendency of a suit or proceeding shall be deemed to commence from the date of presentation of
the plaint in a Court of competent jurisdiction. Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
28. In the present case, it is not disputed that the plaint was presented on 26.08.1974, hence, the
suit between the parties was already instituted before a competent court, as such, the principle of lis
pendens was applicable on fulfillment of other conditions. One of the parties to the suit i.e.
defendant no. 1 transferred the suit property to a third party which was subsequently added as
defendant no. 2 and the transaction affected the right of the plaintiff in the suit property, hence, on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9608322/ 8
Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
this ground also, the suit was hit by the principle of lis pendens.
29. Section 149 of the C.P.C. empowers the Court to accept deficit court-fee. The provision reads as
follows:
"Section 149 of the C.P.C. Power to make up deficiency of Court-fees. --- Where the
whole or any part of any fee prescribed for any document by the law for the time
being in force relating to Court-fees has not been paid, the Court may, in its
discretion, at any stage, allow the person, by whom such fee is payable, to pay the
whole or part, as the case may be, of such Court-fee; and upon such payment the
document, in respect of which such fee is payable, shall have the same force and
effect as if such fee had been paid in the first instance."
Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
30. The provisions of Section 4 of the Court-fees Act, 1870 and Section 149 of the C.P.C. were subject
matter of consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mannan Lal Vs. Mst. Chhotka Bibi
(dead) by her legal representative and others reported in AIR 1971 SC 1374 observed as follows:
"Apart from the decisions bearing on the point, there can in our opinion, be no doubt
that Sec. 4 of the Court Fees Act is not the last word on the subject and the Court
must consider the provisions of both the Act and the Code to harmonise the two sets
of provision which can only be done by reading Section 149 as a proviso to Section 4
of the Court Fees Act by allowing the deficiency to be made good within a period of
time fixed by it. If the deficiency is made good no possible objection can be raised on
the ground of the bar of limitation: the memorandum of appeal must be treated as
one filed within the period fixed by the Limitation Act subject to any express
provision to the contrary in that Act and the appeal must be treated as pending from
the date when the memorandum of appeal was presented in Court. In our view it
must be treated as pending from the, date of presentation not only for the purpose of
limitation but also Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 for the
purpose of sufficiency as to court- fee under Section 149 of the Code."
31. In Baijnath Prasad Singh and others v. Umeshwar Singh and others reported in AIR 1937 Patna
550, a Special Bench of Patna High Court observed as follows:
"The Court has a double function: it has its judicial function to hear and decide cases;
it also acts as a Collector of Revenue, and its duty is to collect the revenue for the
Government in the shape of court-fees according to the statues provided, and in
exercising that function it has a discretion granted it to allow time. In the exercise of
both of these functions, Subordinate Courts are under the direction of the High
Court."

Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
32. From the aforesaid propositions, it is evident that institution of the suit starts on the date of
presentation of the plaint before the competent court. The plaint can be rejected in different
circumstances under Order 7, Rule 11 of the C.P.C. One of the circumstance is non-payment of
deficit court-fee within time allowed by the Court. The Court is empowered to grant extension of
time for payment of deficit court-fee. In this case, the court-fee was paid within time granted by the
Court. The suit would be deemed to be presented on the date of its presentation. Therefore, Patna
High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 it is held that defendant no. 1 transferred the suit
property in favour of defendant no. 2 during pendency of the suit.
33. Learned counsel for the appellant next contends that right of the appellant being subsequent
transferee from defendant Sadique Mian is protected under Section 19(b) and Section 27(2)
(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act provides for enforcement
of specific performance of contract against any other person claiming under him by a title arising
subsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value who has paid his money in good faith and
without notice of the earlier contract.
34. Sub-section 1 of Section 27 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides for rescission of contract.
Sub-section 2 thereof reads as follows:
"Section 27(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the Court may
refuse to rescind the contract---
(a) xxxx
(b) xxxx
(c) where third parties have, during the subsistence of the contract, acquired rights in
good faith without notice and for value."
Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019
35. The applicability of the aforesaid provisions was considered by the Allahabad High Court in
Ganga Charan v. Bans Bahadur Singh and another reported in AIR 1975 Allahabad 25. While
interpreting Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, the Court observed in para 10 of the
judgment as follows:
"10. The words "and in which any right to immovable property is directly and
specifically in question" are broad enough to include a suit for specific performance
inasmuch as in such suits right to immovable property is directly and specifically in
question. There is a consensus of opinion on this point that Section 52 of the Transfer
of Property Act would apply to suits for specific performance of the contract."
36. In para 14 of the judgment, the Hon'ble Allahabad High Court observed as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9608322/ 10
Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
"14. In a Madras case Vedachari v.
Narasimha Mudali, 76 Ind Cas 793 = (AIR 1924 Mad 307) the Bench clearly held that
"the doctrine of lis pendens applies to suits for specific performance or agreements to
sell Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 immovable properties just as
much as to suits for possession of the same."
37. The applicability of the principle of lis pendens vis a vis protection to the bona fide purchaser for
value and without notice was subject matter of consideration in Guruswamy Nadar v. P. Lakshmi
Ammal (D) by L.Rs. & Ors. reported in AIR 2008 SC 2560. Para 3 and 4 of the judgment is being
reproduced below:
"3. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. It will be
relevant to mention here that the second purchase by the appellant was on 5.5.1975
i.e. two days after the filing of the suit for specific performance on 3.5.1975. Though
the applicability of Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 was not
considered by the trial court, however, the first appellate court i.e. learned Single
Judge while granting the decree for specific performance found that the subsequent
purchase made by the appellant- defendant was also bona fide for value and without
notice of the agreement to sell but the said sale was subordinate to the decree that
could be made in the suit for specific performance which was instituted prior to the
sale in favour of the second purchaser. The main argument which was advanced
before learned Single Judge was that Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963
provides that a decree for specific performance against a subsequent purchaser for
bona fide who has paid the money in good faith without notice of Patna High Court
SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 the original contract can be enforced as the same is
binding on the vendor as well as against the whole world. As against this, it was
contended by the respondents that Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act which
lays down the principle of lis pendens that when a suit is pending during the
pendency of such suit if a sale is made in favour of other person, then the principle of
lis pendens would be attracted. In support of this proposition a Full Bench decision of
the Allahabad High Court in Smt. Ram Peary and others v. Gauri and others [AIR
1978 All 318] as well as a Division Bench judgment of the Madras High Court was
pressed into service. Therefore, the question before us in this case is what is the effect
of the lis pendens on the subsequent sale of the same property by the owner to the
second purchaser. Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act clearly says subsequent sale
can be enforced for good and sufficient reason but in the present case, there is no
difficulty because the suit was filed on 3.5.1975 for specific performance of the
agreement and the second sale took place on 5.5.1975. Therefore, it is the admitted
position that the second sale was definitely after the filing of the suit in question. Had
that not been the position then we would have evaluated the effect of Section 19 of the
Specific Relief Act read with Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. But in the
present case it is more than apparent that the suit was filed before the second sale of
the property. Therefore, the principle of lis pendens will govern the present case and

the Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 second sale cannot have the
overriding effect on the first sale. The principle of lis pendens is still settled principle
of law. In this connection, the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Smt. Ram
Peary (supra) has considered the scope of Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act.
The Full Bench has referred to a decision in Bellamy v. Sabine [(1857) 44 ER 842 at
p. 843] wherein it was observed as under:
"It is scarcely correct to speak of lis pendens as affecting a purchaser through the
doctrine of notice, though undoubtedly the language of the Courts often so describes
its operation. It affects him not because it amounts to notice, but because the law
does not allow litigant parties to give to others, pending the litigation, rights to the
property in dispute, so as to prejudice the opposite party.
Where a litigation is pending between a plaintiff and a defendant as to the right to a
particular estate, the necessities of mankind required that the decision of the Court in
the suit shall be finding, not only on the litigant parties, but also on those who derive
title under them by alienations made pending the suit, whether such alienees had or
had not notice of the pending proceedings. If this were not so, there could be no
certainty that the litigation would ever come to an end."
Similarly the Privy Council in Faiyaz Husain Khan v. Munshi Prag Narain [(1907) 34 Ind Patna High
Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 App 102] where the Court lay stress on the necessity for
final adjudication and observation that otherwise there would be no end to litigation and justice
would be defeated. The Full Bench of Allahabad High Court further referred to the work of Story on
Equity IIIrd Edition, (para 406) which expounded the doctrine of lis pendens in the terms as
follows:
"Ordinarily, it is true that the judgment of a court binds only the parties and their
privies in representations or estate. But he who purchases during the pendency of an
action, is held bound by the judgment that may be made against the person from
whom he derives title. The litigating parties are exempted from taking any notice of
the title so acquired; and such purchaser need not be made a party to the action.
Where there is a real and fair purchase without any notice, the rule may operate very
hardly. But it is a rule founded upon a great public policy; for otherwise, alienations
made during an action might defeat its whole purpose, and there would be no end to
litigation. And hence arises the maxim pendente lite, nihil innovetur; the effect of
which is not to annul the conveyance but only to refer it subservient to the rights of
the parties in the litigation. As to the rights of these parties, the conveyance is treated
as if it never had any existence; and it does not vary them."
Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 Normally, as a public policy once a suit has been
filed pertaining to any subject matter of the property, in order to put an end to such kind of
litigation, the principle of lis pendens has been evolved so that the litigation may finally terminate
without intervention of a third party. This is because of public policy otherwise no litigation will

Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
come to an end.
Therefore, in order to discourage that same subject-matter of property being subjected to
subsequent sale to a third person, this kind of transaction is to be checked. Otherwise, litigation will
never come to an end.
4. Our attention was invited to a decision of this Court in R. K. Mohammed Ubaidullah & Ors. v.
Hajee C. Abdul Wahab (D) by L. Rs. & Ors. [AIR 2001 SC 1658]. In this case it was observed that a
person who purchased the property should made necessary effort to find out with regard to that
property, whether the title or interest of the person from whom he is making purchase was in actual
possession of such property. In this case, the plaintiff filed the suit for specific performance of
contract and during the pendency of the suit, rest of the defendants brought subsequent transaction
of sale by the defendant in their favour claiming the title to the suit property on the ground that they
were the bona fide purchasers for value without notice of prior agreements in favour of plaintiff and
they were also aware that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property as a tenant for last
several years and that they did not make any inquiry if plaintiff had any further or other interest in
the suit property on Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 the date of execution of sale
deed in their favour apart from that he was in possession of the property as a tenant. In that context
their Lordships observed that subsequent purchaser cannot be said to be bona fide purchaser of the
suit property for value without notice of suit agreement and plaintiff would be entitled to relief of
specific performance. Their Lordships after considering the effect of Section 19 of the Specific Relief
Act as well as Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act held that subsequent purchaser has to be
aware before he purchases the suit property. So far as the present case is concerned, it is apparent
that the appellant who is a subsequent purchaser of the same property, he has purchased in good
faith but the principle of lis pendens will certainly be applicable to the present case notwithstanding
the fact that under Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act his rights could be protected."
38. Thus, the settled principle is that the principle of lis pendens would apply even in suit for
specific performance of contract and in cases where the subject matter of the suit has been
transferred by a party to the suit to a third party affecting right of another party to the suit property.
39. In the present case, the suit property was transferred as noticed above during pendency of the
suit, hence, it was subject to the rule of lis pendens and provisions of the Specific Relief Act Patna
High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 cited above protecting right of the purchaser for
consideration and without notice of the earlier contract would not be applicable.
40. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied on the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in
Raghunath Ganesh Thakar v. Vaman Vasudev Chitale reported in AIR (37) 1950 Bombay 234. In the
referred case, the court-fee was sufficiently paid when the matter was pending before the High
Court. The High Court by a judicial order transferred the case to the appropriate jurisdiction of
Subordinate Judge, Civil Division. Before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, a separate case number
was registered. The Court thereafter asked for payment of deficit court-fee. The plaintiff challenged
the order before the High Court on the ground that when the matter was before the High Court, the
court-fee was sufficiently paid. Considering the aforesaid fact of the case, the Hon'ble Bombay High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9608322/ 13
Jonha Devi vs Dinesh Singh And Ors on 7 March, 2019
Court upheld the order of the Civil Judge, Senior Division. The case of Thakar's (supra) is not
applicable in the present facts and circumstances of this case.
41. Learned counsel for the appellant has next relied on the judgment of Apparao Sheshrao
Deshmukh v. Mt. Bhagubai and others reported in A.I.R. (36) 1949 Nagpur 263. In that case, the
plaint was not under-stamped on face of it. However, subsequently it was discovered that the plaint
was not sufficiently Patna High Court SA No.717 of 1986 dt.07-03-2019 stamped. In that
circumstance, the Court held that the Court is bound to give time for making the deficit court-fee in
exercise of power under Section 149 of the C.P.C. before making any order under Order 7, Rule 11 of
the C.P.C.
42. Learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on B. V. Vasantha v. Sha Poonamchand and
others. reported in A.I.R. 1997 Karnataka 306. In this case, the decree passed was found to in nullity
as due to inadvertence quite a different decree was drawn against the judgment. Before correction of
the decree, the suit property was transferred. In the circumstance, the Court held that since the
decree was a nullity on the date of transfer of the property which was subject matter of the decree,
the lis pendens was not applicable.
43. All the aforesaid referred judgments were passed in their peculiar facts and circumstances of the
case.
44. In view of the aforesaid conclusions, this appeal has got no merit. Accordingly, this second
appeal stands dismissed, however, without cost in the facts and circumstances of this case.
