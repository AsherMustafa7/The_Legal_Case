ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 15-10-2025
1. The present Writ petition is filed for issuance of an appropriate writ(s), order(s), or direction (s) to
the respondents for quashing the part of the list dated 25.10.2018 in respect of the Respondent No. 5
appeared at Sl. No. 18 by which the name of the Respondent No.5 has been recommended after
selection for licencee of the Public Distribution system (hereinafter referred as P.D.S.) dealership
under the gram Panchayat Raj Patna High Court CWJC No.12159 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025 Maudiha of
Block Nokha within the district of Rohtas and further to recommend the name of the petitioner in
place of Respondent No. 5 since the petitioner is mere qualified as well as equipped with computer
training.
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision. Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:

issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the
license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of

the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
Patna High Court CWJC No.12159 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of,
whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Patna High Court CWJC No.12159 of 2019
dt.15-10-2025 Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal. Therefore, the petitioner is
directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional Commissioner.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within two months from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the Patna High Court CWJC No.12159 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority concerned, and the authority shall dispose
of the same within three months from the date of filing of the same.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
