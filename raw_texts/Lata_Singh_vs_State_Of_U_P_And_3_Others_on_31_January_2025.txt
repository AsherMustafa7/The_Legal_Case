3. The facts in brief as contained in the writ petition is that petitioner was placed under suspension
vide order dated 17.08.2015 passed by the respondent no.4 namely District Basic Education Officer,
Moradabad. The aforesaid suspension order was revoked by him vide its order dated 05.05.2016.

4. Pursuant to the aforesaid, representations were made by the petitioner before the authorities for
making the full salary for the period of suspension. The aforesaid representation of the petitioner
was duly looked into and thereafter enquiry committee was constituted, who submitted his report
on 28.10.2021. Pursuant to the aforesaid respondent no.4 passed an order dated 21.04.2022. The
operative portion of which reads as follows :-..

5. It is argued that in the aforesaid order observations were made that petitioner will be paid the full
salary for the period of suspension after the verification of his attendance register by the Block
Development Officer, Dilari, District Moradabad.
6. Sri Siddharth Khare, learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon a letter dated
01.06.2024 written by the Block Education Officer, Dilari, District Moradabad to the petitioner by
which he was directed to produce the original copy of his attendance-sheet on or before 05.06.2024.
7. In response to the same, a letter dated 05.06.2024 was written by the petitioner to the Bock
Education Officer, Dilari, District Moradabad stating therein that suspended employee cannot be
compelled to mark attendance. He also placed reliance upon judgement delivered by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of Anwarun Nisha Khatoon Vs. State of Bihar and others reported in AIR
2002 (SC) 2959. He placed reliance upon paragraphs 7, 8 & 9 of the aforesaid judgement, which
reads as follows :--

Lata Singh vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 31 January, 2025
"7. Mr. B. B. Singh relied upon the authority of the Patna High Court in the case of
Ganesh Ram v. State of Bihar reported in 1995 (2) PLJR 690, wherein, after
considering the above mentioned rules, it has been held that after suspension it is not
necessary that the employee must attend work. It is held that a suspended employee
cannot be compelled to mark attendance. It has been held that the authority is,
however, entitled to ensure itself about the presence of the suspended employee at
the headquarter before making payment of subsistence allowance. It is held that in
the event of a dispute it will be for the employee to establish his presence at the
headquarter.
8. In our view, this authority, far from assisting the Respondents, is against them.
This authority shows that there is no requirement to mark attendance. To us also no
rule could be shown which required a suspended employee to mark attendance. The
Respondents can at the most ask for a certificate that the Appellant's husband was
not engaged in any other employment, business, profession or vocation. The
Appellant's husband having died, he could not have furnished such a certificate. At no
stage have the Respondents asked the Appellant to give such a certificate. Thus the
grant of subsistence allowance cannot be denied on the ground that such a certificate
is not given.
9. This view of ours is supported by an authority of this Court in the case of
Jagdamba Prasad Shukla v. State of U.P. reported in (2000) 7 SCC 90. In this case,
on identical facts, it has been held that if the State requires a certificate they should
ask for it. It has been held that without asking for such a certificate the State cannot
reject a claim for subsistence allowance."
8. On the basis of aforesaid it is argued by counsel for the petitioner that petitioner cannot be
compelled to place the copy of the attendance register during the period he was under suspension. It
is further argued that the period for which petitioner was placed under suspension she will be paid
salary meaning thereby to fulfill the terms and conditions of the order of suspension in which one of
the condition was that petitioner will be attached to the institution in which she was working at the
time of suspension.
9. On the other hand it is argued by Ms. Akansha Sharma, learned counsel for the respondents no.3
& 4 that since the petitioner has not placed copy of the proof of his attendance before the
authorities, no decision has been taken till date regarding the payment of full salary for the period of
suspension as stated above.
10. With the consent of learned counsel for the parties, the writ petition is being disposed of at the
admission stage itself.
11. In the facts and circumstances of the case and also in the interest of justice, petitioner is
permitted to submit a fresh representation ventilating all her grievances before the respondent
no.3-Secretary, Board of Basic Education, U.P., Prayagraj along-with certified copy of this order

within a period of three weeks from today. If such a representation is made, the respondent no.3 is
directed to pass appropriate order strictly in accordance with law and without influenced by the
observations made hereinabove within a further period of six weeks.
12. In so far as prayer no.2 is concerned, petitioner is further directed to place necessary papers and
documents in this regard also before the respondent no.3, who will take a decision in the matter.
13. With the aforesaid observations, present writ petition is disposed of finally.
