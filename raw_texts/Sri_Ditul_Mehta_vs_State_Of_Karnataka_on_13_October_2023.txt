3. Heard the learned Senior Counsel Sri C.V. Nagesh appearing the petitioners in Criminal Petition
No.2450/2022 and Sri Sandesh J. Chouta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in
W.P. No.11718/2022, Sri Tomy Sebastian, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent -
de-facto complainant and, Sri Vikram Huilgol, the Additional Advocate General and the learned
High Court Government Pleader for respondent-State.
4. The case of petitioners in Criminal Petition No.2450/2022 is that the de-facto complainant Smt.
Esha Raj filed first information statement before Basavanagudi police alleging the cruelty and abuse
by her husband (accused No.1) and his relatives for dowry. She has stated that she is the daughter of
one Jodhraj and Smt. Chanchal. Her father is the successful business man and a prominent person
in business circle as well as in the Jain community. In the year 2009, there was marriage proposal
from petitioner-accused No.1 (Ditul Mehta). After negotiation, the marriage engagement ceremony
was held on 26.01.2010 at ITC Gardenia hotel and her marriage was decided to be performed on
22.11.2010. After the engagement, accused No.1 used to take the de-facto complainant for lunch and
dinner and started enquiring about properties and assets of her father and then started pressurizing
her for making arrangement for shopping of the marriage at Jaipur, Kolkata, Milan, etc.
Accordingly, clothes and jewelleries were purchased by him. The accused also pressurized for
getting a BMW 5 Series Car, which was agreed. Thereafter, they started demanding more dowry,
otherwise, they used to tell that would postpone the marriage. Due to the pressure of the accused
persons, her father accepted to give gold, silver and other dowry articles and a car as demanded by
the accused persons. The marriage of the de-facto complainant with accused No.1 was performed on
22.11.2010 at Bengaluru palace in a grand manner. At the time of marriage, diamond jewelry, Rolex
Watch, Artefacts, camera, home theater, household items were all given to the accused. Thereafter,
she started to reside in the matrimonial home. The mother of accused No.1 claimed custody of all
the valuables given to her and behaved in rude manner and all the accused abused her in filthy
language. Like wise, her mother-in-law and sister-in- law also suggested to get some gifts from the
parents of de-facto complainant, and it became habit of the accused for getting valuables from the
house of her parents. Thereafter, the harassment was increased day by day, her mother-in-law was
instigating accused No.1 for movable properties and also the rent of the commercial properties. As
per the demand, her father also gifted a property to her and the rents received from the tenants for
about Rs.5,99,00,000/- were all got transferred to the account of the accused persons. It is further
alleged that Anu Mehta who is the sister-in-law of the de-facto complainant, got married on
20.06.2014, The mother-in-law of the complainant gave the jewelry of the complainant to the
sister-in-law during her marriage and, thereafter, it was not returned. When the same was
questioned, both her husband and in-laws were used to harass her, physically and mentally, they
scolded her calling her as slut, prostitute, bitch, ass hole, whore, etc. and even they asked as to
whom did she sleep with and abused her parents also in filthy language. It is also alleged by the
de-facto complainant that she came to know that accused No.1 is in the habit of having illicit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 5
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
intimacy with some other lady and used to come to home late, used to abuse her and assault her. She
also gone to abroad along with family members for 10 days and the husband of her sister- in-law one
Rakshit Kankaria misbehaved with her, attempted to touch inappropriately and talking with her
indecently. Thereafter, they returned to Bengaluru. On 06.12.2018, when the accused-Rakshit
Kankaria visited her home, he crossed the limits by attempting to kiss her forcibly and accused No.1
did not react for that and he insisted her to adjust with Rakshit Kankaria. Right from the beginning,
the accused and family members pressurizing the parents of de-facto complainant for giving them
jewelry, cash whenever they demanded. The jewels worth more than Rs.10 crores have been kept in
their custody, they have taken away silver articles worth more than Rs.50 lakhs, a BMW 5 Series Car
and they got transferred Rs.5.00 lakhs and more than Rs.6 crores taken through cheques. Even on
03.01.2019, when they were staying in a hotel at Mumbai, her husband-accused No.1 abused her in
filthy language and behaved in cruel manner. Hence, prayed for taking action against all the accused
persons.
5. The respondent-police initially registered FIR in Crime No.104/2019 for the above said offences
and later, on the direction of the Commissioner of Police, the investigation was taken by the CCB
police, and they filed charge sheet. Accused Nos.1 to 5 challenging the filing of charge sheet, prayed
for quashing the criminal proceedings.
6. The facts of the case in Writ Petition No.11718/2022 are that the petitioner-accused No.1
challenged referring of investigation of the matter to the CCB police and filing of charge sheet based
upon the notification issued by the State Government on 25.02.2021 appointing the CCB police
officers and conferring the power to the CCB police officials to exercise the power of a Station House
Officer of all police stations in Bangalore City. On various grounds, the petitioner-accused No.1
prayed for quashing the aforesaid notification and consequently, prayed for quashing the charge
sheet filed by the CCB police.
7. The learned Senior Counsel Sri C.V. Nagesh appearing the petitioners in Criminal Petition
No.2450/2022 raised 5 legal issues during his arguments. They are (i) The Commissioner of Police
can not exercise the power under the Karnataka Police Act for transferring the investigation to the
CCB police in respect of criminal case registered at Basavanagudi police, (ii) The Commissioner of
Police has no power to transfer the investigation from Assistant Commissioner of Police to CCB, (iii)
For the purpose of taking cognizance under Section 190 of Cr.P.C., the Magistrate can take
cognizance on the police report filed under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. by the officer in-charge of the
police station, but the CCB is not a police station. Therefore, the notification of the Government
dated 25.02.2021 cannot be considered as an order for transferring the investigation and filing
charge sheet by the CCB police (the same question was also raised by accused No.1 filing separate
writ petition), (iv) While taking cognizance, the learned Magistrate can not exercise the power of
issuing process, summoning the accused, and the same is not in accordance with law, and,
(v) There was exchange of legal notice between the accused No.1 and de-facto complainant. Prior to
filing of the complaint, a divorce petition was filed by accused No.1 against respondent No.2 -
de-facto complainant and the respondent No.2 - de-facto complainant also filed a divorce petition
and the evidence of the petitioner-accused No.1 was not challenged in cross examination and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 6
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
de-facto complainant - respondent No.2 has stated no objection to grant decree of divorce in favour
of accused No.1. Therefore, it is contended that the allegation made in the complaint as well as in the
divorce petition by the accused clearly reveals that there was allegation made by the accused against
respondent - de-facto complainant, was cruelty which was admitted by her. Therefore, the
averments made by de-facto complainant in the complaint for cruelty on her is not sustainable and
also the charge sheet is not sustainable. The learned Senior Counsel also contended that there was
delay of nine years in filing the complaint. Previously, Jayanagar police prepared B-final report and
sent for approval and thereafter, the Commissioner of Police transferred the Investigating to the
CCB police. Therefore, without considering the B-final report filed by Jayanagar police, the charge
sheet filed by the CCB police is not sustainable. Hence, prayed for quashing the charge sheet.
8. In support of his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel Sri C.V. Nagesh has relied on the
following judgments:

9. Sri Sandesh J. Chouta, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner-accused No.1 in
W.P. No.11871/2022 has mainly contended that the 5th respondent issued the notification on
25.02.2021 by declaring that the CCB police are the investigation officers and in turn, they filed
charge sheet. But, as per Section 173 of Cr.P.C. and Sections 2(r) and 2(s) of Cr.P.C., the officer in
the CCB cannot be considered as Station House Officer and his report cannot be considered as a
report under Section 2(r) and Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. Therefore, without power, this notification
has been issued and the CCB cannot be considered as police station in view of the judgments passed
by the Co-ordinate Benches of the High Court as the Co-ordinate Benches have declared that the
CCB is not a police station. The learned Senior Counsel has further contended that while arguing the
matter of ACB in Division Bench, this notification has been issued, they have not followed the
Transaction of Business Rules of Karnataka State. The file has to be placed before the Hon'ble Chief
Minister or the in-charge Minister. Then, the cabinet required to approve the same. Thereafter, an
amendment shall be brought to Section 36 of Cr.P.C. Thereafter, notification has to be signed in the
name of the Hon'ble Governor, but the same was not followed. Therefore, the notification is
required to be set aside. The State Government has not followed the procedure as required under
Articles 245 and 246 of Constitution of India. Unless there is an amendment to Section 36 of
Cr.P.C., the State Government cannot exercise the power under Section 36 of Cr.P.C. for referring
the investigation to the CCB Police. The Learned Senior Counsel also brought to the notice that the
same procedure was followed in Delhi Police Establishment Act, National Investigation Agency Act,
NDPS Act, Lokayuktha Act and contended that, in this case, there is no statutory power for the
government to issue such a notification. Hence, prayed for quashing the notification.
10. In support of his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel Sri Sandesh J. Chouta has relied on the
following judgments:

11. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent - de-facto complainant has seriously
objected the petition and contended that perusal of the averments made in the complaint shows that
the accused persons demanded huge dowry by way of cash, gold, silver and car, and further demand
was made after the marriage of accused No.1 with de-facto complainant. The father of the de-facto
complainant gifted a commercial building where she is receiving more than Rs.5.00 lakh as rent per
month. The entire rent has been got transferred by the accused persons. Continuously, there was
harassment on the de- facto complainant by all the accused persons. The police investigated the
matter and filed charge sheet. There is triable case against the accused persons and therefore, the
charge sheet cannot be quashed.
12. It is further contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent - de-facto complainant
that the averments made in the divorce petition on the ground of cruelty against the de-facto
complainant under Section 13(1)(a) of Hindu Marriage Act, is altogether different from the cruelty
mentioned under Section 498A of IPC and the provisions of D.P. Act. The respondent - de-facto
complainant also filed a petition for divorce and she has stated no objection to grant decree, but the
Family Court has not disposed of the matter and kept pending. The accused also filed an application
for giving further evidence. There were serious allegations made against the husband of de-facto
complainant, her mother-in-law and sister-in-law and the husband of sister-in-law, who tried to
sexually assault her. Therefore, the charge sheet cannot be quashed against the accused persons.
Hence, prayed for dismissing the petition. In support of his contentions, learned senior counsel for
the respondent - de-facto complainant relied on the following decisions:

13. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, perused the records in respect of
criminal petition No.2450/2022.
14. The first ground urged by the learned Senior Counsel Sri C.V Nagesh is that FIR has been
registered by Basavanagudi police and later, on the point of jurisdiction, the Jayanagar police
registered FIR and investigated the matter. The Assistant Commissioner of Police of Jayanagar
Police Station prepared B-final report and subsequently, the Commissioner of Police transferred the
investigation to the CCB Police. In turn, the CCB police filed charge sheet by exercising the power
under the notification dated 25.02.2021 where the State of Karnataka has issued a notification
conferring the power to the CCB police officials to exercise the power of a superior of Station House
Officer of all police stations in Bangalore City comes under the Commissionerate. The
petitioner-accused No.1 also challenged the said notification dated 25.02.2021 in Writ Petition
No.11718/2022 for quashing the same. Therefore, ground No.1 urged by Sri C.V.Nagesh, learned
Senior Counsel, and the prayer in the writ petition are one and the same. Therefore, they are taken
together for discussion.
15. Both the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the petitioners have strenuously contended that
the Commissioner has no power to transfer the case for investigation to the CCB police and the CCB
police have no authority to file charge sheet as the CCB police is not a police station.

Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
16. On the other hand, the learned Additional Advocate General has seriously objected the petitions
and contended that the CCB is working since long for investigating the matter and the police officers
are assigned the power of investigating the matter and to file the charge sheet, which amounts to
filing of the final report under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. Merely, there are some errors in the
notification mentioning the provisions of law under the Karnataka Police Act, that itself is not a
ground to quash the notification and it is not the notification declaring the CCB as police station, but
the CCB police officers are given the power to exercise the power of in-charge of police stations as
superior for the purpose of investigation. Therefore, prayed for dismissing the petition.
In support of his contentions, the learned AAG has relied on the following judgments:
1. Dr. M.G. vs. State by Central Police and Another - 2021 SCC OnLine Kar 339
2. N. Mani v. Sangeetha Theatre, - (2004) 12 SCC 278
3. Zakir Abdul Mirajkar vs. State of Maharashtra and Others - 2022 SCC OnLine SC
4. R.P. Kapur v. Pratap Singh Kairon -
(1961) 2 SCR 143
17. Both the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the petitioners as well as the learned AAG have
relied upon the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of DR. M.G. GOPAL,
PRINCIPAL AND DEAN OF KIMS Vs. CENTRAL POLICE AND ANOTHER reported in 2021 SCC
Online KAR 339, wherein the Co-ordinate Bench has held that the CCB is not a police station for the
purpose of filing charge sheet and quashed the criminal proceedings in that case. The learned AAG
has also submitted that the said judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench has been stayed by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Special Leave Appeal (Criminal) Nos.2157-2158/2021 on 30.07.2021 and the stay
is still operating. Therefore, the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench is not required to be
considered by this Court.
18. The learned AAG has also seriously contended that the notification issued by the government on
25.02.2021 is only a clarification regarding investigation officer to be investigated by the CCB by
assigning the power of the superior officer of all police stations in Bengaluru. Therefore, once the
power assigned to the officer of the CCB to investigate the crime registered in the police station
comes under the Commissionerate of Bangalore City and the police officer of CCB, being a superior
officer of the police station, is empowered to file charge sheet, Therefore, it is contended that the
said ground is not sustainable.
19. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner also relied upon the judgment of the another
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of MAGADI SHANKAR RAO KRISHNAMURHTY AND
OTHERS VS. COP BANGALORE CITY reported in ILR 2015 KAR 6039, wherein the said
Co-ordinate Bench while considering the definition of Section 2(o) of Cr.P.C. regarding the officer in
charge of a police station and Section 2(22) of the Karnataka Police Act in respect of superior police
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 12
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
officer and Section 36 of Cr.P.C., has held that the Commissioner did not take over the investigation
by himself but directed the Commissioner of Police (Crimes) to order a police officer of the CCB unit
to conduct the investigation and the Co-ordinate Bench has held that the Commissioner has no
power to refer the investigation to the other inferior officer and he could have taken the
investigation himself being a superior of the police station. This judgment was delivered in the year
2015, that is on 28.10.2015, and subsequent to the said judgment, the State Government issued the
notification dated 25.02.2021 empowering the powers to the CCB police for investigating the matter
as the superior officers of the police station. Therefore, the said judgment was delivered prior to
issuing the impugned notification. Hence, that order is not required to be considered at this stage.
20. Regarding power of the State Government for issuing notice has been disputed by Sri Sandesh J.
Chouta, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner in W.P. No.11718/2022, contending that the
procedure under the provisions of Karnataka Police Act read with Section 36 of Cr.P.C. for issuing
the notification by the State Government dated 25.02.2021 was not followed and without following
the proper procedure and the Rules, the State Government has over night issued the impugned
notification. The learned Senior Counsel has also relied upon the various enactments including the
Delhi Special police Establishment Act, wherein Section 3 of the said Act empowers the officer in
charge of police station for exercising the power above the rank of Sub-Inspector, subject to any
order of Central Government, he can exercise the power of in charge of the police station for
discharging the functions; Section 3 of the National Investigation Act empowers the power of the
Sub- Inspector. Above the rank of Sub-Inspector can exercise the power of officer in charge of the
police station; and Section 53 of NDPS Act empowers an officer giving power to exercise as a Station
House Officer. But, in the present case, no such law empowers the State Government to issue
impugned notification dated 25.02.2021. Hence, he has contended that the notification shall be
quashed.
21. The learned Senior Counsel Sri Sandesh J. Chouta has relied upon the judgment of the
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of STATE OF KARNATAKA BY SUPERINTENDENT OF
POLICE Vs. THAMMAIAH AND OTHERS passed in Criminal Petition No.749/1996 dated
03.08.1998, wherein the establishment of COD police for investigation has been questioned. In the
said case, the Magistrate referred the complaint to the COD police and it was set aside by the High
Court. There is no second thought about the principles laid down by the Co- ordinate Bench of this
Court that under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C., the complaint shall be referred to the Station House
Officer of the police station and subsequently, the investigation can be ordered to be taken up by the
COD police as per the direction of the Commissioner or Superintendent of Police. The said order
was passed in the year 1998 and there was no impugned notification dated 25.02.2021 at that time.
Hence, the said judgment will not come to the aid of the petitioners.
22. Another Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of N. RAJACHAR AND OTHERS Vs.
KODANDARAMA AND ANOTHER reported in ILR 2002 KAR 2909 in respect of referring the
complaint to the CCB police for investigation, has held that the CCB police is not an in charge police
station and accordingly, the proceedings has been quashed. The said order was delivered in March,
2002. At that time, there was no notification issued by the State Government. The notification was
issued only on 25.02.2021.

Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
23. Another Co-ordinate Bench in the case of RAKESH SHETTY Vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND
OTHERS reported in 2020 SCC Online KAR 4638 (in Writ Petition No.11169/2020 (GM-RES) dated
05.11.2020), while considering the quashing of FIR and charge sheet at para 11.8 of its judgment,
has held that CCB is not a police station and the CCB by itself cannot register or investigate into any
matter since there is an embargo on such registration of complaint and such power is conferred only
on a person in charge of police station. The Co-ordinate Bench has further held that CCB is not
Police station, however, it has held that the power of CCB to investigate an offence by way of an
administrative order passed in relation thereto and the charge sheet shall not be filed by them and
after the investigation, they should hand over the charge sheet to the Police station and in turn, the
particular police can file the charge sheet.
24. The Co-ordinate Bench has held in Rakesh Shetty's case, cited supra, that the CCB police can
investigate the crime but they cannot file charge sheet and they should hand over the charge sheet to
the concerned police and in turn, the concerned police or in charge Police station shall file charge
sheet.
25. The learned Senior Counsel has relied upon the another judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of
this Court in the case of MANJUNATH HEBBAR Vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in 2021 SCC
Online KAR 1493, wherein it is held that the CID police cannot be held to be superior officer in
charge of a police station. It is submitted that the said judgment has been stayed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition and therefore, the said judgment need not be considered at
this stage.
26. The learned Senior Counsel has contended that the notification issued by the State Government
is not in accordance with law and that was not issued in the manner prescribed which is known to
law. He has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in JURWASIR LIMITED Vs.
REGIONAL DIRECTOR, ESI, HYDERABAD reported in (2015)7 SCC 690. At para 14 and 15 of the
said judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court relied upon its earlier judgment reported in STATE OF
JHARKAND AND OTHERS Vs. AMBAY CEMENT AND ANOTHER reported in (2005)1 SCC 368
wherein it has been held that "it is the cardinal rule of interpretation that where a statute provides
that a particular things should be done, it should be done in the manner prescribed and not in any
other way".
27. At para 15, the Apex Court relied upon the earlier judgment in the case of BABU VERGHESE Vs.
BAR COUNCIL OF KERALA reported in (1999) 3 SCC 422 wherein it was held that "it is basic
principle of law long settled that if the manner of doing a particular act is prescribed under a statute,
the act must be done in that manner or not at all. The origin of this rule is traceable to the decision
in TAILOR Vs TAILOR was followed by Lord Roche in NAZEER AHMED Vs. KING EMPEROR".
Here, in the present case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that for legislating any law or a rule,
the procedure shall be followed.
28. The learned Senior Counsel also contended that the Commissioner cannot exercise power
prescribed under the law and the delegatee cannot delegate the power. The learned Senior Counsel
also relied upon the judgment in the case of SAINT JOHNS TEACHER INSTITUTE Vs. REGIONAL
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 14
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
DIRECTOR NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR TEACHER EDUCATION AND ANOTHER reported in
(2003)3 SCC 321, wherein, the said case also laid the similar principles as stated in
AGRICULTURAL MARKET COMMITTEE Vs. SHALIMAR CHEMICAL Works Limited reported in
(1997)5 SCC 516. In another judgment in the case of STATE OF RAJASTHAN AND OTHERS Vs.
BASANTH NAHATA reported in (2005) 12 SCC 77, the Hon'ble Supreme Court at para 19 of the
judgment, has held that the necessity of the legislatures delegating its power in favour of the
executive, is a part of legislative function. It is a constituent element of the legislative power as a
whole under Article 245 of Constitution of India. Such delegation of power however cannot be vide,
untenalised, or unguided. It is also held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the legislative functions
cannot be delegated.
29. In another case in STATE OF T.N. Vs. P. KRISHNAMURTHY reported in (2006)4 SCC 517, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court at para 15 of the judgment, has held as under:
"Whether the rule is valid in its entirety?
15. There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality or validity of a subordinate
legislation and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that it is invalid. It is
also well recognised that a subordinate legislation can be challenged under any of the
following grounds:
(a) Lack of legislative competence to make the subordinate legislation.
(b) Violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India.
(c) Violation of any provision of the Constitution of India.
(d) Failure to conform to the statute under which it is made or exceeding the limits of
authority conferred by the enabling Act.
(e) Repugnancy to the laws of the land, that is, any enactment.
(f) Manifest arbitrariness/unreasonableness (to an extent where the court might well
say that the legislature never intended to give authority to make such rules)."
30. In another judgment, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.S.
JOSHI, SALES TAX OFFICER GUJRATH Vs. AJIT MILLS LTD. reported in (1997)4 SCC 98, has
laid down the principles regarding the competence of the state legislature to enact provisions by
exercising the power under Articles 245, 246, 265 and list-II Schedule-7 of Constitution of India and
also laid down the enactment and its sustainability.
31. In another judgment, the Full Bench of High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the case of M/s.
INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LIMITED Vs. MR. KAREM ZAHEER YAR JUNG reported in 1997
SCC Online AP 271 has considered the judicial review of the delegated legislation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 15
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
32. The petitioners have also relied upon the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the
case of CHIDANANADA Vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA and connected matters, reported in 2022 SCC
Online KAR 1488, wherein the Division Bench has scrapped the creation of Anti Corruption Bureau
(ACB) established on the executive order of the State Government. The learned Senior Counsel has
contended that while arguing the matter before the Division Bench in respect of challenging the
ACB, the notification was issued for creation of ACB. But, in the present case, the State Government
has hurriedly issued the impugned notification dated 25.02.2021 without following the procedure
under the Karnataka Government (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1977. Therefore, prayed for
quashing the said notification.
33. By keeping the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the above said cases, in
respect of enacting the legislature by following the procedures known to law or in the manner
known to law, they cannot delegate the power to Commissioner of Police, etc. In this regard, it is
relevant to note the impugned notification issued by the State Government dated 25.02.2021, which
is as under:

discharged subject to the control of the Inspector-General: Provided also that in any area for which a

35. The notification also refers the provisions of Section 36 of Cr.P.C. For convenience, Section 36 of
Cr.P.C. is cited as under:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 18
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
36. Considering the above said provisions of Karnataka Police Act and Section 36 of Cr.P.C., now
this Court is required to consider :
(i) Whether the petitioner made out ground for quashing the notification dated
25.02.2021 empowering the CCB police to investigate the matter is not in accordance
with law ?
(ii) Whether the Commissioner of Police is having power to refer the investigation to the CCB police
under the Karnataka Police Act ?
37. In this regard, on perusal of the Karnataka Police Act 1963, it is clear that it is a legislature in
respect of the powers and functions of the police under the Karnataka State. Section 4 of the
Karnataka Police Act confers the power of the government regarding superintendence of police force
in the State; Section 5 states the State Government has power to give ranks to the police officials;
and Section 6 empowers DG and IGP for having control, direction, supervision of police service and
State Government shall appoint DG and IGP; and Section 7 provides the Government may appoint a
Police Commissioner for the Bangalore City and Section 7(2) empowers the Police Commissioner for
performing such functions and duties as provided under the Act or as may otherwise directed by the
Government; Section 11 empowers the State Government to appoint the Deputy and Assistant to the
Commissioner i.e. DCP and ACP; and Section 12 empowers the Government to make an
appointment of police officers of and below the rank of inspector shall be made by the prescribed
authority. Therefore, the State Government has power to issue any notification under the Karnataka
Police Act for appointing any police officer or establish police station in the local area and appoint
Police officers for investigating the matters/crimes. There is reference available under Section 36 of
Cr.P.C. which provides the police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station
may exercise the same powers, throughout the local area to which they are appointed, as may be
exercised by such officer within the limits of his station.
38. The learned AAG has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
STATE OF KERALA Vs. P.B. SOURABHA reported in (2016)4 SCC 102, wherein the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, in a similar circumstances, has held that the power exercised by the State Police
Chief/Director General of Police empower to appoint superior police officer to investigate crime
registered outside the territorial jurisdiction of such officer. The Hon'ble Supreme Court at
paragraph 7 of the said judgment has held as under:
"7. Section 36 empowers police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a
police station to exercise the same powers as that of an officer in charge of a police
station insofar as the territorial/local area within the jurisdiction of such superior
police officers is concerned. Section 18(1) of the State Police Act, on the other hand,
vests the administration, supervision, direction and control of the police throughout
the State in the State Police Chief. The power under Section 36, on a plain reading
thereof, is to be exercised by the District Police Chief who, by virtue of the said
section, is empowered to appoint an officer above the rank of an officer in charge of a
police station to exercise the same powers as may be exercised by an officer in charge
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 19
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
of the police station. This is, however, subject to the condition that such superior
officer would be competent to exercise powers within the territorial/local limits of his
jurisdiction. We do not see how Section 36 CrPC, in any way, can debar the exercise
of powers by the State Police Chief to appoint any superior officer who, in his
opinion, would be competent and fit to investigate a particular case keeping in view
the circumstances thereof. Section 36 CrPC does not fetter the jurisdiction of the
State Police Chief to pass such an order based on his satisfaction. It is the satisfaction
of the State Police Chief, in the light of the facts of a given case, that would be
determinative of the appointment to be made in which situation the limits of
jurisdiction will not act as fetter or come in the way of exercise of such jurisdiction by
the superior officer so appointed. Such an appointment would not be hedged by the
limitations imposed by Section 36 CrPC. Section 18 of the State Police Act, on the
other hand, does not confer any such power and merely recognises the State Police
Chief as the head of the police force in the State."
39. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sourabha's case, cited supra, is squarely
applicable to the case on hand as the Commissioner of Police has acted in accordance with the
power conferred by the State Government under Section 7 of Karnataka Police Act and in view of
Section 7(2) of Karnataka Police Act, the Commissioner of Police has referred investigation to the
CCB police and in turn, the CCB police investigated the matter and filed charge sheet. Therefore, the
contention of the petitioners' counsel that the Commissioner of Police does not have power to refer
investigation to the CCB police in respect of FIR registered at police station comes under the
Commissionerate of Bangalore City, can not be acceptable.
40. The learned AAG also relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of N
MANI Vs. SANGEETHA THEATER AND OTHERS reported in (2004)12 SCC 278, at paragraph 9 of
the judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:
"It is well settled that if an authority has a power under the law, merely because while
exercising that power the source of power is not specifically referred to on a reference
is made to a wrong provision of law that by itself does not vitiate the exercise of
power so long as the power does exist and can be traced to a source available in law."
41. In another case in JAKEER ABDUL. Vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA reported in 2022 SCC
Online 1092, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the case challenged under the
provisions of Maharashtra Control of Organized Crimes Act (MOCA Act), considered the challenging
the investigation by the police under the special enactment. At paragraph 67 of the judgment, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
"67. It is our view that the expression "rank" must be understood as a class or
category which encompasses multiple posts. The posts of SP, Addl. SP, and DCP all
fall within the same rank as they exercise similar functions and powers and operate
within similar spheres of authority. Every person within a particular rank will not be
of the same seniority. Officers of the same rank may have been in service for a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 20
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
different number of years. At times, this may even bear on the post to which they are
appointed but their rank remains undisturbed. A difference in the seniority of a
particular officer is not the same as a difference in their ranks. The insignia on
officers' uniforms denote, in this case, their seniority as well as their designations."
42. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case has categorically held that the police are empowered
to investigate the matter under law. Especially, the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case
of P.B. SOURABHA cited supra, it is held that the Commissioner has power to appoint the superior
officer for investigating the matter. Here, in this case, the Commissioner of Police has referred to the
CCB police officer for investigating the matter and to file charge sheet. Therefore, the contention of
the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that charge sheet filed by the CCB is unsustainable
under the law and the Commissioner of Police does not have power to refer the complaint for
investigation to the CCB police holds no water.
43. Here, in the case on hand, the Commissioner of Police directed the CCB police to investigate the
matter in the crime registered by Basavanagudi police. The CCB police officer investigated the
matter and filed charge sheet, which is under the challenge. The main contention of the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioners was that the notification dated 25.02.2021 was issued by over
night without following the procedure as per the Karnataka Government (Transaction of Business)
Rules, 1977.
44. The learned AAG has produced the file pertaining to the issuance of impugned notification by
the State Government in a sealed cover. On perusal of the said file, the parliamentary affairs and the
home department has created a file No.HD/18/POP/2021 on 29.01.2021 (DPAL/29/ASHARA/2021
dated 30.01.2021) and sent to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs and Legislation and the
same was verified by the Additional Chief Secretary, Home Department and later, forwarded to the
concerned minister on the same day and the same was approved later, it was referred back to the
Additional Chief Secretary and the impugned notification has been issued on 25.02.2021. On
verifying the said file, it was revealed that the CCB police was created on 03.09.1971 consisting
record section, special squad, cycle squad and totally 2 circle inspectors, 8 sub inspectors, 20 head
constables and 12 constables were deputed and the ACP was in charge of the CCB. Later, further
notification was issued by the State Government on 10.02.1994 by deputing the additional officers.
On 13.11.2002, further notification was issued categorizing the crimes and appointing the DCP and
ACP and other police officers. Later, in the year 2004, investigation officer was appointed. On
27.03.2004, the strength of the investigation officer was increased by reorganization of CCB by
appointing more ACPs. Finally, the present notification dated 25.02.2021 has been issued.
45. On careful reading of these orders from the year 1971 and subsequent dates, appointing the
officers from the rank of circle inspectors to the rank of police inspectors, ACP and DCP to exercise
the power under Section 36 of Cr.P.C. for investigating the matter in the manner exercised by the
police officer of the particular Police station, therefore, the notification issued by the State on
25.02.2021 cannot be said that it is prepared over night empowering the CCB police for
investigation. On the other hand, for the last 50 years, the CCB is functioning and the officers
deputed in the CCB are investigating the matters by functioning as investigation officer for crimes
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 21
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
registered in the various Police station at Bangalore city and they are empowered under this
notification and they are classified and identified as superior officer of the Police stations comes
under the Commissionerate, Bangalore City, for the purpose of investigation.
46. Once the power of investigation is exercised by the Police officer as Superior of a Police station,
in view of deputing the police in the CCB, they can exercise all the powers and functions of a
superior investigation officer of police station and they have power to file charge sheet or final
report under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. in view of Section 36 of Cr.P.C. Once the CCB Police officer
investigated the matter as a superior officer of the police station, he becomes automatically an
officer in-charge of the police station by virtue of the power given to him by the State Government
under the Karnataka Police Act and he can exercise the power under Section 36 of Cr.P.C. vide
notification issued on 25.02.2021. Therefore, the contention of the learned Senior Counsel that the
State Government has no power to issue such notification, without seeking amendment to the
Cr.P.C. in the floor of the assembly and in the manner known to law, cannot be acceptable.
47. The Karnataka Police Act was legislated in the year 1963 and the powers and functions were
stated in the Karnataka Police Act and the State Government by exercising the power under the
Karnataka Police Act appointed the Commissioner of Police under Section 7 of Karnataka Police Act,
and he, being the superior officer of the entire police station in the Bangalore city, is having power to
superintendence over all the police stations under Section 7(2) of Karnataka Police Act. When the
investigation officer in Jayanagar police station prepared the B-final report in favour of the accused,
the Commissioner found that the investigation was not proper, and therefore, he has assigned the
investigation to the CCB police and in turn, the CCB police by virtue of the power under the
notification issued by the Government from time to time from the year 1971, investigated the matter
and filed charge sheet.
48. Therefore, I am of the view that the notification dated 25.02.2021 is only an order in respect of
clarification stating that the police officers working in the CCB are the superior officers in respect of
all Police station within the limit of Police Commissionerate of Bangalore city and they can exercise
the same powers as the officer of in charge of Police station under Section 36 of Cr.P.C. Once the
government empowered the CCB police officers as superior officer of the concerned police stations
in Bangalore city, automatically the CCB police gets power under Section 36 of Cr.P.C. for the
purpose of functioning as investigation officer and they are empowered to investigate and file charge
sheet as they become officer in charge of police station as per definition of section 2(o) of Cr.P.C.
and the Karnataka Police Act empowers the State Government to direct any police superior officers
as officer in charge of the police station, they can exercise power under Section 36 of Cr.P.C. and
once the CCB filed the final report, it becomes police report under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. and
therefore, the Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance under Section 190 of Cr.P.C. on the police
report. Therefore, I am of the view that the investigation conducted by the CCB police is in
accordance with the provisions of Section 36 of Cr.P.C. and charge sheet filed by them is sustainable.
49. In view of the findings above, I hold that the investigation done by the CCB police and filing of
the charge sheet by the CCB police, amounts to final report under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. and the
cognizance taken by the Magistrate, is in accordance with law. Therefore, W.P.No.11718/2022 filed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 22
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
by accused No.1 challenging the notification dated 25.02.2021 is liable to be dismissed holding that
the CCB police are empowered to file final report/charge sheet under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C.
50. As regards to the contention taken by Sri C.V. Nagesh, the learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioner- accused Nos.1 to 5, for quashing the charge sheet filed against the petitioner-accused
No.1 in the writ petition as well as against the petitioner-accused Nos.1 to 5 in the criminal petition,
on perusal of the very first information under Section 154 of Cr.P.C., makes out sufficient
ingredients to attract Sections 498-A, 354(A)(B), 504, 506, 324 of IPC and demanding additional
dowry after marriage also attracts Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Though the learned Senior
Counsel for the petitioners Sri C.V. Nagesh has relied upon the various judgments in respect of
quashing FIR, charge sheet including the judgment in the case of STATE OF HARYANA AND
OTHERS Vs. BHAJANLAL AND OTHERS reported in 1992 SCC (Cri) 426 case, but the charge sheet
material reveals that the accused persons demanded and received gold and diamond ornaments,
silver articles worth of crores, and got engagement ceremony in ITC Gardenia hotel spending crores
of rupees, performing marriage at Bangalore-Palace spending more than Rs.12.00 crores, a BMW 5
Series Car was given to accused. At the instance of the accused, a commercial building was gifted by
the parents of complainant to the complainant and rent received by her were got transferred to the
account of the accused. There is also allegation that the mother and sister of accused No.1 taken gold
and diamond ornaments of the complainant and kept in their custody which was used for marriage
of the accused No.4-sister of accused No.1, and all the accused harassed the complainant demanding
additional dowry, abusing her in filthy language and accused No.5-husband of accused No.4 trying
to outrage the modesty of the complainant touching her on the body and the accused also attempted
to commit murder, where Section 307 of IPC also registered. Such being the case, there is abundant
material placed on record to show the involvement of the accused persons in harassing the married
woman-complainant and demanding additional dowry as well as cruelty on the complainant, which
falls within the meaning of the for the offences punishable under Section 498A, 504, 506, 354(A)(B)
of IPC and Section 4 of D.P. Act.
51. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the various judgments for
quashing the criminal proceedings, but those cited judgments depends on the facts and
circumstances of the each case and they are not applicable to the case on hand. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court in case of K. NEELAVENI Vs. STATE BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE AND OTHERS
reported in (2010)11 SCC 607, has held that the High Court cannot quash the charge sheet even
prior the Magistrate examine as to whether the accused persons deserve to be discharged in terms of
Section 239 of Cr.P.C. Paragraph 14 of the said judgment reads as under:
"14. It has to be borne in mind that while considering the application for quashing of
the charge-sheet, the allegations made in the first information report and the
materials collected during the course of the investigation are required to be
considered. Truthfulness or otherwise of the allegation is not fit to be gone into at this
stage as it is always a matter of trial. Essential ceremonies of marriage were gone into
or not is a matter of trial."

52. As regards to the contention raised by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner-
accused No.1 that accused No.1 has filed matrimonial case for divorce against the de-facto
complainant making so many allegations of cruelty and harassment under Section 13(1)(a) of Hindu
Marriage Act on the respondent - de- facto complainant. appeared and she also filed a similar
divorce petition and the family court taken both the matters together. The allegation made by the
petitioner against the respondent - de-facto complainant on the ground of cruelty has not been
challenged and on the other hand, she has accepted the same in M.C. No.5654/2019 and she also
stated no objection for decreeing the divorce petition. Therefore, it is contended when the de-facto
complainant has not disputed the evidence of the petitioner on oath making serious allegations of
cruelty against her in the matrimonial proceedings, therefore, she cannot maintain a case under
Section 498A of IPC against the petitioner, when she has not disputed the allegation made by him in
the matrimonial case, therefore, the criminal proceedings is not sustainable.
53. In this regard, the learned counsel for the respondent - de-facto complainant has objected the
proceedings in the divorce case under the provisions of Section 13(1)(a) of Hindu Marriage Act,
stating that the burden of proving the case is on the preponderance and probabilities of the fact.
Here, in the criminal case, it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and the matrimonial case is
based upon the averments made in the petition for granting divorce, whereas in the criminal case
where serous allegations are made against the accused persons, investigation has been conducted
and charge sheet came to be filed for punishment and the complainant was fed up with the
harassment made by the accused and therefore, she wanted to get rid out of the problems and stated
no objection to grant decree and the accused persons retained all the dowry articles, gold ornaments
etc. in their house, therefore, it is contended that the charge sheet, cannot be quashed.
54. On careful reading of the charge sheet materials, the proceeding in the Family Court, it is an
admitted fact that petitioner-accused No.1 filed divorce petition on the ground of cruelty where the
de-facto complainant also filed another divorce case for granting decree on the ground of cruelty,
but the Family Court has not passed any decree on the admitted facts. However, the cruelty alleged
in the matrimonial case cannot be considered on par with the cruelty defined under Section 498A of
IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Merely, the de-facto complainant has not chosen to
cross examine accused No.1 in matrimonial case and the case was under progress and the Family
Court not yet decided the cruelty alleged by the petitioner No.1. However, the said cannot be used
for the purpose of quashing the charge sheet in this case. If at all the said contention was used by the
petitioner for the purpose of acquittal in the criminal case, but the averments made in the complaint
and the documents in the charge sheet specially witnesses, family members reveals abundant
material placed on record for framing of charge by the trial Court. When there is no material against
the accused and groundless in the charge sheet, then only the court can quash the criminal
proceedings by exercising power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and it shall be considered only in the
rarest of rare cases, the charge sheet can be quashed and not as a matter of routine or as a rule.
55. This Court is aware of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhajanlal's
case, cited supra, and the various judgments regarding quashing of charge sheet in respect of
criminal case. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held when the serious allegations are made, the case
is required for trial and the Court cannot quash the criminal proceedings.

Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
56. Though the learned Senior Counsel has contended that B-final report has been filed by
Jayanagar Police and without referring the B-final report, the charge sheet came to be filed by the
CCB police. But, the said contention can be raised in the trial as a defence.
57. Therefore, I hold that the petitioner has not made out a case for quashing the impugned
notification. The Police Commissioner, being a superior to all the police stations in the Bangalore
city, is empowered to direct any of the police under the Commissionerate for investigating the
matter on the power conferred under the notification dated 25.02.2021. Therefore, referring the
matter by the Police Commissioner to the CCB is in accordance with law. Hence the contention of
the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner is not acceptable.
58. It is also well settled that for issuing process and taking cognizance when the charge sheet is filed
by the police, the Magistrate need not pass a detailed order for issuing process as required under the
private complaint filed by the complainant under Section 200 Cr.P.C. The learned Senior Counsel
for respondent No.3 has relied upon the judgment in the case of PRADEEP S WODEYAR Vs STATE
OF KARNATAKA reported in 2021 SCC Online SC 1140.
59. The same view is taken by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of THE STATE OF GUJARAT
Vs. AFROZ MOHAMMED HASANFATTA reported in (2019)20 SCC 539, where it is held by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court that the Magistrate need not pass a detailed order while taking cognizance
on the charge sheet filed by the police. Therefore, the contention raised by the learned Senior
Counsel for the petitioner that the cognizance taken by the Magistrate is not correct, cannot be
acceptable.
60. Though the learned senior counsel for the petitioners have strenuously contended that CCB
cannot be a police station and various pronouncements of this court has declared CCB is not a police
station, there is no second opinion in this regard that CCB is not a police station and the notification
of the Government says the officers working in the CCB are the Superior Officers of the in- charge of
police station, only for the purpose of investigation and investigating the heinous offences.
Therefore, it cannot be said that CCB is a police station, but the Officers are meant for investigating
the matters and in view of the notification of the State, once they have appointed or identified as
investigatning officers, then they can file the final report/ charge sheet under Section 173 (2) of
Cr.P.C.
61. For the foregoing reasons and on perusal of the records, once the State Government is having
authority under Sections 4 to 7, 11 and 12 of the Karnataka Police Act for appointing the police
officers and establishing the police stations and, once the notification was issued by the State
Government on 25.02.2021 appointing the CCB Police officers as above the rank of police inspector
as superior officer of the police stations in Bangalore city, the CCB police officer who took up
investigation becomes the superior officer of the police station and the investigation report prepared
by him under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C., amounts to a police report as per the provisions of Section
2(r) of Cr.P.C. Therefore, once the police officer of the CCB investigates the matter, it amounts to the
police report under Section 2(r) of Cr.P.C. and the charge sheet filed by him to the Court amounts to
the final report under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. Therefore, the CCB police is empowered to file
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73347011/ 25
Sri. Ditul Mehta vs State Of Karnataka on 13 October, 2023
charge sheet against the accused persons in view of the notification issued by the State Government.
The power of the State Government is defined under the Karnataka Police Act as stated above.
Therefore, there is no flaw in the issuance of notification dated 25.02.2021 and there is no ground
made out for quashing the said notification. Therefore, the writ petition filed by the
petitioner-accused No.1 in W.P. No.11718/2022 is liable to be dismissed.
62. In view of the power exercised under the Karnataka Police Act, the State Government appointed
the Commissioner of Police under Section 7 of the Karnataka Police Act and the Commissioner of
Police by exercising the power under Section 7(2) of the Karnataka Police Act, referred the matter to
the CCB Police for investigation and in turn, the CCB police filed the charge sheet. Once the charge
sheet is filed by the police, the Magistrate need not pass an elaborate order for taking cognizance.
Therefore, the Magistrate has rightly taken cognizance under Section 190 of Cr.P.C. and issued
process to the petitioners- accused, which is in accordance with law. Therefore, when the sufficient
materials are placed on record for framing charges against the petitioners-accused, the petitioners
are required to face trial and it is not a fit case for exercising the power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
for quashing the criminal proceedings. Therefore, Criminal Petition No.2450/2022 filed by the
petitioner-accused Nos.1 to 5 is liable to be dismissed.
63. In view of the above findings, both Criminal Petition No.2450/2022 filed by petitioner-accused
Nos.1 to 5 and Writ Petition No.11718/2022 filed by petitioner- accused No.1 are hereby dismissed.
