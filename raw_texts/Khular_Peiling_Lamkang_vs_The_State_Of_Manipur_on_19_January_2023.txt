Khular Peiling Lamkang vs The State Of Manipur on 19 January, 2023
W.P. (Crl.) No. 29 of 2022 Page 1
ORDER (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] The petitioner assails the order dated 04.10.2022 of the Special Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, subjecting her to preventive detention in exercise of power
under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. She seeks a consequential writ of habeas corpus
to set her at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Ms. Rinika Maibam, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Athouba
Khaidem, learned Government Advocate, appearing for respondents No. 1, 2 & 4; and
Mr. S. Vijayanand Sharma, learned Sr. PCCG, appearing for respondent No. 3.
[3] The main ground of attack urged by Ms. Rinika Maibam, learned counsel, is that
there is unexplained delay in the disposal of the petitioner's representation made
against her detention. The petitioner's representation is dated 11.11.2022 and was
sent to various authorities through the Superintendent, Central Jail, Imphal. The
affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, reflects that the said representation was forwarded to the Home
Department of the State Government by the Inspector General of Prisons, Manipur,
under letter dated 14.11.2022 and was received on 15.11.2022.
Para-wise comments were solicited from the police Department by the Home Department under
letter dated 16.11.2022. Thereupon, the police department submitted its comments/views on
16.12.2022 and acting on the same, the petitioner's representation was rejected after due
consideration, under letter dated 16.12.2022.
W.P. (Crl.) No. 29 of 2022 Page 2
[4] Perusal of the file of the detaining authority produced by Mr. Athouba
Khaidem, learned Government Advocate, reflects that the para-wise comments received from the
police department on 16.12.2022 do not even find place therein. This Court had occasion to
comment earlier also on the sorry state of affairs prevailing in the State of Manipur in so far as the
maintenance of official files is concerned. The case on hand presents another instance of how
shoddily the files of detaining authorities are being maintained.
[5] In any event, the Note-file in the detaining authority's file states that the police department
furnished its views/comments under the letter dated 13.12.2022 of the Superintendent of Police,
Kakching. Significantly, the letter addressed by the Superintendent of Police, Kakching, to the
Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, is annexed to the affidavit-in-opposition filed
by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur. This letter clearly bears the date
16.12.2022 and is a further indication of the carelessness with which the Note- file in the file of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40681880/ 2
Khular Peiling Lamkang vs The State Of Manipur on 19 January, 2023
detaining authority is being maintained, as the date of this letter is wrongly shown therein as
13.12.2022.
[6] However, no explanation has been offered in the affidavit-in- opposition and no explanation is
forthcoming from the file of the detaining authority as to why the police authorities took a month to
send their para-wise comments upon the petitioner's representation.
[7] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme Court
observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to indifference
or any other lapse, such delay would adversely affect further detention of the prisoner.
W.P. (Crl.) No. 29 of 2022 Page 3 According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned
to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the
delay is very short, as even longer delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration
or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that
case was a mere 5 days. [8] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur
[AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground
that there was unexplained delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by
the detenu. [9] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and
others [(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the
Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government
denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the delay by the State
Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and
guarantees granted to a detenu. [10] Though it is laudable that the Government of Manipur is
waging a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug
manufacture, trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its
responsibility to ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the
Constitutional and statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite
this Court stating to this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to
compliance with the prescribed norms.
W.P. (Crl.) No. 29 of 2022 Page 4
[11] The unexplained lethargy on the part of the police authorities in
dealing with the detenu's representation clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on
their part, which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The
same would also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order.
[12] The order of detention dated 04.10.2022 issued by the Special Secretary (Home), Government
of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand
set aside. The petitioner, Mrs. Khular Paileng Lamkang, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central
Jail, Imphal, shall be set at liberty forthwith unless her continued incarceration is validly required in
connection with any other case.

Khular Peiling Lamkang vs The State Of Manipur on 19 January, 2023
WP (Cril.) No. 29 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs. A copy of this order shall be sent to the
Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information and necessary further action in the
context of educating the detaining authorities and the police authorities in the State of Manipur as
to what are the procedural norms that they need to adhere to while exercising power and
jurisdiction under preventive detention laws.
