8. In Cr.W.J.C. No. 540 of 2019, the prayer of the petitioner is to issue a writ in the nature of
certiorari for quashing Sigaudi P.S. Case No. 02 of 2018 registered on 09.01.2018 on the basis of a
written report submitted by the Mines Inspector, Patna alleging therein that the Broad Son
Commodities Pvt. Limited (for short 'Company') was settled sand ghats in Patna district for the
period 2015-2019. Upon inquiry of the monthly report submitted for Chakiya-2, Jarka and Tikul
sand ghats, it appears that excess sand had been excavated than prescribed in the mining plan and
the environment clearance. It has been further alleged that the total quantity of excess mined sand is
76,98,625 cubic feet. The settlee did not perform mining work according to the approved mining
plan and the environment clearance and thereby illegally excavated sand, which is in violation of
Rules 22(2) and 21-A(3) and (4) of the 1972 Rules. He has further alleged that according to Rule
40(8) of the 1972 Rules, the cost of 76,98,625 cubic feet sand at the rate of Rs.7/- per cubic feet =
Rs.5,38,90,375/- is recoverable from the Company. He has further alleged that the petitioner being
one of the directors of the Company and other Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019
dt.26-08-2019 officials have illegally excavated excess sand, which has caused loss to the exchequer
and damage to the environment.

case, investigation has been taken up.

11. Mr. S.B. Upadhyay, learned senior advocate
appearing for the petitioner submitted that from perusal of the contents of the FIR, it
would be evident that the only allegation of the informant is regarding excess mining
of sand in comparison to the limit prescribed in the mining plan and environment
clearance.
He contended that the excess mining is entirely distinct from illegal mining.
According to him, excess mining is not illegal mining. Illegal mining is defined in
Section 2(iia) of Mineral Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019
Concession Rules, 1960 framed under Section 13 of the MMDR Act. He pleaded that
the Company is a valid settlee of the State of Bihar for mining sand in the district of
Patna and, hence, Section 21 of the MMDR Act would not be attracted in case of the
petitioner.
12. Advancing his arguments, Mr. Upadhyay, learned senior advocate submitted that
the jurisdictional Magistrate cannot take cognizance of any offence under the MMDR
Act or the 1972 Rules or 1986 Act in absence of any complaint under Section 200 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'Cr.P.C') filed by a person authorized on
behalf of the Government in view of express legal bar engrafted in the statutory
provisions of the Acts and the Rules under which the petitioner is being prosecuted.
13. As far as allegations made under Section 379 of the IPC is concerned, Mr.
Upadhyay has submitted that since the Company is a valid settlee and has not
dishonestly removed any sand from the sand ghats, the ingredients of Section 379 of
the IPC would not be attracted. He contended that the informant detected the fact of
excess mining from the monthly returns filed by the Company. Had there been any
intention of the Company to commit theft, it would not have reported about the
excess mining in its monthly returns.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019
14. In respect of allegations made under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC, he has submitted that
from perusal of the FIR itself, it would appear that there is no averment about cheating or
fraudulent intention of the petitioner at the time of entering into the contract. Thus, he submitted
that the ingredients of the offences under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC would also not be
attracted.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87509746/ 5
Mithilesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Throught Principal ... on 26 August, 2019
15. Referring to the new sand policy, notification of the State Government hearing 2887 dated
22.07.2014 and work orders in different calendar years, he has submitted that it has been provided
that in case the Company excavates sand in excess, it shall be liable to pay royalty.
16. Lastly, he has submitted that the IPC does not provide for vicarious liability upon the director of
the Company for any of the offences alleged to be committed by the Company. In absence of the
Company having been impleaded as an accused, the petitioner cannot be charged and put on trial
for the offences punishable under the Penal Code.
17. Per contra, Mr. Gyan Prakash Ojha, learned advocate appearing for the State submitted that the
allegations made in the FIR would clearly attract the ingredients of the offences alleged. The
petitioner has admitted that the Company has excavated more Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of
2019 dt.26-08-2019 sand from the respective sand ghats, which is in violation of terms and
conditions of the agreement. He submitted that since it is also a case of theft of State revenue, the
petitioner being one of the directors of the Company in whose favour settlements of sand ghats were
made is liable to be prosecuted. He argued that the petitioner cannot take a plea of vicarious liability
as he had actively participated in the excavation of excess sand from the sand ghats. According to
him, it is the petitioner, who was the executive agent of the Company for the purposes of excavation
of sand. He pleaded that though the petitioner has obtained environment clearance and was allowed
to excavate the sand and there was capping limit per month for excavation of sand ghats, after
verification of monthly returns filed by the petitioner, it was found that the Company had crossed
the environment clearance capping limit. He urged that since the investigation into a cognizable
offence is going on, it would not be proper to interdict the FIR at the stage of investigation.
18. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos. 8 and 9, it is stated that the
Company was given lease for a period of five years on calendar year basis in terms of excavation
limits from the rivers of the district. It was allowed to carry on its mining activities except during the
ban period round Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 the calendar year and
was also allowed to excavate the permitted level of capping limit per annum as per environment
clearance given by the concerned authority.
19. Ms Kalpana, learned advocate appearing for the respondent nos. 8 and 9 submitted that since
the Company violated the terms and conditions of the capping limit of environmental clearance, a
case for prosecution is made out. She submitted that the investigation would reveal the correct facts.
According to her also, since the allegations made in the FIR do attract the ingredients of a
cognizable offence, it would not be proper for this Court to consider the case of the petitioner on
merit. She has urged that as the Company, being juristic person has violated the terms and
conditions of the licence granted for excavation of sand, there is no illegality in institution of the FIR
against the petitioner, who was the executing agent-cum-director of the Company.
20. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and carefully perused the record, I find that in the
year 2014 pursuant to a tender floated by the State of Bihar for settlement of sand ghats, the
Company was the highest bidder in the district of Patna. Vide letter no. 961 dated 31.12.2014, a work
order was issued in favour of the Company for mining activity on the sand ghats in the district of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87509746/ 6
Mithilesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Throught Principal ... on 26 August, 2019
Patna. Thereafter, individual agreement was executed in Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019
dt.26-08-2019 the month of December, 2014 between the Company and the District
Magistrate-cum-Collector, Patna. Upon monthly returns submitted by the petitioner, the Mining
Inspector, Patna lodged Sigaudi P.S. Case No. 02 of 2018 under various provisions of the Acts and
the rules referred to above.
21. From perusal of the contents of the FIR, it would be manifest that the only allegation of the
informant is regarding excess mining of sand.
22. Clause 3(vii) of Appendix-1 of the new sand policy and Clause 5 of Appendix 2 of the said policy,
as contained in Annexure-1 to the present application, provides that in case the settlee excavates
sand in excess to the settlement amount then it shall pay royalty for the excess quantity of sand
excavated.
23. Further, notification no. 2887 dated 22.07.2014 at Appendix 2 Clause 6(vii), as contained in
Annexure-2 to the present application provides that in case the royalty of the sand excavated in any
year is in excess to the settlement amount then excess royalty shall be paid by the settlee.
24. In the work orders for the calendar year 2015 at clause 11(xv) (Annexure-4) for the calendar year
2016 at clause 11(xiv) (Annexure-6), for the calendar year 2017 at clause 11(xiv), for the calendar
year 2018 at clause 18(xiv) and for the calendar Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019
dt.26-08-2019 year 2019 at clause 15(xiv) (Annexure-12), it has been provided that in case the
settlee excavates sand in excess of the settlement amount, it shall be liable to pay the royalty for the
excess sand so excavated.
25. Even in the agreement of the calendar years 2015 and 2016, as contained in Annexures-5 and 7
to this application, at Part III Clause 22, it is provided that "Settlee shall have to pay extra royalty in
case he/they extract/mine sand excess to the bid amount in that calendar year".
26. Rule 26(b) of the 1972 Rules lays down that royalty shall be charged at the rates specified in
Schedule II. For mining of sand, Schedule II prescribes the auctioned amount as the chargeable rate
and Note II of Schedule II lays down that "the settlee shall pay the extra Royalty for the excess
quantity of extracted and dispatched sand more than the equivalent action amount".
27. Neither the Sand Policy, 2013 nor the notification no. 2887 dated 22.07.2014 nor the work
orders and agreements nor the Acts and the rules penalizes excess mining in any manner. It has
specifically been stated in the sand policy, work orders, agreements and the relevant Acts and the
rules that the excess mining shall be treated to be violation of the agreement or the Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 terms of the licence. The 1972 Rules do not
categorize excess mining an offence. Thus, it would be evident that for mining in excess, the settlee
shall be liable to pay excess royalty.
28. It has rightly been contended on behalf of the petitioner that excess mining unlike illegal mining
is a civil wrong. It is not an illegal mining.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87509746/ 7
Mithilesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Throught Principal ... on 26 August, 2019
29. Illegal mining is defined in Section 2(iia) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 framed in
exercise of powers conferred by Section 13 of the MMDR Act as under :-
"2(ii-a) "illegal mining" means any reconnaissance or prospecting or mining operation undertaken
by any person or a company in any area without holding a reconnaissance permit or a prospecting
licence or as the case may be, a mining lease as required under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the
Act."
30. It is not the case of the informant that mining operation was carried out by the Company
without permit. Hence, it cannot be said that the Company indulged in illegal mining.
31. Section 21 of the MMDR Act prescribes punishment for violation of Section 4(1) and 4(1-A),
which prohibit mining activity except in accordance with the valid licence. It penalizes mining
activity by a person, who does not have any licence. Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019
dt.26-08-2019
32. In the instant case, admitted case of the prosecution is that the Company is a valid
settlee/licensee of the State of Bihar for mining sand in the district of Patna. Hence, offence
punishable under Section 21 of the MMDR Act would not be attracted.
33. Section 22 of the MMDR Act reads as under :-
"22. Cognizance of offences.--No court shall take cognizance of any offence
punishable under this Act or any rules made thereunder except upon complaint in
writing made by a person authorised in this behalf by the Central Government or the
State Government."
34. A similar provision is contained under Rule 41 of the Rules of 1972, which reads as under :-
"41. Offence cognizable upon written complaints. - No Court inferior to that of a
Magistrate of the First Class shall try any offence punishable under these rules and no
Court shall take cognizance of any offence under these rules, except upon a complaint
made in writing by the [Competent Officer or Deputy Director of Mines or Additional
Director of Mines or Director of Mines] or any other Officer empowered by the
Government".
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019
35. In the instant case, the FIR has been registered by the Mines Inspector contrary to the
requirements of Section 22 of the MMDR Act and Rule 41 of the 1972 Rules.
36. For the offence alleging violation of any provisions of the MMDR Act or any rules made
thereunder, an FIR cannot be instituted rather a complaint in writing has to be made by a person
authorized in this behalf.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87509746/ 8
Mithilesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Throught Principal ... on 26 August, 2019
37. The word 'complaint' has not been defined in MMDR Act or the rules framed thereunder. In
absence of any definition of 'complaint' in the MMDR Act or the rules made thereunder, one has to
look to the definition of 'complaint' given in the Cr.P.C.
38. Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C defines 'complaint' as under :-
"2(d) "complaint" means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate,
with a view to his taking action under this Code, that some person, whether known or
unknown, has committed an offence, but does not include a police report."
39. In view of the definition of the complaint in Section 2(d) of the Cr.P.C, there cannot be any doubt
that an FIR cannot be treated as a complaint. The moment an FIR is instituted in respect Patna
High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 of an offence, it is required that the same be
investigated upon and once the investigation is completed, the report is required to be submitted
before the court under Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. The police report submitted under Section
173(2) of the Cr.P.C cannot be treated as a complaint. Thus, it would be evident that Section 22 of
the MMDR Act puts restriction on the court to take cognizance of an offence punishable under the
MMDR Act or the rules made thereunder except on a written complaint made by a person
authorized in this behalf by the State Government or the Central Government.
40. Similarly, Rule 41 of the 1972 Rules puts a restriction on the court to take cognizance of any
offence under the said rules except upon a complaint. In other words, it can be said that the
jurisdictional court can take cognizance of any offence under the MMDR Act or the rules made
thereunder only upon a written complaint under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C filed by a person
authorized in this behalf.
41. Hence, even if the allegations made in the FIR are accepted to be true, the police could not
register an FIR in respect of the offences punishable under the MMDR Act or the rules made
thereunder.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019
42. As far as the offence punishable under Section 379 of the IPC is concerned, an argument has
been advanced on behalf of the petitioner that in absence of any allegation that the Company
excavated sand in a clandestine manner with an intent to remove mineral dishonestly, the offence
punishable under Section 379 of the IPC would not be attracted against it. In support, reliance has
been placed on the decision of the Suprem Court in State (NCT of Delhi) Vs. Sanjay, since reported
in (2014) 9 SCC 772.
43. In State (NCT of Delhi) Vs. Sanjay (Supra), the Supreme Court observed as under :-
"71. However, there may be situation where a person without any lease or licence or
any authority enters into river and extracts sands, gravels and other minerals and
remove or transport those minerals in a clandestine manner with an intent to remove
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87509746/ 9
Mithilesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Throught Principal ... on 26 August, 2019
dishonestly those minerals from the possession of the State, is laible to be punished
for committing such offence under Sections 378 and 379 of the Indian Penal Code.
72. From a close reading of the provisions of the MMDR Act and the offence defined
under Section 378 IPC, it is manifest that the ingredients constituting the offence are
different. The contravention of terms and conditions of mining lease or doing mining
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 activity in violation of
Section 4 of the Act is an offence punishable under Section 21 of the MMDR Act,
whereas dishonestly removing sand, gravel and other minerals from the river, which
is the property of the State, out of the State's possession without the consent,
constitute an offence of theft. Hence, merely because initiation of proceeding for
commission of an offence under the MMDR Act on the basis of complaint cannot and
shall not debar the police from taking action against persons for committing theft of
sand and minerals in the manner mentioned above by exercising power under the
Code of Criminal Procedure and submit a report before the Magistrate for taking
cognizance against such persons. In other words, in a case where there is a theft of
sand and gravel from the government land, the police can register a case, investigate
the same and submit a final report under Section 173 CrPC before a Magistrate
having jurisdiction for the purpose of taking cognizance as provided in Section
190(1)(d) of the Code of Criminal Procedure."
(emphasis mine)
43. Thus, it would be evidentfrom the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in State (NCT of Delhi)
Vs. Sanjay (Supra), that in case a person without any lease or licence or any authority Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 extracts minerals in a clandestine manner with an
intent to remove dishonestly from the possession of the State, the ingredients of the offence
punishable under Section 379 of the IPC would be attracted. But, if the person having valid licence
or lease or authority excavates minerals in excess of the quantity for which permission is granted, it
cannot be said that the ingredients of the offence punishable under Section 379 of the IPC is
attracted.
44. In so far as the offences under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC are concerned, since the
petitioner is a valid licensee, it cannot be said that there was an intention to cheat right from the
beginning. The petitioner was filing his returns and on the basis of returns filed by him, the
informant came to know that the Company had excavated sand in excess to the permissible limit.
Thus, in absence of any mens rea as also any dishonest intention to cheat right from the beginning,
the ingredients of the offences punishable under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC would also not be
attracted.
45. That apart, it has rightly been contended that concept of vicarious liability is unknown to
criminal law. IPC does not provide for vicarious liability upon the directors of the company for any
offence alleged to be committed by a company. In absence of company having been impleaded as an
accused, the petitioner Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 cannot be charged

and put on trial for the offence punishable under the IPC.
46. In S.K. Alagh Vs. State of U.P., since reported in (2008) 5 SCC 662, the Supreme Court observed
as under :-
"The Penal Code, save and except some provisions specifically providing therefor,
does not contemplate any vicarious liability on the part of a party who is not charged
directly for commission of an offence."
47. In the FIR, there is no specific allegation against the petitioner. The allegation of excess mining
is against the Company. The Company has not been made an accused in the case. In that view of the
matter also, the petitioner cannot be prosecuted for any of the offences punishable under the IPC.
48. Another Section under which the FIR has been instituted is Section 15 of the 1986 Act, which
reads as under :-
"15. Penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Act and the rules, orders and
directions.--(1) Whoever fails to comply with or contravenes any of the provisions of
this Act, or the rules made or orders or directions issued thereunder, shall, in respect
of each such failure or contravention, be punishable with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to five years or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or
with both, and in Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 case the
failure or contravention continues, with additional fine which may extend to five
thousand rupees for every day during which such failure or contravention continues
after the conviction for the first such failure or contravention. (2) If the failure or
contravention referred to in sub-section (1) continues beyond a period of one year
after the date of conviction, the offender shall be punishable with imprisonment for a
term which may extend to seven years.
49. Section 19 of the 1986 Act provides for taking cognizance of the offences under the Act, which
reads as under :
"19. Cognizance of offences.--No court shall take cognizance of any offence under this
Act except on a complaint made by--
(a) the Central Government or any authority or officer authorised in this behalf by
that Government; or
(b) any person who has given notice of not less than sixty days, in the manner
prescribed, of the alleged offence and of his intention to make a complaint, to the
Central Government or the authority or officer authorised as aforesaid."
50. In exercise of power conferred under clause (a) of Section 19 of the 1986 Act, the Central
Government has authorized the Government of the State (represented by the Secretary to the State

Government, Chairman or Principal Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019
Secretary of the State Board for the prevention and control of water, pollution constituted under
Section 4 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (6 of 1974) or a State Board
for the prevention and control of air pollution constituted under Section 5 of the Air (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 (14 of 1981) for the whole of the State of Bihar and the water in the
whole of the district while Standing Order 394(e) dated 16th March, 1987.
51. In the instant case, the informant is the Mining Inspector. Apart from the fact that no complaint
as mandated under Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act has been lodged, the informant a
Mining Inspector is not the officer authorized for the purpose of Section 19(a) of the Act.
52. In view of the restrictions imposed on the court to take cognizance of an offence except on a
complaint made by the Central Government or any authority or officer authorized or any person,
who has given notice of not less than 60 days under Section 19 of the 1986 Act, institution of the FIR
in question under Section 15 of the 1986 Act is patently bad in law.
53. In view of the discussions made above, it would be apparent that in a case where mining
activities were being carried out in violation of the mining plan or environment clearance, Patna
High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019 prosecution could have been launched only by
way of filing complaint in accordance with law and not otherwise. In a case instituted before the
police under Section 154 of the Cr.P.C, the jurisdictional Magistrate cannot take cognizance of the
offence. Since the MMDR Act and the rules made thereunder as also the 1986 Rules are special
statutes, in view of sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Cr.P.C there cannot be any manner of doubt
whatsoever that the provisions prescribed under the special statute shall prevail over the provisions
of the Cr.P.C. It is well settled position in law that if a special statute lays down a procedure, the
procedure laid down under the general statute shall not be followed.
54. Since the present FIR is against express legal bar created by the MMDR Act, 1972 Rules and the
1986 Rules and none of the ingredients of the offences under the Indian Penal Code are attracted, in
the opinion of this Court, allowing the prosecutions to continue would amount to an abuse of the
process of the court.
55. Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed. The FIRs of Sigaudi P.S. Case No. 02 of 2018,
Bhagwanganj P.S. Case No. 02 of 2018, Dhanarua P.S. Case No. 07 of 2018 and Naubatpur P.S. Case
No. 07 of 2018 are hereby quashed.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.540 of 2019 dt.26-08-2019
56. It is made clear that this Court has not adjudicated upon the issue of civil liability arising out of
excess mining of sand by the petitioner. Any of the observations made in these cases would have no
consequence in any proceedings, which may arise between the parties in respect of civil liability.
