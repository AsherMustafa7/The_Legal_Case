HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
?Neutral Citation No. - 2025:AHC:68851
Court No. - 87
Case :- APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 18862 of 2016
Applicant :- Vinod Kumar And 2 Others
Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another
Counsel for Applicant :- Satya Prakash,Sunil Kumar Srivastava
Counsel for Opposite Party :- Avinash Pandey,G.A.
Hon'ble Prashant Kumar,J.
1. Heard Sri Satya Prakash, learned counsel for the applicants, Sri Shashi Dhar Pandey, learned
A.G.A. for the State-Opposite Party No.1, and Sri Avinash Pandey, learned counsel for Opposite
Party No.2, and perused the material on record.
2. The present application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed for quashing of the summoning
order dated 14-10-2015 as well as proceedings of Complaint Case No. 63 of 2015, under Sections
498A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, P.S. Gagalhedi, district Saharanpur.
3. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicants that the F.I.R. has been lodged falsely by
Opposite Party No.2 with an oblique motive to harass not only her husband (applicant No.1), but
also the other family members, namely applicant nos.2 and 3, who have no direct involvement in the
matrimonial affairs. It is pointed out that no specific role has been attributed to applicant nos.2 and
3, and the allegations levelled against them are general and omnibus in nature. It is contended that

Vinod Kumar And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
continuation of proceedings against them would amount to abuse of the process of law. To buttress
his arguments, he has placed reliance upon a judgement passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
matter of Sushila Devi v. State of U.P. & Anr., 2025 INSC 505 and Geeta Mehrotra & Another v.
State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr., 2012 (10) SCC 741.
4. Per contra, learned counsel for Opposite Party No.2 submits that, in so far as applicant no.1
(husband) is concerned, the allegations against him are specific and are duly supported by the
statement of the complainant and other witnesses recorded during investigation. Hence, prima facie
a cognizable offence is made out against applicant no.1.
5. Heard rival submissions advanced on behalf of both the sides and perused the record.
6. A perusal of the complaint and the accompanying documents clearly indicates that the Opposite
Party No.2 has sought to implicate the entire family of her husband, including Pawan Kumar
(Dewar) and Smt. Sangeeta (Devrani). It appears to be a classic case of over-implication with the
intention to exert undue pressure on the husband by roping in his entire family.
7. From the statements recorded under Sections 200 and 202 Cr.P.C., it emerges that a prima facie
case is made out against applicant no.1, the husband of the complainant. Therefore, the prayer for
quashing of proceedings against him is liable to be rejected.
8. Accordingly, the instant application qua applicant no.1-Vinod Kumar (husband) is dismissed.
9. However, on careful examination of the record, this Court finds force in the submissions made on
behalf of applicant nos.2 and 3. The allegations against them are vague, general, and lacking in
specific details. Even the statements recorded under Sections 200 and 202 Cr.P.C. do not disclose
any specific role or overt act attributable to them.
10. In the matter of Geeta Mehrotra (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:-
"25. However, we deem it appropriate to add by way of caution that we may not be
misunderstood so as to infer that even if there are allegations of overt act indicating
the complicity of the members of the family named in the FIR in a given case,
cognizance would be unjustified but what we wish to emphasize by highlighting is
that, if the FIR as it stands does not disclose specific allegation against accused more
so against the co-accused specially in a matter arising out of matrimonial bickering, it
would be clear abuse of the legal and judicial process to mechanically send the named
accused in the FIR to undergo the trial unless of course the FIR discloses specific
allegations which would persuade the court to take cognizance of the offence alleged
against the relatives of the main accused who are prima facie not found to have
indulged in physical and mental torture of the complainant-wife. It is the well settled
principle laid down in cases too numerous to mention, that if the FIR did not disclose
the commission of an offence, the court would be justified in quashing the
proceedings preventing the abuse of the process of law. Simultaneously, the courts

Vinod Kumar And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
are expected to adopt a cautious approach in matters of quashing specially in cases of
matrimonial dispute whether the FIR in fact discloses commission of an offence by
the relatives of the principal accused or the FIR prima facie discloses a case of
over-implication by involving the entire family of the accused at the instance of the
complainant, who is out to settle her scores arising out of the teething problem or
skirmish of domestic bickering while settling down in her new matrimonial
surrounding."
10. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has further held that if the contents of the FIR do not disclose
specific allegation against the relatives of the husband except casual reference to their names, it
would not be just to direct them to suffer the ordeal of facing criminal trial pending against them
specially when the FIR does not disclose ingredients of offences under Sections 498A 323, 504 IPC
read with Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.
11. Furthermore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in number of cases has reiterated the importance of
preventing the abuse of the legal and judicial process in matrimonial disputes. The court
emphasized that if the FIR fails to disclose specific allegations against the family members of
husband, especially in matters of matrimonial bickering, it would be an abuse of the legal and
judicial process to mechanically subject the named accused to trial. This principle is applicable to
the present case, where the allegations against the applicant are vague and general in nature, lacking
specific instances of wrongdoing. By quashing the criminal proceedings against the applicants, the
court ensures that the legal process is not misused to harass individuals based on unsubstantiated
accusations, thus upholding the principles of justice and fairness.
12. Since in the instant matter, there is no specific averments against the applicants no.2 and 3, who
are family members of husband of the O.P. no.2, hence, following the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the present application
stands allowed and the entire proceedings of Complaint Case No. 63 of 2015, under Sections 498A,
323, 504, 506 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, P.S. Gagalhedi, district Saharanpurare hereby quashed.
