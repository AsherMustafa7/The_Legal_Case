ORDER
This writ petition has been filed for issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to
correct the date of birth of the petitioner in the Secondary School Leaving Certificate and the Higher
Secondary Course Certificate.
2.The case of the petitioner is that, she was born on 11.12.1999 and the same was duly registered on
20.12.1999 which is clearly evident from the copy of the birth certificate that has been filed before
this Court.
At the point of admission in the School, her parents had given the date of birth as 11.06.1999 instead
of 11.12.1999. The petitioner did not notice this mistake till she completed her graduation. The
petitioner was making arrangements to apply for passport and only at that point of time, the
petitioner came to know about the mistake that had crept in the School records. The petitioner
thereafter, made a representation to the respondents to correct the date of birth in the school
certificates. Since no action was taken by the respondents, the present writ petition has been filed
before this Court seeking for appropriate directions.

3.When the matter was taken up for admission, this Court questioned the learned counsel for the
petitioner as to how the respondents can make such corrections after the course is completed. In
reply to the same, the learned counsel brought to the notice of this Court a series of judgments
passed by this Court on the same issue, wherein, this Court had directed the correction of date of
birth. The learned counsel specifically relied upon the judgment of this Court in W.P.No.23716 of
2014 dated 03.03.2015. The relevant portions in the judgment are extracted hereunder:
5.The very same issue came up for consideration before this Curt in W.P.(MD)
No.9340 of 2009 dated 18.09.2012. An identical prayer was made to rectify the date
of birth in the petitioner's service records. The respondent Government took a stand
that in view of Rule 5 of the Tamil Nadu Secondary School Certificate Rules, the
request for correction of date of birth cannot be considered after the pupil have left
the school. This Court after elaborately considered the Government Orders and
taking note of other decisions on the point, allowed the Writ Petition and directed the
respondent to consider the birth extracts and http://www.judis.nic.in other records
of the petitioner while considering his representation and making necessary changes
in the date of birth as in the Secondary grade School Leaving Certificate and Higher
Secondary grade School Leaving Certificate and other certificates. The petitioner
therein was given liberty to make representation to the respondents along with the
copy of the order. At this stage it would be beneficial to refer to the operative portion

of the order.
“27.The Tamil Nadu Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, 2000 have come into force with effect
from 01.01.2000. Rule 11, deals with the correction or cancellation of entry in the register of births
and deaths under Section 15 and that the same is extracted hereunder:
"11.Correction or cancellation of entry in the register of births and deaths under
Section 15:(1)If it is reported to the Registrar that a clerical or formal error has been
made in the register or if such error is otherwise noticed by him and if the register is
in his possession, the Registrar shall enquire into the matter and if he is satisfied that
any such error has been made, he shall correct the error (by correcting or cancelign
the entry) as provided in section http://www.judis.nic.in 15 and shall in the case of
local authorities specified in column (1) of the Table below, send an extract of the
entry showing the error and how it has been corrected to the officer specified in
column (2) thereof.
Local Authorities(1) Officers(2) Village Panchayat Village Panchayat President Town

Maullisha N.Y vs The Director Of Government ... on 10 March, 2020
28.Reading of the statutory provisions makes it clear that the Act provides for correction or
cancellation of entry in the register of births and deaths. The decision relied on by the respondents
in their counter affidavit rendered in W.P.No.4244 of 1965, dated 26.10.1965 and reported in 1966
MLJ 80, is prior to the introduction of Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 and the rules
framed thereunder.
29.Subsidiary Rule 5 of the Secondary School Leaving Certificate scheme, relied on by the
respondents to contend that the application for alteration in the date of birth will not be entertained
after a pupil had completed his course or appeared for the S.S.L.C public examination also is much
earlier to the advent of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 and the rules framed
thereunder. Needless to say that the provisions of any Central Act, will prevail over the State Act or
the rules or regulations, framed by the latter, on the same subject. When the statutory provisions
stated supra, enable the competent authorities under http://www.judis.nic.in the Registration of
Births and Deaths Act, 1969, to make correction or cancellation as the case may be, the contention of
the respondents that no alteration is permissible in the school records, after the student leaves the
secondary education cannot be countenanced.
30.As stated supra, as per the birth certificate issued by the Sub Registrar, Thiruvattar enclosed in
the typed set of papers, the name of the child entered in the said certificate is S.Rajesh Kumar. The
date of birth has been shown as 19.01.1975. When the statute provides for correction or cancellation
of an entry in the register of births and deaths maintained by the Sub Registrar after coming into
force of the Act, the said certificate can be relied on for making necessary changes in public records
which includes the records maintained in the office of the Director of Government Examinations
Chennai. The contention of the respondents that the said correction can be made only before the
student leaves the school and not later, cannot be accepted for the reason that any entry in the birth
certificate by virtue of registration or http://www.judis.nic.in alteration or cancellation by the
competent authority under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969, has to be given effect to
otherwise, the purpose for registration or alteration or modification would be defeated. There
cannot be different entries in the public records maintained by different authorities, one under the
Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 and the other by the educational authorities. The date of
birth as entered in the birth extract has to be entered in all the public records uniformly, unless and
until any statutory rules, restrict such entry, like in the case of a Government servant, governed by
the Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Services Rules. In the light of the above discussion, this
Court is not inclined to accept the objections of the educational authorities made on the basis of the
Subsidiary rules framed before the introduction of the Central Act, 1969.
31.In the light of the decision made in W.P.No.9800 of 2009, dated 21.10.2009 in R.Deepak Vs.The
Chairman Tamil Nadu Uniform Service Recruitment Board, Chennai and two others, the certificate
issued by the http://www.judis.nic.in competent authority under Registration of Births and Deaths
Act, 1969, and other supporting documents relied on by the present writ petitioner has to be
considered.
32.For the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is allowed. There shall be a direction to the
respondents to consider the birth extract and other evidence produced by the petitioner while
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/115666658/ 4
Maullisha N.Y vs The Director Of Government ... on 10 March, 2020
considering his representation, dated 03.09.2009 and make necessary changes, in the date of birth
as 19.01.1975 in the Secondary School Leaving Certificate and the Higher Secondary Course and
other certificates. The petitioner is at liberty to make a representation to the respondents along with
a copy of this order and that he shall produce the original certificates for making necessary
corrections. No costs.
6.The decision referred supra is squarely applicable to the facts of the case on hand and in the
instant case, the only ground for rejection is that the petitioner cannot seek for alteration of School
Certificates after he has completed the studies. Since similar issue has already been decided by this
Court, this Writ Petition has to be necessarily allowed. http://www.judis.nic.in
4.The learned Government Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that Rule 5
of the Tamil Nadu Secondary School Certificate Rules prohibits such alteration of date of birth after
the candidate leaves the school and therefore, it will be beyond the jurisdiction of the respondents to
make such corrections in the School Leaving Certificate.
5.The objections that have been raised by the learned Government Advocate, have been answered in
the judgment that has been cited supra.
Apart from the above judgment, this Court is taking a very consistent view that, after coming into
the force of the Tamil Nadu Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, 2000 w.e.f. 01.01.2000, such
corrections can be carried out in the school records when they are found to be in variance with the
birth certificate issued by the competent authority.
6.The judgment that has been cited supra will squarely apply to the facts of the present case.
http://www.judis.nic.in
7.In view of the above, there shall be a direction to the respondents to consider the birth certificate
of the petitioner and any other documents produced by the petitioner and deal with the
representations made by the petitioner on 07.06.2019 and 27.01.2020 and make necessary changes
in the date of birth as 11.12.1999 in the Secondary School Leaving Certificate and the Higher
Secondary Course Certificate. The petitioner is directed to make a fresh representation to the
respondents along with a copy of the representations dated 07.06.2019 and 27.01.2020 and a copy
of this order. This exercise shall be completed by the respondents within a period of four weeks from
the date of receipt of copy of this order.
8.This writ petition is disposed of with the above directions. No Costs.
