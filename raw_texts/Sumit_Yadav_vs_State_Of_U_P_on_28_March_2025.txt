were made but actually applicant is himself victim.
6. He next submits that actually applicant was an unemployed youth and some unknown person
approached him with regard to the job and he also told the applicant that you will have to open a
bank account and thereafter, applicant opened Account No. 110117329358 in Canara Bank and on
the instructions of unknown person, he also linked his bank account number with the mobile
number provided by the unknown person but when subsequently in November, 2024 applicant
came to know that some transactions were made from his bank account then he immediately on
7.4.2025 moved an application before In-charge Cyber Cell Officer, Mau alongwith his affidavit
which has been annexed at page 152 of the paper book. He further submitted that above application
and affidavit were filed by the applicant before lodgement of the FIR of the present case and this fact
shows his innocence.
7. He further submitted that apart from the present case, applicant is having no criminal history and
therefore, it cannot be said that he is the member of any crime syndicate and there is no material
available on record, on the basis of which it can be said that he committed the offence of organized
crime.
8. He further submitted that applicant has a very good academic record and he is appearing for
competitive examination and by implicating him in the present matter, his entire career has been
ruined.
9. He further submitted that applicant is in jail in the present matter since 22.1.2025.
10. Per contra, learned AGA opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that bank account number of
the applicant was used and huge transaction was made from his account therefore, it cannot be said
that he is innocent. However, he could not dispute the fact that FIR of the present case was lodged
on 21.1.2025 and before lodgement of the FIR on 7.12.2024, applicant himself moved an application
to the In-charge Cyber Cell, Mau alongwith his affidavit that his bank account is being misused.
11. He further could not dispute the fact that applicant is not having any previous criminal history
and in the present matter, applicant is in jail since 22.1.2025
12. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record of the case.
13. However, as per allegation applicant alongwith other accused persons indulged in the offence of
cyber crime and from his bank account, transactions of Rs. 34.73 lacs were also made from May,
2023 to October, 2023 but it appears, before lodgement of the FIR of the present case, he on
7.12.2024 moved an application alongwith his affidavit before In-charge Cyber Cell, Mau. The
affidavit filed by the applicant alongwith the application dated 7.12.2024 has been annexed
alongwith the instant bail application and genuineness of the same has not been controverted by
learned AGA during the course of argument. Considering the affidavit filed by the applicant dated
7.12.2024, the argument advanced by learned counsel for the applicant with regard to the innocence
of the applicant, cannot be completely brushed aside at this stage.

applicant.
15. Further, applicant is having no previous criminal history and in the present matter, he is in jail
