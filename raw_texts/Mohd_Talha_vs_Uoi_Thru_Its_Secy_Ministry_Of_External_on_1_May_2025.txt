Hon'ble Om Prakash Shukla,J.
(Per : Om Prakash Shukla, J.) (1) Heard learned Counsel for the petitioner, Shri S.B. Pandey,
learned Senior Advocate/D.S.G.I. assisted by Shri Varun Pandey, learned Counsel for Union of India
and learned Standing Counsel for the State.
(2) The petitioner has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking writ of mandamus directing
the opposite party No.2-Regional Passport Officer, Regional Passport Office, Gomti Nagar,
Lucknow, for issuance of passport to him as per the notification dated 25.08.1993 issued by the
Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi.
(3) Shorn of unnecessary details, it is borne from the writ petition that the petitioner, a practicing
Advocate of this Court, had applied for issuance of fresh passport vide Application
No.LK3069688351424, wherein certain adverse report was submitted by the concerned police to the
Passport Officer relating to pendency of two criminal case against the petitioner. Two criminal cases
as stated in the writ petition being (i) Case Crime No. 113/13 under Sections
147/504/506/507/354/354D IPC and (ii) Case Crime No. 123/11 under Sections 323/504/ 506 IPC.
(4) It is the case of the petitioner that as an under trial, he filed an application in Case Crime No.
113/13 before the Court of ACJM, CBI (A), Lucknow on 05.06.2024, which came to be disposed of
vide order dated 30.07.2024 on the grounds that there is no need to take permission from the trial
Court for obtaining Passport in view of judgment dated 25.06.2024 rendered by a Co-ordinate
Bench in Writ-C No. 5587 of 2024 : Umapati Vs. Union of India and 3 others. As far as the other
criminal case, bearing Case Crime No. 123/11, is concerned, the petitioner has enclosed a copy of the
report submitted by Sub-Inspector, Police Station Chowk, Lucknow to the Court of ACJM, CBI (AP)
as Annexure No.4, whereby the Sub-Inspector, Police Station Chowk, Lucknow reported to the
Court of ACJM, CBI (AP) that in Case Crime No. 123 of 2011, the then Investigating Officer had
forwarded/submitted Final Report No. 45 dated 16.07.2011 to the Court concerned.
(5) It appears that the petitioner armed with the aforesaid orders approached the opposite party
No.2-Regional Passport Officer, whereupon he was advised that verification would be done of the
said orders by the concerned police and the Regional Passport Officer would act accordingly.
(6) In the aforesaid background, it is the grievance of the petitioner that since no passport has been
issued to him, a direction may be given to the concerned authority for that said purpose and as such
has relied on the Notification of the Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi dated 25.08.1993.
(7) According to the learned Counsel for the petitioner, since the trial Court has rejected his prayer
for grant of NOC vide order dated 25.06.2024 on the ground that as per judgment in Umapati
(supra), there is no requirement of prior permission from the trial Court for issuance/renewal of
passport, as such, there was no occasion for the opposite party no.2-Regional Passport Officer not to
renew/re-issue him Passport as per the prevailing notification.

(8) Per contra, Shri S.B. Pandey, learned D.S.G.I. has stated that on a plain reading of the judgment
passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Umapati's case, it is apparent that the said decision
has not noted any of earlier judgments passed by Co-ordinate Benches of this Court relating to
similar issue nor the Notifications of the Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi dated 25.08.1993
and Office Memo dated 10.10.2019 issued by the Government of India under Section 22 of the
Passport Act, 1967, which it appears were not brought to the notice of the said Co-ordinate Bench.
(9) Shri Pandey also invited our attention to earlier decisions of this Court such as decision dated
20.11.2018 passed in Writ Petition No.31723 (M/B) of 2018 'Salim Kumar vs. Union of India & Ors.'
wherein this aspect as also GSR 570(E) dated 25.08.1993 was taken into consideration as also
decision of Delhi High Court and thereafter, direction was issued to the petitioner to move an
appropriate application before the court of criminal jurisdiction where the trial was pending against
him seeking permission to go abroad. Consequential direction was also issued for consideration of
issuance of passport if such permission is granted by the court below. He has also placed before us
another Division Bench judgment dated 03.12.2022 rendered in Writ-C No.8621 of 2022 'Shiv
Shankar vs. Union of India & Ors.' wherein similar view has been taken after considering the
Notification dated 25.08.1993 and 10.10.2019 as also provisions of the Passport Act, 1967. He has
also referred to a similar decision dated 21.06.2022 rendered in Writ-C No.3617 of 2022 by Division
Bench of this Court in the case of 'Smt. Rashmi Kapoor vs. Union of India & Ors.' wherein also law
has been elucidated and directions have been issued accordingly in a case where criminal cases were
pending and passport was not being issued. He has also referred to a recent decision dated
21.10.2024 rendered by Division Bench of which one of us (Hon'ble Rajan Roy, J.) was a member in
Writ-C No.8874 of 2024 : Shah Alam vs. Union of India & Ors.' on the same subject and he has then
referred to the judgment dated 25.06.2024 rendered by a Co-ordinate Bench in Writ-C No.5587 of
2024 'Umapati vs. Union of India & Ors.' wherein it has been held that there is no provision in the
Passport Act requiring any permission to be taken from the court of criminal jurisdiction where the
criminal trial are pending for issuance of a passport and a direction has been issued to the Passport
Officer to take a decision on the application of the petitioner. The submission is that this judgment
dated 25.06.2024 has been rendered in ignorance of and without considering earlier judgments on
the same subject by the Co-ordinate Benches. He has also invited our attention to various judgments
of Hon'ble the Supreme Court wherein the law of precedents has been discussed and it has been
held that in the event, there being conflicting judgments of Co-ordinate Benches, it is the earlier
judgment which should be followed especially in a case where the subsequent Division Bench has
not considered the earlier Division Bench judgment. These decisions have been rendered in Civil
Appeal No.5707 of 2023 (@Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.18727 of 2023) 'Union Territory of
Ladakh and ors. vs. Jammu & Kashmir National Conference and Ors.' dated 06.09.2023; (2017) 16
SCC 680 'National Insurance Company Limited v Pranay Sethi' which in fact is a Constitution Bench
judgment on the same issue; 'Chandra Prakash and Ors. vs. State of U.P.' (2002) 4 SCC 234; 'Union
of India vs. Raghubir Singh' (1989) 2 SCC 754; 'Pradip Chandra Parija and others v. Pramod
Chandra Patnaik' (2002) 1 SCC Page 1; 'Rattiram vs. State of Madhya Pradesh' (2012) 4 SCC 516;
'National Telephone Company Ltd vs Post Master General' 1913 AC546 (HL) and 'Sandeep Kumar
Bafna vs. State of Maharastra' (2014) 6 SCC 623. He has specifically referred to the decision of
Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of Rattiram (supra) wherein the question of conflict between
two judgments rendered by benches of equal strength specifically came up for consideration and a

Mohd. Talha vs Uoi Thru. Its Secy. Ministry Of External ... on 1 May, 2025
Three Judge Bench of Hon'ble the Supreme Court relying upon Constitution Bench decision in
Raghubir Singh (supra) and other decisions on the subject held that earlier decision was a binding
precedent and when in ignorance of it, subsequent decision has been rendered, the latter would not
constitute a binding precedent as concept of per incuriam would come into play.
(10) Having heard the learned Counsel for the parties, this Court finds that the core issue engaging
the attention of this Court is whether there is any requirement under the Passport Act, 1967 for an
under trial to obtain permission/'NOC' from the Court where his trial is pending for going abroad
and for issuance of Passport or for its renewal.
(11) This Court in its endeavour to decide the said issue wishes to put on record that more than 50
years ago, the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its celebrated Judgment passed in "Satwan Singh
Sawhney Vs. Union of India" : AIR 1966 SCC 1836 held and read the right of a citizen to travel into
the right to personal liberty as per Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In consequence to the
above-mentioned judgment, Passport Bill was introduced and later was enacted as "The Passport
Act, 1967". The essence of the said legislation and the subsequent passport rules of 1980 framed
therein was with a purpose to provide/issue passports/travel documents and regulate the departure
of citizens from India and matters incidentals and ancillary thereto.
(12) Section 3 of the Passport Act, 1967 invariably says that no person shall depart from, or attempt
to depart from, India unless he holds in this behalf a valid Passport or travel document.
(13) Section 5 of the Passport Act, 1967 relates to filing of application for Passports, travel document
etc., wherein the Passport Authority is empowered to issue and/or refuse Passport as per the terms
of the said provision.
(14) However, Section 6 of the Passport Act, 1967 relates to provisions for specific refusal of
Passport, travel documents etc., wherein various conditions for refusal have been enumerated
therein. Section 6 of the Passport Act, 1967, which specifically entails refusal of Passport, travel
documents etc., is as under :-
"6. Refusal of passports, travel documents. Etc.--
(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to
make an endorsement for visiting any country under clause (b) or clause (c) of
sub-section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no
other ground, namely:--
(a) that the applicant may, or is likely to, engage in such country in activities
prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India;
(b) that the presence of the applicant in such country may, or is likely to, be
detrimental to the security of India;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7609456/ 4
Mohd. Talha vs Uoi Thru. Its Secy. Ministry Of External ... on 1 May, 2025
(c) that the presence of the applicant in such country may, or is likely to, prejudice
the friendly relations of India with that or any other country;
(d) that in the opinion of the Central Government the presence of the applicant in
such country is not in the public interest.
(2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to
issue a passport or travel document for visiting any foreign country under clause (c)
of sub-section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no
other ground, namely:--
(a) that the applicant is not a citizen of India;
(b) that the applicant may, or is likely to, engage outside India in activities prejudicial
to the sovereignty and integrity of India;
(c) that the departure of the applicant from India may, or is likely to, be detrimental
to the security of India;
(d) that the presence of the applicant outside India may, or is likely to, prejudice the
friendly relations of India with any foreign country;
(e) that the applicant has, at any time during the period of five years immediately
preceding the date of his application, been convicted by a court in India for any
offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced in respect thereof to imprisonment
for not less than two years;
(f) that proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by the
applicant are pending before a criminal court in India;
(g) that a warrant or summons for the appearance, or a warrant for the arrest, of the
applicant has been issued by a court under any law for the time being in force or that
an order prohibiting the departure from India of the applicant has been made by any
such court;
(h) that the applicant has been repatriated and has not reimbursed the expenditure
incurred in connection with such repatriation;
(i) that in the opinion of the Central Government the issue of a passport or travel
document to the applicant will not be in the public interest."
(15) Since this Court is dealing with the issue relating to issuance of Passport during the pendency of
proceeding before a criminal court in India, the relevant provision for consideration would be
Section 6 (2) (f) of the Passport Act, 1967, which, in categorical terms mandates the Passport
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7609456/ 5
Mohd. Talha vs Uoi Thru. Its Secy. Ministry Of External ... on 1 May, 2025
Authority to refuse to issue a Passport or travel document for visiting any foreign country under
Clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 5 on the ground that the proceedings in respect of an offence
alleged to have been committed by the applicant are pending before a criminal court in India. The
word 'shall' used in Section 6 (2) of the Passport Act, 1967 indicates a mandatory or binding nature
of the provision and does not give any room for discretion. Section 6 (2) (f) is a reasonable
restriction imposed by law within the framework of Article 19 (f) of the Constitution of India and
debars issuance of passport where proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been
committed by the applicant is pending before a criminal Court in India.
(16) Section 22 of the 1967 Act is an exception carved out from the restrictions imposed by the Act
itself. It reads as under :-
"22. Power to exempt.--
Where the Central Government is of the opinion that it is necessary or expedient in
the public interest so to do, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette and subject
to such conditions, if any, as it may specify in the notification,--
(a) exempt any person or class of persons from the operation of all or any of the
provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder; and
(b) as often as may be, cancel any such notification and again subject, by a like
notification, the person or class of persons to the operation of such provisions."
(17) The aforesaid Section 22 confers on the Central Government the power to exempt where it is of
the opinion that it is necessary or expedient in the public interest to do so, by Notification in the
Official Gazette. Such exemption by Notification includes exemption of any person or class of
persons from the operation of all or any of the provisions of the Act or the Rules made thereunder. It
is in this regard, so as to provide such exemption, the Central Government exercising powers
conferred under Section 22 of the Passport Act, 1967, has published Official Gazette notification
[GSR 570 (E) dated 25.08.1993]. For the sake of reference relevant portion of Official Gazette [GSR
570 (E) dated 25.08.1993] is extracted hereunder :-
"MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS NOTIFICATION New Delhi, the 25th August,
1993 G.S.R.570(E).--In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of Section 22 of
the Passports Act 1967 [15 of 1967] and in supersession of the notification of the
Government of India in the Ministry of External Affairs No. G.S.R. 298(E), dated the
14th April, 1976, the Central Government, being of the opinion that it is necessary in
public interest to do so, hereby exempts citizens of India against whom proceedings
in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by them are pending before a
criminal court in India and who produce orders from the court concerned permitting
them to depart from India, from the operation of the provisions of Clause (f) of
sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the said Act, subject to the following conditions,
namely :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7609456/ 6
Mohd. Talha vs Uoi Thru. Its Secy. Ministry Of External ... on 1 May, 2025
(a) the passport to be issued to every such citizen shall be issued-
(i) for the period specified in order of the court referred to above, if the court specifies a period for which the passport has to be issued; or
(ii) if no period either for the issue of the passport or for the travel abroad is specified
in such order, the passport shall be issued for a period one year;
(iii) if such order gives permission to travel abroad for a period less than one year,
but does not specify the period validity of the passport, the passport shall be issued
for one year; or
(iv) if such order gives permission to travel abroad for a period exeeding one year,
and does not specify the validity of the pass-port, then the passport shall be issued for
the period of travel abroad specified in the order.
(b) any passport issued in terms of (a) (ii) and (a) (iii) above can be further renewed
for one year at a time, provided the applicant has not travelled abroad for the period
sanctioned by the court; and provided further that, in the meantime, the order of the
court is not cancelled or modified;
(c) any passport issued in terms of (a) (i) above can be further renewed only on the
basis of a fresh court order specifying a further period of validity of the passport or
specifying a period for travel abroad;
(d) the said citizen shall give an undertaking in writing to the passport issuing
authority that he shall, if required by the court concerned, appear before it at any
time during the continuance in force of the passport so issued.
[No.VI|401|37|79] Sd/-
L.K. Ponappa, Jt. Secy, (CPV)"
(emphasis supplied) (18) In view thereof, it can be safely deduced that the provision
of Section 6 (2) (f) of the Act, 1967 does not impose an absolute bar on the issuance of
passports to individuals against whom criminal proceedings are pending, as, in that
regard Section 22 of the Passport Act, 1967 provides power to the Central
Government for grant of exemptions from the application of all or any provisions of
the Passport Act, 1967, which has been exercised by issue of notification dated
25.08.1993.
(19) This Court finds that under Official Gazette Notification GSR 570 (E) dated
25.08.1993, the Central Government has exempted individuals facing pending
criminal proceedings from the restrictions imposed under Section 6 (2) (f) of the Act,
1967, provided they obtain order from the concerned Court permitting them to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7609456/ 7
Mohd. Talha vs Uoi Thru. Its Secy. Ministry Of External ... on 1 May, 2025
depart from India. Further, in case the concerned Court grants permission, then a
passport may be issued for the duration specified in the order. In case, no period is
mentioned, then, the passport shall be issued for a maximum of one year. In the
absence of Court's order permitting to depart from India, the restriction under
Section 6 (2) (f) of 1967 Act remains in force which prevents issuance or renewal of
the Passport.
(20) The aforesaid notification under Section 22 of the Act, 1967 has statutory
backing and force. The requirement of obtaining 'permission' or 'NOC' for an
under-trial to go abroad, is a statutory requirement under the Act, 1967.
(21) As to the period for which the passport can be issued, it is easily discernible from
the aforesaid notification that in case of sub-clause (i), (iii) and (iv) of Clause (a), the
Court not only grants permission to the under-trial to depart from India, but specifies
a period therefor, in which case the Passport Authority is bound to issue the passport
for that said period as granted by the Court or in case the period of travel is less than
one year as per sub-clause (iii) of Clause (a) for a period of one year.
(22) It is seen that the Central Government has deliberately left the period for
issuance of Passport to the discretion of the trial Court. However, if the Court chooses
to grant permission to the applicant to depart from India but abstains from
specifying the period therefor, i.e., the trial Court refuses to exercise its discretion in
the first instance as aforesaid, then the power of determining the period reverts back
to the residuary authority of the Central Government, which is conferred on the
Central Government in the first place by the source of its power, that is, Section 22 of
the Act, 1967 and, in such a case, a reasonable period of one year has been fixed by
the Central Government, which this Court finds to be in consonance with Section 22
of the parent statute that is the Passport Act, 1967 as well as Article 19 (5) of the
Constitution of India, read in the context of Section 6 (2) (f) of the 1967 Act.
(23) While things stood thus, there had been a confusion relating to the procedure for
processing of the Passport Application amongst the authorities, wherein the Ministry
of External Affairs published Office Memorandum, bearing No. VI/401/I/5/2019
dated 10.10.2019 prescribing guidelines/ procedure for processing applications under
Section 6 (2) (f) of the Passport Act, 1967. As per the said Memorandum also, the
applicant is required to submit an application/undertaking to the Passport
Authorities, disclosing all pending criminal cases. If any cases are pending against the
under-trial, the said under-trial shall obtain 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) from
the concerned Court seeking leave to depart India. Subsequently, Police Verification
(PV) shall be conducted by the police authorities and subject to the police verification
report, passport authorities may issue or reject issuance of passport by giving
reasons. It may be reminded that the said Memorandum is an extension of the earlier
Notification inasmuch as the said Memorandum of 2019 itself records that the
provisions of GSR 570 (E) be strictly applied in all case as it being a statutory
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7609456/ 8
Mohd. Talha vs Uoi Thru. Its Secy. Ministry Of External ... on 1 May, 2025
notification and forms part of the rules.
(24) In the given circumstances, although Section 6 (2) (f) of the Passport Act, 1967
clearly provides that if the proceedings in respect of an alleged offence committed by
the petitioner are pending before the criminal Court in India, then, it shall constitute
a ground for refusal of issuance of Passport, however, by virtue of the beneficial
statutory notification of GSR 570 (E) (dated 25th August, 1993) read along with the
Office Memorandum dated 10.10.2019, the petitioner on submission of 'No Objection
Certificate' from the Court where the proceedings are pending, shall be exempted
from the operation of Section 6 (2) (f) of the Passport Act, 1967 and he/she would be
entitled to go abroad and for this NOC issuance/renewal of the passport is implicit.
(25) A plain reading of the provisions of Passport Act, 1967 and the beneficial
Notification issued in terms of Section 22 of the Act, 1967 leads to the sole logical
conclusion that in all cases wherein criminal proceedings are pending and have been
denied the issuance of passport by the operation of Section 6 (2) (f) of the Passport
Act, 1967, the under-trial, as a condition precedent has to first seek permission or
NOC from the Court concerned, wherein the trial is pending, to travel abroad or
depart, for which essentially a passport is required and then only as a condition
subsequent apply to the passport authority for issuance of the passport for a
particular period as mentioned in the permission order itself or for the period as
mentioned in GSR 570(E) dated 25th of August, 1993.
(26) However, misinterpreting Section 6 (2) (f) of Act, 1967 and Office Memorandum
No. VI/40/1/5/2019 dated 10.10.2019, several under-trails have been obtaining 'No
Objection Certificates' (NOCs) from the Court for the re-issuance of passports,
instead of securing order permitting applicant to depart from India. Accordingly, the
Ministry of External Affairs, with the intent to clarify the issue, published an Office
Memorandum (OM) dated 06.12.2024 through its PSP Division, stating that there is
no legal provision requiring an applicant to obtain permission or 'No Objection
Certificate' (NOC) from the concerned Court for the issuance or re-issuance of a
passport. Instead, the applicant is required to obtain permission from the concerned
Court specifically to depart from India or travel abroad. Relevant portions from the
Office Memorandum (OM) dated 06.12.2024 is extracted hereunder :-
"8. It may be noted that there is no such provision for seeking permission/NOC from
the court concerned for issuance of passport; instead it is permission to depart from
India. In case the applicant is unable to provide the prescribed documents, PIA may
issue a refusal order under Section 6 of the Passport Act, 1967 prescribing provisions
for appeal."
(27) It goes without saying that as per Official Gazette [GSR 570 (E) dated 25.08.1993], relaxation
under Section 6 (2) (f) of the Passport Act, 1967 applies to only those persons who produce orders
from the Court concerned permitting them to depart India, otherwise, the rigour of refusing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7609456/ 9
Mohd. Talha vs Uoi Thru. Its Secy. Ministry Of External ... on 1 May, 2025
issuance of passport would follow consequently.
(28) Apparently, it seems that when the petitioner applied for such NOC, the concerned trial Court
passed an order stating that such permission was not required to be given by it. We have already
discussed relevant provisions of Passport Act, 1967 and the notifications issued thereunder which do
require such permission to be taken from the Court where criminal trial is pending. We have also
referred to the earlier judgments of several Co-ordinate Benches where the law has been discussed
and clarified in this regard. In this context, we have also taken into consideration the submissions of
learned Senior Counsel and Deputy Solicitor General of India. We, accordingly, set-aside the order
dated 30.07.2024 passed in Case No. 2397 of 2023 arising out of Case Crime No. 113 of 2013 by the
Chief Judicial Magistrate (A.P.), Lucknow in exercise of our suo moto inherent powers.
Consequently, the application of the petitioner shall stand revived and will be considered afresh in
the light of what has been discussed hereinabove and a decision shall be taken within a period of
three weeks. The aforesaid order dated 30.07.2024 has been passed in the context of Case Crime
No.113 of 2013 as referred earlier, however, there is another criminal case against the petitioner,
bearing Case Crime No. 123 of 2011, in respect to which, some document has been filed by the
petitioner indicating submission of a Final Report by the Investigating Officer, however, there is no
order regarding its acceptance, therefore, the petitioner will have to find out as to whether the Final
Report has been accepted, if so, produce the said order before the Regional Passport Officer. If it has
not been accepted or on a protest application, same is being proceeded, then, he will have to seek
permission from the Court of criminal jurisdiction, where the said case is pending on the same lines
as discussed hereinabove. If, the NOC/Permission for going abroad is granted by the aforesaid
Courts, then, the petitioner shall submit the same before the Regional Passport Officer concerned,
who shall then process the application of the petitioner for issuance of passport as per law and take a
decision within a period three weeks of submission of such NOC/Permission.
(29) The writ petition is allowed.
