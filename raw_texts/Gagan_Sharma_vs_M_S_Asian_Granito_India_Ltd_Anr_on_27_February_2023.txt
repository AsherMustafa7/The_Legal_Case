JUDGMENT
1. The present Criminal Revision Petition has been filed against the order dated 03.05.2016 (for
short „impugned order(cid:129)) passed in complaint titled M/s Asian Granito India Ltd. Vs. Gagan Sharma
by Learned Judicial Magistrate (2nd Munsiff ) Jammu, ( hereinafter called „Jammu Court(cid:129))
whereby the case has been returned back to the complainant ( respondent no. 2 herein) with liberty
to him to present the same within 30 days to the concerned court.
2. The brief facts giving rise to the present revision petition are that the respondent no. 2 had filed a
complaint purportedly under Section 138 r/w Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881
against the petitioner before the Court of Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate Ahmedabad (Rural) on
19.02.2012 which was transferred to the Court of Ld. 4th Additional Senior Civil Judge Ahmedabad
Rural, Mirzapur Ahmedabad (hereinafter called for short Áhmedabad Page |2 Court(cid:129)) alleging
therein that a cheque was issued by the petitioner which has been dishonoured. It is further averred
that respondent has mentioned in the aforesaid complaint that petitioner/accused had purchased
tiles from the respondent and issued a cheque in lieu thereof and there was nothing due against the
petitioner, as such , the complaint is nothing but an abuse of process of law.

3. It is submitted that during the pendency of the above complaint and even before the petitioner
could be served through summons the landmark judgment of the Hon(cid:129)ble Apex Court in a case
titled as Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod Vs. State of Maharashtra'' (Cri. Appeal No. 2287 of 2009) was
pronounced dealing with the territorial jurisdiction of the cases relating to dishonour of cheques.
Consequently, upon the said Judgment, the Trial Court at Ahmedabad passed an order dated
13.04.2015 wherein the Ahmedabad Court held that cheque has been drawn upon a bank located
outside the territorial jurisdiction of that Court. Therefore, in view of the decision of Hon(cid:129)ble Apex
Court in the above said case the complaint was returned to the complainant to be presented in the
competent criminal court located in Jammu & Kashmir. Thereafter an application was filed by the
respondent no. 2 for the presentation of the above titled complaint before the Court of Ld. CJM,
Jammu and complaint was transferred to the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate (2nd Addl;
Munsiff) Jammu. Consequently the application was allowed and the court took the cognizance of the
matter and proceedings were initiated and petitioner after being served notice appeared before the
learned trial court and furnished the bail bonds to the satisfaction of trial court.

4. During the pendency of the said complaint, the Jammu, in view of the Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 passed the impugned order dated 03.05.2016, whereby complaint
was returned back to respondent no. 2 with liberty to present the same within 30 days to the
Concerned Court.
5. Amendments have been incorporated in the Negotiable Instruments Act by virtue of which
Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Ordinance 2015 ( hereinafter referred to as „First
Amendment(cid:129)) read with Negotiable Instruments ( Amendment). Ordinance 2015 (hereinafter
referred to as „Second Ordinance(cid:129)) were incorporated in Sub-section (2) of Section 142 of the
Principal Act (Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881). The learned Magistrate at Jammu, passed the
order impugned dated 03.05.2016 observing that in view of the latest amendment the complaint is
not maintainable before his Court, as such, complaint in original along with the accompanying
documents was directed to be returned back to the complainant against proper receipt, with liberty
to the applicant to present the same within 30 days from the date of the order passed by the Court to
the competent Court.
6. The ground of challenge thrown to order impugned in the present revision petition is that there is
no such provision incorporated in Second Ordinance of Negotiable Instruments (Amendment),
Second Ordinance, 2015, therefore the order impugned transferring the complaint/application is
without jurisdiction.
7. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the „First Ordinance(cid:129) Page |4 Negotiable
Instruments (Amendemt) Ordinance, 2015, was promulgated by Hon(cid:129)ble President of India on 15th
June, 2015 and the Parliament re-assembled on 21st July, 2015 for the Monsoon Session, therefore,
the Ordinance ceased to operate on the expiry of the period of six week with effect from 21st July,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75610668/ 2
Gagan Sharma vs M/S Asian Granito India Ltd. & Anr on 27 February, 2023
2015. Therefore, the First Ordinance lapsed on 31st August, 2015. Negotiable instruments
(Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015 was promulgated by Hon(cid:129)ble the President of India to
further amend the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In the preamble of the Second Ordinance, it
was mentioned that Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) First Ordinance, to replace the
Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015 has been passed by the House of
People and is pending in the Council of the State. It is further averred that the Second Ordinance
was given effect from 15th June, 2015, i.e. the date when first Ordinance was promulgated.
9. Learned counsel for the respondent argues that the present revision petition is misconceived, in
view of the insertion of Section 142-A in the Negotiable Instruments Act. Further argues that
sub-section (1) thereof leaves no room for any doubt in so far as the place of trial of offence under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is concerned. He further argued that in light of
amendments made in the Negotiable Instruments Act by virtue of the Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 ( No.6 of 2015, First Ordinance) read with the Negotiable
Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015 ( No.7 of 2015), the trial Court has rightly
passed the order impugned, returning the complaint to be presented to the concerned Court.

10. Hon(cid:129)ble Apex Court in case titled Bridgestone India Pvt. Ltd. V. Inderpal Singh (2015 AIR SCW
6556), considered and dealt with the validity of Sub Section (2) of Section 142-A of the Negotiable
Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 . Relevant para 11 and 12 of the said judgment are reproduced
as under:
"11. It is, however, imperative for the present controversy, that the appellant overcomes the legal
position declared by this Court, as well as, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Insofar
as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, a reference may be made to Section 4 of the
Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015, whereby Section 142A was inserted
into the Negotiable Instruments Act. A perusal of Sub-section (1) thereof leaves no room for any
doubt, that insofar as the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is concerned,
on the issue of jurisdiction, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, would have to
give way to the provisions of the instant enactment on account of the non-obstante clause in sub-
section (1) of Section 142A. Likewise, any judgment, decree, order or direction issued by a Court
would have no effect insofar as the territorial jurisdiction for initiating proceedings under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is concerned. In the above view of the matter, we are
satisfied, that the judgment rendered by this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod(cid:129)s case would also
not non-suit the appellant for the relief claimed.
12. We are in complete agreement with the contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel
for the appellant. We are satisfied, that Section 142(2)(a), amended through the Negotiable
Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015, vests jurisdiction for initiating proceedings for
the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, inter alia in the territorial
jurisdiction of the Court, where the cheque is delivered for collection (through an account of the
branch of the bank where the payee or holder in due course maintains an account). We are also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75610668/ 3
Gagan Sharma vs M/S Asian Granito India Ltd. & Anr on 27 February, 2023
satisfied, based on Section 142A(1) to the effect, that the judgment rendered by this Court in
Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod(cid:129)s case, would not stand in the way of the appellant, insofar as the
territorial jurisdiction for initiating proceedings emerging from the dishonor of the cheque in the
present case arises(cid:129)(cid:129).

11. As the learned counsel for the parties have vehemently argued on Section 142A of the Negotiable
Instruments ( Amendment) Act, 2015, it would be advantageous to reproduce relevant portion
thereof:
„„142A. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 or any judgment, decree, order or directions of any court, all cases arising out of
section 138 which were pending in any court, whether filed before it, or transferred to
it, before the commencement of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment)
Ordinance, 2015 shall be transferred to the court having jurisdiction under
sub-section (2) of section 142 as if that sub- section had been in force at all material
times.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) of section 142 or
sub-section (1), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has
filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction
under sub-section (2) of section 142 or the case has been transferred to that court
under sub-
section (1), and such complaint is pending in that court, all subsequent complaints arising out of
section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of whether
those cheques were delivered for collection or presented for payment within the territorial
jurisdiction of that court. (3) If, on the date of the commencement of the Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2015, more than one prosecution filed by the same payee or holder in due
course, as the case may be, against the same drawer of cheques is pending before different courts,
upon the said fact having been brought to the notice of the court, such court shall transfer the case
to the court having jurisdiction under sub-section (2) of section 142 before which the first case was
filed and is pending, as if that sub-section had been in force at all material times.(cid:129)(cid:129).
12. Admittedly, in the case on hand, the petitioner has not challenged the vires of Amendment of
Section 142A of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015. Thus from the conjoint
reading of the newly inserted provisions in the Negotiable Instruments Act and the law laid down by
the Apex Court in case titled Bridgestone India Private Limited ( supra), it is explicitly Page |7 clear
that the newly inserted provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, are applicable with
retrospective effect, that is from 15.6.2015 and the decision of the Hon(cid:129)ble Apex Court in case
Dashhrath Rupsing Rathod v. State of Maharashtra is statutorily superseded.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75610668/ 4
Gagan Sharma vs M/S Asian Granito India Ltd. & Anr on 27 February, 2023
13. As per Section 142A, amended by the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance,
2015 vests jurisdiction for initiation of proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, inter alia, in the territorial jurisdiction of the Court where the cheque is presented for
encashment by the Payee to his Banker. In the promulgation of Negotiable Instruments (
Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015, the expression "...is as if that sub-section had been in force at
material times..." has been used with reference to Section 142 (2) . Be that as it may, Section 142-A
(1) gives retrospective effect to the provisions.
14. I am of the considered view that there is no scope to interfere with the order impugned dated
03.05.2016 passed by the Jammu Court , whereby a complaint initially filed in the Ahmedabad
Court where the payee had presented cheque issued by the petitioner herein, to his bankers at
Ahmedabad and later in view of the judgment of the Apex Court was returned to be presented before
the Jammu Court, in view of the retrospective effect of amendment of Negotiable Instruments Act
by incorporating section 142-A is now maintainable at Ahmedabad only. The impugned order thus
does not warrant any interference by this court, invoking revisional jurisdiction, which is upheld.

15. For the foregoing reasons, this Criminal Revision Petition is devoid of merit and is accordingly,
dismissed alongwith pending application(s). No costs. Copy of this judgment shall be sent down for
information and compliance.
