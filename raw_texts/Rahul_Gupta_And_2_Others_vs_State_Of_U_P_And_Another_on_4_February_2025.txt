3. Earlier on 14.11.2024, the following order was passed in Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. No. 36198 of
2024:-
"Heard Mr. Anwar Hussain, learned counsel for the applicants and learned A.G.A. for
the State.
The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the charge sheet dated
27.11.2019 and cognizance/summoning order dated 19.12.2019 as well as the entire
proceedings of Criminal Case No. 2876 of 2019 (State vs. Rahul Gupta and Others)
arising out of Case Crime No. 294 of 2019, under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506 IPC
and Section 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station-Firozabad South,
District-Firozabad, pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Firozabad, on
the basis of compromise.
Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the parties have reconciled their
differences and a compromise has been entered between them after which they have
decided to live separately. In this regard, an application along with compromise deed
on behalf of both the parties has been filed before the court below stating therein that
they have entered into compromise and they do not want to press the case, copy of
said application has been annexed as Annexure no. 6 to this application. Therefore,
no useful purpose would be served in continuing the proceedings before the court
below and the same is not only sheer wastage of time of the Court but also abuse of
the process of law.
Learned AGA, however, submits that it is the concerned court below, which has to
verify the fact as to whether the parties have entered into compromise, hence the
applicants may approach the concerned court below and move an application with
respect to compromise between the parties, which will be decided in accordance with
law.
In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with an application for verification of the compromise deed as well as a
certified copy of this order. It is expected that the trial court may fix a date for the
verification of the compromise and after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an
appropriate order with respect to the same in accordance with law, as expeditiously
as possible, preferably within a period of two months from today. While passing the
order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall also record the statements
of the parties as to whether all the terms and conditions mentioned in the original
compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not?
The court in that scenario will allow the parties to obtain certified copy of the order
verifying the compromise deed and it will be open to the applicants to approach this
Court again for quashing of the proceedings.

4. In compliance of the order dated 14.11.2024, compromise verification report dated 9.12.2024 is
placed on record as is evident from page no. 66 (Annexure-9) of the application vide which
compromise has been verified between the parties.
5. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that since the compromise entered between the parties
has been verified by the court below, the entire proceedings of the aforesaid criminal case may be
quashed by this Court.
6. Learned A.G.A. for the State as well as learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 also accept that
the parties have entered into a compromise and the copy of the same has also been enclosed along
with verification order, they have no objection, if the proceedings in the aforesaid case are quashed.

(i). B.S. Joshi and others Vs. State of Haryana and Another; (2003)4 SCC 675,
(ii). Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 677,

8. In the aforesaid judgments, the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made
between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. Reference
may also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and Others Vs. State of U.P. &
Another; 2013 (83) ACC 278 and Pramod & Another Vs. State of U.P. & Another (Application U/S
482 No.12174 of 2020, decided on 23rd February, 2021) and Daxaben Vs. State of Gujarat, reported
in 2022 SCC Online SC 936 in which the law expounded by the Apex court in the aforesaid cases has
been explained in detail.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as noted herein above, and also the
submissions made by the counsel for the parties, the court is of the considered opinion that no
useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the proceedings of the above mentioned criminal case
as the parties have already settled their dispute.
10. Accordingly, the proceedings of Criminal Case No. 2876 of 2019 (State vs. Rahul Gupta and
others), arising out of Case Crime No. 294 of 2019, under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and
