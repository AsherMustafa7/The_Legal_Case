"1. Heard Mr. Shravana Kumar Yadav, the learned counsel for applicant and the
learned A.G.A.
2. Perused the Court.
3. This application for bail has been filed by applicant-Shivlal seeking his
enlargement on bail in Case Crime No. 321 of 2023 under Sections 498A, 304B I.P.C.
and Sections 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station-Behat, District- Saharanpur,
during the pendency of trial.
4. Record shows that Marriage of Sandeep son of applicant was solemnized with
Ritika @ Ritu on 22.02.2023. However, just after expiry of a period of four months
from the date of marriage of the son of applicant an unfortunate incident occurred on
26.06.2023 in which the daughter-in-law of applicant namely Ritika @ Ritu died as
she committed suicide by hanging herself. 5.Information regarding aforementioned
occurrence at the police station concerned was not given by applicant or any of his
family members but by Nishad ( brother of the deceased).
6.Subsequently, the first informant Sri Lakshmichand father of the deceased lodged a
prompt F.I.R. dated 26.06.2023, which was registered as Case Crime No. 321 of 2023
under Sections 498A, 304B I.P.C. and Sections 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, Police
Station-Behat, District- Saharanpur. In the aforesaid F.I.R. three persons namely
Sandeep , Premjeet and Shivlal (applicant herein) have been nominated as named
accused. 6. The gravamen of the allegations made in the F.I.R. is to the effect that
marriage of daughter of first informant was solemnized with Sandeep on 22.02.2023.
At the time of marriage sufficient amounts of goods and dowry were given. However,
subsequently, additional demand of dowry was made. As the said demand of dowry
was not fulfilled, physical and mental cruelty was committed upon the daughter of
first informmt. Ultimately, the daughter of first informant was put to death.
7. Thereafter, inquest (Panchnama) of the body of deceased was conducted on
26.06.2023. In the opinion of the witnesses of inquest (Panch witnesses), the nature
of death of the deceased was categorized as suicidal and the cause of death was
opined as hanging. Subsequent to above, post-mortem of the body of the deceased
was conducted. In the opinion of Autopsy Surgeon, who conducted autopsy of the
body of the deceased, the cause of death of deceased is asphyxia as a result of ante
mortem hanging, However viscera of the deceased was preserved. The Autopsy
Surgeon found following ante mortem injuries on the body of the deceased:

Shivlal vs State Of U.P. on 31 January, 2025
1. Abraison 9x1 cm on front of Rt. side neck ii. 14 cm above from Rt. medial end of
clavicle.
iii. 25 cm above from Rt. mid clavicle.
iv. 23 cm above from Lt. mid clavicle.
8. After aforementioned F.I.R. was lodged, the Investigating Officer proceeded with statutory
investigation of concerned case crime number in terms of Chapter XII Cr.P.C. During course of
investigation, he examined the first informant and other witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C., who
have substantially supported the F.I.R. On the basis of above and other material collected by
Investigating Officer during the course of investigation, he came to the conclusion that complicity of
two of the named accused namely Sandeep and Shivlal (applicant herein) is fully established in the
crime in question. He accordingly submitted the charge-sheet dated 18.09.2023 whereby both the
named accused have been charge sheeted under Sections 498A, 304B I.P.C. and Sections 3/4 Dowry
Prohibition Act. Investigation in respect of another named accused Premjeet is said to be pending.
9. Learned counsel for applicants submits that though the applicant is father-in-law of the deceased,
named as well as charge sheeted accused yet he is liable to be enlarged on bail. With reference to the
material on record, he submits that the deceased was a short tempered lady and she has taken the
extreme step of terminating her life by hanging herself. Bonafide of applicant is also explicit from
the fact that in the opinion of Autopsy Surgeon, the cause of death of deceased is asphyxia as a result
of ante mortem hanging. As such, prima facie, the death of deceased is a suicidal death. Moreover no
internal or external ante-mortem injury was found on the body of the deceased by the autopsy
surgeon. The same depicts the bonafie of applicant. Applicant cannot be said to be the beneficiary of
the alleged demand of dowry. No abetment, instigation or conspiracy can be inferred against
applicant from the record either. Allegations with regard to demand of additional dowry and
commission of physical and mental cruelty upon deceased on account of non-fulfilment of
additional demand of dowry are vague and bald allegation as they are devoid of material particulars.
As such, the same are liable to be ignored by this Court at this stage in view of the law laid down by
Apex Court in Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and others Vs. State of Bihar and Others, (2022) 6SCC
599.
10. Learned counsel for applicants further contends that considering the nature of death of
deceased, applicant is not liable to be awarded the maximum sentence for an offence under Section
304B I.P.C. Even otherwise applicant is a man of clean antecedents inasmuch he has no criminal
history to his credit except the present one. Applicant is in custody since 27.06.2023 As such, he has
under-gone more than four months of incarceration. The police report (charge-sheet) in terms of
Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. has already been submitted, therefore, the entire evidence sought to be relied
upon by the prosecution against applicant stands crystallised. Upto this stage, no such incriminating
circumstance has emerged necessitating the custodial arrest of applicants during the pendency of
trial. He therefore contends that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. In case the applicant is
enlarged on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall co-operate with the trial.

11. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State has opposed the prayer for bail. he submits that since the
applicant is a named as well as charge sheeted accused, therefore, he does not deserve any
indulgence by this Court. He submits that death of deceased has occurred just after expiry of a
period of four months from the date of marriage. The death of deceased is a dowry death. The
deceased was a young lady aged about 21 years whose death has occurred in unnatural
circumstance. By reason of above, applicant being an inmate of the house and is father in law of the
deceased, is therefore, under burden to not only explain the manner of occurrence but also his
innocence in terms of Section 106 and Section 113B of Evidence Act. However, applicant has
miserably failed to discharge the said burden upto this stage. On the above conspectus, the learned
A.G.A. submits that no sympathy be shown by this court in favour of applicant.
12. When confronted with above the learned counsel for applicant could not over come the same.
13. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, upon consideration
of material on record, evidence, gravity and nature of offence, accusations made as well as
complicity of applicant coupled with the fact that the learned counsel for applicant could not
dislodge the submissions urged by learned A.G.A. in opposition of the present application for bail,
therefore irrespective of the submissions urged by learned counsel for applicant in support of
present application for bail this Court, this Court does not find any sufficient or good ground to
enlarge the applicant on bail.
14. As a result, present application for bail fails and is liable to be rejected.
15. It is accordingly rejected. "

31.10.2023, co-accused Premjeet @ Paramjeet has already been enlarged on bail vide

offence under Section 304B I.P.C. Even otherwise applicant is a man of clean

14. As a result, present application for bail fails and is liable to be rejected.
15. It is accordingly rejected. ""
It is then contended by the learned counsel for applicant that subsequent to the order dated
31.10.2023, the trial of named and charge sheeted accused commenced before Court below. First
informant Laxmi Chand, father of the deceased deposed before Court below as PW.1. However, this
witness in his deposition before Court below has not supported the F.I.R. Consequently, he has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62517197/ 7
Shivlal vs State Of U.P. on 31 January, 2025
declared hostile. On the above premise, the learned counsel for applicant submits that once the first
informant has himself not supported the F.I.R., as such, no good ground exists to prolong the
custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial.
Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents inasmuch as he has no criminal history to
his credit except the present one. Applicant is in jail since 17.2.2024. As such, he has undergone
more than nine months of incarceration. The police report in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. has
already been submitted against applicant, as such, the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by
prosecution against applicants stands crystalized. However, upto this stage no such incriminating
circumstance has emerged necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of
trial. It is thus urged by the learned counsel for applicant that applicant is liable to be enlarged on
bail. In case the applicant is enlarged on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall
co-operate with the trial.
Per contra, the learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail. He submits that since applicant is a
named as well as charge sheeted accused, therefore he does not deserve any indulgence by this
Court. However, he could not dislodge the factual and legal submissions urged by learned counsel
for applicant, with reference to the record at this stage.
Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, upon perusal of
material brought on record, evidence, nature and gravity of offence as well as complicity of
applicant, accusation made coupled with the fact that father of the deceased/first informant who has
deposed before Court below as P.W.1 has not supported the F.I.R, therefore, no good ground exists
to prolong the custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial, police report in terms of
Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. has already been submitted against applicant, as such, the entire evidence
sought to be relied upon by prosecution against applicants stands crystalized, yet inspite of above,
the learned A.G.A. could not point out any such circumstance from the record necessitating
custodial arrest of applicant during pendency of trial, the period of incarceration undergone, the
clean antecedents of applicant, the clean antecedents of applicant, the period fo incarceration
undergone, therefore, irrespective of the objections raised by the learned A.G.A. in opposition to the
present application for bail, but without making any comment on the merits of the case, applicant
has made out a case for bail.
Accordingly, the bail application is Allowed.
Let the applicant Premjeet Alias Paramjeet, be released on bail in the aforesaid case crime number
on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
court concerned with the following conditions which are being imposed in the interest of justice:-
(i) THE APPLICANT SHALL FILE AN UNDERTAKING TO THE EFFECT THAT
HE/SHE SHALL NOT SEEK ANY ADJOURNMENT ON THE DATE FIXED FOR
EVIDENCE WHEN THE WITNESSES ARE PRESENT IN COURT. IN CASE OF
DEFAULT OF THIS CONDITION, IT SHALL BE OPEN FOR THE TRIAL COURT TO
TREAT IT AS ABUSE OF LIBERTY OF BAIL AND PASS ORDERS IN ACCORDANCE
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62517197/ 8
Shivlal vs State Of U.P. on 31 January, 2025
WITH LAW.
(ii) THE APPLICANT SHALL REMAIN PRESENT BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT ON
EACH DATE FIXED, EITHER PERSONALLY OR THROUGH HIS/HER COUNSEL.
IN CASE OF HIS/HER ABSENCE, WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CAUSE, THE TRIAL
COURT MAY PROCEED AGAINST HIM/HER UNDER SECTION 229-A IPC.
(iii) IN CASE, THE APPLICANT MISUSES THE LIBERTY OF BAIL DURING TRIAL
AND IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS/HER PRESENCE PROCLAMATION UNDER
SECTION 82 CR.P.C., MAY BE ISSUED AND IF APPLICANT FAILS TO APPEAR
BEFORE THE COURT ON THE DATE FIXED IN SUCH PROCLAMATION, THEN,
THE TRIAL COURT SHALL INITIATE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST HIM/HER, IN
ACCORDANCE WITH LAW, UNDER SECTION 174-A IPC.
(iv) THE APPLICANT SHALL REMAIN PRESENT, IN PERSON, BEFORE THE
TRIAL COURT ON DATES FIXED FOR (1) OPENING OF THE CASE, (2) FRAMING
OF CHARGE AND (3) RECORDING OF STATEMENT UNDER SECTION 313
CR.P.C. IF IN THE OPINION OF THE TRIAL COURT ABSENCE OF THE
APPLICANT IS DELIBERATE OR WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CAUSE, THEN IT
SHALL BE OPEN FOR THE TRIAL COURT TO TREAT SUCH DEFAULT AS ABUSE
OF LIBERTY OF BAIL AND PROCEED AGAINST THE HIM/HER IN
ACCORDANCE WITH LAW.
(v) THE TRIAL COURT MAY MAKE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS/ENDEAVOUR AND
TRY TO CONCLUDE THE TRIAL WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER THE
RELEASE OF THE APPLICANT.
However, it is made clear that any wilful violation of above conditions by the applicant, shall have
serious repercussion on his/her bail so granted by this court and the trial court is at liberty to cancel
the bail, after recording the reasons for doing so, in the given case of any of the condition mentioned
above. "
On the aforesaid premise, learned counsel for applicant contends that case of present
applicant is similar and identical to co-accused Premjeet @ Paramjeet. There is no
such distinguishing feature on the basis of which case of present applicant can be so
distinguished from aforesaid bailed out co-accused so as to deny him bail. He,
therefore, contends that in view of above and for the facts and reasons mentioned in
the order dated 12.12.2024, applicant is also liable to be enlarged on bail on the
ground of parity.
It is then contended by the learned counsel for applicant that applicant is
father-in-law of the deceased. Trial of applicant has already commenced before Court
below. Up to this stage, three prosecution witnesses of fact have been deposed before
Court below. However, the prosecution witnesses of fact, who have deposed up to this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62517197/ 9
Shivlal vs State Of U.P. on 31 January, 2025
stage, have not supported the F.I.R. He, therefore, contends that in view of above, no
useful purpose shall be served in prolonging the custodial arrest of applicant.
Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents inasmuch as he has no
criminal history to his credit except the present one. Applicant is in jail since
27.6.2023. As such, he has undergone more than one year and six months of
incarceration. The police report in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. has already been
submitted against applicant, as such, the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by
prosecution against applicant stands crystalized. However, upto this stage no such
incriminating circumstance has emerged on record necessitating the custodial arrest
of applicant during pendency of trial. It is thus urged by the learned counsel for
applicant that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. In case the applicant is
enlarged on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall co-operate with the
trial.
Per contra, the learned A.G.A. and learned counsel for first informant have opposed
the prayer for bail. They submit that since applicant is the father-in-law of deceased a
named as well as charge sheeted accused, therefore he does not deserve any
indulgence by this Court. The occurrence giving rise to present criminal proceedings
occurred on 26.6.2023 . Moreover, the occurrence has taken place in the house of
applicant and within seven years of marriage. As such, the death of the deceased is a
dowry death. By reason of above, the burden is upon the applicant himself to not only
to explain the manner of occurrence in terms of Section 106 and but also his
innocence under section 113 of the Evidence Act. However, applicant has miserably
failed to dislodge the aforesaid burden up to this stage. It is thus urged that no
sympathy be shown by this Court in favour of applicant. However, they could not
dislodge the factual and legal submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicant,
with reference to the record at this stage.
Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, upon
perusal of material brought on record, evidence, nature and gravity of offence as well
as complicity of applicant, accusation made coupled with the fact that similar situate
and circumstanced, named and charge sheeted co-accused has already been enlarged
on bail, case of present applicant is similar and identical to bailed out co-accused
Premjeet @ Paramjeet, applicant is father-in-law of deceased, whereas bailed out
co-accused is devar of deceased upto this stage, three prosecution witnesses have
deposed before Court below, however, they have not supported the F.I.R., as such, no
good ground has emerged to prolong the custodial arrest of applicant, learned A.G.A.
could not point out any such distinguishing feature on the basis of which case of
present applicant can be so distinguished from bailed out accused so as to deny him
bail, the Police Report in terms of Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. has already been submitted
therefore the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against
applicant stands crystalized yet inspire of above the learned A.G.A. could not point
out any such circumstance from the record, necessitating the custodial arrest of

learned counsel representing first informant in opposition to the present repeat
application for bail, but without making any comment on the merits of the case,
applicant has made out a case for bail.
Accordingly the bail application is allowed.
