Chatrapati Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 October, 2019
Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the applicant is an innocent person and he has
falsely been implicated in the present offence. On the false report of the complainant, the case has
been registered against the applicant. It is also submitted that the applicant has no criminal
antecedents and he is ready to furnish bail as per the order and shall abide by all conditions as may
be imposed by the Court. He further submits that the applicant is in jail since 29.6.2019 and the trial
will take time for its final disposal. On these grounds, learned counsel for the applicant prays for
grant of bail to the applicant.
Per-contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State and the learned counsel for the objector have
opposed the bail application.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the fact that the name of the applicant has
not been mentioned in the Dehati Nalisi and afterward statements of some of the injured and eye
witnesses have been recorded and they have narrated the name of the applicant, but at this stage it
is not proper to discuss the merit or 3 MCRC-41554-2019 demerit of the case, the applicant is in
judicial custody since 29.6.2019 and the trial will take time to conclude, I am of the considered view
that it is a fit case to release the applicant on bail. Therefore, without commenting on the merits of
the case, application of the present applicant seems to be acceptable. Consequently, it is hereby
allowed.
It is directed that applicant be released on bail on his furnishing a bail bond in the sum of
Rs.30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand) with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the
committal/trial Court to appear before the court on the dates given by the concerned Court. It is
directed that applicant shall comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) Cr.P.C.
C.C. as per rules.
