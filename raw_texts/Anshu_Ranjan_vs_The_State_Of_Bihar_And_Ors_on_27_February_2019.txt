CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and
HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE) Date : 27-02-2019 Having heard learned counsel for
the petitioner, it appears that the grievance is that by deleting Question No. 25, the respondents
have caused prejudice to the petitioner as his marks stand lowered so as to attain the minimum
bench mark fixed. Question No. 25 is as follows:-
"25. Rajjnama is the Persian translation of which Hindi book?
(A) Ramayana (B) Mahabharata (C) Ramcharitmanas (D) Kavitavali"
Patna High Court CWJC No.3873 of 2019 dt.27-02-2019 Shri Pandey, learned counsel for the
Commission contends that the description of the Persian translation has been incorrectly spelt as
'Rajjnama', whereas the correct spelling is "Rezanama". Secondly, the question also incorrectly

Anshu Ranjan vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 27 February, 2019
describes the said translation to be of a Hindi book, whereas the same is a translation of
Mahabharata, which is in Sanskrit. On account of this ambiguity in the question posed in the
question paper, it was resolved to delete the said question from evaluation in all answer sheets.
We do not find any error in the said decision taken by the respondents nor will it cause any
prejudice to anyone as the deletion will result in an identical impact on all candidates.
Consequently, this is not a case for interference on the ground of violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India.
The writ petition accordingly stands rejected.
