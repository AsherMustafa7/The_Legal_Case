ORDER
The Petitioner herein was the respondent before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Arbitral Award dated
18.11.2013(the Award) is assailed by this petition.
2. A Lease Agreement dated 17.04.2008 (the Lease Agreement) was entered into between the
Petitioner, as lessee, and the first Respondent, as lessor. The period of lease was for an aggregate
term of nine years with provision for escalation after three and six years. Consequently, the
aggregate lease period was scheduled to expire on 16.04.2017. Although the lease was for an
aggregate period of 9 years, the Lease Agreement was neither adequately stamped nor registered.
The Lease Agreement provided for termination by the lessee by giving three months advance written
notice to the lessor. The Lease Agreement stipulated that the lessee would deposit a sum of
Rs.18,00,000/- as security deposit, which was repayable by the lessor on the date of termination of
lease and at the time of handing over _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis vacant
possession of the relevant premises. A monthly lease rental of Rs.3,00,000/- was payable by the
lessee, inclusive of municipal taxes but exclusive of service tax and any future taxes imposed by the
Government. On the same date, a separate Agreement for Provision of Amenities and Services(the
Amenities Agreement) was entered into between the parties. The Amenities Agreement dealt with
the provision of the amenities listed in Annexure -1 thereto by the lessor to the lessee. These
amenities included electricity connection for a total power load of 100 KVA, a diesel generator set
with 100% back up, electrical fittings, fixtures, furniture, AC Units, LAN, UPS, etc. In connection
with the Amenities Agreement, an interest free refundable security deposit of Rs.27 lakhs was paid
by the lessee to the lessor. This Agreement was co-terminus with the Lease Agreement. While the
Lease Agreement provided for dispute resolution by a sole arbitrator, the Amenities Agreement
contained a separate arbitration clause, which provided for dispute resolution by a sole arbitrator, if
mutually agreed upon, or, in the alternative, a panel of three arbitrators with the venue of
arbitration being Mumbai.
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
3. By a communication dated 20.05.2009, the Petitioner issued a notice of termination of the Lease
Agreement by relying upon Clause 24 thereof. By such communication, the first Respondent was
called upon to refund the security deposit of Rs.45 lakhs + electricity deposit, if any. This Rs.45 lakh
claim appears to be both under the Lease Agreement and the Amenities Agreement (Rs.18 lakhs +
Rs.27 lakhs = Rs.45 Lakhs). A subsequent communication dated 26.08.2009 was also issued stating
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24134374/ 2
Icici Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mrs.P.Usha on 15 December, 2021
that the Petitioner is ready to hand over possession on 27.08.2009 and that the rent for June to
August 2009, the amenities charges for June to August 2009 and the maintenance for June to
August 2009 along with the electricity charges and diesel charges would be handed over at the time
of handing over possession. Further communications dated 28.06.2009 and 30.08.2009 were also
issued in this connection.
4. By a reply dated 02.09.2009(wrongly mentioned as 02.09.2008), the first Respondent informed
the Petitioner that she had not received the rent, service tax, maintenance charges, electricity
charges and diesel charges for the months of June to September 2009. In addition, it was stated
therein that the first Respondent would refund the interest free _____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis security deposit after deducting the pending amounts and interest
thereon once the keys are hand over. By a further communication dated 16.09.2009, the Petitioner
called upon the first Respondent to take possession by refunding the security deposit with interest
thereon at 30% per annum.
5. In the above facts and circumstances, a dispute arose between the parties. The Petitioner herein
filed an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (the Arbitration
Act) seeking security for a sum of Rs.45 lakhs and also requesting that a court receiver be appointed
to take possession of the premises. Eventually, in appellate proceedings arising out of the order
passed in the application under Section 9, a Division Bench of this Court, by order dated 09.07.2012
in O.S.A.No.247 of 2012, directed the parties to resolve the dispute through arbitration conducted
by the Nani Palkhivala Foundation. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted pursuant to such order.
The first Respondent herein submitted a statement of claim in April 2013. In such statement of
claim, the first Respondent claimed a sum of Rs.4,25,86,200/-; future rents till the date of handing
over of possession by the Petitioner; 30% interest on rental dues; Rs.50 lakhs towards damages to
amenities; and surrender of _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis possession. The
Petitioner herein submitted a counter statement with a counter claim. In such counter
statement-cum- counter claim, the Petitioner sought to recover the sum of Rs.45 lakhs with interest
thereon at 30% per annum from 30.08.2009. The Arbitral Tribunal framed ten issues based on the
pleadings. Both parties adduced documentary evidence: the first Respondent/claimant exhibited 11
documents as Exhibits C1 to C11; and the Petitioner/respondent exhibited 15 documents as Exhibits
R1 to R15. Neither party adduced oral evidence. Eventually, the arbitral proceedings were disposed
of by the Award.
6. The Petitioner assailed the Award on multiple grounds. The Petitioner contended that the Award
is contrary to public policy and is patently illegal by referring to the documentary evidence on
record. By drawing reference to the Lease Agreement, the Petitioner contended that the Lease
Agreement provided for a security deposit of Rs.18 lakhs. Such security deposit was liable to be
refunded by the lessor upon expiration or termination of the Lease Agreement. The Petitioner relied
upon Clause 24 of the Lease Agreement which enables the lessee / Petitioner to terminate the Lease
Agreement without assigning any reason by providing three months' _____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis advance written notice. The Petitioner also relied upon Clause 30
of the Lease Agreement which stipulates that the first Respondent / lessor shall refund the security
deposit on the date of handing over of keys / vacant possession of the demised premises. In case the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24134374/ 3
Icici Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mrs.P.Usha on 15 December, 2021
security deposit is not refunded as per the Lease Agreement, it was contended that interest at 30%
per annum is payable from the date the security deposit became refundable.
7. The Petitioner also relied upon the communications dated 20.05.2009, 26.08.2009, 30.08.2009
and 31.08.2009 so as to emphasize that it had called upon the first Respondent to take vacant
possession. According to the Petitioner, the rental dues, amenities charges, maintenance, electricity
charges and diesel charges were offered to be paid at the time of handing over possession, but the
first Respondent refused to take possession. Indeed, the Petitioner contended that it was
constrained to file applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act both to ask for security for the
sum of Rs.45 lakhs and also for the appointment of a receiver to take possession of the premises.
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
8. The Petitioner also referred to the Award. After pointing out that the Arbitral Tribunal framed 10
issues, the Petitioner contended that the Arbitral Tribunal committed a patent illegality by refusing
to rely upon the Lease Agreement even for collateral purposes. As regards the Amenities Agreement,
the Petitioner contended that the said Agreement was duly stamped and that it did not require
registration. With regard to the inadequacy of stamp duty on the Lease Agreement, the Petitioner
contended that such defect was curable. In addition, it was contended that the Arbitral Tribunal was
duty bound to impound the document and send it to the Collector for levying the deficit stamp duty
with penalty. Once the deficiency was remedied, the document should have been take into
consideration to adjudicate the dispute. After pointing out that the Lease Agreement was marked as
Exhibit C3 and the Amenities Agreement as Exhibit C2, the Petitioner contended that once a
document is received in evidence and exhibited, it cannot be disregarded because it is inadequately
stamped as per Section 36 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (the Stamp Act).
9. More importantly, as indicated above, the Petitioner contended that the Amenities Agreement did
not require compulsory registration as per Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (the
Registration Act). _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis However, the Arbitral
Tribunal erroneously concluded that the Amenities Agreement was inadequately stamped and that it
required compulsory registration. On such basis, it was contended that the Arbitral Tribunal
disregarded both the Lease Agreement and the Amenities Agreement. As a corollary, the Arbitral
Tribunal failed to take into account the clauses of the Lease Agreement and the Amenities
Agreement as regards refund of the security deposit along with interest thereon.
10. The Petitioner further contended that the Arbitral Tribunal gravely erred in concluding that its
authority was derived entirely from the order of the Division Bench of this Court by which the
dispute was referred to the Nani Palkhivala Foundation. The Petitioner also contended that the
Award is liable to be interfered with because the Arbitral Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction and held
that the first Respondent is entitled to set-off the rental dues and amenities charges, even in the
post-termination period, until the date of handing over of keys and possession by the Petitioner.
11. In support of these contentions, the Petitioner referred to and relied upon the following
judgments in course of oral submissions:

_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(i) Silicon Graphics Systems India Private Limited v. NIDAS Estates Private Limited
and Ors. 182(2011) DLT 753, wherein, at paragraph 18, the Delhi High Court held
that the licensor was required to refund the security deposit at the time of vacant
possession being handed over and that if the licensor refuses to do so, the licensee is
entitled to retain physical possession.
(ii) ICRA Limited v. Associated Journals Limited and Ors. (2008) ILR 1 Delhi 684,
wherein, at paragraph 21, the Delhi High Court concluded that once the lessee offers
to hand over possession and the lessor refuses to take possession, the lessee would be
entitled to remain in possession.
(iii) N.N.Global Mercantile Private Limited and others v. INDO Unique Flame
Limited and others (2021) 4 SCC 379, wherein, at paragraph 36.1, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the Arbitral Tribunal is obligated by Section 33 of the Stamp
Act to impound an insufficiently stamped instrument and direct the parties to pay the
requisite stamp duty and penalty, if any, and obtain an endorsement from the
Collector concerned.
12. These contentions were refuted by the first Respondent. The first Respondent submitted that a
sum of Rs.39,51,000/- was due and _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis payable by
the Petitioner towards rental arrears, amenities charges, maintenance charges, electricity charges,
diesel charges, etc. as of August 2009. Indeed, the first Respondent asserted that the Petitioner also
admitted in contemporaneous correspondence that there were dues towards rent, amenities,
maintenance, etc. By referring to the communication dated 26.08.2009 from the Petitioner, the first
Respondent pointed out that the payments specified therein were not made by the Petitioner. The
first Respondent further submitted that the Lease Agreement was for an aggregate period of nine
years. Therefore, the Lease Agreement was required to be adequately stamped and registered. Since
it was admittedly not adequately stamped or registered, no rights were created in favour of the
parties by such Lease Agreement. As regards the Amenities Agreement, the first Respondent
contended that the said Agreement was supplementary to the Lease Agreement. Therefore, it did not
have an existence independent of the Lease Agreement. Since the Lease Agreement was void, the
Amenities Agreement, which was supplementary thereto and co- terminus therewith, was also void.
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
13. The first Respondent clarified that physical possession of the property was taken by her only on
or about 26.07.2017 pursuant to orders passed by this Court. At such time, by way of security
towards the refund claim, the first Respondent made a deposit of a sum of Rs.12 lakhs. The first
Respondent contended that the Award is certainly not in violation of public policy and cannot be
termed as patently legal or as shocking the conscience of the Court. As regards the conclusion of the
Arbitral Tribunal that it derived authority from the order of the Court, the first Respondent pointed
out that the parties had agreed, under the Lease Agreement, to arbitration by a sole arbitrator to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24134374/ 5
Icici Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mrs.P.Usha on 15 December, 2021
mutually agreed upon by the parties and under the Amenities Agreement to arbitration in Mumbai
by a panel of three arbitrators, whereas the Court referred the dispute to the Nani Palkhivala
Foundation. In effect, it was contended that the reference of the dispute for arbitration was not as
per the relevant clause of the Lease Agreement but on the basis of the order of this Court.
14. Upon considering the rival submissions, several questions arise for consideration. The first
question is whether the Arbitral Tribunal was justified in disregarding the Lease Agreement. This
question was _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis considered and dealt with under
Issues 1 and 2 by the Arbitral Tribunal. Upon examining the Lease Agreement, there is no doubt that
the term of lease is an aggregate period of nine years. Therefore, as per Section 107 of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882, read with Section 17 of the Registration Act, the document required compulsory
registration. The said document bears stamp duty of only Rs.300/-, which is not adequate for a nine
year lease under the Stamp Act. Therefore, the stamp duty is also inadequate. Consequently, the
Arbitral Tribunal was justified in concluding that no rights in respect of the immovable property can
be founded on the Lease Agreement. Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that the Lease
Agreement could be relied upon for collateral purposes as per the proviso to Section 49 of the
Registration Act. However, from the pleadings and the Award, it does not appear that such
contention was raised before the Arbitral Tribunal. In any event, the handing over of vacant
possession is not collateral to a lease. Consequently, the refund of security deposit, which is to be
effected simultaneously with the handing over of vacant possession, cannot be looked at in isolation
and construed as collateral. The contention of the Petitioner that the Lease Agreement was exhibited
in evidence and, therefore, cannot be eschewed may be a valid contention from the
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis perspective of the Stamp Act, but does not
cure the defect of non- registration under the Registration Act or avert the consequences thereof.
15. The next aspect to be considered is the conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal on the Amenities
Agreement. The subject matter of the Amenities Agreement is the provision of the amenities listed
in Annexure-1 thereto. As indicated earlier, these amenities included, inter alia, electricity
connection, diesel generator, electricity fittings, fixtures, furniture, AC Units, router. The Amenities
Agreement was clearly not a document by which interest in immovable property was created,
declared, transferred, limited or extinguished. It also does not fall within the scope of any of the
clauses in sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the Registration Act. Therefore, an agreement of this
nature did not require compulsory registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act. The said
Agreement bears the stamp duty of Rs.300/-, which is adequate because an agreement of this nature
would fall within the residuary entry in Article 5 of Schedule I of the Stamp Act. On this issue, the
Arbitral Tribunal committed an error by treating it in the same manner as the Lease Agreement.
Hence, the material clauses of the Amenities Agreement should be examined so as to determine if
the non- _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis consideration of the same vitiates the
Award. Clause 1 of the Amenities Agreement provided for payment of a sum of Rs.4,50,000 per
month as charges for the provision of amenities and services and Clause 2 stipulated that such
charges shall be paid on or before the 7th of each month. Clause 4 of the Amenities Agreement deals
with the security deposit and is, therefore, of significance. The said Clause is as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24134374/ 6
Icici Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mrs.P.Usha on 15 December, 2021
''4. An interest free refundable Security deposit amounting to Rs.27,00,000/-
(Rupees Twenty Seven Lakhs only) shall be payable to the Lessor upon the signing of
the agreement. The security deposit will be held by the Lessor during the said leave
and licence agreement and this amenities agreement and shall be returned upon the
expiration or earlier termination of the agreement after the deduction of any
reasonable dues or damages if any arising out of and in pursuance of the Leave and
Licence agreement. The Lessor shall refund security deposit on the date of handing
over of keys/Vacant possession of the demised premises by the lessee either by
Demand Draft/ Current Dated cheque. In case if the lessee gives written
communication before 5 days of handing over of the keys / Vacant possession, then
the lessor shall issue a Post dated cheque(PDC) with respect to _____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis last date of termination of the lease agreement.
Furthermore, the Lessor shall pay an interest @ 30% per annum on the security
deposit for such period the security deposit is not refunded to the Lessee in case of
such termination.'' (emphasis added).
16. On perusal of Clause 4, it is evident that a security deposit of Rs.27 lakhs was specified as
payable by the Petitioner. The said clause further specified that the security deposit should be
refunded upon the expiry or termination of the Agreement, after deducting reasonable dues or
damages arising out of the Lease Agreement, on the date of handing over the keys / vacant
possession of the demised premises by the lessee. In addition, it provided for the payment of interest
at 30% per annum on the security deposit if the same is not refunded.
17. The question whether the Award is liable to be interfered with on account of non-consideration
of the Amenities Agreement is examined next. As indicated above, as a consequence of disregarding
the Amenities Agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal did not take into account the clauses thereof,
including Clause 4. On this issue, it should be noticed that even de hors the Lease Agreement and
the Amenities Agreement, the amounts _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
payable monthly towards rent and amenities charges, and the amounts deposited by way of security
deposit are not in dispute. For instance, the communication dated 16.09.2009 from the Petitioner
sets out these amounts with no room for ambiguity. Besides, the communication dated 26.08.2009
from the Petitioner clearly indicates that there are dues towards rent, amenities, maintenance, etc.
from June 2009 onwards. In this factual context, the Arbitral Tribunal examined whether
possession was handed over by the Petitioner especially while dealing with Issues 5 and 6 by looking
at the correspondence between the parties. Upon considering such evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal
recorded, in relevant part, as under while dealing with Issue 5:
“ ....Copies of the correspondence filed as Exhibits show the Respondent using the
terms like “ready to hand over”, “called upon to take over”, etc. Even in his final
written submission the Respondent submitted that they “only held de jure
possession, they are not enjoying the benefits of the premises”, etc. When it comes to
immovable property like a locked office premises, when the key to the premises is still
held by the tenant, it cannot be said that proper possession has been handed over to
the landlord. Issue 5 is answered accordingly.” _____________
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24134374/ 7
Icici Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mrs.P.Usha on 15 December, 2021
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis In this manner, the Arbitral Tribunal proceeded to
enter a finding that the Petitioner had not handed over possession and therefore
continued to be under an obligation to pay rent and amenities charges. These
conclusions were based on a reasonable appraisal of the documentary evidence on
record. Therefore, such conclusion does not warrant interference under Section 34 of
the Arbitration Act. Clause 4 of the Amenities Agreement would have enured to the
benefit of the Petitioner only if the Arbitral Tribunal had concluded that the
Petitioner had handed over or at least taken all possible steps to hand over possession
to the first Respondent. However, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that the Petitioner
did not hand over possession either by delivering physical possession or by handing
over the keys because of pending issues such as rental arrears, maintenance and
amenities charges arrears, etc. Consequently, the error committed by the Arbitral
Tribunal in not taking into account the Amenities Agreement does not vitiate the
Award. In other words, it cannot be construed as an illegality which goes to the root
of the case.
18. The Petitioner contended that the Arbitral Tribunal erred in concluding that it derived authority
and jurisdiction from the judgment of _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the
Division Bench and not from the arbitration clause in the Lease Agreement and Amenities
Agreement. There is merit in this contention inasmuch as the arbitration agreement is required to
be treated as independent of other clauses in an agreement as per Section 16(1)(a) of the Arbitration
Act and, as per clause (b) of the above Section, even if it is concluded that the contract is invalid, it
does not lead to the inference that the arbitration clause is invalid. Nonetheless, the error on this
count is a non-sequitur because the Award cannot be interfered with merely because the Arbitral
Tribunal was under the misconception that it derived authority only from the judgment of the
Division Bench of this Court.
19. Another contention was raised that the Arbitral Tribunal exceeded the scope of authority in
directing payment of rent and amenities charges in the post-termination period. This contention
should be tested by examining the arbitration clause in the Lease Agreement and Amenities
Agreement. Both Clause 45 of the Lease Agreement and Clause 10 of the Amenities Agreement,
which are the arbitration clauses, are wide and use the expression “any dispute”. In addition, both
use the expression “howsoever arising”. In such context, it certainly cannot be concluded that
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the direction to pay rent and amenities
charges in the post-termination period is beyond the scope of reference or beyond jurisdiction.
20. This arbitration and even the Section 34 petition were prior to Act 3 of 2016. Therefore, the law
that applied prior to 23.10.2015 should be applied. Under the then prevailing legal regime, an
arbitral award could be interfered with if it conflicts with public policy, including on account of
being patently illegal. While the Petitioner contended that the Award is liable to be interfered with
by citing Delhi Development Authority v. R.S. Sharma and Company, New Delhi (2008) 13 SCC 80
and Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (2015) 3 SCC 49, the said judgments instruct
that an award is patently illegal if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of
the Court. The Award in the case at hand may contain errors in certain respects, but when viewed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24134374/ 8
Icici Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mrs.P.Usha on 15 December, 2021
dholistically does not qualify as being patently illegal or as shocking the judicial conscience.
Therefore, the Petitioner's challenge fails.
21. By the operative part of the Award, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that the first Respondent is
entitled to set-off amounts due and payable towards rent and amenities charges, at Rs.7,50,000/-
per month, from the security deposit of Rs.45 lakhs until the date of handing over of
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis possession by the Petitioner to the first
Respondent. Since the Award was pronounced on 18.11.2013, it proceeded on the assumption that
after setting-off such amounts, a portion of the security deposit would be refundable to the
Petitioner. Accordingly, the balance of the security deposit was directed to be paid by the first
Respondent to the Petitioner herein. However, the Petitioner challenged the Award before this
Court, and did not hand over physical possession until about 26.07.2017. As a corollary, the rent and
amenities charges would, in all likelihood, have exceeded the security deposit, if computed at
Rs.7,50,000 per month up to the date of hand over, as indicated in the Award. This may result in a
dispute which the Award did not envisage or deal with. The Award also enables the parties to
institute separate proceedings as regards damages to the leased premises.
22. For reasons set out above, the Award, including the operative part thereof, does not call for
interference. Consequently, the first Respondent is entitled to file an appropriate application for
payment out of the amounts deposited by the first Respondent as a condition for taking possession.
However, open issues such as claims or disputes in relation to amounts due and payable by the
Petitioner to the first Respondent towards rental dues, amenities charges, maintenance charges,etc.
after setting-off the _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis entire security deposit or
claims for damages may be dealt with by the parties in accordance with law. O.P.No.171 of 2014 is
disposed of on the above terms without any order as to costs.
