JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
A. Guneshwar Sharma, J.
[1] Heard Mr. L. Diko, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Phungyo Zingkhei, learned Dy.
Government Advocate, appearing for respondent Nos. 1 , 2 & 3; and Mr. S. Vijayanand, learned Sr.
PCCG, appearing for respondent No. 4. [2] By the present petition, under Article 226 of the
Constitution, the detenu has challenged the detention order dated 08.09.2022 issued by the Special
Secretary(Home), Government of Manipur, detaining him under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (PIT- ND&PS), 1988.
[3] The points for determination involved in the present petition are:
(a) Whether the detention order ought to be confirmed before expiry of the period of
3 months for further detention as mandated by Article 22(4) of the Constitution?
(b) Whether unexplained delay in disposal of the representation submitted by the
detenu vitiates the detention as provided under Article 22(5) of the Constitution?
[4] Mr. L. Diko, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that the petitioner/detenu was arrested
on 28.04.2022 in connection with F.I.R. No. 71(4)2022 SJM PS U/S 21(b)/60(3) ND&PS Act on
alleged possession of heroin No. 4 from his vehicle and he was remanded to police custody and then
to judicial custody. Vide order dated 31.08.2022, passed by the learned Judge, Special Court
(ND&PS), Manipur in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 239 of 2022, the detenu was released on default bail
as the prosecution could not file charge-sheet within the stipulated time. Thereafter, vide impugned
order dated 08.09.2022, the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, issued a detention
order detaining the detenu under Section 3(1) of PIT-ND&PS Act for preventing him from further
involvement in illicit trafficking of drugs and after released on bail he would likely continue with the
illegal activities. By letter dated 12.09.2022, the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur,
furnished grounds of detention under Section 3(3) of PIT-NDPS Act to the detenu. Vide order dated
23.12.2022, the Commissioner (Home), Govt. of Manipur, confirmed the detention order dated
08.09.2022 and fixed the period of detention for 12(twelve) months from the date of detention. Mr.
L. Diko, learned counsel, also submitted that the detenu make common representation dated
01.03.2023 to the Deputy Secretary (PIT-ND&PS), Government of India and the Chief Secretary,
Government of Manipur, through the Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, for revocation
of the detention order. Vide order dated 10.03.2023 issued by the Commissioner (Home),
Government of Manipur, the representation dated 01.03.2023 submitted by the detenu was

Md. Nurul Huda (32 Yrs.) vs Commissioner (Home) Govt. Of Manipur on 21 June, 2023
rejected. It is submitted that at the time of filing of the writ petition, there is no information
regarding the disposal of the representation by the Central Government. The detention order is
challenged mainly on the ground that there is total non-application of mind, mandatory provisions
of the PIT-ND&PS Act have not been complied, the Central Government has failed to dispose of the
representation. [5] The State Government filed counter affidavit and Mr. Phungo Zingkhei, learned
Dy. Government Advocate, submits that the detenu was arrested for possession and trafficking of
the illegal drugs and after release on bail , he was continuing the illegal activities and for this reason
he was detained after considering materials submitted before the detaining authority. It is also
submitted that there is no lapse on the part of the State Government in dealing with the detention
and the disposal of the representation. Representation dated 01.03.2023 submitted by the detenu
was received on 03.03.2023 from the IG(Prisons) and a copy of the same was forwarded to the
Central Government on 06.03.2023 and parawise comment was also furnished to the Government
of India on 10.03.2023. Parawise comment was received by the State Government on 09.03.2023
and the representation of the detenu was disposed of as rejected by order dated 10.03.2023. Mr.
Phungyo Zingkhei, learned Dy. Government Advocate, submits that there is no delay on the part of
the State Government and the writ petition may be rejected.
[6] Mr. S. Vijayanand, learned Sr. PCCG for the Central Government, relying upon the affidavit
submits that the representation dated 01.03.2023 submitted by the detenu was received from the
State Government by e-mail dated 06.03.2023 and the parawise comments were received from the
State Government by e-mail on 10.03.2023. Thereafter, the matter was submitted to the competent
authority i.e., Secretary (Revenue) on 16.03.2023 and after perusing all the materials on record,
Secretary (Revenue) rejected the representation vide memorandum dated 21.03.2023. Mr. S.
Vijayanand, learned Sr. PCCG, submits that time taken by the Central Government in disposal of the
representation is not fatal and the same is due to normal office process and he prays that the writ
petition may be rejected. [7] Considered the submissions made by the parties, perused the materials
on record and the relevant law in this regard. Grounds of detention were furnished within 5 days as
stipulated under Section 3(3) of PIT-ND&PS Act and the detention order was furnished to the
Central Government within 10 days as stipulated under Section 3(2) of the PIT-ND&PS Act. On the
advice of the Advisory Board vide opinion/report dated 22.11.2022, the detention order dated
08.09.2022 was confirmed by State authority vided order dated 23.12.2022. Representation dated
01.03.2023 was submitted by the detenu through the Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa,
and the same was received on 03.03.2023 from the office of IG(Prisons) and the parawise comments
were received on 09.03.2023 and the representation was rejected vide order dated 10.03.2023. This
Court is of the opinion that there is no delay on the part of the State Government while disposing the
representation submitted by the detenu.
[8] However, there has been a serious lapse on the part of the State Government for its failure to
confirm the detention order dated 08.09.2022 within the stipulated period of 3 months as
mandated by Article 22(4) of the Constitution. In a catena of cases, Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that the opinion of the Advisory of existence of the sufficient grounds for detaining the detenu
beyond the period of 3 months, should be confirmed by the detaining authority before expiry of the
stipulated period. Otherwise, any detention beyond the period of three months is illegal. Important
case laws in this regard may be considered.

Md. Nurul Huda (32 Yrs.) vs Commissioner (Home) Govt. Of Manipur on 21 June, 2023
[9] In the case of Ujjal Mandal v. State of W.B., (1972) 1 SCC 456, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
the detention order is valid only for three months as mandated under Article 22(4) of the
Constitution and unless it is confirmed before the expiry of three months, further detention would
be without any authority of law. Relevant para are reproduced below:
8. Article 22(4) of the Constitution has specified the maximum limit of initial
detention, and detention for a longer period than three months can only be made on
the basis of the report of the Board. The Act authorises a possible detention of more
than three months. It is because the appropriate Government wants to detain a
person for more than three months that the matter is referred to the Board and it is
only when the Board makes its report that the appropriate Government can fix the
period of detention under sub-section (1) of Section 12.
So, when the Government receives the report of the Board stating that there is sufficient cause for
detention of a person, if the Government wants to detain him for a period beyond three months, it
has to pass an order or make a decision under Section 12(1) to confirm the order of detention. The
confirmation of the detention order without anything more would result in an automatic
continuation of the detention, even if there is no separate decision to continue the detention for any
specific period as held by this Court in Dattatreya Moreshwar Pangarkar v. State of Bombay. When
Section 12(1) of the Act speaks of "and continue the detention of the person concerned for such
period as it thinks fit", it can only mean continuance of detention from the point of time at which
detention would become illegal if the order of detention is not confirmed, namely, the expiry of three
months from the date of detention. It would not be necessary to confirm the order of detention even
after the receipt of the report of the Board by the Government if the Government only wants to
continue the detention for the period of three months from the date of detention, as the initial order
of detention would authorise the continuance of detention for that period without any confirmation.
Confirmation is necessary only to continue the detention after the expiry of three months. If that be
so, it stands to reason to hold that the order of detention must be confirmed before the expiry of the
three months.
9. To put the matter in a nut-shell: the State Government has power under the Act to detain a person
without trial beyond a period of three months but limited to a period of one year. That power the
State Government may exercise on the receipt of the opinion of the Board that there is sufficient
cause for the detention. When the State Government receives that opinion, it has still the option to
exercise the power and to continue the detention beyond the period of three months or not.
Confirmation is the exercise of the power to continue the detention after the expiry of three months.
Unless that power is exercised within the period of three months from the date of detention, the
detention after the expiry of that period would be without the authority of the Law.
[10] In the case of Deb Sadhan Roy v. State of W.B.: (1972) 1 SCC 308, Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that no person can be detained for any period beyond three months or for any period thereafter up
to twelve months unless the Board's opinion is confirmed within three months from the date of
initial detention. [11] In the case of Shibapada Mukherjee v. State of W.B.: (1974) 3 SCC 50, Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the detention order has to be confirmed by the detaining authority before
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67370293/ 4
Md. Nurul Huda (32 Yrs.) vs Commissioner (Home) Govt. Of Manipur on 21 June, 2023
expiry of 3 months period after receiving the Board's report, otherwise further detention beyond 3
months is invalid. [12] In the case of Nirmal Kumar Khandelwal v. Union of India: (1978) 2 SCC
508, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the if the detention order is not confirmed within the
period of 3 months as mandated by Article 22(4) of the Constitution after receiving the opinion of
the Advisory Board finding sufficient grounds for detention, further detention will be without any
authority. Para 9 & 10 are reproduced below:
"9. We do not find any merit in the contention that since the period prescribed for the
Advisory Board to make its report has been increased from 10 weeks (as prescribed
under MISA) to 11 weeks in COFEPOSA, leaving only a short period for the
Government to take a decision under Section 8( f), the legislative intent was that the
order of confirmation of the detention and its continuance could be made after the
expiry of three months from the date of the detention. It is true that in certain
situation when the Advisory Board makes its report in favour of the detention just
before the expiry of 11 weeks from the date of the detention, the time left to the
Government for taking a decision as to the confirmation of the detention and its
continuance would be hardly two weeks. That only shows the anxiety on the part of
the legislature to ensure that the Government continues the preventive detention of a
person beyond three months after due application of mind and for that purpose acts
with utmost promptitude. The law does not lend its authority to the continuance of
the detention even for a day more than the initial period of three months if the
Government does not take a decision for that purpose on the report of the Advisory
Board within three months of the commencement of the detention.
10. There is no reason to doubt the law enunciated by this Court in the aforesaid
decisions. Respectfully following the ratio of those decisions, we hold that since no
order of confirmation of the detention was made under clause (/) of Section 8 within
three months of the date of detention by the appropriate Government, further
detention of the petitioner after the expiry of that period is without the authority of
law."
[13] From the above decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it is the settled proposition of law with
regard to the mandatory provision of Article 22(4) of the Constitution that an order of detention
issued under the preventive detention law will not be valid beyond a period of 3 months, if the
opinion/report of the Advisory Board for existence of sufficient cause for such detention is issued
before the expiration of the period of 3 months from the date of detention and that such
opinion/report is confirmed by the detaining authority before the expiration of the stipulated period
of 3 months.
[14] In the present case, the detention order was issued on 08.09.2022. The Advisory Board held its
sitting on 17.11.2022 and made the opinion/report on 22.11.2022. After considering the report of the
Board, the detention order dated 08.09.2022 was confirmed by the State authority vide order dated
23.12.2022. It is seen that the opinion/report of the Board was made on 22.11.2022 before expiry of
the stipulated period of 3 months, but the State authority confirmed the detention order only on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67370293/ 5
Md. Nurul Huda (32 Yrs.) vs Commissioner (Home) Govt. Of Manipur on 21 June, 2023
23.12.2022, ie, after 15 days of the expiration of the stipulated period of 3 months. There is no
controversy in this regard that the detention order should be confirmed by the detaining authority
before the expiry of 3 months as contemplated by Article 22(4) of the Constitution. We are of the
considered view that as the confirmation order was issued after expiry of 3 months from the date of
initial detention, further detention beyond 08.012.2022 is without any authority. The detention
order is liable to be set aside on this ground alone. [15] On the other hand, the representation dated
01.03.2023 submitted by the detenu was received by the Central Government on 06.03.2023 by
e-mail and the parawise comments were received on 10.03.2023 from the State Government by e-
mail. On 16.03.2023, the file was put up before the competent authority i.e. Secretary (Revenue),
Government of India, for passing an appropriate order and vide Memorandum dated 21.03.2023,
the representation dated 01.03.2023 submitted by the detenu was rejected. It took 20 days for the
Central Government in disposal of the representation. However, the period from 01.03.2023 to
06.03.2023 is explained as the time take in receiving the representation from the State Government.
Further, the period from 06.03.2023 to 10.03.2023 has been explained as time taken in receiving
parawise comments from the State Government. Hence, the Central Government took 11 effective
days in disposal of the representation. There is no explanation for pending of the file for 6 days in
the Ministry and 5 days' time taken by the Secretary (Revenue) in passing the memorandum dated
21.03.2023. In short, delay of 11 days has not been explained by the Central Government while
disposing the representation.
[16] In the case of Rajammal vs. State of Tamil Nadu reported as 1999 (1) SCC 417, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that though no period is prescribed by Article 22 of the Constitution for the
decision to be taken on the representation, the word 'as soon as may be' in clause 5 of Article 22
conveyed the message that representation should be considered and disposed of at the earliest. It
was further held that authority is permitted to explain the delay occasioned in the disposal of the
representation. If the delay is not explained properly, the detention order is vitiated for violation of
the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 21 and 22(5) of the Constitution.
[17] In the case of Sarabjeet Singh Mokha Vs. the District Magistrate, Jabalpur reported in
MANU/SC/1011/2021, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that detention order can be invalidated on
the grounds of- (1) unexplained delay on the part of the authority in deciding the representation,
and (2) failure of the authority to communicate the rejection of the representation in timely manner.
[18] In a very recent case of Pramod Singla Vs. Union of India (UOI) & ors., reported in
MANU/SC/0349/2023, the Honb'e Supreme Court observed in para 44 as follows:
'44. .... Every procedural rigidity, must be followed in entirety by the Government in
cases of preventive detention, and every lapse in procedure must give rise to a benefit
to the case of the detenue. The Courts, in circumstances of preventive detention, are
conferred with the duty that has been given the utmost importance by the
Constitution, which is the protection of individual and civil liberties. .....' [19] From
the above decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it is clear that compliance of the
statutory provisions should be construed strictly and for any lapses on the part of the
authorities, the benefit of the same be given to the detenu. This principle is
propounded on the presumption that in a preventive detention a person is confined
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67370293/ 6
Md. Nurul Huda (32 Yrs.) vs Commissioner (Home) Govt. Of Manipur on 21 June, 2023
in custody without facing a trial and on the basis of the subjective satisfaction of the
authority only.
[20] In the present case, Central Government cannot explain the effective period of 11
days taken while disposing the representation submitted by the detenu.
As already observed above, the State Government also did not confirm the detention
order within the stipulated period of 3 months as prescribed by Article 22(4) of the
Constitution. In the circumstance, we are of the considered opinion that detention
order cannot be sustained in the eyes of the law as it infringes the fundamental rights
conferred on a citizen by Articles 21 & 22 of the Constitution.
[21] Accordingly, detention order dated 08.09.2022 and the confirmation order
dated 23.12.2022 are set-aside. The detenu Md. Nurul Huda, be immediately released
from detention forthwith, if not required in any other case.
[22] Writ petition is allowed.
[23] No costs.
[24] Send a copy of this order to the Commissioner (Home), Government of
Manipur and the Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail Sajiwa for information and
necessary compliance.
