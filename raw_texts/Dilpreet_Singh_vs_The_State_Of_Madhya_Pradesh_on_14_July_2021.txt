Dilpreet Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 July, 2021
Learned counsel for the State in view of the order dated 5.9.2020 passed by the Coordinate Bench of
this Court in M.Cr.C. No.26957/2020, in which the offences under Section 3/7 of Essential
Commodities Act are held as bailable, fairly conceded that all the offences alleged against the
applicant are bailable and triable by Judicial Magistrate First Class.
Considering the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties, nature of offence
registered against the applicant, which are triable by t h e Judicial Magistrate First Class and period
of custody i. e. since 13.5.2021, I am of the considered view that it is a fit case for grant of bail to the
applicant. Hence, without commenting on merits, this application is allowed.
It is directed that the applicant shall be released on bail on furnishing his personal bond in the sum
of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac only) along with one solvent surety of the like amount to the
satisfaction of the trial Court to appear before the court on the dates given by the concerned Court.
It is further directed that applicant shall comply with the provisions of Section 437 (3) of Cr. P. C. I n
view of the outbreak of 'Corona Virus disease (COVID-19)' the concerned Jail Authority is directed
to follow the directions/ guidelines issued by the Government with regard to COVID-19 before
releasing the applicant.
This M.Cr.C. stands allowed and disposed of.
C. C. as per rules.
