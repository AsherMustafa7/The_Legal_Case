23.03.2016 PASSED IN MVC NO.3837/2013 ON THE FILE
OF THE 22ND ADDITIONAL SMALL CAUSES JUDGE, 20TH
ACCM, MEMBER, MACT, BENGALURU, PARTLY ALLOWING
THE CLAIM PETITION FOR COMPENSATION AND SEEKING
ENHANCEMENT OF COMPENSATION.
THESE APPEALS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR JUDGMENT ON 14.10.2020, COMING ON
FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF JUDGMENT THIS DAY, SACHIN
SHANKAR MAGADUM J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
The captioned appeals are filed challenging the judgment and award dated 23.3.2016 passed in
MVC.No.3837/2013 by the XXII Addl.Small Causes Judge and XX A.C.M.M. & Member, MACT,
Bengaluru. MFA.No.5149/2016 is filed by the Insurer of the tempo-traveler questioning the
negligence and also the quantum of compensation awarded. MFA.No.4274/2016 is filed by the
claimants questioning the quantum of compensation awarded.
2. For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to as per their rank before the Tribunal.
3. The brief facts of the case are as under:
The claimants in MFA.No.4274/2016 filed a claim petition contending that on
29.03.2013 at about 1.30 a.m. the deceased was travelling in a tempo traveler bearing
Regn.No.KA-04-B-9273 on NH.4 road. When the tempo-traveler reached
Haraganhalli village, Harihara, on NH-4 road, the driver of the offending lorry
bearing Regn.No.KA-17-B-2779 came from opposite direction i.e. from Ranebennur
side towards Bengaluru, on one way road in a rash and negligent manner and dashed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198632832/ 5
M/S United India Insurance Company ... vs Smt Anitha on 11 December, 2020
against the tempo-traveler. Due to the impact, the deceased sustained fatal injuries
and died on the spot. The appellants have contended that at the time of accident, the
deceased was aged about 45 years and was earning Rs.32,000/- per month as
employee of 'A' grade at K.E.B. and was contributing his full earnings to the
maintenance of the family. The claimants are facing severe financial problems and
their lives have become dark and miserable. Hence, they filed claim petition claiming
compensation of Rs.25 Lakhs.
Inspite of service of notice, the first and third respondents who are the owners of the
lorry and tempo traveler respectively remained absent and were placed exparte.
The insurer of the offending lorry which was arrayed as second respondent contested
the proceedings and stoutly denied the entire averments made in the claim petition.
It was specifically contended in the written statement that the driver of the offending
vehicle which was insured with the second respondent-Insurance company did not
possess valid and effective driving licence. The liability, if any, is limited to the terms
and conditions of the policy. Further, contended that there was no rashness or
negligence on the part of the driver of the lorry. It is the driver of the tempo-traveler
drove the same in a rash and negligent manner without observing the oncoming
vehicles on the road and came to the centre of the road and dashed against the lorry
and caused the accident. The petition is bad for non-joinder of proper and necessary
parties to the petition. Further, denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased.
On these set of defences, the Insurance company has sought for dismissal of the claim
petition against them with cost.
The insurer of the tempo-traveler which was arrayed as fourth respondent, who is the
appellant in MFA.No.5149/2016 contested the proceedings and stoutly denied the
entire averments made in the claim petition. The liability, if any, is limited to the
terms and conditions of the policy. The claim of the claimants is highly exorbitant
and unreasonable. Further contended that as per the police records, the alleged
accident was caused by the driver of the lorry bearing Regn.No.KA-17-B-2779 and the
police have rightly filed charge sheet against the lorry driver. The petition is bad for
non-joinder of proper and necessary parties to the petition. Further, denied the age,
income, occupation of the deceased. On these set of defences, the fourth
respondent-Insurance company has sought for dismissal of the claim petition against
them with cost.
The Tribunal based on the pleadings, framed the following issues:
"1. Whether the petitioners prove that deceased P. Chandrashekar died due to
accidental injuries arising out of accident alleged to have been taken place on
29.03.2013 at about 1.30 a.m., near Haraganahalli village, NH-4, Harihar Taluk due
to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Lorry bearing Reg.No.KA-07-B-
2779?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198632832/ 6
M/S United India Insurance Company ... vs Smt Anitha on 11 December, 2020
2. Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so, what amount and
from whom?
3. What order or award?
Additional Issue No.1
1. Whether the respondent no.2 proves that, the accident took place due to negligence
on the part of the driver of the Tempo-Traveller bearing Reg.No.KA-04-B- 9273?"
In support of their contentions, the claimants got examined claimant No.1 as P.W.1 and two
witnesses as P.Ws.2 and 3 and the fourth claimant got herself examined as P.W.4 and got marked
Exs.P1 to P17. In support of their respective case, the second respondent has got examined two
witnesses as R.W.1 and 3 and got marked Ex.R1 and the fourth respondent examined one witness as
R.W.2 and got marked Exs.R2 to R5.
The Tribunal on appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence on record has answered issue
No.1 in the negative and additional issue No.1 in the affirmative holding that the accident took place
due to negligence on the part of the driver of the tempo- traveler bearing Regn.No.KA-04-B-9273.
The Tribunal while assessing the compensation, by taking note of the salary certificate as per Ex.P17
has assessed the income of the deceased at Rs.30,637/- per month. Deducting Rs.200/- towards
professional tax, the monthly income is arrived at Rs.30,437/- per month and Rs.3,65,244/- per
annum. After deducting 10% towards income tax, the Tribunal has assessed the income of the
deceased at Rs.3,28,720/- per annum. By deducting 1/4th towards personal expenses and applying
the multiplier of 13, the Tribunal has awarded Rs.32,05,020/- towards loss of dependency. Under
conventional heads, Rs.85,000/- is awarded and in all, the Tribunal has awarded total
compensation of Rs.32,90,020/- with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of petition
till its realisation. Being aggrieved by the same, both the Insurance Company and the claimants have
preferred these appeals seeking enhancement.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant in MFA.No.5149/2016 who is the insurer of the
tempo traveler, insofar as negligence is concerned, contends that the Tribunal without considering
the evidence of the parties more particularly the evidence of the Investigating Officer and the driver
of the tempo-traveler, contents of FIR, charge sheet and mahazar and only relying on the rough
sketch prepared by the police has proceeded to hold that the accident occurred due to the rash and
negligent driving of the driver of the tempo traveler. The sketch drawn is contrary to what is stated
in mahazar and other documents like FIR and complaint and as such the Tribunal ought to have
ignored the contents of sketch. Hence, learned counsel for the Insurance Company submits that the
finding recorded on Issue No.1 and additional Issue No.1 suffers from serious infirmities and hence,
the same requires to be re-examined by this Court.
On quantum, the learned counsel for the Insurance company would submit that the compensation
awarded under the head of loss of dependency is on the higher side. Even under conventional heads,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198632832/ 7
M/S United India Insurance Company ... vs Smt Anitha on 11 December, 2020
learned counsel submits that the Tribunal erred in adding 85,000/- which is improper and needs to
be set aside by this Court. Further, the Tribunal has not properly deducted 20% of the earnings of
the deceased and erred in deducting only 10% and thereby erred in taking Rs.3,26,720/- as net
income of the deceased. Therefore, learned counsel submits that the total compensation awarded by
the Tribunal is liable to be interfered with.
5. Per contra, learned counsel for the claimants in MFA.No.4274/2016 would submit to this Court
that Tribunal has not added future prospects while determining the loss of dependency. The amount
awarded under the head of loss of dependency and loss of consortium and loss of estate is on the
lower side. On these set of grounds, learned counsel would submit that the judgment and award
needs to be modified on the disputed question of negligence as well as quantum.
On negligence, the learned counsel would support the arguments advanced by the counsel for the
insurer of the tempo traveler.
6. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the second respondent-insurer of the offending lorry
would submit that the finding arrived at by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 and Additional Issue No.1 is
in accordance with law and does not suffer from any illegality.
7. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties. Perused the pleadings of the parties and
reassessed the entire oral and documentary evidence on record.
8. Regarding Negligence:
This Court while examining the negligence in MFA.No.1884/2016 arising out of the
same accident has held that it is the driver of the offending lorry who was responsible
for the accident and accordingly, the entire negligence is fixed on the driver of the
offending lorry. In view of the negligence fixed on the driver of the offending lorry,
the finding recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 and additional Issue No.1 is set
aside and accordingly, the negligence is fixed on the driver of the offending lorry
owned by the first respondent.
9. Regarding quantum:
In the present case on hand, the deceased was aged 46 years and was permanently
employed and drawing salary of Rs.30,637/- per month and Rs.3,67,644/- per
annum. Towards professional tax Rs.2,400/- has to be deducted at the rate of
Rs.200/- per month, which works out to Rs.3,67,644 - Rs.2,400 = Rs. 3,65,244/-.
The Tribunal has deducted 10% towards income tax from the total annual income,
which is improper. For the assessment year 2013-14, upto Rs.2,00,000/- there is
exemption. In excess of Rs.2,00,000/- and upto Rs.5,00,000/-, 10% slab is
a p p l i c a b l e . T h e r e f o r e , o n t h e b a l a n c e a m o u n t i . e .
Rs.3,65,244-Rs.2,00,000=Rs.1,65,244/-, 10% is taxable, which works out to
Rs.16,524/-. After deducting the said amount, the total annual income of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198632832/ 8
M/S United India Insurance Company ... vs Smt Anitha on 11 December, 2020
deceased comes to Rs.3,65,244-Rs.16,524= Rs.3,48,990/-. The Tribunal while
assessing the compensation under the head of loss of dependency has not added
future prospects. Hence, the determination of the compensation under the head of
loss of dependency is opposed to the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
National Insurance Company .vs. Pranay Sethi and others [2017 ACJ 2700]. In the
present case on hand, admittedly, the deceased was aged 46 years and was
permanently employed and hence, 30% needs to be added towards future prospects,
which works out to Rs.3,48,990x30/100= Rs.1,04,697/-. By adding the said amount
to the total income it works out to Rs.3,65,244+Rs.1,04,697= Rs.4,69,941/-. After
deducting 1/4th towards personal expenses of the deceased and applying the
multiplier of 13, the total loss of dependency is re-assessed at Rs.4,69,991x13x3/4=
Rs.45,81,925/-.
Under conventional heads, the claimants are entitled to Rs.1,90,000/- i.e.
Rs.40,000/- towards spousal consortium to the first claimant, Rs.40,000/- each
towards parental consortium to the second and third claimants and Rs.40,000/-
towards filial consortium to the fourth claimant and Rs.30,000/- towards loss of
estate and funeral expenses.
Thus, the total compensation re-determined by this Court comes to Rs.47,71,925/-, to
which the claimants are held entitled with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from
the date of petition till its realisation.
10. Hence, the following:
ORDER
1. The appeal filed by the Insurance Company in MFA.No.5149/2016 is allowed in
part and the appeal filed by the claimants in MFA.No.4274/2016 is allowed.
2. The impugned judgment and award is modified fixing the negligence on the driver
of the offending lorry owned by the first respondent.
3. The compensation awarded is modified and enhanced to Rs.47,71,925/- as against
Rs.32,90,020/- awarded by the Tribunal with Interest at the rate of 6% per annum
from the date of petition till its realisation, which the insurer of the lorry and the
owner namely respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally held liable to pay.
4. The second respondent-insurer of the lorry in question shall deposit the amount
determined as aforesaid before the Tribunal within 90 days from the date of receipt
of the certified copy of the judgment and order.
5. The portion of the order of the Tribunal inasmuch as apportionment and
disbursement remains intact.
