2. I.A. No.2 of 2019 has been filed on behalf of the appellant for grant of leave to file and pursue this
criminal appeal.
The applicant-appellant claims himself to be adopted son of the deceased persons and Khushrupur
P.S. Case No.51 of 2002 was lodged on the basis of his fardbeyan. Therefore, in the aforesaid
circumstance, the applicant-appellant is permitted to file and pursue this criminal appeal and,
accordingly, I.A. No.2 of 2019 stands disposed of.
3. I.A. No.3442 of 2018 has been filed on behalf of the appellant, under Section 5 of the Limitation
Act, for condonation of delay of only one day in filing this criminal appeal.
The delay in filing this criminal appeal is condoned, on the grounds mentioned in I.A. No.3442 of
2018 itself.
Accordingly, the above stated I.A. No.3442 of 2018 stands disposed of.
4. This criminal appeal has been preferred against the Judgment of acquittal dated 21.07.2018
passed by the learned 6th Additional Sessions Judge, Patna City, Patna, in Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.1309 of 2018 dt.21-02-2019 Sessions Trial No.769 of 2003, by which and whereunder
he acquitted the respondents no.1 to 4 from the charges framed against them for the offences
punishable under Sections 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code.
5. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant submits that the learned trial court has committed
error in acquitting the respondents no.1 to 4, particularly, in the circumstance, when the strong
circumstantial evidence was available against the private respondents no.1 to 4 to prove their guilt.
He submits that the private respondents no.1 to 4 are agnates of the deceaseds and, as a matter of
fact, the deceased persons had adopted the appellant as son and wanted to give their entire
properties to the appellant but prior to the alleged occurrence, the respondents no.1 to 4 had
threatened both the deceased and, subsequently, they committed the murder of both the deceased.
He submits that the learned trial court ignored the above stated circumstances, while writing the
Judgment of acquittal.
6. On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor supports the impugned Judgment of
acquittal, submitting that the prosecution could not succeed to bring the sufficient circumstantial
evidence to prove the guilt of the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1309 of 2018 dt.21-02-2019
private respondents no.1 to 4 and, therefore, the learned trial court rightly acquitted the private
respondents no.1 to 4.
7. From perusal of the impugned Judgment, we find that the informant claimed in his fardbeyan
that his 'Phufa', namely, Yadunandan Singh, and 'Phua', namely, Punia Devi, were issueless and they
had adopted him as adopted son. He further claimed that one year back to the alleged occurrence,
the private respondents no.1 to 4, who happened to be the so-called agnates of his 'Phufa', had given
threatening to kill him and pressurized the deceased Yadunandan Singh to adopt the respondent
no.1 as adopted son but his 'Phufa' refused to buckle upon the pressure of the private respondents

no.1 to 4 and, subsequently, he purchased one Katha land in the name of the informant. The
informant further claimed that on the alleged date of the occurrence, he had gone to his native
village and got information that his 'Phufa' and 'Phua' were killed, while they were sleeping on the
roof of their house. The impugned Judgment further goes to show that, altogether, 9 prosecution
witnesses were examined and almost all the material witnesses repeated the same story, as
mentioned in the fardbeyan of the informant. Therefore, it is obvious that the prosecution claimed
that prior to one year of the alleged occurrence, the respondents Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.1309 of 2018 dt.21-02-2019 no.1 to 4 had given threatening to kill the deceaseds and the private
respondents no.1 to 4 wanted to grab the lands of the deceaseds and that was the reason, they
committed the murder of the deceaseds. The learned trial court mentioned in the impugned
Judgment that the aforesaid circumstances were sufficient to prove the guilt of the private
respondents no.1 to 4.
8. We are of the opinion that the learned trial court rightly held that the above stated circumstances
were not sufficient to prove the guilt of the private respondents no.1 to 4.
9. It is well settled principle of law that innocence of an accused is presumed and the aforesaid
presumption becomes more stronger after the Judgment of acquittal. Furthermore, it is well settled
principle of law that if two views are possible, the view taken by the trial court cannot be discarded,
unless the said view is perverse and absurd as well as against the materials, available on the record.
10. In the present case, there is nothing on the record to come on this finding that the view taken by
the learned trial court is absurd as well as perverse and against the materials, available on the
record. Therefore, in the aforesaid circumstances, we do not find any ground to interfere into the
impugned Judgment of acquittal.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1309 of 2018 dt.21-02-2019
11. Accordingly, this criminal appeal stands dismissed on the admission stage itself.
