counsel for the State and learned counsel for the private
respondents.
In this case, the petitioners are challenging the
award dated 26.02.2015 passed in Reference Case No. 1 of
1997, by which the Labour Court has given direction for
reinstatement of private respondents along with full back wages.
As per the claim of the workmen, they were
working with M/S. A.B. Gas Agency, Aurangabad, under the
dealership of Hindustan Petroleum Limited. It has been alleged
that they were not getting the minimum wages fixed by the State
Government, no service card, no attendance register etc. were
maintained at the said Gas agency, so the workmen requested
for redressal of the grievance. When it was not redressed, an
industrial dispute was raised in connection with the industrial
dispute, led to initiation of conciliation. The Gas agency
remained closed from 15.12.1994 to 16.12.1994 and on
17.12.1994
when the workmen returned to work, they were asked to leave the premises of the Gas agency,
thereby terminated the services of the workmen without compliance of the provision of the
Industrial Disputes Act. Accordingly, Industrial Disputes was referred to Labour Court for
adjudication by Government of Bihar vide Notification No. Patna High Court CWJC No.18188 of
2015 dt.05-08-2019 3/D1-601/95 L & E-1120 dated 19.11.1996 has referred the following disputes
for adjudication.
"Whether removal from work of Sri Vijay Kumar Singh, Kamta Prasad Singh, Naresh
Prasad Singh, Arvind Kumar, Pramod Kumar Sinha, Ram Pukar Singh and Md. Ayub
by the Management of M/S. A.B. Gas Agency, Aurangabad is justified if not what
relief the workmen are entitled to?

The parties have led their documentary as well as oral evidences and finally the
Labour Court after examining the materials has recorded that these workmen were
terminated from the service without their being compliance of Section 25F of the
Industrial Disputes Act, nor any inquiry was conducted before their
termination/dismissal, granted relief of reinstatement without full back wages.
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that original owner has died and one
Shyam Kishore Prasad, who is also one of the partner of that agency has tendered his
resignation and withdrawn the registration also.
Learned counsel for the private respondents submits that on 17.12.1994 the private
respondents were terminated and said Shyam Kishore Prasad tendered his
resignation on 02.09.1997 and he has again withdrawn the same and the partnership
was dissolved in 1998. Patna High Court CWJC No.18188 of 2015 dt.05-08-2019
However, from the award it does not appear that these facts were raised before the
Labour Court as no issue in this regard has been framed nor any finding has been
given by the Labour Court. Admittedly, it is failure to comply the provision of Section
25F of the Industrial Disputes Act.
Learned counsel for the petitioners also submits that as the Gas agency has been
closed and as such, the question of reinstatement of the private respondents does not
arise, only the workmen can claim some amount of compensation.
Considering the aforesaid fact that the Gas agency has been closed, so the question of
reinstatement of privates respondents does not arise. Hence, the impugned award
dated 26.02.2015 passed by the Labour Court is modified to the extent in place of
reinstatement with back-wages, the Management would pay Rs.75,000/- by way of
compensation to each of the workmen-private respondents.
Accordingly, the impugned award is modified to the extent indicated above.
At this stage, learned counsel for the Gas agency submits that the matter is pending
for execution before the Executing Munsif, Aurangabad. If that be so, the Executing
Munsif, Aurangabad, proceed ahead in the execution matter as Patna High Court
CWJC No.18188 of 2015 dt.05-08-2019 per the modification made in the award.
With the aforesaid observations and directions, this writ petition stands disposed of.
