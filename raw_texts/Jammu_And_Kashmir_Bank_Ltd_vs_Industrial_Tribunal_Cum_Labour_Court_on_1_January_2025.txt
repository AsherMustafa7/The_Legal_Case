[WP (C) No. 1163/2019]
CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJNESH OSWAL, JUDGE
JUDGMENT
1. The respondent No. 2 had filed an application under Section 2-A (2) read with section 10 of
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 with the respondent No. 1, praying thereby that the voluntary
vacation/cessation order be declared as null and void and the petitioner-Bank be directed to
reinstate him in services with immediate effect with all the consequential service benefits.
2. The petitioners filed their response and raised a preliminary objection with regard to the
jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal cum Labour Court of J&K at Srinagar on the ground that the
'appropriate Government' in respect of "Banking" is a Central Government in terms of Section 2(a)
of the Act (supra), therefore, the Tribunal being the State Industrial Tribunal/Labour Court has no
jurisdiction to try the matter. After hearing the parties, the respondent No. 1 vide its order dated
13.03.2019 rejected the preliminary objection raised by the petitioners by arriving at a conclusion
that the State Government is the 'appropriate Government' for the bank and the Industrial Tribunal-
Labour Court established by the State Government shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the
application filed by the respondent No.2. To arrive at the above-mentioned conclusion, the
respondent No. 1 placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of [WP (C) No.
1163/2019] India in case titled as "Nashik Workers Union vs. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited"
reported in (2016) 6 SCC 224.
3. The petitioner-bank has impugned the order dated 13.03.2019 passed by the respondent No. 1
through the medium of present petition on the ground that the reliance placed upon the judgment in
case titled "Nashik Workers Union vs. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited" (supra) by the learned
Tribunal is misplaced, as in case of 'banks' it is only the Industrial Tribunal, established by the
Central Government, which has the jurisdiction to deal with the Industrial disputes.
4. The respondent No. 2-the applicant before the Tribunal has objected to the petition by asserting
that the J&K Bank is an authority and instrumentality of the State and was created by Maharaja of
Jammu & Kashmir. Further, the UT Government has a major shareholding of nearly 59.3% in the
J&K Bank ltd. and thus it has both financial and administrative control over the Bank.
5. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
6. The following issues arise for determination:
A. Whether in case of industrial dispute between Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd. and
its workman, the Central Government or the State Government i.e. Government of
UT of J&K is the 'appropriate Government' in terms of Section 2(a) of the Act
(supra)?

B. Whether the Industrial Tribunal-Labour Court established by the State Government of J&K, now
Government of UT of J&K, has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the industrial dispute between the J&K
Bank Ltd. and its workman?
[WP (C) No. 1163/2019] ISSUE A:
"Whether in case of industrial dispute between Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd. and its
workman, the Central Government or the State Government i.e. Government of UT of
J&K is the 'appropriate Government' in terms of Section 2(a) of the Act (supra)?"
7. Section 2(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 provides that "appropriate government" means

the Central Government, or by a railway company or concerning any such controlled industry as
may be specified in this behalf by the Central Government or in relation to an industrial dispute
concerning a Dock Labour Board established under section 5A of the Dock Workers (Regulation of
Employment) Act, 1948 (9 of 1948), or the Industrial Finance Corporation of India Limited formed

Provided that in case of a dispute between a contractor and the contract labour
employed through the contractor in any industrial establishment where such dispute
first arose, the appropriate Government shall be the Central Government or the State

establishment;
8. Section 2(bb) of the Act (supra) provides that the "banking company"
means " means a banking company as defined in section 5 of the Banking Companies
Act, 1949 (10 of 1949), having branches or other establishments in more than one
State, and includes [the Export-Import Bank of India,] [the Industrial Reconstruction
Bank of India,] [the Small Industries Development Bank of India established under
section 3 of the Small Industries Development Bank of India Act, 1989 (39 of [WP (C)
No. 1163/2019] 1989),] the Reserve Bank of India, the State Bank of India [ a
corresponding new bank constituted under section 3 of the Banking Companies

Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980 (40 of 1980), and any subsidiary bank]] as
defined in the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 (38 of 1959);]
9. Section 5 (c) of the Act No. 10 of 1949 provides that the "banking company" means any company
which transacts the business of banking in India. Section 5 (b) of the Act No.10 of 1949 defines
banking as accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the

(d) the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913) ;
(e) the Registration of Transferred Companies Ordinance, 1942 (54 of 1942) ; and
(f) any law corresponding to any of the Acts or the Ordinance aforesaid and in force
in the merged territories or in a Part B States (other than the State of Jammu and
Kashmir), or any part thereof, before the extension thereto of the Indian Companies
Act, 1913 (7 of 1913) ; or in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, or any part thereof,
before the commencement of the Jammu and Kashmir (Extension of Laws) Act, 1956
(62 of 1956), insofar as banking, insurance and financial corporations are concerned,
and before the commencement of the Central Laws (Extension to Jammu & Kashmir)
Act, 1968 (25 of 1968), insofar as other corporations are concerned ; and
(g) the Portuguese Commercial Code, insofar as it relates to "sociedades anonimas";
12. The Jammu and Kashmir Bank ltd. was incorporated as a public limited company under the
Jammu and Kashmir Companies Regulations Number 11 of 1977 on 01.10.1938 i.e. much before the
commencement of the Central Laws (Extension to Jammu & Kashmir) Act, 1968 (25 of 1968). Thus,
the Jammu and Kashmir Bank Ltd is an "existing company" within the meaning of the Companies
Act and is a 'company' in terms of the Companies Act, 1956. Further, section 2 (20) of the
Companies Act 2013, provides that the company means company incorporated under this law or any
previous law. The Jammu and Kashmir Bank ltd. is involved in the business of 'banking', having its
branches all over the country and as such has all the attributes of 'banking company' as defined
under the Act No.10 of 1949, which finds reference in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
[WP (C) No. 1163/2019]
13. Thus, this court is of the considered view that in case of industrial dispute between the Jammu
and Kashmir Bank Ltd. and its workman, the appropriate Government would be 'the Central
Government'. The issue No.1 is decided accordingly.
ISSUE B:
"Whether the Industrial Tribunal-Labour Court established by the State Government
of J&K, now Government of UT of J&K, has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the
industrial dispute between the J&K Bank Ltd. and its workman?"
14. As this court has arrived at the conclusion that the central government is appropriate
government in case of an industrial dispute between the petitioner bank and its workman, therefore
as a natural consequence, the Industrial Tribunal-Labour Court, established by the central
government ordinarily shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the industrial dispute between the
petitioner- bank and its workman. The perusal of proviso to section 10 of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 reveals that the dispute, where the Central Government is the appropriate Government, it
shall be within the competence of that Government to refer the dispute to a labour court or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78726070/ 5
Jammu And Kashmir Bank Ltd vs Industrial Tribunal Cum Labour Court on 1 January, 2025
Industrial Tribunal, as the case may be, constituted by the State Government. Thus, the Central
Government can refer the dispute to a labour court or Industrial Tribunal, constituted by the State
Government, but otherwise the Industrial Tribunal- Labour Court, established by the central
government ordinarily shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the industrial dispute between the
petitioner- bank and its workman. Accordingly, it is held that in case of an industrial dispute
between the J&K Bank Ltd. and its workman, only the labour court or Industrial tribunal, [WP (C)
No. 1163/2019] established by the Central Government, shall have power to adjudicate the same but
the Central Government may refer the dispute to labour court or Industrial Tribunal established by
the State Government and in that eventuality only, the labour court or Industrial Tribunal
established by the State Government shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate the same.
15. The perusal of the order impugned reveals that the learned Tribunal has not considered the
controversy in its right perspective and has relied upon the judgment, which was not at all
applicable in the instant case.
16. In view of the above, the petition is disposed of by directing the respondent No. 1 to return the
application filed by the respondent No.2 to him and thereafter the respondent No.2 shall be at
liberty to get the dispute settled in accordance with law. Needless, to say that the period of limitation
shall not come in the way of the respondent No.2 in availing the remedy under the Industrial
Disputes, Act 1947, in accordance with law.
17. Disposed of.
