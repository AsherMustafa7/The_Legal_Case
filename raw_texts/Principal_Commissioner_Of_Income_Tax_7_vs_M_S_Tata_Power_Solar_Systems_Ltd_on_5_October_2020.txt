THIS I.T.A. COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,
ALOK ARADHE J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
Mr.E.I.Sanmathi, learned counsel for the revenue.
2. This appeal under Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act',
for short) has been preferred by the revenue. The Assessment Year in this appeal pertains to
2009-10.
3. Facts leading to filing of the appeal briefly stated are that the assessee is a Company which is
engaged in the business of manufacture and sale, including exports of solar cells, photovoltaic
modules and systems. The assessee filed return of income to the Assessment Year 2009-10 declaring
the income of `13,90,62,429/-. The case was taken up for scrutiny and the assessment was
concluded by the Assessing Officer by an order dated 09.04.2013 and the Assessing Officer
determined the income of the assessee at `17,10,43,180/- and directed initiation of proceedings
under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act. The Assessing Officer thereafter passed an order dated
30.10.2013 by which `1,11,79,217/- was levied under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act. The assessee
thereupon filed an appeal. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), by an order dated
20.09.2018, upheld the order passed by the Assessing Officer. Being aggrieved, the assessee filed an
appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal, vide order dated 21.08.2019, by
placing reliance on the decision of this Court rendered in ITA No.380/2015 dated 23.11.2015, set
aside the order passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well as by the Assessing
Officer and allowed the appeal preferred by the assessee.
4. We have heard the learned counsel for the revenue at length. Learned counsel for the revenue
could not dispute the position that the order of the Tribunal dated 21.08.2019 is based on the
decision rendered by this Court in 'CIT VS. SSA'S EMERALD MEADOWS' in ITA No.380/2015
dated 23.11.2015. Since the order of the Tribunal is based on the decision rendered by a Bench of
this Court, in our opinion, no substantial question of law arises for consideration in this appeal.
In the result, the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.
