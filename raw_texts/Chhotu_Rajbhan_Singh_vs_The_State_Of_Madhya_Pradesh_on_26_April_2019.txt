3. Learned counsel for the applicant contended that trial Court has not considered the material
available along with the charge-sheet. There is no prima facie case made out against the applicant.
The date of incident is 13.07.2018. The information was recorded in Roznamacha on 14.08.2018 and
FIR was lodged on 09.09.2018 and on the same day, the statement of the witnesses were recorded
by the Investigating Officer. No suicide note was recovered. He further submits that prosecutrix was
at the time of alleged incident was 16 years and no offence under Section Â¾ of POSCO Act is made
out against the applicant and also no case for the offence under Section 376 (1) of IPC is made out.
For the offence under Section 306 of IPC, it is mentioned in the statement that the applicant has not
instigated or abated the prosecutrix for suicide. Brother of the prosecutrix scolded her and being
annoyed of that act, she committed suicide. There is no ingredients of the offence under Section 306
of IPC is made out against the applicant and prayed to set aside the impugned order and discharge
the applicant.
4. Counsel for the State submits that there is sufficient material available on record to connect the
applicant with the alleged offence. There is no need to discharge the applicant. The applicant can
face the trial and having the opportunity to put a defence and cross-examine the witnesses and pray
to dismiss the revision.
5. Having heard of both the parties and perused the documents filed by the applicant. The applicant
filed the copy of the charge-sheet. It is undisputed fact that on 14.7.2018, prosecutrix set her ablaze,
she was shifted to District Hospital and the doctor on the same day informed the Police Chowki
Katni situate in the premises of District Hospital. On the basis of information, Merg No.39/18
registered in the Police Station Shah Nagar. Prosecutrix was referred for better treatment at
Jabalpur, but on the way, she succumbed. Merg intimation in the Police Chowki Katni is 0/192/18
registered under Section 174 of Cr.P.C and the same was send to Police Station Shah Nagar where
merg No.39/18 was registered. Dead body of the prosecutrix was send to the District Hospital Katni
where doctor opined that prosecutrix she was 95% burnt. She prepared a slide of smear of the
prosecutrix and handed over to Investigating Officer and thereafter, IO through Superintendent of
Police send the slide to FSL Sagar for examination and also for DNA test.
6. Perused the statements of the witnesses recorded during investigation. Prima facie it reveals that
the prosecutrix at the time of incident was 16 years (minor). The applicant is maternal uncle of the
prosecutrix and distant relation and he managed the consent of the prosecutrix and committed
inter- course with her. When the aforesaid act was seen by the brother of the prosecutrix, he scolded
her and after that prosecutrix committed suicide. No suicide note has been recovered. FSL report is
yet to be received.
7. There is prima facie material is available against the applicant in the investigation for prosecuting
him for the offence under Section 376 of IPC and under Section 3 read with Section 4 of POCSO Act.
Learned trial Court framed the charge against the applicant under Section 376 (1) of IPC and under
Section 3 read with Section 4 of POCSO Act. There is no irregularity or perversity found in framing
the charge against the applicant in abovementioned both offences.

8. No doubt, there is no prima facie sufficient material found against the applicant for instigation or
abatment for suicide. The brother of the prosecutrix found that the prosecutrix and applicant both
were in compromising position and thereafter, he scolded the prosecutrix and reported the matter to
his mother. There is no prima facie sufficient material against the applicant for the offence
punishable under Section 306 of IPC. Learned counsel for the applicant in support of his arguments
relied in the case of Suhadra Vishwakarma vs. State of M.P., passed on 16.11.2018 in Cr.R
No.2472/2018, and prayed to quash the charge under Section 306 of IPC.
9. The applicant has filed this revision for discharging the applicant from the charge levelled. Since
there is prima facie material available against the applicant for the offence punishable under Section
376/1 of IPC and under Section 3 read with Section 4 of POCSO Act, this Court find that sufficient
material to proceed against the applicant in trial. In the criminal revision, the Court cannot
discharge the applicant for one offence. The trial will continue against the applicant for the other
offences because such type of order comes under the preview of interlocutory order as co-ordinate
Bench of this Court has held as under in the case of Khagesh Kumar Goel Vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh and others, reported in 1998 CRI.L.J. 776 para 13 and 14 are relevant which reads as
under:-
13. The other case is, where according to the material on record, there is ground for
presuming that the accused committed a particular offence and the charge is framed.
The plea of the accused is that on the basis of material on record that charge could
not be framed, but a minor or other charge is made out and this plea is repelled by
the Court and the charge is framed. Such an order of framing charge to my mind is
certainly an interlocutory order. The reason is that if the plea of the accused that a
minor or other charge is made out is accepted it will not put an end to the matter and
the accused has still to be tried on the charge which can be framed according to him.
It will be open to him to show at proper time that on the material on record the
offence made out is minor offence. A contention has been raised to the effect that it
may be said that the accused stands discharged with reference to the major offence
and as such it puts an end to that content. This to my mind is not correct. The
accused can be discharged only as proceeded under Section
227. There cannot be an order of discharge if there is a ground to proceed against the
accused, even if a minor charge is made out from material on record. In case a minor
charge is made out even then the order of framing charge by the Court cannot be said
to be a final order as it does not put an end to the controversy. It is certainly an
interlocutory order because trial has to continue with respect to the minor charge
claimed by the accused.
14. I, therefore, conclude that the order passed at the time of framing the charge
negativing the plea of the accused that no charge is made out and he is entitled to be
discharged is not an interlocutory order and revision petition is maintainable and
such an order is not hit by the provisions of S. 397(2), Cr.P.C. On the other hand if
the plea of the accused is that a minor charge is made out instead of charge framed by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194604089/ 3
Chhotu @ Rajbhan Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2019
the order of framing charge, such an order is certainly an interlocutory order and the
revision petition against such an order is not maintainable and is hit by provisions of
Section 397(2), Cr.P.C. This aspect has not been considered in the authorities of
Bombay High Court cited by learned counsel or in the Single Judge authority of this
Court. As such, these authorities do not help the learned counsel to show that every
order of framing of charge is revisable. In the cases in hand the plea of the accused
was that there was no material on record against the accused-petitioner and no
charge could be framed against him. In other words it means that the petitioner
claimed to be discharged. If this plea had been accpeted by the Court below it would
have put an end to the trial of the petitioner.
This order to my mind, in view of what has been stated above is not hit by provisions of Section
397(2), Cr.P.C. The preliminary objection is, therefore, repelled and it is held that the revision
petitions are maintainable. They are accordingly admitted.
10. The Sessions Trial No.43/2018, is being tried as Sessions trial as per Section 227 of the Cr.P.C.,
if, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith, and after
hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the Judge considers that
there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and
record his reasons for so doing. In consonance with this Section, there is a provision envisaged
under Section 228 of the Cr.P.C., if the accused is not discharged under Section 227 of Cr.P.C., Court
may proceed to frame charge. If accused completely discharged from all offences under Section 227
of Cr.P.C., then order is revisable and if there is any ground for the proceeding against the accused
in regard to any offence, such type of order is not revisable.
11. In the instant case, accused has been charged for the offence under Section 376 (1) of IPC and
Section 3 read with Section 4 of POSCO Act along with Section 306 of IPC. The counsel mainly
concentrated over the offence punishable under Section 306 of IPC and submit that no ingredients
of the alleged offence is made out against the applicant. In this respect this Court is of the view that
such type of prayer if made by the accused/applicant in respect of the impugned order, this order
may be categorized as an interlocutory order and barred under Section 392 of the Cr.P.C.
12. Considering the foregoing discussions and proposition of law held in the case of Khagesh Kumar
Goel (supra), this Court does not find any merit in this revision to discharge the applicant from the
charge framed by the trial Court. Revision petition being devoid of any merit deserves to be and is
hereby dismissed.
