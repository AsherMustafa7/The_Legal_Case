THESE PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDER, THIS DAY, THE COURT
PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
Petitioner-medical students prosecuting their studies in the respondent - ESI Medical College are
knocking at the doors of Writ Court, in substance, for laying a challenge to the prescription of five
year compulsory service to be rendered in the ESI Hospitals after the accomplishment of their
graduation.
2. After service of notice, respondents have entered appearance through their Panel Counsel; the
respondent - ESI Corpn/college has filed the Statement of Objections resisting the writ petitions;
however, the respondent - MCI has filed its Statement of Objections incidentally supporting the case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61737554/ 12
Shabana Salahudheen vs Union Of India on 14 February, 2020
of petitioners.
3. Since common questions of law & facts arise in these cases, the same are taken up together, for
the final hearing & disposal by this common judgment, as unanimously suggested at the Bar.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the prescription of five year compulsory service
to be rendered by the candidates after the accomplishment of the medical course in terms of
"Bonds" coercively extracted from them or their parents apart from being without authority of law is
violative of their Fundamental Right to profession; it is also in breach of the spirit of Article 23 of
the Constitution of India which prohibits Bonded Labour/Captive Service; asking the petitioners to
render compulsory service is also discriminatory inasmuch as, the candidates admitted to other
Colleges on allotment of Government seats by the Karnataka Examination Authority do not have
such a condition; the said prescription is otherwise also unjust, arbitrary & unreasonable; so
arguing, the counsel prays for allowing of the writ petitions.
5. Learned Panel Counsel for the ESI Corpn/college per contra contends that: petitioners having
entered into a contract for service at the stage of admission to the medical course cannot now turn
around and lay a challenge thereto; pacta sunt servanda being the operational norm, petitioners are
bound to do what they had agreed to as a condition for their admission to the course; petitioners
having taken the advantage of concessional rates of fees on account of they agreeing to the
stipulation of service, they are estopped from resiling; granting relief to the petitioners who by their
words & conduct have acquiesced in the prescription of service amounts to placing premium on
their act of breaching the bonds; lastly the petitions suffer from laches & delay; so contending the
Panel Counsel for the Corporation seeks dismissal of the writ petitions.
6. Learned Sr. Panel Counsel for the respondent - MCI in substance sailing with the petitioners
contends that the respondent - ESI Corpn/college has neither competence nor justification for
prescribing five year compulsory service; the seats which the petitioners have procured on allotment
by the Karnataka Examination Authority are the "Government Seats" and therefore, the respondent
- ESI Corpn/college could not have super added the condition for compulsory service; neither the
Government nor the RGUHS nor MCI has permitted the prescription in question; it is only the MCI
which has power to prescribe the minimum standards of medical education and therefore, implicitly
it can supervise the qualifications/eligibility criteria for admission to medical courses; thus, the MCI
Counsel finds fault with prescription of compulsory service.
7. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the petition papers, this
Court grants relief to the petitioners for the following reasons:
A) As to competence of ESI Corpn/college to prescribe condition of compulsory
service:
a) the respondent - ESI Corporation is established by the Central Government by
issuing a notification in the Official Gazette u/s 3 of the Employees' State Insurance
Act, 1948 for the administration of the Scheme of Employees State Insurance; this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61737554/ 13
Shabana Salahudheen vs Union Of India on 14 February, 2020
section makes the ESI Corpn a juristic person having perpetual succession; ; the Act
provides for certain benefits to the class of employees who are covered by its fold; the
short Preamble to the Act reads as under:
"An Act to provide for certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity and
employment injury and to make provision for certain other matters in relation
thereto."
much milk cannot be derived from the text of this Preamble; the question of looking to the Preamble
to the Act does not arise inasmuch as the courts are reluctant to allow a Preamble to override or
expand the scope and meaning of a provision which is plain and unambiguous vide Bennion on
Statutory Interpretation, section 247, (Sixth Edition, LexisNexis Publication);
b) section 59B introduced by the Amendment Act 18 of 2010 w.e.f. 01.06.2010 enables the ESI
Corporation to establish inter alia, the medical colleges with a view to improve the quality of services
provided under the ESI Scheme; accordingly, the Colleges have been established, is true; all they
function on 'no profit & no loss' basis, may not be much relevant; the contention of the learned panel
counsel for the Corpn that this section when read with the Preamble of the Act vests power in the
Corpn to stipulate a condition for compulsory service appears to be too farfetched an argument;
section 59B reads as under:
"59B. Medical and para-medical education.- The Corporation may establish medical
colleges, nursing colleges and training institutes for its para-medical staff and other
employees with a view to improve the quality of services provided under the
Employees' State Insurance Scheme."
power lies with the Corpn to establish the medical colleges cannot be disputed; but the text and
context of the above provision cannot be construed so as to include the power to prescribe
compulsory service to the candidates seeking admission to the medical courses in the respondent-
colleges;
c) section 92 which was heavily banked upon by the learned panel counsel vests power in the Central
Government to give direction from time to time inter alia to the ESI Corporation, for the efficient
administration of the Act; it is not in dispute that no such direction providing for prescribing
compulsory medical service by the candidates like the petitioners has been issued, as yet; the
contention of the panel counsel that several decisions have been taken by the Corpn which have
been approved by the Central Government and therefore, they partake the character of a "direction"
issued in terms of section 92(2) is difficult to countenance; section 92(2) reads as under:
"92 (1).......xxx.....
(2) The Central Government may, from time to time, give such directions to the
Corporation as it may think fit for the efficient administration of the Act, and if any
such direction is given, the Corporation shall comply with such direction."

in modern times, the legislatures in their wisdom ordinarily incorporate a provision of the kind in
Statutes dealing with special subject matters like the one in question, inasmuch as, it is humanly
difficult to visualize the permutation and combination of situations/circumstances which may pose
hardship in implementing the provisions of the Act and the delegated legislation made thereunder;
the implementing authorities may not wash off their hands, in such situations by pleading that the
Act does not provide for remedial measures; to overcome such difficulties, the Central Government
may issue necessary directions on solicitation or suo moto; however, that is not the case here; it is
also conceded on behalf of the Corpn. that no such directions have been issued concerning
compulsory service; and,
(d) there are provisions in the Act which empower the Corporation to make orders and take
decisions, which need to be authenticated by the signature of the Director General as prescribed u/s
7; these orders and decisions may have the approval of the Central Government; high rank officials
of the Central Government may be part of the body that takes such institutional decisions, may be
true; however, only by that, such orders/decisions do not partake the character of "directions"
contemplated u/s 92(2) of the Act; had that been the intent of the Parliament, a provision to that
effect would have been made in the Act itself; in the absence of such a provision, the contention does
not merit acceptance; courts in the interpretative process of a Statute cannot read something which
is conspicuously absent therein; therefore, several decisions/resolutions of the Corporation, copies
whereof are part of the record, which the panel counsel banked upon for justifying the prescription
of the impugned condition of compulsory service do not come to the rescue of the answering
respondents.
B) Legality/enforceability of so called "contract" or "bond" in the Scheme of the Act:
a) learned Panel Counsel for the Corporation vehemently contended that regardless
of power to prescribe a condition for compulsory service as mentioned above, it is
open to the respondent-Corpn. to enter into a contract with the candidates seeking
admission to the medical course in its colleges and accordingly, it has entered into
ones with the petitioners and therefore, they are bound by the contracts and
therefore they cannot challenge the obligation; there are some provisions in the Act
like section 59 which empower the Corpn. to "enter into agreement" with any local
authority, private body or individual for arranging for medical treatment of insured
persons or for commissioning and running ESI hospitals;
despite strenuous arguments, the learned panel counsel could not fish out any provision akin to the
same in the Act which enables the Corpn/college to enter into a contract of the kind or extract a
service bond from the candidates as a pre-condition for admission to the medical course, assuming
that there are valid agreements or bonds which the Corpn. holds;
b) it has long been settled position of law that a natural person can do all that is not prohibited by
law whereas a juristic person like the respondent -Corpn. can do only that which is provided by law,
expressly or by necessary implication; the Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta in the
case of SATIBHUSHAN MUKHERJEE Vs. CORPORATION OF CALCUTTA, AIR (36) 1949 CAL 20
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61737554/ 15
Shabana Salahudheen vs Union Of India on 14 February, 2020
at para 10 observed as under:
"10..... There is a fundamental distinction between the capacity of a natural person
and of an artificial person which has been created by Statute or Charter. To a natural
person whatever is not expressly forbidden by the law is permitted by the law. He has
the capacity to do everything save and except those forbidden by law. In the case of
an artificial person-e.g., a corporation, which can be created either by charter or by
statute the rule applicable to a natural person is reversed. Whatever is not permitted
expressly or by necessary implication by the constituting instrument is prohibited not
by any express or implied prohibition of the legislature but by the doctrine of ultra
vires. This fundamental principle has been laid down in many cases......;"
as already mentioned above, no provision in the Act, Rules or Regulations is brought to the notice of
this Court which authorizes the Corpn. or its College to enter into an agreement or take bond of the
kind from the medical students or their parents; thus on the basis of what is not provided in the
Scheme of the Act, no legally enforceable obligation arises by virtue of so called contract or the
bond; for the same reason the doctrine of estoppel pressed into service by the Panel Counsel does
not come to the aid of answering respondents;
c) the text of the instrument which the petitioners have executed does not support the contention of
the panel counsel for the ESI Corpn. that there is a contract between the Corpn/college on the one
hand and the petitioners on the other; "a contract is an agreement enforceable by law"
says section 2 (h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872; for an agreement to come into
existence, there must be an offer followed by the acceptance; thus, invariably there
need to be an offerer & the acceptor ie, two parties, as a minima; the text of the bond
shows that the Corpn/College is not a party although its Dean has put his hand to the
instrument as a witness and not as a party representing the Corpn/college; this
position is fairly conceded by the learned Panel Counsel for the Corpn.; the Corpn can
be represented only by the Director General or his delegate, as provided by Rule 16 of
the Employees' State Insurance (Central) Rules, 1950; delegation of this power by the
Director if it has prior approval of the standing Committee, vide sub-Rule (2);
nothing is placed on record even otherwise to treat the Dean of the college to be the
delegate of the Director General even if it is assumed that he purportedly represented
the Corpn/College; therefore, the instrument executed by the petitioners cannot be
treated as "an agreement"; and,
d) the other contention of the Panel Counsel for the Corporation that the instrument
in question even if is not an agreement, it partakes the character of a bond wherein
an undertaking is incorporated and therefore, petitioners are bound to serve, cannot
be countenanced inasmuch as the Act, Rules & Regulations do not authorize the
Corpn/College to extract such a bond from the students allotted to the respondent
College by the Examination Authority under the Government Quota seats, as a
precondition for such admission; if the Corpn cannot enter into a contract in respect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61737554/ 16
Shabana Salahudheen vs Union Of India on 14 February, 2020
of the subject matter in question, it cannot secure a bond for generating a legally
enforceable obligation for serving the ESI hospitals, either;
C) Compulsory service and its Constitutionality:
(a) Fundamental Right to Profession under Article 19(1)(g):
the submission of the counsel for the petitioners that prescription of compulsory
service regardless of its laudability is legally impermissible, has force; the
respondent-Corpn and its Colleges answer the description of 'State' under Article 12
of the Constitution of India is not in dispute; therefore their actions and inactions are
susceptible to Part-III Discipline of the Constitution; the Fundamental Right to
practise profession guaranteed u/a 19(1)(g) can be subject to reasonable restrictions,
is true; however, such a restriction can be imposed only by the authority of law; the
prescription of compulsory service obviously robs off the citizens' choice which they
have in the matter of employment or practice of profession; the right to practise
profession obviously includes right not to practise if the citizen so chooses; it is
already held above that the ESI Corpn and its colleges do not have authority of law to
prescribe compulsory service; the prescription of five year compulsory service is in
the best interest of the public at large since there is dearth of medical facilities, is
beside the point; laudability is one thing & legality is another; laudability does not per
se legitimize an act which is not legally permissible; Court is concerned with the
legality; therefore, impugned prescription of compulsory service does not withstand
judicial scrutiny;
(b) Prohibition of "Bonded Labour" under Article 23:
there is force in the contention of the petitioners that enforcing the service bonds in
question virtually amounts to enforcing the bonded labour, which is prohibited by
Article 23 of the Constitution of India as broadly interpreted by the Apex Court in
PEOPLE'S UNION FOR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS -vs- UOI, AIR 1982 SC 1473
inasmuch as the petitioners as already mentioned above, lacked "reasonable choice"
in the matter; the bonds were taken from them by the respondent-college at the time
of admission; joining a medical course by securing Government seat is a dream for
many which comes true for a few; but for the bond, the admissions would not have
been granted to the petitioners does not need elaboration, and it is not disputed
either; Article 23 prohibits 'compulsory service' unless it is made pursuant to
statutory enablement and for the public purpose; as already mentioned above, there
was/is no statutory authority availing to the Corpn or its colleges to extract service
bonds of the kind in question from the medical students; therefore, permitting the
respondent - Corpn. or its colleges to enforce the said bonds militates against
constitutional prohibition enacted in Article 23; after all, the Fundamental Rights
being in the nature of a prohibition addressed to the State or its instrumentalities
falling within the definition of Article 12 cannot be waived or contracted away by an

Shabana Salahudheen vs Union Of India on 14 February, 2020
individual subject to all just exceptions vide BASHESHAR NATH Vs. INCOME TAX
OFFICER, 1959 SUPPL. (1) SCR 528; the contention that during the service period
the petitioners would be paid reasonable remuneration pales into insignificance; and,
(c) the related contention of Panel Counsel for the Corporation that this Court in the
case of DR.SWAMY MANJUNATH -vs- STATE OF KARNATAKA, 2019 (2) Kar.L.J.
156, has upheld prescription of compulsory medical service by taking bond and that
the said decision is affirmed by the Division Bench vide judgment dated 15.02.2019
in W.A.Nos.32-54/2019 (Edn-Res) between DR.VARUN & OTHERS -VS- STATE &
OTHERS, does not come to the rescue of answering respondents, facts of those cases
being miles away from those of these writ petitions; in the above cases, the State
Government had obtained three year Service Bonds from the candidates seeking
admission to Government Seats in medical colleges, is true; but this was done in
terms of Rule 15 of Karnataka Conduct of Entrance Test for Selection and Admission
to Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Degree and Diploma Courses Rules, 2006;
these Rules have been promulgated under Karnataka Educational Institutions
(Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act, 1984; thus there was statutory enablement unlike
in the present writ petitions;
therefore, the challenge to the enforcement of statutory bonds prescribing compulsory service came
to be negatived;
D) Condition of compulsory service and admission qua Government Seats:
a) the respondent-college is established & administered in the State of Karnataka,
having been affiliated to the respondent-Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences;
certain number of seats are surrendered by the colleges to the Government for being
allotted to the candidates; after such surrender, the same are allotted to the
candidates by the Karnataka Examination Authority after counseling, in accordance
with law; petitioners are such allottees; the colleges do not have any competence to
super-add any condition to the admission of candidates, who are allottees of the
Government Seats, as rightly contended by learned MCI Counsel, Mr.N.Khetty; in
fact, for allotment of seats from the Government Quota, the petitioners have already
executed a three year service bonds in terms of Rule 15 of 2006 Rules mentioned
above;
once such an allotment is made, the ESI colleges have neither competence nor justification for
exacting any service bonds, that too unilaterally; this Court as already mentioned above, has upheld
the enforcement of three year service bond given to the State Government; added to this, the
petitioners are liable to put in one year compulsory service as prescribed by the Karnataka
Compulsory Service Training by Candidates Completed Medical Courses Act, 2012 whose validity is
upheld by this Court vide BUSHRA ABDUL ALEEM Vs. GOVERNMENT OF KARNATAKA 2019 (4)
KCCR 3482; if the bonds in question are enforced by the ESI colleges, the total compulosry service
period would be nine years; thus, the bonds in question are otherwise also unjust & unreasonable,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61737554/ 18
Shabana Salahudheen vs Union Of India on 14 February, 2020
since they render the petitioners virtually the 'captive doctors'; and,
b) the above apart, the respondent -MCI being a special body established under Indian Medical
Council Act, 1956 has power to prescribe minimum standards of medical education in which is
implicit the authority to supervise the qualifications or eligibility standards for admission to medical
institutions vide STATE OF KERALA vs. T.P.ROSHNA, 1979 SCC 580 as rightly submitted by Mr.
Khetty; the respondent-colleges have prescribed a five year compulsory service as a condition of
admission to medical course not only without competence but even without the courtesy of seeking
concurrence of the respondent - MCI, the respondent-Examination Authority & the respondent -
Health University; it is un- understandable that even after noticing such incompetent &
unscrupulous condition of compulsory service, these three respondents did not take up the matter
with the Corpn. or the college concerned; there is a grave lapse on the part of these respondents; the
State Government is also equally guilty, if not more for the similar lapse on its part.
E) The last contention of the Panel Counsel for the Corpn that the bonds in question were executed
way back in the Academic Year 2012-13 and that the challenge is laid to the same years thereafter
and consequently petitions are liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay & laches, does not
impress this Court; true it is, that some years have lapsed since the bonds were furnished; however,
even going by the terms of the bond, the same becomes enforceable only in the year 2020; it was
open to the petitioners to invoke the writ jurisdiction immediately after the bond was exacted from
them, is true; but, choate cause of action accrues to them when an unlawful bond is sought to be
enforced; the Apex Court in the case of NIRANJANLAL AGARWALA vs. UNION OF INDIA, AIR
1969 SC 23, has ruled that it does not behove the State to contest a good claim of a citizen on the off
chance of success on some unsubstantial technical plea; in the facts of this case the contention of
delay & laches cannot but be termed as "unsubstantial technical plea"; so is also the contention of
estoppel; therefore, petitioners cannot be non-suited on these grounds too.
In the above circumstances, these writ petitions succeed; a Writ of Certiorari issues quashing the
impugned orders; a Writ of Mandamus issues restraining the respondent - ESI Corpn and its
colleges from enforcing against the petitioners the Five Year Compulsory Service Bond for any
period; the respondent-Corporation and their colleges are directed to relieve the petitioners from
the obligation of compulsory service unconditionally, and to issue Orders/Endorsements to that
effect; no liability or the like shall be fastened on the petitioners or their parents on account of the
service bonds in question.
No costs.
