II. FACTS OF THE CASES
6. The petitioners in these writ petitions are challenging different notifications of delimitation of
wards issued by the State Government on the basis of 2011 census figures in respect of Mysuru City
and Tumakuru City Municipal Corporations, declaring 65 wards at Mysuru and 35 wards at
Tumakuru. In W.P No.32989/2018, the petitioners have sought for quashing the notification dated
23.04.2018 issued by the first respondent insofar as not determining the layouts which have been
handed over by the 4th respondent - Mysuru Urban Development Authority ('MUDA' for short),
more particularly not determining Preethi and Sai layouts in the impugned notification for any of
the wards to the election for the office of councilors in the 3rd respondent - Mysuru City Corporation
and for directing the 1st respondent - State Government to determine the layouts which have been
handed over by the 4th respondent - MUDA as per the Official Memorandum dated 15.7.2016, more
particularly Preethi an Sai layouts in any of the wards as required under Section 21 of the Karnataka
Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 ('KMC Act' for short).
7. It is the case of the petitioners in W.P. No.30543- 30545/2018 that in respect of delimitation of
wards, no rules were framed as mandated under Section 21(3) of the KMC Act. However, in respect
of urban local bodies, the Government has formulated various guidelines. Guideline No.9 clearly
and categorically states that all wards shall, as far as practicable, be geographically compact areas,
and in delimiting them regard shall be had to the physical features, facilities of communication and
public convenience. Further Guideline No.15 clearly and categorically states that the Deputy
Commissioners of the concerned districts shall prepare delimitation proposals and furnish such
proposals to the Government for publishing the draft notification. It is further stated that the first
respondent - State Government, Urban Development Department has drawn the proceedings on
15.2.2014 with respect to delimitation of wards of urban local bodies in terms of Sections 13 and
352(2) of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964. The MUDA has formed various new layouts and
has approved various private layouts. As a result of the same, MUDA handed over various layouts to
the 3rd respondent - Mysuru City Corporation on 15.7.2016. Accordingly on 3.11.2016, the
Respondent No.1 issued a Circular regarding delimitation of wards. It is submitted that the election
to the Respondent No.3 is due to be held in September-2018. In view of impending elections,
Respondent No.1 issued a notification dated 8.2.2018 calling for objections from the general public
within 15 days from the date of publication delimiting 65 wards. The petitioners and one
Mr.Sundarkumar, the President of Devaraj Block Congress Committee, Mysuru City filed objections
to draft notification stating that delimitation was not in conformity with the Act. On 14.6.2018 the
Karnataka State Election Commission filed Public Interest Litigation in W.P. No.5697/2018 before
this Court and sought for direction to the State Government to issue final notification of delimitation
of wards and in the said writ petition, joint memo was filed by the State Election Commission as well
as the State Government stating that final notification would be issued by 12.7.2018. Accordingly on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 10
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
19.6.2018 Respondent No.1 issued notification notifying reservation of seats to 65 wards of the
Respondent No.3 - Mysuru City Corporation. Therefore present writ petitions are filed for the reliefs
sought for.
8. It is the case of the petitioners in 29858- 29862/2018 and 31438-31442/2018 that the State
Government issued notification upgrading Respondent No.2
- Tumakuru City Municipal Corporation to Tumakur City Corporation on 20.12.2013. Accordingly,
Respondent No.1 issued draft notification of wards on 20.6.2017 as per 2011 census figures. It is
further stated that on 28.12.2017 Respondent No.1 issued final notification of wards by altering
boundaries of the existing wards for the upcoming elections. On 3.2.2018 Respondent No.2
addressed letter to Respondent No.3 requesting him to undertake the delimitation of wards as per
2011 census figures. Subsequently, Respondent No.1 has issued draft notification for reservation of
35 wards coming within the jurisdiction of Tumakuru City Municipal Corporation. Hence these writ
petitions are filed for the reliefs sought for.
9. It is the case of the petitioners in W.P. Nos.32989/2018 & 32990-32991/2018 that in the year
2007, the developers in pursuance of layout plan approval given by respondent - MUDA has formed
layout in accordance with layout plan and had sold respective sites to purchasers. However, the said
layout has been looked after by MUDA and further for the purpose of elections, the said layout
comes under Grama Panchayath jurisdiction as it was part of Chamundeshwari Legislative
Assembly Constituency. The respondent - MUDA in pursuance of fully development of certain
layouts as the said layouts come well within the territorial jurisdiction of Mysuru City Corporation,
has taken decision to hand over said layouts to the respondent - Corporation on 30.6.2016.
Accordingly on 15.7.2016, the Respondent - MUDA has issued Official Memorandum indicating that
for the lands which have been transferred or handed over to the respondent Corporation, issuance of
katha and plan sanctions have to be made by respondent - Corporation. When things stood thus,
Respondent No.1 issued draft notification notifying schedules for the determination of wards for the
elections to the Councilors of the respondent - Corporation on 8.2.2018. Accordingly Respondent
No.1 issued final notification on 23.4.2018 determining wards, in which petitioners layouts were not
included in any of the wards. The petitioners have filed objections seeking to include the said layouts
in the territorial jurisdiction of ward Nos. 64 and 65. But, the same has not been done. Hence the
petitioners are before this court for the relief sought for.
III. OBJECTIONS FILED BY THE STATE
10. The State Government filed common objections in these petitions and contended that the
prayers sought in the writ petitions are not maintainable and liable to the dismissed. It is contended
that the writ petitions filed by the petitioners for the relief sought for, are not maintainable in view
of the constitutional mandate and bar of jurisdiction as contemplated under the provisions of Article
243ZG of the Constitution of India. Therefore it is contended that no interference can be made by
the court either in the delimitation process or in the election process as the Bar is mandatory. It is
further contended that in view of the bar contained under Article 243ZG of the Constitution of
India, the validity of any law relating to delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 11
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
such constituencies cannot be examined by this court under 243ZH(a) of the Constitution. It is
further contended that the question of delimitation and allotment of a particular seat of President
and Vice President in a particular constituency of Municipality cannot be gone into, so as to allow
the judicial scrutiny of the same by the court passing the said bar of jurisdiction. The only remedy
available to the petitioners under the Constitution is by way of Election Petition before the
Competent Authority or the Tribunal after the elections are concluded as contemplated under
Clause (b) of Article 243ZG. It is further contended that the intention of the constitutional bar is
very clear i.e., to provide insulated and free from Court interference of election process. Any
interference by the Courts or law at the beginning or during the process of election is bound to
defeat the said avowed purpose of the constitutional mandate.
11. It is further contended that the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or
the allotment of seats to such constituencies cannot be questioned before the courts. It is specifically
contended by the State that the respondents while doing delimitation exercise, have followed
guidelines issued by the Government of Karnataka as well as the provisions of the KMC Act. The
guidelines pertaining to ward population has also been adhered to. It is to be noted that in the
guidelines for delimitation issued as per the Government Order No.UDD MLR 2014, Bengaluru
dated 15.2.2014, Guideline No.4 is clear that each ward in the urban body shall be so delimited that
the population of all wards shall, so far as practicable, be the same throughout the particular urban
local body and the same has been complied with. It is further stated that the respondent - State have
also followed guidelines viz., enumerated block of 2011 census, guidelines issued by the Government
dated 18.8.2006, 15.2.2014 and 3.11.2016 and ensured that the enumerated blocks should not be
divided while maintaining population to be between 10,000 to 13,000 with the permitted 10%
variation.
12. It is specifically contended that in respect of wards at Mysuru, the population has been
maintained. In sofar as Tumakuru, in most of the wards, it is ensured that the population has been
maintained between 10,000 and 13,000, but due to scarcity of population in some wards and the
area being wide in some areas and the population being less, there is variation. It is further
contended that the delimitation notification has been done in conformity with the KMC Act,
notifications and Circulars issued by the Government from time to time. The respondents have
published draft notification of the proposed delimitation for the benefit of public through gazette
notification, daily newspapers, both in Kannada and English languages, which include indicating the
display of draft delimitation of wards in the offices that may be specified and called for objections
and suggestions from public. Wide publicity has also been given to the said draft notification by the
Deputy Commissioners of districts through Radio, T.V and newspapers. Objections have been called
for and after considering the objections and suggestions, the Deputy Commissioner has proceeded
to finalize the delimitation.
13. The respondent - State further contended that based on the 2011 census figures and Sections
7(2)(a) and 21 of the KMC Act, guidelines are issued on 15.2.2014 and 13.11.2016 for the purpose of
delimitation. Therefore the impugned final notifications issued on 23.4.2018 for delimitation of
wards to Mysuru City Corporation is according to the guidelines and the KMC Act. It is further
contended that delimitation of wards is a humongous process and as far as practicable wards are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 12
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
recognized in such a way, so as to maintain they are geographically compact keeping in mind
physical features, accessibility and communication facility to public communication. The objections
of the petitioners were heard in detail by the Deputy Commissioner concerned and passed orders
accordingly. Further, the State Government contended that the petitioners have approached Court
with unclean hands without producing documents and suppressing the facts that the Deputy
Commissioner has considered the objections and has followed the guidelines of the Government.
The only intention of the petitioners is to stall the democratic process of election and the same has
to be nipped at the bud by this Court. Therefore sought for dismissal of writ petitions.
IV. OBJECTIONS FILED BY THE RESPONDENT -
COMMISSIONER, MYSURU CITY CORPORATION
14. The Respondent No.3 - Commissioner, Mysuru City Corporation filed the objections and the
additional statement of objections in W.P. Nos.30543-30545/2018 and contended that Respondent
NO.1 has published draft notification of delimitation of wards in respect of Mysuru City Corporation
on 8.2.2018 and called for objections to be filed within 15 days. The draft notifications were put up
in all the Corporation wards and also in the office of the Commissioner, Mysuru City Corporation
and also in the office of the Deputy Commissioner. The petitioners have filed their objections. The
said objections were considered and all the objectors who were present were also heard on
27.3.2018 by the Deputy Commissioner in presence of the Commissioner, Mysuru City Corporation
and Project Officer, District Urban Development Cell and thereafter has forwarded his report to the
Secretary, Urban Development Department. The letter dated 27.3.2018 of the Deputy Commissioner
as per Annexure-G reveals that the objections were considered and the persons who were present
were also heard. It is further stated that the guidelines issued by the State Government have been
followed and certain criteria is followed in the process viz.,
(i) 2011 Census population strength of 10,000 to 13,000 with permitted variation of 10% for each
ward (ii) enumerated blocks of 2011 census have been adopted in the delimitation exercise (iii) that
enumerated blocks should not be divided while maintaining the population between 10,000 to
13,000 with the permitted 10% variation. The present delimitation of wards facilitates in
maintaining and following the same electoral rolls of the voters complied by the Election
Commission for the Corporation elections also. It is further contended that Table - Annexure-R4 to
the additional statement of objections clearly depicts the population in the earlier delimitation of
wards and the present delimitation of wards the allegations that in view of the Mandate of Article
243T of the Constitution of India, rotation of seats should have been done without abolishing the old
wards and new wards should not have been demarcated or delimited till the cycle is completed and
the authorities should have adjusted the population keeping in the old wards in existence, are
untenable. It is further contended that the Table - Annexure R4 filed along with the additional
statement of objections clearly depicts the population in the earlier delimitation of wards and the
present delimitation of wards and while preparing the delimitation, the Corporation has followed
the enumerated blocks and uniformity in the population for each ward is maintained with 10%
variation, which is permissible. Therefore the petitioners are not entitled to any relief. Accordingly
sought for dismissal of the writ petitions. V. OBJECTIONS FILED BY THE RESPONDENT -

TUMAKURU CITY MUNICIPAL CORPORATION
15. In Writ Petition Nos.32989/2018 & W.P. Nos.32990-32991/2018, Respondent No.3 - Mysuru
City Corporation filed objections, wherein it is specifically stated in paragraph 4 that the newly
formed layout in the outgrowth area of the Corporation was not included in 2011 census. Some of
the layouts were formed and developed post 2011 census and hence the said layouts are not shown
in the enumerated blocks. The area has been developed and people are residing in those layouts
since 2013-14 onwards. However Respondent NO.3 while preparing draft/proposal of delimitation
of wards has included all those wards which have been handed over to the Corporation and said new
areas are included in Ward Nos.65 and 46. Since some layouts are not included in the census
enumerated blocks, their layout may not be shown in the notification, but their names are found in
voters' list. The Mysuru City Corporation officials have distributed Voter ID cards in newly included
areas of the Corporation wards as per Annexure-R2. It is categorically stated that in the event the
names of petitioners or their neighbours are not found in the Voters' list for the Corporation
elections, they are even to this date entitled to make necessary applications in the summary revision
of electoral rolls which is an ongoing process till the parliament elections. If their names are not
found in Grama Panchayath voters' list, the Corporation officials will verify with the Revenue
Inspector and Booth level officers and recommend their names to be included in the Voters' list for
the Corporation elections. Therefore sought for dismissal of the petitions.
16. The Respondent No.2 - Tumakuru City Municipal Corporation filed objections in W.P.
Nos.29858-29862/2018 contended that the petitioner nos.1 and 5 are members of Tumakuru City
Municipal Corporation who were elected in the year 2013. It is stated that erstwhile Tumakuru City
Council was upgraded as Tumakuru City Corporation vide notification dated 20.12.2013 and after
upgradation, the wards remained the same. The Deputy Commissioner issued draft notification
regarding delimitation of wards in Tumakuru City Municipal Corporation area on 22.2.2017 inviting
objections from general public. However, the said notification was withdrawn in view of the fact that
the Deputy Commissioner was not competent to issue such notification. Subsequently, the State
Government vide notification dated 20.6.2017 called upon public to file objections and subsequently
final notification issued on 28.12.2017 based on 2011 census figures retaining 35 wards. It is further
contended that the writ petitions are filed questioning the notification dated 28.12.2017 after lapse
of more than six months, that too at the fag end of the finalization of categories in respect of the
wards pertaining to Tumakuru city and therefore writ petitions are not maintainable and liable to be
dismissed. It is further contended that writ petitions are not maintainable in view of the fact that
Section 21(1-A) of the KMC Act prohibits entertaining any proceedings before any Court of law.
Further, the delimitation of wards cannot be called in question before any Court of law in view of the
bar contained under Article 243ZG of the Constitution of India. Objections were called for from
general public by giving wide publication. The Deputy Commissioner received 37 objections relating
to delimitation of wards. The State Government after considering the objections, issued the final
notification on 28.12.2017 determining the wards and its boundaries for the Tumakuru City
Corporation. Therefore the petitioners cannot maintain the writ petitions. It is further contended
that Ward No.11 was having the population of 18344 and after the delimitation, the population is
now 9,304. The population in excess of 9,304 has been distributed among Ward Nos.12, 13 and 28
after delimitation. Similarly, Wad No.7 was having the population of 6,754 and after delimitation,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 14
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
the population is raised to 7,070. Therefore it is clear that the respondents have taken into
consideration all the relevant aspects and factors and the final notification came to be issued on
28.12.2017. The population of wards in Tumakuru City Corporation varies from 5500 to 12500. If
the average population figures are considered, the variation would be plus or minus 3,000.
Therefore, delimitation notification issued on 28.12.2017 is absolutely in accordance with the
statutory provisions of the KMC Act. Hence sought for dismissal of the writ petitions.
17. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties to the lis.
VI. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONERS
18. Sri D.N. Nanjundareddy, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.
No.30543-545/2018 contended that in view of the provisions of Section 21 of the KMC Act, the
Mysuru City divided into 65 wards and as per sub section (2) of section 21 of KMC Act, the
population of wards shall so far as practicable be the same throughout the City. He further
contended that Clauses 4,5 and 6 of the Government guidelines dated 15.2.2014 contemplate that
each ward in the urban local body shall be so delimited that the population of all the wards shall, so
far as practicable, be the same throughout the particular urban local body; All wards shall, as far as
practicable, be geographically compact areas, and in delimiting them regard shall be had to the
physical features, facilities of communication and public convenience; An area within a ward shall
not extend to other wards, such that a ward does not have an enclave/island within it of certain
areas belonging to another ward having no contiguity to other areas of the concerned ward. He
further contended that the delimitation of wards must be geographically compact, that is to say, it
should be round, oval, square or rectangle. He further contended that the population of each of the
wards is not uniform. For example, the population of Ward NO.1 is 9,292 and population of Ward
No.54 is 31,616 in respect of Mysuru as per Annexure M - Population census of India 2011. He
invited attention of the Court to the objections filed by Respondent No.3 - Mysuru City Corporation,
wherein it is admitted that in the present delimitation of wards, the population for each ward is
maintained between 10,000 and 13,000 with 10% variation. He would further contend that as per
Annexure- K issued by the MUDA dated 15.7.2016, 16 new layouts formed not assigned any wards
and it will affect the reservation also. He further contended that the petitioners have not challenged
law under Section 21 of the KMC Act and they are only challenging executive action of the State
Government as per the impugned final notification dated 23.4.2018 (Annexure-H) and the said
notification cannot be termed as law. He further contended that Article 243ZG of the Constitution is
not applicable to these cases. Therefore writ petitions are maintainable
19. Sri D.N. Nanjundareddy, learned senior counsel further contended that Ward nos.1,2,3,
5,12,22,24,27,28,54,59 were determined by the respondents as not practicable in terms of provisions
of Section 21(2) of the KMC Act. He further contended that ward map - Annexure-J is in utter
violation of the provisions of Section 21 of the KMC Act r/w Government guidelines dated 15.2.2014.
Therefore, the impugned notification cannot be sustained and liable to be quashed. He further
contended that the delimitation of wards must be geographically compact that is to say, it should be
round, oval, square or rectangle. The respondent No.2 whimsfully and fancifully demarcated
boundaries as could be seen from delimitation map. It is against mandatory provisions of Section 21
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 15
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
of the KMC Act and the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. He further contended that
Annexure-G issued by the authorities is contrary to the principles of natural justice because no
notice was issued and no opportunity of hearing was provided. Therefore he sought to quash the
impugned notification by allowing the writ petitions.
20. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of BHARATI REDDY vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in (2017)12 SCC 61 (paragraphs 4
and 11) and 2007 SCC Online Delhi 365, (paragraphs 12, 17 and 36).
21. Sri Jayakumar S Patil, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P. Nos.29858-
29862/2018 and 31438-31442/2018 contended that the Commissioner, Tumakuru City Municipal
Corporation addressed a letter to the Deputy Commissioner requesting him to undertake the
delimitation of wards of Corporation as per 2011 census figures, but while issuing final notification
dated 28.12.2017, the number of wards was fixed at 35 based on 2011 census, but however
boundaries of wards were altered but no population is mentioned. He further contended that the
population of wards is not uniform. For example, as per Annexure-D, the population of Ward Nos.9,
30, 10 and 32 is 5329, 12,786, 11,126 and 12,025 respectively. Therefore population of wards
mentioned is not in terms of the provisions of Section 21(2) of the KMC Act and it is also not
practicable. He further contended that the population allotted to each ward shall be in terms of
Section 21(1)(b) of the KMC Act. He also contended that in view of paragraph-10 of the statement of
objections filed by the State Government, the writ petitions have to be allowed. He also contended
that the petitioners have not challenged either law or allotment of seats. He further contended that
Article 243ZA of the Constitution deals with elections to the Municipalities and the petitioners have
not come either under Article 243ZA of the Constitution of India or section 21 of the KMC Act. He
further contended that the impugned notification issued by the respondents is not an authority of
law under Articles 265, 300A, 326 and 329 of the Constitution and the said Articles are outside the
chapter of fundamental rights. Therefore the writ petitions are maintainable and sought to allow the
writ petitions.
22. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the following decisions:
1. CIT vs. MCDOWELL AND CO. LTD., {(2009)10 SCC 765}, wherein the Hon'ble
Supreme Court observed that notification is not law and hence writ petition is
maintainable.
2. M/s BISHAMBER DAYAL CHANDRAMOHAN vs. STATE OF U.P. AND OTHERS
{AIR 1982 SC 133} (paragraphs 41 and 42), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court
observed that the impugned notification therein is not in consonance with Section 21
of the KMC Act.
3. ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA v. ASHOK KUMAR {(2000)8 SCC 216}
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with interference under Section 329 of the
Constitution of India.

Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
4. BABU VER4GHESE vs. BAR COUNCIL OF KERALA {(1999)3 SCC 422}
(paragraph 31), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that if the manner of
doing a particular action is prescribed under the statute, the act must be done in that
manner or not at all.
5. Dictionary meaning of the word, ' practicable' is also referred.
23. Sri Amruth Choudhari, learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P. No.33432-33435/2018 has
adopted the arguments of Sri Jayakumar S. Patil, learned senior counsel appearing for some of the
petitioners.
24. Sri R.Sarathy, learned counsel for petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.32989/2018 & W.P.
Nos.32990- 32991/2018 contended that the petitioners are residents of Preethi and Sai layouts in
Mysuru City and the said layouts have not been included in the notification while forming wards.
Therefore he submits that the impugned action of the respondents not including the layouts where
petitioners are residing, cannot be sustained and respondents cannot deprive the petitioners or
residents of Preethi and Sai layouts when the said layouts come within the purview of Krishnaraja
Legislative Assembly and their names have been included in Karnataka Legislative Assembly
Constituency electoral roll. Though the layouts which were held to be integral part of Mysuru City
come within the purview of the 2nd respondent - Corporation, in the impugned notification the 1st
respondent has failed to determine the said layouts within the territorial schedules of either under
Ward No.64 or Ward No.65 and thus deprived the residents of the said layouts from exercising their
franchise in the ensuing elections to the 2nd respondent - Corporation. Therefore the impugned
notification dated 23.4.2018 issued is perse illegal and ultra vires of sections 7 and 21 of the KMC
Act. Therefore he sought to allow the petitions.
VII. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE LEARNED ADVOCATE GENERAL & LEARNED
COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENTS
25. Per contra, Sri Udaya Holla, learned Advocate General appearing for the respondent State
contended that the very writ petitions filed by the petitioners challenging the notification issued by
the respondents for delimitation of wards are not maintainable in view of the dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of ANUGRAH NARAIAN SINGH & ANOTHER vs. STATE OF U.P. AND
OTHERS reported in (1996)6 SCC 303. He would further contend that every Municipality unless
sooner dissolved under any law for the time being in force, shall continue for a period of five years
from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer. Admittedly the election for Municipal
Corporations in the State of Karnataka is imminent to be conducted on or before 05.09.2018 in
terms of the mandatory provisions of Article 243U of the Constitution of India. He would further
contend that the impugned notifications issued for delimitation of wards is a law relating to
delimitation of Constituencies. Therefore the present writ petitions filed are not maintainable before
this Court under Articles 226 and 227 of Constitution of India in view of the bar imposed by Article
243ZG of the Constitution of India and this Court cannot stall the election process. He would further
contend that the delimitation of wards is made by the Mysuru Mahanagara Palike on the basis of
2011 census strictly in terms of the provisions of Section 21 of the KMC Act. He would further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 17
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
contend that the objections filed by the petitioners to the draft notification in respect of Mysuru
have been considered and mistakes have been rectified. He would further contend that in respect of
Tumakuru, the petitioners have not filed objections to the draft notifications and final notification
issued as long back as on 28.12.2017. Admittedly the present writ petitions are filed during the
midst of election process, that too, when the Election Commission is about to issue the calendar of
events. Infact, the Election Commission issued calendar of events on 02.08.2018. Therefore, he
sought to dismiss all the writ petitions.
26. In support of his contentions, learned Advocate General relied upon the following judgments.
1. KISHANSINGH TOMAR vs. MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF THE CITY OF AHMEDABAD AND
OTEHRS {(2006) 8 SCC 352 ...Paragraphs5, 14, 19, 20 and 22} (Constitution Bench Judgment).
2. STATE OF U.P. vs. PRADHAN SANGH KSHETRA SAMITI {1995 SUPPL SCC 305 ..
Paragraph-45}
3. SURENDRA BABU vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA {ILR 1996 KAR 1797... paragraph - 9}
4. PROFESSOR B.K. CHANDRASHEKAR vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA { ILR 1999 KAR 2513 ...para
22}
5. SMT. LATHA vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA {2017(2) Kar.LJ 421} (Paragraphs 20, 21, 22, 23, 27)
27. Sri K.N.Phaneendra, learned counsel for the State Election Commission while adopting the
arguments of the learned Advocate General for the State contended that, the elections to the 29 City
Municipal Councils, 53 Municipalities and 23 Town Panchayats is imminent in view of the
constitutional mandate of Article 243U of the Constitution of India and it is the duty of the State
Election Commission to conduct elections within the time under the provisions of Article 243K of
the Constitution of India and because few petitioners are before the Court, elections to Municipal
Corporations to be conducted imminently, cannot be stalled. Therefore, he sought to dismiss the
petitions.
28. Smt. Geethadevi M. Papanna along with M.C. Jayakeerthi, learned counsel for the Mysuru City
Corporation contended that enumerated blocks of 2011 census have been adopted in the exercise of
delimitation of wards and that should not be divided while maintaining population between 10,000
to 13,000 with the permitted 10% variation. She further contended that the contiguity, geographical
features, connectivity, means of communication and public convenience were also kept in mind
while effecting delimitation. A perusal of the delimitation map of Mysuru City Corporation depicts
that no ward is an island. Since the Corporation has to follow 2011 census, the blocks enumerated as
identified by the Department of Statistical Survey of India Census division has been adopted which
is an objective criteria. A perusal of Annexure R-4 to the additional statement of objections filed by
Respondent No.3 - Mysuru City Corporation, reveals the population earlier to delimitation of wards
and after delimitation of wards. While preparing delimitation of wards, the Corporation has
followed enumerated wards as identified by census. Therefore, she sought to dismiss the petitions
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 18
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
while adopting the arguments of learned Advocate General.
29. Sri R.Subramanya, learned counsel for the Tumakuru City Corporation while adopting the
arguments of the learned Advocate General contended that writ petitions are not maintainable in
view of the fact that Section 21(1) of the KMC Act prohibits entertaining of any proceedings before
any court of law, in relation to the notification issued under Section 21(1) of the KMC Act, 1976. He
would further contend that the reliefs sought in the present writ petitions are not maintainable in
view of Article 243ZG of Constitution of India. He further contended that the draft notification was
widely published and the general public were provided an opportunity to file objections. Admittedly,
the petitioners have not filed any objections to the draft notification and therefore it is not open for
them to assail the final notification dated 28.12.2017 by filing Writ Petitions in the month of
July-2018. Therefore he sought to dismiss the writ petitions.
30. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the following judgments
1. MEGHARAJ KOTHARI vs. DELIMITATION COMMISSION AND OTHERS {AIR 1967 SC 669 ...
paragraphs 20,21, 24, 32,33}
2. ASSOCIATION OF RESIDENT OF MHOW..... vs. DELIMITATION COMMISSION OF INDIA
AND OTHERS {2009 AIR SCW 3424 .. paragraphs 24 and 25} VIII. POINTS FOR
DETERMINATION
31. In view of the above rival contentions urged by the learned counsel for the parties, the points
that arise for consideration in these writ petitions are:
(i) Whether the writ petitions filed by the petitioners are maintainable in view of the
constitutional mandate of Article 243ZG of the Constitution of India?
(ii) Whether the petitioners have made out a case to interfere with the impugned final
delimitation notifications, under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, in
the facts and circumstances of these matters ?
32. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the
parties to the lis.
IX. CONSIDERATION
33. The substance of the case of the petitioners is that, the delimitation of wards is contrary to the
provisions of Section 21(2) of the KMC Act and not practicable throughout the cities of Mysuru and
Tumakuru and the delimitation of wards not contiguous and geographically each ward is not
compact. The population of each of the wards is not uniform. For example, the population of Ward
Nos.1 and 54 of Mysuru is 9,292 and 31,616 respectively. Similarly, the population of Ward Nos.9
and 30 of Tumakuru is 5,329 and 12,786 respectively. That is to say, it is contrary to the provisions
of Section 21(2) of the KMC Act. It was further contended that, delimitation of wards was made
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 19
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
without any basis and the same are in utter violation of Article 14 of Constitution of India.
Notification issued is not an authority of law. Further, the petitioners have not challenged either law
or allotment of seats. Therefore, writ petitions are maintainable etc.,
34. It is the specific case of the respondents that the division of wards was made strictly in terms of
provisions of Section 21 of the KMC Act and some of the petitioners have not filed objections to the
draft notification and elections are imminent. It is further case of the respondents that the
impugned notifications issued for delimitation of wards is a law relating to delimitation of
Constituencies and hence the present writ petitions are not maintainable before this Court under
Articles 226 and 227 of Constitution of India in view of the bar imposed by Article 243ZG of the
Constitution of India and this Court cannot stall the election process. Therefore, petitioners are not
entitled to any relief.
35. In view of the above, it is relevant to consider the provisions of Section 7 of KMC Act, 1976 which
reads as under:
7. Constitution of the Corporation.-- (1) The Corporation shall consist of,-
(a) such number of elected councillors not being less than thirty and not more than
two hundred as the Government, may by notification determine;

36. A plain reading of the said provisions make it clear that the Corporation shall consist of (a) such
number of elected councilors not being less than thirty and not more than two hundred as the
Government may, by notification determine; and (b) not exceeding ten percent of the total number
of Councillors in the case of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and not more than five persons in

37. Sub section (2) of Section 7 of the KMC Act prescribes that the seats shall be reserved in a
Corporation for the Scheduled Castes and for the Scheduled Tribes and the number of seats so
reserved shall be as nearly as may be, the same proportion to the total number of seats to be filled by
direct election in the Corporation as the population of the Scheduled Castes in the city or of the
Scheduled Tribes in the city bears to the total population of the city.
38. Sub Section (3) of Section 7 of the KMC Act prescribes that such number of seats which shall as
nearly as may be, one-third of the total number of seats to be filled by direct election in a
Corporation shall be reserved for persons belonging to the Backward classes; Provided that out of
the seats reserved under this sub-section, eighty percent of the total number of such seats shall be
reserved for the persons falling under category 'A' and the remaining 20% of the seats shall be
reserved for the persons falling under category B ; Provided further that if no person falling under
category 'A' is available, the seats reserved for the category shall also be filled by the persons falling
under Category 'B" and vice versa ; Provided also that the number of seats so reserved for the
Backward classes under this sub-section shall be so determined, that the total number of seats
reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes under sub section (2) and the backward classes
under sub section (3) shall not exceed fifty percent of total number of seats in the city corporations.
39. The explanation to Section 7 of the KMC Act prescribes that for the purpose of the said section
and proviso to clause (b) of sub section (1A) of section 10, categories 'A' and 'B' shall mean categories
A and B referred to in clause (1) of Section 2 of the KMC Act.
40. Clause (4) of section 7 of the KMC Act prescribes that not more than fifty percent of the seats
reserved for each category of persons belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
Backward classes and those of the non reserved seats to be filled by direct election in a Corporation
shall be reserved for women; Provided that the seats reserved in sub section (2), (3) and (4) shall be
allotted by rotation to the different wards in a city.
41. Sub section (5) of Section 7 prescribes that the councilors referred to clause (a) of sub section (1)
shall be elected in the manner provided in the KMC Act. Sub- Section (6) of Section 7 prescribes that
nothing contained in sub sections (2),(3) and (4) shall be deemed to prevent the members of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 22
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes or women from standing for election to non
reserved seats.
42. Section 8 of the KMC Act deals with term of office of the councilors which reads as under:
(1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the term of office of councillors,-
(i) directly elected at a general election shall be five years;
(ii)nominated by the Government under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 7
shall, subject to the pleasure of the Government, be five years.
(2) The term of office of the councillors shall commence on the date appointed for the first meeting
of the corporation.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, where two thirds of the total number of
councillors required to be elected have been elected, the Corporation shall be deemed to have been
duly constituted under this Act.
(4) If any casual vacancy occurs it shall be filled, as soon as may be, by the election of a person
thereto. The person so elected shall hold office only so long as the person in whose place he is
elected would have held had the vacancy not occurred:
Provided that no election to fill a casual vacancy shall be held if the vacancy occurs
within four months before the expiry by efflux of time of the term of office of the
councillors.
(5) A councillor may resign his office at any time by notice in writing addressed to the
Mayor and delivered to him and such resignation shall take effect from the date on
which it is delivered.
43. A plain reading of the said provision makes it clear that the term of the office of the councilors
directly elected at a general election shall be five years and the term of office of the Councillors
nominated by the Government under Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 7 shall, subject to the
pleasure of the Government, be five years. Sub Section (2) of Section 8 prescribes that the term of
office of councilors shall commence on the date appointed for the first meeting of the Corporation.
Sub Section (3) of Section 8 prescribes that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, where
two-thirds of the total number of councilors required to be elected have been elected, the
Corporation shall be deemed to have been duly constituted under the Act. Sub-section (4) of Section
8 prescribes that if any casual vacancy occurs it shall be filled, as soon as may be, by the election of a
person thereto. The person so elected shall hold office only so long as person in whose place he is
elected would have held had the vacancy not occurred ; Provided that no election to fill casual
vacancy shall be held if vacancy occurs within four months before the expiry by efflux of time of the
term of office of the councilors.

44. Sub Section (5) of Section 8 prescribes that a councilor may resign his office at any time by
notice in writing addressed to the Mayor and delivered to him and such resignation shall take effect
from the date on which it is delivered.
45. Chapter IV of the KMC Act deals with Election and Section 21 of Chapter IV deals with
determination of wards, which reads as under:
Determination of 1 [wards], etc.--
(1) For purposes of elections Government shall, by notification, determine,-
(a) the [wards] into which the city shall be divided and the extent of each [wards];
(b) the number of seats [alloted to each ward which shall be one];
(c) the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes,
[Backward Classes and women] and the [wards] in which such seats shall be
reserved.
[1A) No notification under sub-section (1) shall be called in question in any court of law;] (2) The
ratio between the number of councillors to be elected from each [ward] and the population of that
[ward] shall so far as practicable be the same throughout the city.
(3) The State Government may make rules for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2).
46. A plain reading of the said provision makes it clear that for the purposes of elections
Government shall, by notification, determine (a) the wards into which city shall, be divided and the
extent of each wards. (b) The number of seats allotted to each ward which shall be one, (c) the
number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes and
Women and the wards in which such seats shall be reserved. Sub Section (1A) of Section 21
prescribes that no notification under sub Section (1) shall be called in question in any court of law.
47. Sub section (2) of Section 21 prescribes that the ratio between the number of Councillors to be
elected from each ward and the population of that ward shall so far as practicable be the same
throughout the city. Sub section 3 of Section 21 prescribes that the State Government may make
rules for the purposes of sub-sections (1) and (2).
48. With a view to provide for setting up democratic institutions at the grass-root level by virtue of
Seventy- fourth Amendment to the Constitution, Part IX-A providing for establishment of the
Municipalities was incorporated in the Constitution w.e.f 1.6.1993. The object of introducing Part IX
A in the Constitution of India was that in many States the local bodies were not working properly
and the timely elections were not being held and the nominated bodies were continuing for long
periods. Election had been irregular and many times unnecessarily delayed or postponed and the
elected bodies had been superseded or suspended without adequate justification at the whims and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 24
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
fancies of the State authorities. The new provisions i.e., Articles 243P to 243ZG were added in the
Constitution of India with a view to restore the rightful place in political governance for local bodies.
It was considered necessary to provide a constitutional status to such bodies and to ensure regular
and fair conduct of election.
49. A contention was raised by the petitioners that the delimitation of wards was not properly
effected by the respondent authorities in terms of the provisions of Section 21 of KMC Act, especially
provisions of sub Section (2) of Section 21 which prescribes that the ratio between the number of
Councillors from each ward and the population of that ward shall so far as practicable be the same
throughout the city. But, the Table - Annexure R-4 to the additional statement of objections filed by
the Mysuru City Corporation in W.P. Nos.30543-30545/2018 clearly depicts that the delimitation of
wards was done on the basis of population of Mysuru as per 2011 census. A careful perusal of
Annexure-R4 - Table discloses the information of delimitation of 65 wards, which clearly indicates
that uniformity in the population for each ward is maintained with 10% variation and there is no
double population in any of the wards as contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners. It is
also not in dispute that the division of wards was made on the basis of population within Mysuru
City Corporation as per 2011 census.
50. The population within the Mysuru City Corporation limits as per 2011 census document is
8,93,062 and the population of Mysuru including the outer growth is 9,20,550 as per 2011 census.
Outer growth area includes the layouts that are being developed by MUDA and others which is
approved by MUDA. The population has been divided and distributed to different wards following
the Government guidelines and a perusal of table as per Anenxure-R4 depicts the population in the
earlier delimitation of wards and the present delimitation of wards. While preparing the
delimitation, the Corporation has followed enumerated blocks as identified by census. A perusal of
the process of the delimitation to one of the wards would reveal laborious process undertaken by the
Corporation. Therefore the contention of learned counsel for petitioners that the delimitation of
wards is not practicable as contemplated in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 21 of the KMC Act,
cannot be accepted.
51. Article 243Q of Constitution of India deals with constitution of Municipalities. Clause 1(b) of
Article 243Q refers to a Municipal Council for a smaller urban area and Clause 1(c) of Article 243Q
refers to a Municipal Corporation for a larger urban area. Article 243K of the Constitution of India
depicts the power of the State Election Commission to conduct elections.
52. The material on record clearly depicts that though the election is imminent to be conducted on
or before 05.09.2018, the State Government has not issued the notifications for delimitation within
the time stipulated. Therefore, the Election Commission has approached this Court by way of writ
petition for a mandamus against State Government. When the matter was pending before the Court,
the State Government issued draft and final notifications. Admittedly, the final notification issued
on 28.12.2017 in respect of Tumakuru and on 23.4.2018 in respect of Mysuru for delimitation of
wards and writ petitions are filed in the month of July-2018 by few petitioners before this court
challenging the delimitation of wards on the ground that State Election Commission and the State
Government have not discharged the constitutional mandate etc., It is equally true that when the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 25
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
draft notification was issued inviting the objections, only some of the petitioners have filed
objections and others have not filed any objections and ultimately, final notification came to be
issued as long back as on 28.12.2017 in respect of Tumakuru and on 23.4.2018 in respect of Mysuru
and the writ petitions are filed only in the month of July-2018, that too when the elections are
imminent. Therefore, the petitioners also have no social obligation and they have not come to this
Court within the time and they have filed writ petitions at the fag end of the day raising various
questions/problems, which clearly indicate that both the Election Commission, State Government as
well as petitioners are indirectly pressurizing the Court at the fag end of the day, which is
impermissible.
53. A careful perusal of the draft notifications dated 20.6.2017 and 8.2.2018 and the final
notifications dated 28.12.2017 and 23.4.2018 in respect of Tumakuru and Mysuru respectively
issued by the respondent-Government clearly depict that the State Government issued the said
notifications under the provisions of Sections 7(2)(a) and 21 of KMC Act in terms of 2011 census and
writ petitions were filed at the fag end of the day i.e., in the month of July-2018. Therefore, the
petitioners are not entitled to any relief before this Court, when the elections are imminent to be
conducted before 05.09.2018 as mandated by the Constitution of India.
54. If holding of election is allowed to be stalled on the complaint of few individuals/petitioners,
then grave injustice will be done to lakhs of other voters, who have a right to elect their
representatives to the local bodies. The Court should not intervene when the elections were
imminent. It must be stated that though the constitutional bar applies, it will not take away the
power of the Courts in examining the effect of the notification issued under Section 21 of the KMC
Act, if such notification cannot be traced to Article - 243ZA. If the notification issued for
delimitation of the constituencies and allotment of seats thereof is a law arising under Article
243ZA, the same cannot be called in question in view of Article 243ZG. If that is so, the provisions
arising under Section 21(1-A) is superfluous as it merely gives effect to the provisions of the
Constitution. If it exceeds that scope or falls short of the same in meeting the requirements thereof,
a notification issued thereunder can certainly be examined as to its validity. By careful reading of the
notifications issued by the State Government exercising powers under Section 21 of the KMC Act, it
may not be possible to say that the notifications have the force of law and is beyond challenge by
virtue of Article 243ZG of the Constitution of India, but the challenge should be made soon after
final notifications issued. In the present case, admittedly draft notifications were issued on
20.6.2017 and 8.2.2018 and the final notifications were issued on 28.12.2017 and 23.4.2018 in
respect of Tumakuru and Mysuru Corporations respectively and writ petitions were filed in the
month of July-2018 after lapse of several months. The same is impermissible in view of the dictum
of the Apex Court in the case of ANUGRAH NARAIN SINGH vs. STATE OF U.P. AND OTHERS
reported in (1996)6 SCC 303, wherein at paragraphs 24 and 25 it is held as under:
24. The validity of Sections 6-A, 31, 32 and 33 of the U.P. Act dealing with
delimitation of wards cannot be questioned in a court of law because of the express
bar imposed by Article 243-ZG of the Constitution. Section 7 contains rules for
allotment of seats to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Backward
Class people. The validity of that section cannot also be challenged. That apart, in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 26
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
instant case, when the delimitation of the wards was made, such delimitation was not
challenged on the ground of colourable exercise of power or on any other ground of
arbitrariness. Any such challenge should have been made as soon as the final order
was published in the Gazette after objections to the draft order were considered and
not after the notification for holding of the elections was issued. As was pointed out
in Lakshmi Charan Sen case [(1985) 4 SCC 689] , that the fact that certain claims and
objections had not been disposed of before the final order was passed, cannot arrest
the process of election.
25. In this connection, it may be necessary to mention that there is one feature to be
found in the Delimitation Commission Act, 1962 which is absent in the U.P. Act.
Section 10 of the Act of 1962 provided that the Commission shall cause each of its
order made under Sections 8 and 9 to be published in the Gazette of India and in the
Official Gazettes of the States concerned. Upon publication in the Gazette of India
every such order shall have the force of law and shall not be called in question in any
Court. Because of these specific provisions of the Delimitation Commission Act, 1962,
in the case of Meghraj Kothari v. Delimitation Commission [AIR 1967 SC 669 : 1967
MPLJ 553] , this Court held that notification of orders passed under Sections 8 and 9
of that Act had the force of law and therefore, could not be assailed in any court of
law because of the bar imposed by Article 329.
The U.P. Act of 1959, however, merely provides that the draft order of delimitation of municipal
areas shall be published in the Official Gazette for objections for a period of not less than seven days.
The draft order may be altered or modified after hearing the objections filed, if any. Thereupon, it
shall become final. It does not lay down that such an order upon reaching finality will have the force
of law and shall not be questioned in any court of law. For this reason, it may not be possible to say
that such an order made under Section 32 of the U.P. Act has the force of law and is beyond
challenge by virtue of Article 243-ZG. But any such challenge should be made soon after the final
order is published. The Election Court constituted under Section 61 of the U.P. Act will not be
competent to entertain such an objection. In other words, this ground cannot be said to be
comprised in sub-clause (iv) of clause (d) of Section 71 of the U.P. Act. In the very nature of things,
the Election Court cannot entertain or give any relief on this score. The validity of a final order
published under Section 33 of the U.P. Act is beyond the ken of Election Court constituted under
Section 61 of the said Act.
55. It is not in dispute that Article 243P(g) defines 'population' to mean the population as
ascertained at the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Articles 243P(g) and 243T of the
Constitution of India in the case of ANUGRAH NARAIN SINGH cited supra held at Paragraph-33 as
under:
33. In our view, the argument advanced on behalf of the State must be upheld. It is
true that Article 243-P(g) has defined 'population' to mean "population as
ascertained by the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 27
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
published". The delimitation of constituencies and also preparation of electoral rolls
will have to be done on the basis of the figures available from the last census which
was taken in 1991. Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is
mandatory under Article 243-T of the Constitution. This must also be done on the
basis of the available figures from the census. Clause (6) of Article 243-T of the
Constitution has made it permissible for the State Government to reserve seats for
other Backward Classes. The census of 1991 has not enumerated the number of
persons belonging to Backward Classes.
Therefore, in order to reserve seats for citizens belonging to Backward Classes, their number will
have to be found out. Clause (6) of Article 243-T has impliedly empowered the State Government to
ascertain the Backward Classes and the number of people belonging to such classes. Otherwise, the
provisions of clause (6) of Article 243-T will become otiose and meaningless. Merely because, such
an enumeration of people belonging to Backward Classes was made, does not mean that the figures
enumerated by the last census were discarded. The latest available census figures had to be the basis
for delimitation of the constituencies, preparation of electoral rolls and also for reservation of seats
for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women. But census figures are not available for persons
belonging to Backward Classes. The next census will be in the year 2001. There is no way to reserve
seats for Backward Classes in the meantime except by making a survey of the number of persons
belonging to such classes for the purpose of giving them assured representation in the municipal
bodies. To do this exercise is not to do away with the last available census figures but to find out
what was not to be found by the last census. Had such counting been done in the census, then it
would not have been open to the State Government to embark upon a survey of its own. The State
Government here had only two choices. It could say that there will be no reservation for people
belonging to Backward Classes because, the census figures of such people are not available or it
could make a survey and count the number of people belonging to the Backward Classes and reserve
seats for them in the municipal bodies. The State Government has taken the latter course. This is in
consonance with the provisions of clause (6) of Article 243-T. Therefore, the survey made by the
State Government for finding out the number of persons belonging to Backward Classes was not in
any way contrary to or in conflict with any of the provisions of the Constitution.
56. It is an undisputed fact that every Corporation shall have a lifespan of five years and if dissolved
earlier, fresh elections will have to be held within the time specified in clause (3) of Article 243U of
the Constitution of India, which reads as under:
243U. Duration of Municipalities, etc:-
(1) Every Municipality, unless sooner dissolved under any law for the time being in
force, shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no
longer: Provided that a Municipality shall be given a reasonable opportunity of being
heard before its dissolution (2) No amendment of any law for the time being in force
shall have the effect of causing dissolution of a Municipality at any level, which is
functioning immediately before such amendment, till the expiration of its duration
specified in clause(1) (3) An election to Constitute a Municipality shall be completed,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 28
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
(a) before the expiry of its duration specified in clause ( 1 );
(b) before the expiration of a period of six months from the date of its dissolution:
Provided that where the remainder of the period for which the dissolved Municipality
would have continued is less than six months, it shall not be necessary to hold any
election under this clause for constituting the Municipality for such period.
(4) A Municipality constituted upon the dissolution of a Municipality before the
expiration of its duration shall continue only for the remainder of the period for
which the dissolved Municipality would have continued under, clause(1) had it not
been so dissolved.
57. It is an undisputed fact that in view of provisions of section 21(1) and (2) and 35(1)(d)(iv) of the
KMC Act and Articles 243ZA, 243ZG and 243U of the Constitution of India, the delimitation of
wards was done on the basis of latest census figures. Admittedly in the present case, both the draft
and final notifications were issued by the State Government for the delimitation of wards on the
basis of 2011 census figures. The alleged violation of population of wards stated in terms of statute
would not in any way affect the petitioners and ultimately it is for the petitioners to file election
petitions before the appropriate Court/Election Tribunal. On that ground also writ petitions are
liable to be dismissed.
58. It is also not in dispute that the duration of Municipalities is fixed as five years and it is
mandatory in nature and any violation cannot be justified in view of Article 243U of Constitution of
India. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Articles 243K, 243ZA, 324,
243E, 243U, 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India in the case of KISHANSING TOMAR vs.
MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF THE CITY OF AHMEDABAD reported in (2006)8 SCC 352 held
at paragraphs 19, 20, 21 and 22 as under:
19. From the opinion thus expressed by this Court, it is clear that the State Election
Commission shall not put forward any excuse based on unreasonable grounds that
the election could not be completed in time. The Election Commission shall try to
complete the election before the expiration of the duration of five years' period as
stipulated in clause (5). Any revision of electoral rolls shall be carried out in time and
if it cannot be carried out within a reasonable time, the election has to be conducted
on the basis of the then existing electoral rolls. In other words, the Election
Commission shall complete the election before the expiration of the duration of five
years' period as stipulated in clause (5) and not yield to situations that may be created
by vested interests to postpone elections from being held within the stipulated time.
20. The majority opinion in Lakshmi Charan Sen v. A.K.M. Hassan Uzzaman [(1985)
4 SCC 689] held that the fact that certain claims and objections are not finally
disposed of while preparing the electoral rolls or even assuming that they are not
filed in accordance with law cannot arrest the process of election to the legislature.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 29
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
The election has to be held on the basis of the electoral rolls which are in force on the
last date for making nomination. It is true that the Election Commission shall take
steps to prepare the electoral rolls by following due process of law, but that too,
should be done timely and in no circumstances, it shall be delayed so as to cause
gross violation of the mandatory provisions contained in Article 243-U of the
Constitution.
21. It is true that there may be certain man-
made calamities, such as rioting or breakdown of law and order, or natural calamities which could
distract the authorities from holding elections to the municipality, but they are exceptional
circumstances and under no (sic other) circumstance would the Election Commission be justified in
delaying the process of election after consulting the State Government and other authorities. But
that should be an exceptional circumstance and shall not be a regular feature to extend the duration
of the municipality. Going by the provisions contained in Article 243-U, it is clear that the period of
five years fixed thereunder to constitute the municipality is mandatory in nature and has to be
followed in all respects. It is only when the municipality is dissolved for any other reason and the
remainder of the period for which the dissolved municipality would have continued is less than six
months, it shall not be necessary to hold any elections for constituting the municipality for such
period.
22. In our opinion, the entire provision in the Constitution was inserted to see that there should not
be any delay in the constitution of the new municipality every five years and in order to avoid the
mischief of delaying the process of election and allowing the nominated bodies to continue, the
provisions have been suitably added to the Constitution. In this direction, it is necessary for all the
State Governments to recognise the significance of the State Election Commission, which is a
constitutional body and it shall abide by the directions of the Commission in the same manner in
which it follows the directions of the Election Commission of India during the elections for
Parliament and the State Legislatures. In fact, in the domain of elections to the panchayats and the
municipal bodies under Part IX and Part IX-A for the conduct of the elections to these bodies they
enjoy the same status as the Election Commission of India.
59. It is also not in dispute that the duration of five years as provided or prescribed for
Municipalities and the elections to the Municipalities which include Municipal Corporation are
mandatorily required to be held within a period of five years. After completion of five years, fresh
bodies or representatives have to be elected and constituted by holding the elections i.e., on or
before 5.9.2018 in the present cases. Therefore the respondents cannot be directed to flout the
mandate of the Constitution by quashing the impugned notification issued for delimitation of wards.
In order to obey the constitutional mandate, the respondents are in a hurry to hold elections and
also issued calendar of events. If the elections are not held within the time stipulated under the
Constitution, it would certainly lead to breach of the constitutional mandate. Besides, it would result
in breakdown of the democratic set up as envisaged under the Constitution.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 30
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
60. A careful perusal of Article 243U of the Constitution of India would depict that the election to
the Municipalities/Corporations will have to be held before the expiry of its duration of five years as
specified in Clause (1) of Article 243U of the Constitution. The State Election Commissioner has
already taken preliminary steps for holding the elections by issuing calendar of events/necessary
instructions to all the Deputy Commissioners concerned. It is true that there are differences of ratio
of population in some of the wards as per the documents relied upon by some of the petitioners.
Subsequently the same has been rectified by the Municipal Corporations in consonance with the
provisions of sub- section (2) of Section 21 of the Constitution of India as per the Table - Annexure
R4 filed by the Respondent - Mysuru City Corporation along with the additional statement of
objections. That itself is not a ground to entertain the writ petitions at this stage, when the elections
are imminent, moreso when the petitioners have an alternative and efficacious remedy of taking
such ground in the election petition. Therefore the petitioners are not entitled to any relief before
this Court under the extraordinary writ jurisdiction.
61. The main grievance of the petitioners is that there is a breach of statutory provisions while doing
delimitation of wards on the basis of 2011 census figures. The same cannot be a ground to stall
holding of election in the present writ petitions and the same would be a ground for election petition
in view of the provisions of Articles 226, 243ZA, 243ZG and 243U of the Constitution of India. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Articles 243ZG and 226 of the
Constitution of India in the case of ANUGRAH NARIAN cited supra held at paragraphs 11, 12, 14, 15,
17, 28 and 35 as under:
11. The question that came up for decision before the Allahabad High Court has been
stated in the judgment in the following words:
"... the common question raised in all these petitions is as to whether in terms of
Article 243-ZG of the Constitution there is complete and absolute bar in considering
any matter relating to municipal election on any ground whatsoever after the
publication of the notification for holding municipal election."
12. The answer must be emphatically in the affirmative. The bar imposed by Article 243-ZG is
twofold. Validity of laws relating to delimitation and allotment of seats made under Article 243- ZA
cannot be questioned in any court. No election to a municipality can be questioned except by an
election petition. Moreover, it is well settled by now that if the election is imminent or well under
way, the court should not intervene to stop the election process. If this is allowed to be done, no
election will ever take place because someone or the other will always find some excuse to move the
court and stall the elections. There were ten petitioners in the main writ petition and several others
in connected writ petitions, who had questioned the fairness of the action of the authorities
concerned in publication of the notifications dated 11-10-1995 and 13-10- 1995 pursuant to which
the elections to the Municipal Corporations throughout the State of U.P. were to be held. The State
Government and also the Election Commission took the stand before the High Court that after the
publication of the notification for holding municipal elections, the High Court under Article 226 of
the Constitution could not interfere with the election process. On the other hand, the writ
petitioners' contention was that the election was being held in a farcical manner and the confidence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 31
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
of the people had been shaken in the electoral process and the constitutional guarantee regarding
constitution and composition of the municipalities had been thrown to the winds. In this situation,
Article 243-ZG could not be treated as an absolute bar to doing justice under Article 226 of the
Constitution.
14. There are several reasons why these arguments of the writ petitioners should not have been
upheld. The High Court overlooked the fact that no municipal election had been held in the State for
nearly ten years and the dates of the elections were fixed under the direction given by the High
Court in another case.
Importance of holding elections at regular intervals for panchayats, municipal bodies or legislatures
cannot be overemphasised. If holding of elections is allowed to be stalled on the complaint of a few
individuals, then grave injustice will be done to crores of other voters who have a right to elect their
representatives to the local bodies. As a result of the order of the High Court, elections that were
going to be held to the local bodies after a long lapse of nearly ten years were postponed indefinitely.
It was pointed out by this Court in the case of Lakshmi Charan Sen v. A.K.M. Hassan Uzzaman
[(1985) 4 SCC 689] , that: (SCC p. 703, para 21) "... the fact that certain claims and objections are
not finally disposed of, even assuming that they are filed in accordance with law, cannot arrest the
process of election to the legislature. The election has to be held on the basis of the electoral roll
which is in force on the last date for making nominations".
15. The Court also quoted from its order dated 30-3-1982 that: (SCC pp. 219-20, para 1) "... no High
Court in the exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution should pass any orders,
interim or otherwise, which has the tendency or effect of postponing an election, which is reasonably
imminent and in relation to which its writ jurisdiction is invoked. The imminence of the electoral
process is a factor which must guide and govern the passing of orders in the exercise of the High
Court's writ jurisdiction.
The more imminent such process, the greater ought to be the reluctance of the High Court to do
anything, or direct anything to be done, which will postpone that process indefinitely by creating a
situation in which, the Government of a State cannot be carried on in accordance with the
provisions of the Constitution. ... The High Courts must observe a self-
imposed limitation on their power to act under Article 226, by refusing to pass orders or give
directions which will inevitably result in an indefinite postponement of elections to legislative
bodies, which are the very essence of the democratic foundation and functioning of our
Constitution".
17. In Lakshmi Charan Sen case [(1985) 4 SCC 689] , this Court was dealing with Part XV of the
Constitution which deals with preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to
Parliament, and to the Legislatures of different States and all elections to the offices of the President
and the Vice-President. We are in this case, concerned with the elections to municipal bodies. But
the principles laid down in Lakshmi Charan Sen case [(1985) 4 SCC 689] will apply in full force to
municipal elections because various articles dealing with holding of municipal elections in Part IX-A
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 32
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
of the Constitution are similarly worded. In fact, highest importance has been attached to holding of
panchayat as well as municipal elections by the Constitution. Parts IX and IX-A of the Constitution
were introduced by the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 and (74th Amendment) Act, 1992.
By these two Parts, it was intended to take democracy to the grass- root level. Part IX deals with
constitution of panchayats, composition of panchayats and holding of regular elections to the
panchayats. Article 243-O contains a bar to interference by Court in electoral matters. This bar is
similar to the bar contained in Article 329 of the Constitution in Part XV, the implication of which
was explained by this Court in the case of Lakshmi Charan Sen [(1985) 4 SCC 689] .
28. Therefore, so far as preparation of the electoral roll is concerned, there are sufficient safeguards
in the Act against any abuse or misuse of power. In view of these provisions and particularly, in view
of sub-section (6) of Section 39 which provides for appeals in regard to inclusion, deletion or
correction of names, there is hardly any scope for a court to intervene and correct the electoral rolls
under Article 226 of the Constitution. In fact, if this is allowed to be done, every election will be
indefinitely delayed and it will not be possible to comply with the mandate of the Constitution that
every Municipality shall have a life span of five years, or less, if dissolved earlier, and thereafter
fresh elections will have to be held within the time specified in clause (3) of Article 243-U. Having
regard to the provisions for filing objections and also the right of appeal against inclusion, deletion
and correction of names and also to the constitutional authority of the Election Commission to give
directions in all matters pertaining to elections, the Court should not have intervened at all on the
basis of allegations as to preparation of electoral rolls.
35. Lastly, the Court on no account should have directed postponement of the elections by the
impugned judgment and order dated 13-11- 1995. On 11-10-1995, the notification for holding the
municipal elections was issued. 16- 10-1995 to 20-10-1995 was the period during which the
nomination papers could be filed. 24- 10-1995 was the last date for withdrawal of nomination
papers. Voting was to take place between 17-11-1995 to 20-11-1995. The writ petition was filed as late
as 26-10-1995 on the allegation that there were defects in the electoral rolls, delimitation of
constituencies and reservation of seats. A similar writ petition moved before the Lucknow Bench of
the Allahabad High Court (WP No. 2997 of 1995) had been dismissed by the Court on 18-10-1995.
Barely one week before the voting was scheduled to commence, the Court decided to intervene in the
matter regardless of the repeated warnings given by this Court in a number of earlier decisions. The
Court decided to intervene in the matter and stop the election process while it was nearing
completion. In Lakshmi Charan case [(1985) 4 SCC 689] , it was held that the Court should not
intervene even when the elections were imminent. Here, the election was well under way.
62. This Court while considering the provisions of Article 243E of the Constitution of India in the
case of PROFESSOR B.K. CHANDRASHEKAR vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA {ILR 1999 Kar. 2513}
held at paragraph 23 as under:
23. Commission had proposed to hold elections before the expiry of the term of the
earlier panchayat in two phases and when was due to issue the calender of events the
Government proposed to make structural changes regarding the declaration of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 33
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
panchayat area, population criteria etc. Can it be said that process of election had
begun and therefore the ordinance would have no effect on the election due in the
month of March/April 1999? It is to be seen that when the Commission was about to
issue calender of events, the ordinance was promulgated. Supreme Court of India in
N.P. Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer, Namakkal [ AIR 1952 SC 64.] while
considering as to when the 'elections' commence, held that necessarily elections do
not commence with the issue of the calender of events only. It would depend upon
the situation of facts of each case. While assigning meaning to the word 'election'
used in the context of Articles 324 and 329(b) of the Constitution it was held that the
word 'election' can be and has been properly used with reference to the entire process
which consists of several stages and embraces many steps, some of which may have
an important bearing on the result of the process. The relevant extract of the
observations of the Supreme Court reads: (From para 7) "It seems to me that the
word 'election' has been used in Part XV of the Constitution in the wide sense, that is
to say, to connote the entire procedure to be gone through to return a candidate to
the legislature. The use of the expression 'conduct of elections' in Article 324
specifically points to the wide meaning, and that meaning can also be read
consistently into the other provisions which occur in Part XV including Article
329(b). That the word 'election' bears this wide meaning whenever we talk of
elections in a democratic country, is borne out by the fact that in most of the books
on the subject and in several cases dealing with the matter, one of the questions
mooted is, when the election begins. The subject is dealt with quite concisely in
Halsbury's Laws of England in the following passage see P. 237 of Halsburry's Laws
of England, Edn. 2 Vol. 12 under the heading 'Commencement of the election.':
'Although the first formal step in every election is the issue of the writ, the election is
considered for some purposes to being at an earlier date. It is a question of fact in
each case when an election begins in such a way as to make the parties concerned
responsible for breaches of election law, the test being whether the contest in
'reasonably imminent'. Neither the issue of the writ nor the publication of the notice
of election can be looked to as fixing the date when an election begins from this point
of view, Nor, again, does the nomination day afford any criterion. The election will
usually begin at least earlier than the issue of the writ. The question when the election
begins must be carefully distinguished from that as to when 'the conduct and
management of' an election may be said to begin. Again, the question as to when a
particular person commences to be a candidate is a question to be considered in each
case.' The discussion in this passage makes it clear that the word 'election' can be and
has been appropriately used with reference to the entire process which consists of
several stages and embraces many steps, some of which may have an-important
bearing on the result of the process."
The election Commission had taken all steps in connection with the preparation of
polls and issue of notifications under Section 5(1) followed by the notifications by the
Deputy Commissioner under Sections 5(2), 5(3) and 5(4). Election Commission had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 34
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
also issued the notification under Section 5(5) delimiting the Constituencies in each
panchayat. In the context of the facts of this case, it cannot be said that the process of
election would have begun only with the issuance of calender of events. It is apparent
that the Election Commission had taken all preparatory steps and the process of
election had already been put in motion once the process of election begins, the
election cannot be postponed. Elections to the Panchayats under the circumstances
could not be post poned. As observed earlier the timings of the issuance of the
ordinance is not mere coincidental. Resulting effect of the ordinance is postponement
of election to the Grama Panchayats in the State thereby flouting the mandate of the
Constitution of India which cannot be countenanced or accepted under any
circumstances. To that extent the ordinance has to be ignored.
63. This Court while considering the provisions of Section 21 of the KMC Act and the provisions of
Parts IX and IX A of the Constitution of India in the case of SURENDRA BABU vs. STATE OF
KARNATAKA {ILR 1996 KAR 1797} held at paragraph-9 as under:
9. The second contention urged is that Section 21(1A) of the Karnataka Municipal
Corporation Act is invalid. The decision of the Supreme Court in Meghraj's case [AIR
1967 SC 669.] deals with an identical provision arising under the Delimitation Act
which we have adverted to earlier. We have already upheld Article 243 ZG as valid
which bars the interference of Courts in matters pertaining to delimination of wards
or allotment of seats. Under the Delimitation Act enacted which pertains to the
delimitation of constituencies in relation to Parliament, the Court examined the
scope of the matter and stated that notwithstanding the limitation arising under
Article 329(a) unless such notification is deemed to be law for purpose of Article
243ZA.
Article 243ZG would not prevent investigation by any Court of law. Therefore, it is unnecessary to
strike down this provision even assuming that the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioner
may be correct, as the scope is limited. If the notification issued for delimitation of the
constituencies and allotment of seats thereof is a law arising under Article 243ZA, the same cannot
be called in question in view of Article 243ZG. If that is so, the provisions arising under Section
21(1A) is superfluous as it merely gives effect to the provisions of the Constitution to which we have
made reference just now. If it exceeds that scope or falls short of the same in meeting the
requirements thereof, a notification issued there under can certainly be examined as to its validity.
Thus, the second contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is also rejected. In any event, we
cannot hold that Section 21-A of the Act is invalid.
64. Insofar as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners in the case of
BHARATHI REDDY vs. STATE OF KARANTAKA {(2017)12 SCC 61}, it was a case under the
Karnataka Panchayath Raj Act and the Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of
Article 243-O of the Constitution of India, held that power of judicial review under Articles 226 and
227 of the Constitution is an essential feature of Constitution which can neither be tinkered with nor
eroded and even Constitution cannot be amended to erode the basic structure of the Constitution
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 35
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
and therefore, it cannot be said that the writ petitions filed by Respondent Nos.6 to 9 therein under
Article 226 of Constitution of India is not maintainable; However, it is left to the discretion of the
Court exercising the power under Articles 226 and 227 to entertain the writ petitions.
65. In the present case though a contention was raised that writ petitions are not maintainable in
view of the bar under Article 243-U of the Constitution of India, it has to be stated that the
notification issued by the State Government for delimitation of wards cannot be considered as law.
Therefore, writ petitions though maintainable, still the petitioners are not entitled to any
discretionary relief under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India since the petitioners filed
writ petitions at a belated stage and the elections to the Local bodies are imminent in view of Article
243U of Constitution of India and the elections cannot be postponed because of few individuals.
66. Learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon several judgments in support of their
contentions that notification issued by the State Government is not the law and therefore the writ
petitions are maintainable. This Court is not dismissing the petitions on the ground of
maintainability, but this court has decided the matters on merits as stated supra. Therefore, the
judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners are not applicable to the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the present cases.
67. It is relevant to state at this stage that the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.32989/2018 & W.P
Nos.32990-991/2018 have sought for quashing the impugned notification dated 23.04.2018 issued
by the 1st Respondent, insofar as not determining the layouts which have been handed over by the
4th Respondent-Mysore Urban Development Authority, more particularly not determining the
Preethi and Sai Layout in the impugned notification for any of the wards to the election for the office
of councilors in the 3rd Respondent Mysore City Corporation. The petitioners have sought for the
above reliefs to enable them to franchise their votes in the ensuing elections to be conducted for
Mysuru City Corporation/Urban Local Bodies in pursuance of the impugned notification dated
23.4.2018 issued by the 1st respondent.
68. Learned Advocate General appearing for the respondent - State, on instructions submits that no
voter within the limits of Mysuru City Corporation/Urban Local Body will be deprived to franchise
their votes and assured the Court that he will instruct the Deputy Commissioner, Mysuru to take all
necessary immediate steps to include the names of the petitioners as well as the residents of Preethi
and Sai lay-outs of Mysuru in the voters' list for the ensuing election to be conducted for Mysuru
City Corporation/Urban Local Bodies, in accordance with law.
69. Therefore it is appropriate to dispose of Writ Petition Nos.32989/2018 & W.P
Nos.32990-991/2018 with a direction to the respondents, in particular to the Deputy Commissioner,
Mysuru to include the names of the petitioners as well as the residents of Preethi and Sai lay- outs of
Mysuru in the voters' list so as to enable them to franchise their vote in the ensuing elections to be
conducted for the Mysuru City Corporation/Local bodies X. CONCLUSION
70. For the reasons stated above, the point No.1 raised in the present writ petitions has to be
answered in the affirmative holding that the writ petitions are maintainable and the point No.2 has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157139464/ 36
Mr. Shiva Madhu vs State Of Karnataka on 9 August, 2018
to be answered in the negative holding that the petitioners have not made out a case to interfere
with the impugned final delimitation notifications under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of
India since the elections have to be completed on or before 5th September 2018 as per the
constitutional mandate in view of provisions of Article 243U of Constitution of India.
71. In view of the aforesaid reasons, the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.30543-30545/2018 c/w
Writ Petition Nos. 29858-29862/2018, 31438-31442/2018, 33432-33435/ 2018 are not entitled to
any relief. Accordingly the said writ petitions are dismissed.
Writ Petition Nos. 32989/2018 & W.P Nos.32990- 991/2018 are disposed of with a direction to the
respondents, in particular to the Deputy Commissioner, Mysuru to include the names of the
petitioners as well as the residents of Preethi and Sai lay-outs of Mysuru in the voters' list so as to
enable them to exercise their franchise in the ensuing elections to be conducted for the Mysuru City
Corporation/Local bodies, in accordance with law.
