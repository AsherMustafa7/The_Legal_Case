HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR
ORAL JUDGMENT & ORDER
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR) Date : 08-04-2019 Heard Mr. Rajendra
Narayan, learned Senior Advocate, and Mr. Prabhakar Singh, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf
of the petitioners. The State is heard through Mr. P.N. Shahi, learned AAG-6, Mr. Sunil Kumar
Mandal, learned SC-3, and learned AC to SC-10.
2. These batch of writ petitions have primarily been filed for declaration of Rules 4, 5, 15 and 16 of
the Bihar Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as
the Rules of 2017) as ultra vires on the ground that the State Government has Patna High Court
CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 travelled beyond its competence in framing such clauses in
the Rules of 2017, referred to above.
3. It may not be necessary for us to recount the status of the writ-petitioners and their respective
grievances for the reason that the attack is primarily on the vires of the aforesaid clauses of the
Rules of 2017; though all the petitioners in the aforesaid writ petitions are either the members of the
Child Welfare Committee or Juvenile Justice Board, whose appointments were made under the
erstwhile Rules of 2012 and 2015. As such, they have prayed for being allowed to continue on such
posts in the Juvenile Justice Board or the Child Welfare Committee till the age of sixty five (65)
years or of giving remuneration to them as per the rules made by the Government as well as for
payment of arrears of salary. It may not be necessary for us to deal with their respective grievances
and prayers, for the reason that the issues would stand resolved by noticing the arguments on vires
of the clauses of the Rules of 2017 and deciding the aforesaid core issue.
4. Before the grounds urged on behalf of the Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017
dt.08-04-2019 writ-petitioners are adverted to, it may however be noted that under the Juvenile
Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 2015) and
the dictionary provided in Section 2 thereof, defines "child in need of care and protection" [Section
2(14)]; "Board" meaning a Juvenile Justice Board constituted under Section 4 of the Act [Section
2(10)]; and "Committee", which is Child Welfare Committee (hereinafter referred to as the CWC)
constituted under Section 27 of the Act [Section 2(22)].
5. Though the challenge in these batch of writ petitions have been made with respect to Rules 4, 5,
15 and 16 of the Rules of 2017, which includes Composition of the Juvenile Justice Board (Rule 4);
Terms of Members of the Board (Rule 5); Composition and Qualifications of Members of the CWC
(Rule 15) and Rules and Procedure of the CWC (Rule 16), but the challenge, after some arguments,
has been limited to the vires of the Rule 15 of the Rules of 2017 and especially sub-Clause (2)
thereof.

Fedeartaion Of C. W. C. And J. J. B. Member ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 April, 2019
6. Hence, the discussions hereinafter shall only Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017
dt.08-04-2019 be with respect to the vires of Rule 15(2) of the Rules of 2017.
7. Section 27 of the Act of 2015 reads as follows: (it may be noted here that the aforesaid section is
being extracted only for the sake of completeness and for ready reference:)
27. Child Welfare Committee.-(1) The State Government shall by notification in the Official Gazette
constitute for every district, one or more Child Welfare Committees for exercising the powers and to
discharge the duties conferred on such Committee in relation to children in need of care and
protection under this Act and ensure that induction training and sensitisation of all members of the
committee is provided within two months from the date of notification.
(2) The Committee shall consist of a Chairperson, and four other members as the State Government
may think fit to appoint, of whom at least one shall be a woman and another, an expert on the
matters concerning children.
(3) The District Child Protection Unit shall provide a Secretary and other staff that may be required
for secretarial support to the Committee for its effective functioning.
(4) No person shall be appointed as a Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019
member of the Committee unless such person has been actively involved in health, education or
welfare activities pertaining to children for at least seven years or is a practicing professional with a
degree in child psychology or psychiatry or law or social work or sociology or human development.
(5) No person shall be appointed as a member unless he possesses such other qualifications as may
be prescribed.
(6) No person shall be appointed for a period of more than three years as a member of the
Committee.
(7) The appointment of any member of the Committee shall be terminated by the State Government
after making an inquiry, if-
(i) he has been found guilty of misuse of power vested on him under this Act;
(ii) he has been convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude and such conviction has not been
reversed or he has not been granted full pardon in respect of such offence;
(iii) he fails to attend the proceedings of the Committee consecutively for three months without any
valid reason or he fails to attend less than three-fourths of the sittings in a year.
(8) The District Magistrate shall conduct a quarterly review of the functioning of the Patna High
Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 Committee.

Fedeartaion Of C. W. C. And J. J. B. Member ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 April, 2019
(9) The Committee shall function as a Bench and shall have the powers conferred by the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) on a Metropolitan Magistrate or, as the case may be, a Judicial
Magistrate of First Class.
(10) The District Magistrate shall be the grievances redressal authority for the Child Welfare
Committee and anyone connected with the child, may file a petition before the District Magistrate,
who shall consider and pass appropriate orders.
(emphasis provided)
8. On a reading of Section 27 of the Act of 2015, the intention of the Parliament gets reflected with
respect to the composition of the CWC. The State Government has been given the power to
constitute, for every district, one or more CWC for exercise of powers and to discharge duties in
relation to children in need of care and protection. The composition would comprise of a
Chairperson and four other members; of whom, one shall be a woman and another, an expert on the
matters concerning children.
9. It is also necessary to especially note the provisions contained in Section 27 (4) and (5) of the Act
of Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 2015, which lists the necessary
qualifications for a member of the Committee to be appointed by the State Government with a
specific negative covenant in sub-Clause (5) of Rule 27 of the Act, indicating that without such
qualification, no member of the CWC shall be appointed by the Government. Hence, the
qualifications prescribed by the Central Legislation, viz., Act of 2015 are that minimum of one such
member shall be a woman and another would be an expert on the matters concerning children.
10. The other qualificatory tests for appointment of Members of CWC are that he should have been
actively involved in: (i) Health and (ii) Education; or (iii) Welfare Activities of Children for seven
years; or (iv) has worked as a Professional with a degree in - (a) Child Psychology; or (b) Psychiatry;
or (c) Law; or (d) Social Work; or (e) Sociology; or (f) Human Development. The qualification, thus,
appears to be exhaustive, so far as the Central Act is concerned.
11. Section 110 of the Act of 2015 provides the State Government with the power to make rules,
invoking which power, the impugned Rules of 2017 has been framed. Patna High Court CWJC
No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 It would be necessary to cull-out some part of Section 110 of the
Act, referred to above, for looking at the contentions raised on behalf of the writ-petitioners, which
reads as follows:-
110. Power to make rules.-(1) The State Government shall, by notification in the
Official Gazette, make rules to carry out the purposes of this Act:
Provided that the Central Government may, frame model rules in respect of all or any
of the matters with respect to which the State Government is required to make rules
and where any such model rules have been framed in respect of any such matter, they
shall apply to the State mutatis mutandis until the rules in respect of that matter are

Fedeartaion Of C. W. C. And J. J. B. Member ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 April, 2019
made by the State Government and while making any such rules, they conform to
such model rules.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing powers,
such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely :-
(i) x x x x x x
(ii) x x x x x x
(iii) x x x x x x
(iv) x x x x x x
(v) x x x x x x

(xii) x x x x x x
(xiii) x x x x x x
(xiv) qualifications of the members of the Child Welfare Committee under
sub-section (5) of Section 27.
12. By virtue of Section 110 of the Act of 2015, a State Government has been empowered to make
rules to carry out the objectives of the Act. In the absence of any rule framed by the State
Government, the model rules framed by the Union shall apply in the respective State mutatis
mutandis, but only till such time the rules are made by such State. A restriction has been imposed
upon the State Government for making such rules which would conform to the model rules framed
by the Central Government and any rule so framed shall be without prejudice to the generality of the
provisions contained in the Act of 2015. In the aforesaid context, the realm in which Patna High
Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 rules could be made in addition to the
conditions/contents of the model rules referred to above and while defining the specific domain, the
State Government has been given the powers to make rules for drawing qualifications of the
members of the CWC under sub-Clause (5) of Section 27 of the Act of 2015 (Section 110(2)(xiv).

Fedeartaion Of C. W. C. And J. J. B. Member ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 April, 2019
13. This, therefore, obviously means that apart from the qualifications prescribed for the members
of the CWC, viz., one person being a woman and the other being an expert in the matter concerning
children and the qualification of having been actively involved in Health, Education, Welfare
Activities pertaining to children for seven years or a Professional with a degree in - (a) Child
Psychology; (b) Psychiatry; (c) Law; (d) Social Work; (e) Sociology and (f) Human Development,
some other qualifications could also be prescribed by the State Government.
14. Under the powers granted to the State Government under Section 110 of the Act of 2015, referred
to above, the Government of Bihar has framed Rules of Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017
dt.08-04-2019 2017. Rule 15 thereof spells out the composition and qualifications of the members of
the Committee.
15. Rule 15 of the Rules of 2017 is being extracted hereinbelow for ready reference:-
15. Composition and Qualifications of the Members of the Committee.-(1) There shall
be one or more Committees in each district to be constituted by the State
Government through a notification in the Official Gazette.
(2) The Committee shall consist of a Chairperson and four other members including at least two
women from the district concerned for which the Committee has been constituted, and out of the
five members including Chairperson, at least one member shall be from SC/ST and one from
EBC/OBC communities.
(3) The Chairperson and members of the Committee shall be appointed by the State Government on
the recommendation of the Selection Committee under Rule 87 of these rules.
(4) The Chairperson and the members shall be above the age of thirty years and not more than sixty
five years and shall have following qualifications:-
(i) post-graduate degree in any discipline and having at least seven years of
experience of working with children in the field of Patna High Court CWJC No.16693
of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 education, health, welfare or protection activities;
or a practicing professional with a post-graduate degree in psychology or psychiatry or sociology or
in the field of law with at least 5 years of experience or a retired judicial officer or a retired Gazetted
officer from the Department of the State Government concerning children's development, health,
protection and education.
(ii) in the absence of candidates possessing eligibility criteria mentioned in clause
(i) of the sub-rule (4) as aforementioned, the following may be considered-
(a) graduate in social work/ health/ education/ psychology/ sociology/ rural development/ women
studies/ development studies// public administration and having at least five years of experience of

Fedeartaion Of C. W. C. And J. J. B. Member ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 April, 2019
working with children in the field of education, health, welfare or protection activities; and
(b) graduate in any discipline along with diploma or certificate in child protection/ counseling/ child
development/ child rights/ human rights/ women studies/ criminology/ anti human trafficking/
health or public health/ mental health and having at least five years of experience of working with
children in the field of education, health, welfare or protection activities;
(5) Not more than two members selected for a Committee shall be from same fields of practice or
profession or academic qualification.
(6) A member of the Committee shall be eligible for appointment of maximum of two terms, which
shall not be continuous.
16. The impugned clause of the aforesaid Rules Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017
dt.08-04-2019 of 2017 is sub-Clause (2), which lays down that the Committee (CWC) shall consist of
a Chairperson and four other members including at least two women from the district concerned for
which the Committee has been constituted and out of five members including the Chairperson, at
least one member shall be from the SC/ST and one from the EBC/OBC communities.
(emphasis provided)
17. It has been submitted on behalf of the writ- petitioners that as opposed to the Central Act of 2015
and the model rules which prescribe the minimum of one woman Member of the CWC, the Rules of
2017 makes it compulsory for two of such members to be women and the rest two, apart from the
Chairperson, to be from the SC/ST and EBC/OBC category. This, it has been submitted, results in
100% reservation, leaving no room for appointment of any person of general category, even though
he has the requisite qualification as mentioned in Section 27(4) and (5) of the Act of 2015, which is
not permissible in the eyes of law.
18. Apart from the aforesaid, it has also been urged on behalf of the writ-petitioners that the
aforesaid Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 qualification is also not in
consonance with the earlier rules framed by the Government of Bihar in the years 2012 and 2015 as
also the model rules framed under the Act of 2015.
19. The other ground of challenge is that by virtue of Section 110(2)(xiv) of the Act of 2015, a State
Government is only competent to add, in addition to the qualifications prescribed in Section 27(4)
and (5) of the Act of 2015, other qualifications. Gender and caste, it has been vehemently argued, are
no qualifications, which could be added by the State Government in the rules with respect to the
qualification required for the members of the CWC.
20. Mr. Rajendra Narayan, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Mr. Prabhakar Singh, learned
Advocate, therefore, raised an issue that additional qualifications could definitely be added to the
list of the qualifications already provided in the Act [refer to Section 27(4) and (5) of the Act of
2015], but the State Government does not have the liberty to provide any other category, which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6680561/ 8
Fedeartaion Of C. W. C. And J. J. B. Member ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 April, 2019
cannot be called a qualification, as it would be opposed to the policy and scheme of the Act and
doing so Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 would be contretemps and
prejudicial to the generality of the purpose of the Act of 2015.
21. Defending the aforesaid rule, viz., Rule 15(2) of the Rules of 2017, Mr. P.N. Shahi, learned
AAG-6, has submitted that in tune with Rule 88(2) of the Rules of 2017, for selection of members of
the Juvenile Justice Board and Chairperson as well as the members of the CWC, the State
Government has already constituted a Selection Committee under the Chairmanship of Hon'ble
Justice Ms. Mridula Mishra (Retd.) and five other persons vide Notification No. 127 dated
20.01.2017. It has further been submitted on behalf of the State Government that the Selection
Committee as well as the State Government are aware of their responsibilities and constitutional
limitations of not reserving posts beyond 50%. It was averred by Mr. Shahi that the qualification,
term etc. of the members of CWC have been framed in the light of the Act of 2015 with the intention
to provide a child friendly environment for children and only those persons who have
expertise/experience in the field of child care would be Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017
dt.08-04-2019 selected by the Committee which has been constituted for the purpose.
22. After having heard the learned counsel for the parties and noticing the relevant provisions of the
Act of 2015 and the Rules of 2017, we are of the view that the State Government, while prescribing
under Rule 15(2) of the Rules of 2017 that out of the four members of the CWC, apart from its
Chairperson, two shall be women members and one each would be from the categories of SC/ST and
EBC/OBC, did not exceed its jurisdiction as bestowed upon it by virtue of Section 27(2) and Section
110(2)(xiv) of the Act of 2015. By prescribing two women members and one member from each
category of SC/ST and EBC/OBC, the generality of the provisions of the Act of 2015 and the scheme
thereof is neither breached nor the qualification for the members of CWC provided under Section
27(4) and (5) of the Act of 2015 is infracted. This is no reservation, but only broad basing the
composition with the widest possible participation of people towards effective implementation of
the policy of the Act of 2015, viz., the Child Welfare. Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017
dt.08-04-2019 Women, by their gender, have a dispensation towards taking care of children and
since, as urged on behalf of the State, the maximum numbers of child in need of care and protection
are from the categories of SC/ST and EBC/OBC, it was only necessary that some of the members of
the CWC be from the same category, so as to provide a more child friendly atmosphere in the
Committee. By prescribing the aforesaid categories, no attempt has been made by the State
Government to do away or avoid selecting only such persons who have the qualifications provided
under Section 27(4) and (5) of the Act of 2015.
23. We have also taken note of the fact that appointing members of the CWC is not an appointment
in the regular sense of the term as the appointment is not on any post under the public service. The
appointment is more in the nature of nomination which becomes evident from the constitution of
the Committee, the manner of selection by the Search Committee and that only remuneration is
admissible to the members so nominated. The tenure of the members is fixed with a further
stipulation of maximum of Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 two terms,
which shall not be continuous. Section 15(4) of the Rules of 2017 further specify that in the absence
of candidates possessing eligibility criteria, other persons with somewhat lesser qualifications can be

Fedeartaion Of C. W. C. And J. J. B. Member ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 April, 2019
considered.
24. Thus, induction of persons in the CWC is not akin to employment in public service and hence,
the provisions of Article 16 of the Constitution of India with respect to reservation would not at all
be applicable. Reservation in public service has the sanction of law as it is considered to be
protective discrimination for the persons seeking employment, if they are socially and educationally
backward and do not have adequate representation. The members of the CWC, on the contrary, are
to look after the welfare of the children and not their welfare and, therefore, the necessity of their
experience in the field of Child Welfare.
25. The principles that have been evolved for conferring benefits of reservation contemplated by
Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution of India, cannot be mechanically applied to the
appointment of the members of Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019 the CWC
under the Juvenile Justice Act and Rules. The nature and purpose of the constitution of the CWC is
different and nomination of members in such Committee cannot be said to be an employment.
There is a distinct unviability of the analogy between a reservation for employment in public service
in terms of Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India and providing in the Rules of 2017 that some of
the members of the CWC shall be from particular categories of persons.
26. The aforesaid issue can be looked at from another angle as well. Stipulating that two of the four
members of the CWC shall be women does not tantamount to reservation. Women, by their very
nature and dispensation are adept at rearing up children and, therefore, the impugned rule cannot
be faulted with. The argument of proscription of 100% reservation, thus, fails miserably. The
qualifications, as prescribed under Section 27(4) and (5) of the Act of 2015, have not at all been
diluted/watered down by Rule 15(2) of the Rules of 2017.
27. Thus having noticed that the State Patna High Court CWJC No.16693 of 2017 dt.08-04-2019
Government has the power to frame rules in terms of Section 27(2) and Section 110 of the Act of
2015, Rule 15(2) of the Rules of 2017 does not lack the vires as the State Government has not
exceeded its jurisdiction nor has framed the rules so as to contravene the generality of the provisions
contained in the Central Act of 2015 nor would it in any way oppose or be antithetical to the reach
and ambit of the policy behind enacting Juvenile Justice Act of 2015.
28. The issue in all the writ petitions, viz., vires of Rule 15(2) of the Rules of 2017, which only was
argued on behalf of the petitioners, having been upheld by us, the writ petitions perforce fail and are
dismissed.
29. Needless to state that all previous orders with respect to stay of the operation of the Rule in
question stand vacated.
