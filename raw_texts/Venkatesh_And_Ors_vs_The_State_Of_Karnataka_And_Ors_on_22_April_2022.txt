This petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of

quashing the notification in No.R/Rectt/B-

etc.
These petitions having been heard and reserved for
Orders on 08.04.2022, coming on for "pronouncement of
Orders", this day the Court made the following:-
13
ORDER
'Rules of the game cannot be changed once the game has begun'.
This phrase, which has found its place in many of the judicial pronouncements of the Apex Court
and High Courts when the Courts have taken exception to the employer's decisions, changing the
criteria for selection of employees, after the commencement of the process of selection, is the trump
card for the petitioners.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 10
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
2. Petitioners cling to the ratio in the judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of
K.Manjusree etc. v. State of Andhra Pradesh and another - AIR 2008 SC 1470 and in the matter of
N.T.Bevin Katti, etc. v. Karnataka Public Service Commission and others - AIR 1990 Supreme Court
1233 to justify their stand.
3. Changes in the selection criteria are notified and you have consciously participated in the
selection process without any demur or protest. You took a chance, waited for the result, and now
cannot turn around to say that a change in criteria midway through the selection process is
impermissible, is the response of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur/appointing
authority (for short' University').
4. The other contesting respondents who apparently benefited from the changed criteria would echo
the same defence. Respondents seek to take shelter under the doctrine of estoppel and contend that
parties cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate.
5. The above-referred writ petitions revolve around these principles among others. The petitioners
in these petitions have questioned the notification of the respondent-University published on
4.9.2017, wherein the evaluation criteria are partially changed after the examinations. The
petitioners also seek Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to proceed with the selection as
per the evaluation criteria prescribed in the year 2010 and 2015.
6. Before getting into the discussion on the merits, it is relevant to state that the ratio laid down in
the case of K.Manjusree and the principle that the 'Rules of the game cannot be changed after the
game has begun in the context of the recruitment of employees under the State or instrumentalities
of the State' is referred to the larger Bench, by the three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the mater of Tej Prakash Patak and others v. Rajasthan High Court and others - (2013) 4 SCC 540.
Merely because the ratio in the said case is doubted and the matter is referred to a larger bench, it
does not lose its value as a precedent. The ratio holds good till it is overruled.
7. The dates of publication of various notifications relevant in these petitions are presented in
chronological order for easy reference:
Date Events
2009 University of agricultural sciences Raichur is
established.
2010 University of Agricultural Sciences Act 2010
is enacted.

26.08.2017 30.08.2017 08.03.2017 Co-Ordinate committee of the agricultural universities of the
State resolved to have a uniform selection process for 'C' group employees and decided to adopt the
procedure prescribed under the Rules 2006 as amended in 2015 and evaluate the candidates based
on written test/skill tests and practical test.
29.08.2017 The board adopted the resolution dated 08.03.2017 passed by the Coordinate committee
and university 04.09.2017 The University, issued a notification dropping the score card method and
notified that the candidates will be evaluated based on written test/skill test and practical test.
8. The University, has not yet framed the Statute, however, has adopted the Statute of the University
of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad. Said Statute, does not prescribe any eligibility criteria for the
selection of employees. The eligibility criteria and the selection process are to be determined by the
Board of the University.
9. In terms of the notification dated 20.09.2010, the University adopted the 'Score Card' method for
the recruitment of service personnel, which was prevailing in the University of Agricultural Sciences,
Dharwad. The notification further reveals that the Score Card method adopted is subject to changes
if any to be made by the Co- ordination Committee. The Score Card method provided evaluation of
candidates under different heads. The noticeable feature is, that no written test is prescribed under
this method.
10. Pursuant to above said notification, applications were invited for various posts in the year 2012
and 2014. However, the recruitment process did not proceed further till 2015 for various reasons.
11. On 04.11.2015, one more notification was issued inviting applications to fill up vacancies. The
applicants who applied under earlier notifications of 2012 and 2014 were exempted from applying
again. They were permitted to produce additional documents if any, suggesting thereby, that the
applicants under the earlier notification will be considered for recruitment.
12. On 09.04.2016, the respondent/University issued a notification partially modifying the 'score
card' which prescribed the criteria for the selection process of service personnel. Written tests were
introduced and in addition, certain other changes were made to the original score card. The
notification dated 31.12.2015 issued by the Government of Karnataka is said to be the reason for the
modification. In terms of the said notification dated 31.12.2015, Karnataka Civil Services (Direct
Recruitment by Competitive Examinations and Selection) (General) (Amendment) Rules, 2015 ( For
short 'Rules 2015') which amended some of the provisions of The Karnataka Civil Services (Direct
Recruitment by Competitive Examinations and Selection) (General) Rules, 2006 (For short 'Rules
2006') was enacted. The amendments came into effect on 31.12.2015.

Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
13. Subsequently, on 11.04.2016, the respondent/University issued corrigendum and extended the
timeline to file applications up to 10.05.2016. The said notification at Annexure-D reveals that the
Score Card method is modified pursuant to the Government Notification dated 31.12.2015, which
notified amendment to Rules - 2006 and also the Resolutions passed in 24th meeting Coordination
Committee and 26th meeting of the Board of the Management. It is further clarified that the
candidates, who already submitted the applications in response to the recruitment notification
dated 04.11.2015, need not apply again. They were permitted to submit an additional document, if
any, on or before 10.05.2016. The modified method introduced the written test. The allocation of
marks under certain other heads was either deleted or altered to some extent.
14. The University in terms of the notification dated 28.02.2017 published the syllabus. In the said
notification, it is again specified that the tests will be conducted as per the modified Score Card
published on 09.04.2016.
15. It appears, the University took one more decision to partially modify the Score Card for the post
of Typist/Computer Operator, and the modification was published on 15.03.2017. As per the said
notification, the practical test was introduced for Typist/Computer Operator post.
16. The examinations were conducted by the University. Except for three petitioners, all others
participated in the examination without raising any protest for the changes made in the criteria for
selection. Even the three petitioners who submitted a representation on 29.04.2016, after the
publication of notification dated 09.04.2016, who requested for retention of the earlier Score Card,
did not object to the modification introduced on 15.03.2017. Said petitioners also did not object to
the syllabus published vide notification dated 28.02.2017.
17. The University published the key answers for various tests conducted by the University. The key
answers were published on different dates for different posts.
18. On 04.09.2017, the respondent-University issued one more notification abolishing the Score
Card method. The notification says the selection will be made based on written test/practical
test/skill tests which were already conducted by then. This notification is under challenge. In the
said notification it is said that the Score Card method is dropped in respect of 'C' group employees.
The notification further reveals that all other conditions in the notification dated 09.04.2016 are
unaltered. The decision in this regard is said to have been taken pursuant to the decision of the
Coordination Committee and the Board of the University. The University claims to have decided in
this regard, to bring the selection process on par with the selection process of 'C' group employees in
other Agricultural Universities in the State.
19. It is also the stand of the University that the decision to drop the Score Card method brings the
selection process in tune with the requirement of Rules 2015.
20. On 27.11.2015, the respondent/University appointed typist cum computer operator in the
respondent/University by issuing appointment orders.

Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
21. Since the 'Score Card' was dropped candidates were evaluated based on written tests/practical
tests/skill tests. The petitioners were not selected. Hence the petition to quash the notification dated
04.09.2017 and to announce the results as per the scorecard method notified in the year 2010 and
2015.
22. Heard the learned Senior counsel Shri. S. Basavaraj, and learned counsel Shri. Ravindra Reddy
appearing for the petitioners learned Senior counsel Shri. Tharanath Poojary, the learned counsel
Shri. Shivanand Patil, Shri Arun Kumar Amaragundappa, for some of the selected respondents and
learned counsel Shri. Amaresh Roza and Shri. Mahantesh Patil for the respondent- University.
23. The petitioners urged the following grounds:
(i) The respondent/University cannot change the criteria for selection of the
employees after the cut-off date fixed for applying for the post.
(ii) Once the applications are filed pursuant to the notifications, it confers a right on
the applicants to be considered for the post as per the criteria notified and prevailing
as on the date of application.
(iii) The respondent/University is under the obligation to complete the selection
process in terms of criteria as on the last date of applying unless the notification itself
is withdrawn abandoning the selection process.
(iv) The petitioners have got the right to enforce the duty cast on the
respondent/University to complete the selection process as per the criteria fixed in
terms of the notification of the year 2015 by following the score card method.
(v) The criteria are altered to accommodate certain persons of their choice and the
same is done by disregarding the merit of the petitioners and criteria changed after
the first notification seeks to ignore merit.
24. The petitioners relied on the following judgments.
i. A.A.Calton v. The Director of Education and another
- AIR 1983 Supreme Court 1143;
ii. K.Manjusree etc. v. the State of A.P and Another -

25. On behalf of respondents the following points are urged.
(a) The criteria are changed by the
respondent/University by following the procedure
applicable to the University and the petitioners cannot question the decision of the University in
changing the criteria.
(b) The changed criteria did not prevent the petitioners from participating in the examination. Thus,
the petitioners are not put to any prejudice.
(c) The petitioners despite being notified about the changes, without any demur or protest, have
participated in the examination, waited for the result, and after realising that the results are not in
their favour, have chosen to question the same. The petitioners are estopped from questioning the
change of criteria.
(d) The respondent/University has not changed the criteria midway and has changed the criteria
before the commencement of the examination. Thus, there is no illegality in the act of the University
changing the criteria.
(e) The criteria are changed to bring the recruitment process in tune with Rules, 2015, which did not
permit the Score Card method in the selection and appointment of 'C' group employees.

27. This Court has considered the contentions raised at the Bar and the judgments referred above.
Discussion :
28. Admittedly the respondent/University which came into existence in the year 2009, is governed
by the University of Agricultural Sciences Act 2009. In terms of Section 52 of the said Act, the
Statute of the University may provide for various affairs of the University specified in sub-sections 1
to 13 of Section 52 of the Act. Sub- section 4 of Section 52 provides for classification, qualification,
and manner of appointment, terms, and conditions of service, and powers and duties of teachers
and other employees of the University.
29. Under the Statute, the eligibility criteria for appointing 'C' class employees are not specified.
However, in terms of the Statute, the board of the University is empowered to determine the
eligibility criteria for the selection of service personnel to the University.
30. The eligibility criteria notified in terms of notification of 2010, are decided by the Board of the
University. The eligibility criteria modified in terms of the notification dated 09.04.2016 are also
decided and fixed in terms of the 24th meeting of the Co-ordinate Committee and adopted in the
26th meeting of the Board of Management of the University which is forthcoming in the
corrigendum dated 11.04.2016.
31. The further modification notified in terms of the notification dated 15.03.2017, partially
modifying the Score Card Method which applies to the post of Typist and Computer Operator is also
in terms of the decision taken by the Co-ordinate Committee and the Board.
32. Three petitioners, on 29.04.2016, submitted a representation and requested the
respondent/University to conduct the selection by conducting the skill test as notified in the 2010
notification. However, there was one more change introduced by the University in the criteria for
the selection. This change effected vide notification dated 15.03.2017 is not objected and all the six
persons including three petitioners (Petitioners no. 4 and 5 in W.P. no.208440/2017 and petitioner
no. 1 in W.P. no.207476- 77/2017) who requested for retention of Score Card method participated in
the examinations without any protest. It is also relevant to state that on 28.02.2017, the syllabus for
the tests to be conducted by the University was published. This was a clear statement of the fact that
examinations will be conducted as per the modified criteria. None of the petitioners objected to it
and petitioners participated in the examination.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 17
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
33. The University published the key answers for the various written tests conducted for various
posts. Thereafter, the University in terms of the notification dated 04.09.2017, pursuant to the
decision of the 25th meeting of the Co-ordinate Committee and 32nd meeting of the Board has
dropped the Score Card method for selecting the candidates. The decision is also taken to select the
candidates based on written test/practical test/skill test.
34. The last notification modifying the criteria for selection was published on 15.03.2017. All
examinations are held after 15.03.2017.
35. The University claims that the decision to drop the Score Card method is taken pursuant to
amended Rules, 2015 which amended the Rules 2006 referred above. Admittedly the Rules are not
adopted either by incorporation or by reference. Thus the Rules are not binding on the University.
36. In the backdrop of the above-said facts and the contentions raised by the petitioners, the Court
has to examine whether the ratio laid down in the cases cited by the petitioners, particularly the case
of K.Manjusree and N.T.Bevin Katti referred supra, would come to the aid of the petitioners.
37. In K.Manjusree's case referred above, the examination for the post of District Judges, was
conducted and the results were announced. The committee appointed for the purpose approved the
result and placed the results for final approval of the Full Court of the High Court. The Full Court, of
Andra Pradesh High Court at this juncture altered the marks earmarked for the written test and the
interview. As a consequence, the candidate who is selected earlier is not selected. The Hon'ble Apex
Court in the light of the facts obtained in the said judgment held that decision to vary the marks
allotted for the written test and the interview cannot be made after the announcement of the result.
As could be noticed from the said judgment even the marks obtained by the candidates were
published, a merit list was prepared and candidates were recommended for appointment. The
selection process was initiated pursuant to the resolution/standing order issued by the Full Court
which prescribed a method of recruitment. Though, the lists were announced as per the procedure
prescribed, later it was sought to be unsettled by prescribing the different methods of evaluation.
The Hon'ble Apex court said the rules are changed after the game is over.
38. The ratio laid down in the aforementioned case to some extent applies to the present set of facts
of these petitions. Though the criteria for the selection are not changed after the announcement of
the results as was the situation in K.Manjusree's matter, the criteria for evaluation were changed
after the examination was conducted. In other words, practically the game was over and the criteria
for selection are changed thereafter. However, there are certain distinguishable factors in
K.Manjusree's case and the case on hand which are noted below:
i. The examinations of the petitioners are held as per the modified criteria and not as
per the original criteria fixed in 2010. In K.Manjusree's case, the examination was
held as per the originally notified criteria and results are declared and a list of
selected candidates was published as per the originally notified criteria in the first
instance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 18
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
ii. Though three petitioners requested for retention of the Score Card method, vide
petition dated 29.04.2016, did not register the protest after some modifications are
introduced pursuant to their protest and they did not object to the notification
prescribing the syllabus under the changed criteria. All the three petitioners without
protest participated in the examination. In K.Manjusree's case, there were no
changes introduced till the results are announced in the first instance.
iii. In K.Manjusree's case, the petitioner made a prayer to announce the results as per
the criteria fixed under the notification. From the date of notification till the
alteration of the result, there were no other changes in the selection procedure.
However, in the present cases, the criteria were changed on 09.04.2016 and
15.03.2017. The petitioners participated in the examination after the change of
criteria.
39. After the examinations the impugned notification dated 04.09.2017 is issued. This change is
introduced after the examinations were held as noticed above. Thus, the impugned notification,
changing the criteria after the examination is in the teeth of ratio in K.Manjusree's case. However, to
what extent the petitioners who participated in the examination after changes were introduced can
be granted the relief is a question. The same will be discussed later.
40. Heavy reliance is also placed on the judgment of N.T.Bevin Katti referred supra. The ratio in the
said case does not apply to the facts of these cases for the following reasons -
i. In N.T.Bevin Katti case the recruitment for the post of Tahasildar which was called in question was
governed by Karnataka Recruitment of Gazette Probation (Class-I and II posts appointment by
Competitive Examinations) (Rules) 1966). The notification also provided that for the matters not
covered under the Rules 1966, Karnataka State Civil Services (General Recruitment Rules) 1957
shall apply. The notification for recruitment was issued on 23.05.1975. After the notification inviting
the applications, the rules relating to the reservations based on caste were amended on 9th July
1975. The Public service commission published the list of candidates as per the law prevailing at the
time of publication of the notification inviting applications. The authority did not consider the
amendments to the rules made after the publication of the notification. The question before the
court was whether the recruitment is to be made as per the rule prevailing on the date of notification
or rule which is modified or amended after the publication of notification for the recruitment. The
Apex Court held that unless the amended rules are made retrospective, the rules prevailing as on the
date of inviting application for the posts shall be followed. The ratio in Bevin Katti's case is not
applicable for the following reasons. ii. There was no rule or regulation binding on the University,
prescribing the criteria for the recruitment process when the notification for recruitment was
published. Unlike in N.T.Bevin Katti's case, the petitioners in these petitions cannot seek to enforce
any rules or regulations as no rules/regulations were there prescribing the eligibility criteria for 'C'
group employees.
iii. In N.T.Bevin Katti's case, the examinations were conducted without changing the rules and
results were announced as per the law prevailing on the date of publication of notification for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 19
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
recruitment. In these petitions, the examinations were held as per the changed rules and the
petitioners participated in the written tests after the changed criteria.
41. The University under the Statute enjoys a certain degree of freedom in the matter of
employment. The eligibility criteria for the appointment of employees are to be fixed by the Board of
the University, if required, the Board may, have consultation with the Co-ordination Committee.
(Co-ordination Committee as provided under S.67 of the Act of 2009). The eligibility criteria evolved
by the respondent/University was the outcome of the meeting of the Co-ordination Committee and
the Board of University. These decisions are taken by the Board of University, nevertheless have to
be adhered to, by the University. However, to meet the exigencies of changed circumstances, the
University may make suitable changes in the criteria for selection as long as such changes do not
violate any binding provisions of law or violate the vested rights of the applicants. As long as the
changes in the criteria for selection do not violate any provision of law and the changes are not
arbitrary and not done with any mala- fide intentions, such changes cannot be interfered in exercise
of writ jurisdiction.
42. 'Rules of the game cannot be changed after the game has begun', is a principle evolved by the
Courts while interpreting the facts and law applicable to a given case. It is not a codified provision of
law. It cannot be applied like a mathematical formula. Thus, the principle has to be understood in
the backdrop of cases in which such principle is enunciated. Before applying the said rule, the Court
has to consider various factors viz.,
(a) What are the changes made after the initial notification prescribing criteria for selection;
(b) At what stage changes are made? Whether the changes are made after the commencement of the
examination or before the examination or after the announcement of results?
(c) To what extent, the changes have caused the prejudice to the candidates who applied for the
posts;
(d) Whether the persons who have applied under the initial notification are prevented from
participating in the process after the changes are made;
(e) The reasons for making changes; Whether the changes are made to bring the selection process in
conformity with the binding law or regulation or whether the changes are made in violation of the
binding law or regulation;
(f) Whether the changes are made with a malafide intention of conferring undue favour to a
particular or a section of candidates?
(g) More importantly, whether candidates who participated in the process after the change of
criteria can maintain the challenge to the decision changing the criteria.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 20
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
43. If the petitioners demonstrate that the changes made violate any law/rule/regulation, binding
on the University, then despite having participated in the examinations without protest, petitioners
can question the decision changing the criteria. In a situation, where the petitioners seek to bring
the selection process in conformity with applicable law, then the rule of estoppel does not apply.
44. The decision of the University in changing the criteria for selection has to be examined in the
light of the aforesaid propositions. If the decision is impermissible and invalid, then the petitioners
should succeed.
45. The respondent/University to justify its decision to change the criteria has placed heavy reliance
on the amended Rules of 2015. In terms of the said Rules, the eligibility criteria for selecting the 'C'
group employees under the State are amended. The University contends that the decision to drop
the Score Card method is to bring the selection criteria on par with the selection criteria adopted in
other Universities. The Rules referred to above are not adopted by the University in the manner
known to law. Thus, the Rules are not binding on the University. Then the question is, whether the
University is justified in changing the criteria by following the procedure prescribed under Rules,
2006 as amended by Rules 2015 or whether the changes made to bring the eligibility criteria on par
with Rules, 2015 are impermissible when the Rules are not formally adopted?
46. The answer to this question depends on the fact whether such a course of action by the
University violates any of the rules or regulations binding on the University in a matter relating to
the employment of personnel. There is no denial of the fact that, the University is not governed by
any other law in the matter relating to eligibility criteria to be fixed, for the appointment of
personnel to the University, except for the fact that the Board of the University is empowered to fix
the criteria. In addition to this the University has to adhere to the rules relating to reservation under
the State Policy. However, in these petitions, the question relating to reservation to the posts is not
involved.
47. Given the fact that the Board of the University is empowered to determine the eligibility criteria
for 'C' group employees then, the decision of the University to follow the criteria applicable to the
rest of the State in the selection and appointment of 'C' group employees which is formulated in
terms of Rules, 2015, cannot be said to be an arbitrary decision to be struck down in exercise of
powers under Article 226 of the Constitution. If the University has decided to bring the selection
process of its 'C' group employees on par with the selection of similar employees, in other
Agricultural Science Universities in the State, without formally adopting the Rules, such a decision
cannot be said to be a malafide decision. The good intention behind such a decision is apparent on
the face of the decision itself. The changes are introduced in the year 2016, in the meeting of the
Co-ordinate committee and the Board taking clue from the Rules 2006, as amended with effect from
31.12.2015. Thereafter the change criteria are published on 09.04.2016.
48. No doubt, the working effect of the said decision has resulted in petitioners being knocked down
in the selection process and the respondents getting selected for the post applied by the petitioners.
However, the adverse consequence of the said decision on the petitioners by itself cannot be the
criteria to quash the appointments. If the petitioners were able to demonstrate that the decision is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 21
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
intended to favour a particular section of the respondents or the decision is taken with a malafide
intention of targeting the petitioners, then the Court could have proceeded to dwell deep into the
reason behind the change of criteria. From the materials placed on record and from the pleadings, it
cannot be construed that the decision of the University suffers from malafide intentions. Effect of
participation in the examination under the changed criteria
49. The fact that the petitioners were notified about each of the changes made in the selection
criteria is not in dispute. The examinations have taken place, after a long time, after the changes are
made to the criteria. The petitioners had sufficient time to challenge the changes. However,
petitioners have not chosen to challenge the same. On the other hand, the petitioners have opted to
participate in the written examination (introduced by way of change) without any demur.
Petitioners waited for the result. And only after realizing that they have not succeeded under the
modified selection criteria, do petitioners approach the Court with a prayer not to consider the
marks obtained in the written test and petitioners want the selection to be made without reference
to the marks in the written test. After having participated in the written examination under the
changed criteria without protest, the party cannot object to considering the marks in the written
test, unless he can demonstrate that the changes introduced are contrary to law. Such a stand is hit
by the doctrine of estoppel. The Judgments of the Apex Court in the matters of ASHOK KUMAR &
ANOTHER vs STATE OF BIHAR reported in (2017)4 SCC 357, NITESH KUMAR PANDEY vs
STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH reported in (2020)4 SCC 70, ANUPAL SINGH vs STATE OF
UTTAR PRADESH reported in (2020)2 SCC 173, PRADEEP KUMAR RAI vs DINESH KUMAR
PANDEY reported in (2015)11 SCC 493 would lend support to the contention of the respondents.
50. There is one more dimension to the case that needs to be discussed. It was urged by Shri. S.
Basavaraj the learned Senior counsel appearing for petitioners in W.P.207476-77/2017, that the
changed criteria seek to ignore the merit. It is his submission that the practical test and other tests
found in the earlier method are more suitable than the one adopted in terms of the impugned order.
In exercise of writ jurisdiction, the Court would not sit over the decision of the employer in
prescribing the selection criteria. It is the domain of the employer. Employer will be having the
expertise and wisdom to determine the eligibility criteria. The Courts can interfere in such matters,
only if, the criteria fixed are contrary to the law. That is not the position here. Shri. S. Basavaraj the
learned Senior counsel, in his fairness would submit that that there is no violation of any express
provision of law. However, he would submit that the criteria fixed by the Board of the University
have a statutory flavour and the same is to be retained till the completion of the selection process.
Since the criteria determined in the meeting of the Board, is not a Statute or law, in an appropriate
case and circumstances, the employer can make modifications to the criteria as long as such changes
do not prevent the applicants from participating in the process, as long as such changes do not
violate any provisions of law and such changes do not suffer from malafides.
51. After the 2015 notification, one more notification was issued on 09.04.2016, partially modifying
the Score Card method and the written test was introduced. The petitioners no. 4 and 5 in
W.P.No.208440/2017 and petitioner no.1 in W.P. Nos.207476-477/2017 have applied to the posts,
after the notification dated 09.04.2016. All the petitioners participated in the examination process
which was held under the notification dated 09.04.2016. Thus the petitioners who have applied after
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 22
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
the notification dated 09.04.2016 cannot make a claim to be considered as per the guidelines
prevailing before 09.04.2016. The prayer of these petitioners to consider their eligibility in terms of
the notification dated 20.09.2010 and 04.11.2015 cannot be considered for the simple reason that
these petitioners applied for the posts only after the publication of modified eligibility criteria in
terms of the notification dated 09.04.2016.
52. Sri. Shivanand Patil learned advocate for the respondent would submit that three petitioners
initially requested not to change the criteria for selection under the changes notified on 09.04.2016.
Thereafter, one more change was effected and they did not raise any objection to the change and
participated in the examination process. This conduct of the said petitioners would indicate that
they agreed to the changes made and if they had any objection to the changes, they could have
objected as they did in the earlier instance. There is merit in the contention.
53. Learned Senior counsel Shri. S. Basavaraj appearing for some of the petitioners referring to the
Judgment of Dr. (Major) Meeta Sahai v.s Union of India (2019) 20 SCC 17, would urge that by
participating in the selection process candidate, accepts the prescribed procedure and not the
illegality in it. Thus according to him, there cannot be any estoppels against the law.
54. This Court has considered the said contention in the backdrop of the ratio laid down in the
aforementioned case. The ratio laid down in the said case is not applicable. In the said case, the
person who participated in the selection process, without any protest, later, on the announcement of
the result which was against him, questioned the recruitment process by filing a writ petition. In the
writ petition, he raised a contention that the selection process is contrary to the binding law and the
selection process is held by misconstruing the existing provision of law. In such a situation, the
Hon'ble Apex Court has held that the writ petition to challenge the selection process on the ground
that it is contrary to the law governing the selection process is maintainable, even though the
petitioner has participated in the examination without protest.
55. Admittedly, in the instant case, there is no binding law that would come to the rescue of the
petitioners to say that the examination is to be held as per the law. In the absence of law relating to
criteria for selection of employees, the board of the university has evolved certain eligibility criteria
and the eligibility criteria are modified on the ground that the modified eligibility criteria will be in
tune with the eligibility criteria fixed by other Universities in the State.
56. Another significant factor to be noticed in this case is, the corrigendum II dated 11.04.2016,
issued under the notification dated 09.04.2016. This corrigendum reveals that the decision to follow
the selection criteria prescribed in the amendment Rules 2015 is taken by the university in the 26th
meeting of the Board. The Board's decision is preceded by the 24th meeting of the Coordinate
committee. The decision to introduce the written tests is taken earlier to 09.04.2016.
57. In the light of the discussions made above, the findings are:-
i. The decision of the University to drop the Score Card method after conducting the
examination in terms of the notification dated 09.04.2016 and 15.03.2017 is contrary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150092266/ 23
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 22 April, 2022
to the law declared by the Apex Court in K.Manjusree's case. The University having
taken the decision to hold the examination in terms of criteria fixed under
notification dated 09.04.2016 in which the petitioners participated without protest,
could not have partially dropped the eligibility criteria fixed under notification dated
09.04.2016. Thus, the impugned notification dated 04.09.2017 issued by the 3rd
respondent dropping the Score Card method prescribed in the notification dated
09.04.2016 is impermissible and is to be quashed.
ii. The changes introduced in the selection criteria vide notification dated
09.04.2016, and 15.03.2017 ( for the post of typist/computer operator) did not
prevent the petitioners from participating in the examination and the petitioners
participated in the examinations/tests. The petitioners have waived their right, if any,
to challenge the changed criteria by participating in the process. Thus the petitions
challenging the notifications dated 09.04.2016, 11.04.2016 and 15.03.2017 are not
maintainable.
iii. The petitioners 4 and 5 in W.P. No. 208440/2017 and the petitioner no.1 in W.P. Nos.
207476-477/2017 who applied after 09.04.2016 i.e., the date on which criteria are changed, cannot
claim the right to be considered for selection under the criteria fixed in 2015.
iv. There is no violation of any law or infringement of any right of the petitioners. The petitioners
have not acquired any right in terms of selection criteria for the year 2010 and 2015. Thus the
petitions seeking a direction against the respondents to hold the selection process in terms of
criteria of the year 2010 and 2015 are not maintainable. Hence, the following:
ORDER The Writ Petitions are allowed-in-part.
