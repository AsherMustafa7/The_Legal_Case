Mr.Yogananda N vs State Of Karnataka on 17 January, 2022
11. The petitioner submitted an application for developing the property in question
for construction of residential building. However, the respondent - BBMP issued an
endorsement stating that the application submitted by the petitioner for sanctioning
of the building plan will be processed only upon the petitioner surrendering the
property earmarked for the purpose of widening of road in the master plan free of
cost.
Hence, this petition.
12. Sri Shashi Kiran Shetty, learned Senior Advocate Sri B V Shankara Narayan, learned Senior
Advocate, Sri G V Sudhakar and Sri Rohan Hosmath, learned counsel for the petitioner would make
the following submissions:
The properties in question which are earmarked for widening of the road in the
revised master plan are not included in the plans submitted by the petitioners.
Hence, the requirement to relinquish the properties in question which are earmarked
for widening of road as a condition precedent for sanctioning of the building plans
violates Article 300A of the Constitution of India.
13. In the absence of any legal authority or support by competent legislature as enumerated in
Article 300A of the Constitution of India, the petitioners cannot be deprived of their right over the
immoveable property by mere executive fiat. In support, reliance is placed on the decision of Apex
Court in the case of KT Plantation Pvt. Ltd. -vs- State of Karnataka reported in AIR 2011 SC 3430.
14. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent - BBMP would make the following
submissions:
(i) Section 17(3) of the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961 which is
applicable to a person who intends to develop a single plot or sub-division of plot or
layout of private street specifies that no compensation shall be payable for
sanctioning of single plot.
(ii) Regulations 7.1(5) and 7.2(d) of the Zoning of Land Use and Regulations -
Revised Master Plan 2015 require that roads as shown in the revised Master Plan
2015 shall be incorporated within the plan and shall be handed over to the Authority
free of cost.
iii) The circular dated 29.2.2016 issued by the respondent - BBMP requiring the
owners to surrender the property earmarked for widening of the road free of cost is in
consonance with the provisions contained in Section 17 of the KT and CP Act and also
the Zonal Regulations, 2015.
15. Hence they submitted that the impugned endorsement issued by the respondent - BBMP is in
accordance with law and the same does not violate Article 300A of the Constitution of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38781904/ 8
Mr.Yogananda N vs State Of Karnataka on 17 January, 2022
16. Having examined the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties, the point that
arises for consideration is: whether the requirement to relinquish the properties belonging to the
petitioners designed as road in the master plan free of cost with the respondent - BBMP as a
precondition for sanctioning of the building plans submitted by the petitioners violate Article 300A
of the Constitution of India.
17. The properties in question are earmarked for the purpose of widening of road in the revised
Master Plan 2015 under Section 12(1)(b) of the KT and CP Act. Section 17(3) of the KT and CP Act
specifies that the owner is not entitled for compensation while sanctioning a single plot. However,
reading of Section 17 of KT & CP Act in its entirety does not specify that the land earmarked as road
in the master plan will have to be relinquished free of cost or that the owner is not entitled for
compensation while sanctioning the layout plan. Section 17(3) is applicable only to lands
enumerated in Section 17-2A like parks, open space, roads formed within the layout and civic
amenity site.
18. Section 70 of the KT and CP Act specifies that land needed for the purpose of Town Planning
Scheme or master plan shall be deemed to be land needed for public purpose within the meaning of
Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Section 71 of the KT and CP Act specifies that the State Government can
acquire land included in the scheme by taking recourse to the provision contained in Land
Acquisition Act 1894 subject to payment of compensation to the owners of the lands.
19. A conjoint reading of Sections 12, 17(3), 70 and 71 indicate that if any land needed for the
purpose of Town Planning Scheme or master plan shall be acquired by the Government by taking
recourse to the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 subject to payment of compensation to the
owners of the land. Section 17(3) of the Act does not specify that the property earmarked for
widening of the road requires it to be surrendered free of cost at the time of sanctioning of the single
plot.
20. The term Residential Development Plan under the Regulations 2015 is defined as plan
containing proposal for construction of one or more residential building on a plot measuring more
than 20000 sq. meter in an extent and the term Non-residential Development Plan is defined as
plan containing proposal for construction of one or more commercial building on a plot size
measuring more than 20000 sq. meter.
21. Chapter 7 of the Regulations 2015 deals with the Regulations for residential development plan
and non-residential development plan. Regulation 7.1(5) and 7.2(d) specify that the road as shown
in the Master Plan 2015 shall be incorporated within the plan and shall be handed over to the
authority free of cost.
22. A reading of the definition of Development Plan and Regulations 7.1(5) and 7.2(d) indicate that
it is a condition precedent to incorporate the road shown in the Master Plan - 2015 in the plan and
shall be handed over free of cost to the respondent - BBMP. However, these Regulations are
applicable only to Development of lands, the extent of which is more than 20000 sq. meters in
respect of residential plan and the extent of which is more than 12000 sq. meters in respect of non-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38781904/ 9
Mr.Yogananda N vs State Of Karnataka on 17 January, 2022
residential plan.
23. In the present cases, the extent of land sought to be developed for residential/commercial
purposes is far less than the extent of land specified in the definition development plan. Hence, the
Regulations 7.1(5) and 7(2)(d) of the Regulations 2015 are not applicable and cannot be invoked
requiring the petitioners to relinquish the properties in question free of cost to the respondent -
BBMP.
24. The Circular dated 29.2.2016 requiring the owners to surrender the properties earmarked for
widening of road free of cost at the time of sanctioning of building plans violates Article 300A of the
Constitution of India. The Apex Court in the case of KT Plantation (supra) has held that the owner of
immovable property cannot be deprived of his property by mere executive order without any specific
legal authority or support by competent legislation. In the absence of specific legal authority or
support by competent legislation, the impugned Circular issued by the respondent - BBMP violates
Article 300A of the Constitution of India.
25. Even otherwise, the impugned endorsements and circulars issued by BBMP is arbitrary and
discriminatory since the owners of the properties earmarked as Road in Master Plan 2015 and who
have not applied for sanctioning of building plan for developing their properties will be entitled for
compensation under Section 71 of KT & CP Act, if the said properties are acquired for implementing
the Master Plan. The petitioners cannot be deprived of their properties earmarked as road in the
revised Master Plan, 2015 merely because they intend to develop their properties by obtaining
sanctioned building plan.
26. In view of preceding analysis, I am of the considered view that the impugned endorsements
issued by the respondent
- BBMP requiring the petitioners to relinquish the properties in question free of cost as a condition
precedent for processing their applications for sanctioning of building plans is without authority of
law and the same violate Article 300A of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, I pass the following:

09.02.2022 WP No.9408/2020 c/w WP No.14095/2021, WP No.14975/2021, WP
No.19736/2021 and WP No.19737/2021 ORDER The above matter has been posted
for Being Spoken To regarding correction at para No.17 of the order dated 17.1.2022.
The above matters came to be disposed of on 17.1.2022. It is stated that by oversight "the order
dated 30.6.2021 passed by the 3rd respondent vide Annexure-B" has not been reflected in the
operative portion of the order and after the word Annexure-A at the last line of the operative portion
of the order, the same shall be inserted. Hence, the Registry is directed to issue fresh certified copy
of the order on free of cost.
Similarly in para No.6 of page No.9, instead of '152.40 sq.ft' shall be read as '152.40 sq. mtr'. and in
page No.10 at para No.11 instead of 'residential building' shall be read as 'commercial building'.
This order shall be read in conjunction with the order dated 17.1.2022 passed in WP No.9408/2020
c/w WP No.14095/2021, WP No.14975/2021, WP No.19736/2021 and WP No.19737/2021.
