Shri Laikhuram Nandabir Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
undergoing 2 (two) years B.Ed. Programme for the session 2022-2024 at DM College of Teachers
Education, Imphal. It is stated that the reason for not selecting the petitioner for the session
2022-2024 was that the Principal, Lamding Higher Secondary School forwarded the letter dated
10.06.2022 without NOC from the ZEO concerned. Further, it is stated that the petitioner submitted
the application dated 16.06.2022 to the ZEO, Zone-III, Thoubal requesting to issue NOC only after
the expiry of the date prescribed in the notification dated 23.05.2023. It is also stated that the
petitioner was found not eligible for undergoing 2 (two) years B.Ed. Training Course for the
academic session 2023-2025 as per the notification dated 14.03.2014 issued by the Director of
University & Higher Education, Manipur in connection with the admission policy for the said
course. The notification (para 3.a) mentions that "a minimum of 8 (eight) years of service before
retirement on superannuation at the time of deputation/nomination for B.Ed. Programme is
mandatory." It is stated that the order of deputation of 50 teachers was issued on 04.10.2023 and as
the petitioner's date of superannuation falls on 30.04.2031, he has less that the mandatory 8 (eight)
years at the time of deputation. It is prayed that writ petition be dismissed being devoid of merit.

[8] The petitioner filed rejoinder affidavit wherein it is stated that
as per the notification dated 23.05.2022, the concerned Principal in-charge, Lamding Hr. Sec.
School, Lamding submitted the name of the petitioner for undergoing B.Ed. Training Course in
deputation vide letter dated 10.06.2022 and also issued a NOC from the school as per petitioner's
certificate dated 03.06.2022. It is stated that the Government of Manipur inducted the new R.R.
vide notification dated 02.12.2021 and consequent upon the new RR, the Government issued the
notification dated 29.06.2022 re-designated the post of Lecturer Hr. Sec. School as Post Graduate
Teacher and on such re- designation, it has been declared that normal increment shall be
released/granted notionally (without arrears) from the date of passing/declaration of the trained
examination prescribed in the respective RRs in respect of existing un-trained Teachers. It is also
stated that prior to the issuance of the notification dated 29.06.2022, all the Lecturers serving under
the Government Hr. Sec. Schools were on equal footing irrespective of completion of two years B.Ed.
Course or not. However, due to the issuance of the order dated 29.06.2022 undergoing B.Ed. Course
has been made necessary for all the Lecturers serving under Government Hr. Sec. Schools.
Moreover, the Notification dated 14.03.2014 in para 7 of the notification which reads as "7. Removal
of Difficulties:- The Department of University and Higher Education, Government of Manipur may
modify/alter any of the above clauses partly or wholly to remove any difficulties in the
implementation of the Admission Policy as and when necessary......" In the present case, the
petitioner has been facing difficulties and these difficulties WP(C) No. 304 of 2024 with MC(WP(C)
No. 274 of 2024 Page 6 can be solved by way of invoking para 7 of the Notification as Rules shall not
exercise in a manner to create difficulties in the service career of a government servant and hence, it
is prayed that the writ petition be allowed. [9] Mrs. G. Pushpa, learned counsel for the petitioner
submits that the petitioner was otherwise eligible for getting increments in terms of the earlier RR
and since the RR was subsequently amended later in the year 2021 thereby requiring 2 years B.Ed.

Shri Laikhuram Nandabir Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
Training for becoming a trained Post Graduate Teacher. Under the erstwhile RR, there was no
requirement of training for a Lecturer post, now re-designated as PGT. A new condition was also
imposed by the new RR for the PGT to have a remaining tenure of 8 years of service to be eligible for
the training. The petitioner applied for B. Ed. Training at DM College of Teacher Education, Imphal
for the session 2022-2024 through proper channel. However, there was no response from the
authority. It is stated that the petitioner again applied for the session of 2023-2025 for the 2 years B.
Ed. Programme. His candidature was not considered for the session of 2023-2025. However, in the
counter affidavit of the respondents, it is stated the petitioner was not eligible for the training in
terms of Para 3(A)(ii)(a) of the Notification dated 14.03.2014 issued by the Director of University &
Higher Education, Govt. of Manipur regulating admission to B.Ed. Course in the DM College of
Teacher Education, Imphal on the ground that the petitioner did not have minimum of 8 years
tenure of service before retirement.
[10] Mrs. G. Pushpa, learned counsel draws the attention of this Court to the Notification dated
29.06.2022 issued by Finance Department WP(C) No. 304 of 2024 with MC(WP(C) No. 274 of 2024
Page 7 (Pay Implementation Cell), Govt. of Manipur to the effect that a Lecturer (Higher Secondary
School), now redesignated as Post Graduate Teacher (PGT) shall be entitled to normal increment
notionally (without arrears) from the date of passing of the trained examination prescribed in the
RR in respect of the existing untrained teachers. Recruitment Rules for the post of Lecturer, Higher
Secondary Education (2021) prescribes B. Ed. From a recognised Institute as one of the essential
criteria. Reading together the RR of 2021 and Notification dated 29.06.2022, an untrained Lecturer
(now, PGT) like the petitioner will not be eligible to receive the normal increment unless he/she
passes the B.Ed. course. It is also pointed out that there is guideline for selecting the candidates for
taking admission in B. Ed. Course in DM College of Teacher Education in view of limited number of
seats of 230 per session and the authority resorts to pick and choose method. This is the reason why
the petitioner was not considered in the session of 2022-2024, when he was eligible. In the session
of 2023-2025, he was held ineligible for not having 8 years of regular service prior to
superannuation as disclosed for the first time in the counter affidavit.
[11] Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the State respondents cannot now take
advantage of their own wrongs. In the year 2022-2024, the petitioner's name was not considered
without any intimation and he was eligible for that session. But in the year 2023-2025, he has
allegedly been not considered for not having minimum 8 years of service. It is pleaded that the State
cannot blow hot and cold at the same time and cannot take advantage of the lapse committed for the
session of 2022-2025.

Reliance is placed on a recent judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Ch.
Deependra Singh & Ors. v. State of Manipur & Ors.: 2023 (4) MnLJ 435 @ Para 18 holding that the
State respondents cannot be allowed to take advantage of lapses or mistakes committed by them
while framing the rules and the employees cannot be made to suffer for the mistake or lapses
committed by the State. It is pointed out that in the present case, the State respondents committed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39313509/ 5
Shri Laikhuram Nandabir Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
serious lapses when they did not consider the case of the petitioner for admission to B. Ed. Course
for 2022- 2024 session when he was eligible at that time. Now it cannot plead that the petitioner is
not eligible for 2023-2025 session. For the lapse of the respondents, the petitioner is likely to lose
the entitlement of normal increment. It is submitted that in order to ameliorate the suffering of the
petitioner created by the lapses of the respondent, the petitioner be permitted to take admission in
B. Ed. Course in any available seat of any session notwithstanding whether he is eligible or not of
having minimum 8 years of remaining service.
[12] The second limb of submission of Mrs. G. Pushpa, learned counsel for the petitioner is that
there cannot be no amendment in the service rule with retrospective effect so as to eliminate an
accrued right to an employee. This is the constitutional mandate that by a retrospective legislation,
the service conditions of an employee cannot be altered to his disadvantage and any amendment has
to be prospective with proper safeguard of existing employees. On this point, reference is made to
the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v.
WP(C) No. 304 of 2024 with
MC(WP(C) No. 274 of 2024 Page 9
Tushar Ranjan Mohanty: (1994) 5 SCC 450 @ Para 14 holding that legislatures and the competent
authority under Article 309 of the Constitution of India have the power to make laws with
retrospective effect, but cannot do so to negate the accrued right. It is submitted that in the present
case, the amendment in RR (2021) has taken away the accrued right of the petitioner to entitlement
of normal increment, unless he has passed the B.Ed. course.
[13] Third point raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is the principle of promissory
estoppel. Reliance is placed on the case of Union of India v. Godfrey Philips India Ltd.: (1985) 4 SCC
369 @ Para 13 relying on Motilal Sugar Mills case [(1979) 2 SCC 409] that promissory estoppel is
applicable to both legislative and executive action except for doing contrary to law or against public
policy. It is pointed out that by resorting to para 7 of the Notification dated 14.03.2014, the State
respondents could have removed the difficulties faced by the petitioner due to their lapses. It is
prayed that the respondents be directed to admit the petitioner in any available seat in any session
of B.Ed. in DM College of Teacher Education so as to enable him to receive regular increments.
Otherwise, it will amount to depriving the petitioner of an accrued right by retrospective
amendment in RR in the year 2021.
[14] Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Govt. Advocate submits that as per Para 3(A)(ii)(a) of the Notification
dated 14.03.2014 issued by the Department of University & Higher Education, Govt. of Manipur,
stipulating norms for admission in B. Ed. Course in DM College of Teacher Education, WP(C) No.
304 of 2024 with MC(WP(C) No. 274 of 2024 Page 10 the In-Service Candidate should have a
minimum of 8 years of service before retirement on superannuation at the time of nomination for
the B. Ed. Course. The petitioner is to retire on 30.04.2031 and as on date of deputation of 50
teachers for the course, ie, as on 04.10.2023, the petitioner did not have mandatory 8 years of
minimum service for the course 2023-2025. Regarding the session of 2022-2024, learned GA refers
to para 4 of the counter affidavit that the case of the petitioner was not consider for the session of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39313509/ 6
Shri Laikhuram Nandabir Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
2022-2024, the application was forwarded by the Principal of Lamding Higher Secondary School
without 'No Objection Certificate' from the Zonal Education Office. It is submitted that the
petitioner cannot be considered for the session of 2023- 2025 as he did not have minimum 8 years
of service. The principle of promissory estoppel will not be applicable in the present case. [15] This
Court has considered the materials on record and submissions made at bar and the decisions cited
by the parties. [16] It is an admitted fact that with the introduction of the new RR in the year 2021,
the eligibility criteria of Lecturer of Higher Secondary (now, redesignated as Post Graduate Teacher)
requires passing of B. Ed. Examination from a recognised Institute. In view of Notification dated
29.06.2022 issued by Finance Department (PIC), Govt. of Manipur, the existing un-trained PGT will
be entitled to the normal increment after passing of the trained examination prescribed under RR.
The new RR creates two categories of PGTs- trained and untrained, and the same was not in the old
RR. By this retrospective legislation in exercise of power under Article 309 of the Constitution of
India, the accrued right of the erstwhile Lecturers has WP(C) No. 304 of 2024 with MC(WP(C) No.
274 of 2024 Page 11 been negated, unless they passed the B. Ed. Course from a recognised Institute.
The new RR of 2021 nor the Notification dated 29.06.2022 does provide any safeguard to the
erstwhile Lecturers who are yet to be trained as B. Ed. under the new RR. Such a situation has been
frowned upon by various decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court including the case of Tushar Ranjan
Mohanty (supra).
[17] From perusal of the documents annexed with the writ petition, it is found that the petitioner
submitted an application dated 16.06.2022 to the Zonal Education Officer Zone-III, Thoubal
requesting to issue NOC for B. Ed. Training course 2022-2024. This Court is of the firmed view that
the alleged non-consideration of the candidature of the petitioner on ground of not forwarding a
copy of NOC from Zonal Education Officer cannot be accepted, as there is no fault from the side of
the petitioner. Any lapses are from the officials concerned and the petitioner cannot be allowed to
suffer for such lapses. The decision in the case of Ch. Deependra (supra) will squarely cover the
present case. The State respondents cannot hide behind the plea that the petitioner was not eligible
for the session of 2023-2025 for the lapses committed in 2022-2024 course.
[18] Without going to the legality of retrospective legislation of RR of 2021 cancelling accrued right
of receiving normal increments under the old RR, this Court thinks it apt to refer to constitutional
safeguards as mandated in Article 59(4) [wrt President], Article 125(2) proviso [wrt Judges of
Supreme Court], Article 158(4) [wrt Governor], Article 221(2) proviso [wrt WP(C) No. 304 of 2024
with MC(WP(C) No. 274 of 2024 Page 12 Judges of High Courts] to mention a few that service
conditions cannot be altered to the disadvantages during the tenure of the incumbents. [19] In the
case in hand, the accrued right of the erstwhile Lecturers (now, PGTs untrained) to receive normal
increment has been taken away by the new RR, unless they pass B. Ed. course from a recognised
Institute. Lecturers like the petitioner herein have to undergo the B. Ed. course in order to
entitlement of normal increment. The petitioner was not considered for the session 2022-2024
when he was otherwise eligible on mere plea of non- enclosure of NOC. NOC was applied in time.
For the session of 2023-2025, the rejection is explained in the counter affidavit for the first time that
the petitioner was not eligible as he did not have mandatory minimum 8 years of service. This Court
is of the opinion that the case of the petitioner could have been considered in the 2022-2024 session
itself, even if assuming that there was no 'NOC' from zonal office, by exercising the power under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39313509/ 7
Shri Laikhuram Nandabir Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
Para 7 of the Notification dated 14.03.2014. For the lapses of the respondents in 2022- 2024 cannot
be cured by technical plea in 2023-2025, in a situation where accrued right of an employee has been
taken away by retrospection legislation under Article 309 of the Constitution. It is clarified that this
Court is not examining the retrospection legislation of the new RR of 2021, but considering a device
to do justice to the petitioner applying the settled principle that a person should not be made to
suffer for the lapses of the officials concerned.
[20] In order to do complete justice and in the facts and circumstances of the present case, it would
suffice if the State respondents WP(C) No. 304 of 2024 with MC(WP(C) No. 274 of 2024 Page 13 are
directed to admit the petitioner in B. Ed. course in DM College in any available seat in any session
irrespective of whether the petitioner has 8 years minimum service or not, by invoking power
conferred under para 7 of Notification dated 14.03.2014 for removing difficulties. [21] In terms of
the directions contained in para 20 as above, the writ petition along with misc. application is
disposed of. No cost. [22] Send a copy of this order to the Administrative Secretary, Education(S),
Govt. of Manipur for information and necessary compliance.
