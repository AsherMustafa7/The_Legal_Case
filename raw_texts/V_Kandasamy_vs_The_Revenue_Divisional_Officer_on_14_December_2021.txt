COMMON ORDER
Since the issues involved in all these writ petitions are one and the same, they are disposed of by this
common order.
2. The lis on hand, are instituted questioning the legal validity of the show cause notices issued to
the petitioners, who all are miners. All possess valid lease and miners, who are possessing valid
license for mining operations.
3. In view of the fact that these show cause notices are under challenge, this Court thought fit not to
venture into an adjudication of actual disputes, which all are to be done with reference to the
documents in original and evidences to be placed by the respective parties. Thus, it is suffice if the
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis scope of the show cause notices and the
challenges made therein, are to be considered. The impugned show cause notices reveal that the
petitioners had extended their mining operations excessively and quarried over and above the
permitted limits and thereby committed an act of illegality, irregularity or otherwise based on facts
to facts. Thus, the Authorities issued show cause notices by imposing penalty under the provisions
of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as the
'Act') as well as the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. (hereinafter referred to as
the 'Rules').
4. The learned Senior Counsel as well as the learned counsels appearing on behalf of the petitioners
mainly contended that the Authorities have no jurisdiction to issue show cause notice by invoking
Rule 36(A) of the Rules as Section 21 of the Act contemplates 'Penalties' and as per the procedures
laid down in the Act, the Authorities, on identification of illegality or otherwise, necessarily has to
lodge an complaint before the jurisdictional Court for prosecution, by following the Criminal
Procedure Code. Thus, the procedure adopted by issuing a show cause notice ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis contravenes the spirit of Section 21 of the Act and thus, the show
cause notices are liable to be set aside.
5. The learned Senior Counsel is of an opinion that once the authorities thought fit to invoke Penalty
provisions then, the procedures contemplated under Section 21 of the Act alone must be followed
and the Authorities cannot invoke Section 21 of the Act and simultaneously Rule 36 A of the Rules,
which is improper and therefore, the notices are liable to be setaside.

V.Kandasamy vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 14 December, 2021
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner Mr.V.Sanjeevi pointed out that the show cause notices does
not speak about the inspection report and the manner in which the assessments are made regarding
the excess mining operation. In the absence of those details, the petitioners will not be in a position
to submit their explanation defending their case. Thus, on that ground also, the notices are liable to
be setaside.
7. The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing on behalf of ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the respondents objected the contentions raised on behalf of the
petitioners by stating that the application of Section 21 of the Act and Rule 36(A) of the Rules are
based on different circumstances and therefore, there is no impediment for the Competent
Authorities for invoking Rule 36 (A) of the Rules. The State, by exercising the powers conferred
under Section 15 of the Act framed the Rules and such Rules are in force and based on the facts and
circumstances of each case, the Authorities competent are empowered to invoke the Rules for the
purpose of imposing Penalty by following the procedures as contemplated under the Rules. This
being the position, there is no infirmity as such, in respect of the show cause notices issued and it is
left open to the petitioners to defend their case by submitting their explanation and in the event of
submitting any explanation/objections along with the documents, if any, the competent Authorities
would be in a position to consider the case on merits and take a decision and proceed accordingly.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioners placed a reliance in respect of the judgment of the Hon'ble
Division Bench of this Court dated 29.10.2018 passed in W.P.(MD).Nos.19936 of 2017 and etc.,
batch, and they have relied ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis on Paragraph 9 of
the judgment, which reads as under:
“9.Section 21 of the Act came into inserted by Act 10 of 2015. Rule 36(A) has been in
statute prior to that. This Rule has been introduced in exercise of the power under
Section 15 r/w 23-C of the Act. The moment Section 21 has come into being, Rule
36-A lose its significance. In fact, it does not have any existence thereafter. After all,
between rule which has been enacted in pursuant to the rule making power and
substantive provision of the Act, the later one would certainly prevail, for which,
there will not be any quarrel. Therefore, in no case any revenue official can invoke
Rule 36-A, for the purpose of release of mineral, tool, machinery, instrument, vehicle
etc.,”
9. However, the State preferred Review Application in Review Application Writ (MD).Nos.80 to 82
of 2019 against the above judgment and the Review Petitions were considered and a judgment was
pronounced on 09.09.2019. In the Review Petitions, the Hon'ble Division Bench considered Section
21 of the Act. Section 23A of the Act provides 'Compounding of offences'. However, in respect of the
said writ petition, the relief sought for is to forbear the respondents from quarrying sand in river
Vellar, Survey No.316, Subramaniyapuram Village, Edayar Panchayat, Aranthangi Taluk,
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Pudukottai District. In the said context, the
Hon'ble Division Bench has said that Rule 36-A has to be read in consonance with Section 23A of
the Act. In paragraphs 16 and 17 of the judgment, the Hon'ble Division Bench dealt with the scope of
Section 36-A of the Tamil Nadu Minor and Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 and its effect and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16534268/ 3
V.Kandasamy vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 14 December, 2021
said paragraphs read as under:
“16. Much reliance has been made on Rule 36(A) of the Tamil Nadu Minor and
Minerals Concession Rules, 1959. We would like to place on record the relevant
portion of the aforesaid provision, which speaks on penalty:-
“36-A. Penalties. - (1) Whenever any person contravenes the provisions of
sub-sections (1) and (1-A) of Section 4 of the Act in any land, enhanced seigniorage
fee upto a maximum of fifteen times the normal rate subject to a minimum of
twenty-five thousand rupees shall be charged and recovered from that person by the
District Collector or the District Forest Officer, as the case may be, or in the
alternative, he shall be liable to be punished as provided in sub-section (1) of Section
21 of the Act”
17. This Rule merely speaks about the penalties alone.
These penalties are to be construed only for the purpose of compounding the offence committed. On
a reading of this Rule, it is very clear that the penalty itself is based on seigniorage fee subject to the
minimum amount. This Rule, with due respect, does not speak about the release of the materials
seized, ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis including the vehicle. Hence, Rule
36(A) has to be read in consonance with Section 23A of the M&M Act. We have already held that
compounding under Section 23A is different from the exercise of power under Section 21(4A) of the
Act.”
10. This being the scope of the said judgment, the reliance placed on behalf of the petitioners that
Rule 36-A cannot be applied based on the judgment, deserves no merit consideration. Admittedly,
the said Rule is not struck down and Section 15 (g) of the Act provides Power to the State in this
regard. For all these reasons, the judgment cited is of no avail to the petitioners as the facts and
circumstances are dissimilar and not comparable.
11. It is relevant to consider Section 15 (g) and Section 21 of the Mines and Minerals (Development
and Regulation) Act, 1957 along with Rule 36A of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules,
1959.
11.1 Section 15 (1) empowers the State Governments to make rules in respect of minor minerals.
Accordingly, the State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules for
regulating the grant of ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis quarry leases, mining
leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected
therewith.
11.2 Section 15 (1) (g) provides Power to the State for fixing and collection of rent, royalty, fees, dead
rent, fines or other charges and the time within which and the manner in which these shall be
payable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16534268/ 4
V.Kandasamy vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 14 December, 2021
11.3 Section 21 (5) denotes that “Whenever any person raises, without any lawful authority, any
mineral from any land, the State Government may recover from such person the mineral so raised,
or, where such mineral has already been disposed of the price thereof, and may also recover from
such person, rent, royalty or tax, as the case may be, for the period during which the land was
occupied by such person without any lawful authority.” 11.4 Let us now consider Rule 36-A of the
Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules. Sub Rule 1 states that any person contravenes the
provisions of sub-section (1) and (1-A) of Section 4 of the Act is liable to pay penalty. In alternate, he
shall be liable to be punished under Sub-section ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (1) of Section 21 of the Act.
11.5 The cogent reading of the above provisions of the Act and Rule 36-A of the Rules
unambiguously clarifies that the State Government is empowered to make Rules by notification in
the official Gazette in respect of fixing and collection of rent, royalty, fees, dead rent, fines or other
charges. Further, Section 21(5) also empowers the State Government to recover the loss or the price
thereof etc,. Thus, there is no ambiguity in respect of the power conferred on the State Government
to make Rules and Rule 36-A of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules is within the scope
of the provisions of the Act and it does not supersede the provisions of the Act, in fact it reads in
consonance with the provisions for the purpose of effective control of the mining operations across
the State. Thus, the contention of the petitioners that Section 21 alone is the avail for the State
Government is untenable.
12. Considering the arguments as advanced by the respective learned ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Senior Counsel as well as the learned counsels for the parties to
the lis on hand, this Court has to consider two aspects. Whether a writ proceeding needs to be
entertained against a show cause notice and secondly, the spirit of Section 21 of the Act as well as
Rule 36 A of the Rules.
13. As far as the 1st point is concerned, no writ needs to be entertained against a show cause notice
in a routine manner. Undoubtedly, all writ petitions are maintainable under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India but the entertainability of the writ petition has to be considered by the Courts
while admitting the writ petitions challenging the show cause notices. The writ petitions filed
against a show cause notice may be entertained on the ground that the Authorities having no
jurisdiction issued the show cause notice directly hitting the provisions of the Act or an allegation of
malafides are raised. Even in the case of raising an allegation of malafides, the Authority against
whom such an allegation is raised, must be impleaded as a party respondent in his personal capacity
in the writ proceedings.
14. In all other circumstances, the persons who received such show ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis cause notices are expected to submit their explanations/objections
and defend their case and the Authorities competent are bound to consider those explanations and
take a decision on merits and in accordance with law. Thereafter, if any Appellate remedy is
contemplated under the provisions of the Act, the said remedy also must be exhausted by the
aggrieved persons. Contrarily, the writ petitions need not be entertained at prematured stage, which
will cause prejudice to either of the parties. There is a possibility of miscarriage in view that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16534268/ 5
V.Kandasamy vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 14 December, 2021
entire factual adjudications are not done at the stage of show cause notice. This apart, the High
Court may not be in a position to venture into an adjudication of such disputed facts, which all are to
be done based on the original documents and evidences to be considered by the competent
Authorities.
15. The power of Judicial Review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is to ensure the
processes through which a decision is taken by the Authorities in consonance with the provisions of
the Act and by following the procedures as contemplated, but not the decision itself. Thus,
adjudication which is an important factor must be allowed to be done by the ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis competent Authorities. In the event of premature adjudication of
facts by the High Court, undoubtedly, there is a possibility of error, omission or commission which
would cause prejudice to either of the parties and it is not desirable. The importance of exhausting
of the remedies at no circumstances be undermined by High Court. Such factual findings of those
Authorities or statutorily contemplated bodies are of greater assistance to the High Court for the
purpose of exercising the power of Judicial Review and thus, the Authorities must be allowed to
exercise their adjudicatory powers in all circumstances.
16. With reference to the second point, let us consider Section 4 of the Act. Section 4 enumerates
prospecting or mining operations to be under license or lease. Sub Section 1 to Section 4 of the Act,
stipulates as follows:-
"4. Prospecting or mining operations to be under licence or lease.-
1) No person shall undertake any reconnaissance, prospecting or mining operations
in any area, except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a
reconnaissance permit or of a prospecting licence or, as the case may be, of a mining
lease, granted under this ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Act
and the rules made thereunder"
Sub Section 1A to Section 4 of the Act reads as under :
" 1A) No person shall transport or store or cause to be transported or stored any
mineral otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules
made thereunder."
17. Thus, any excess mining operations made over and above the permissible limit, is construed as
an impermissible activity and contemplated as an offense. Sub section 1-A denotes, 'no person shall
transport or store or cause to be transported or stored any mineral otherwise than in accordance
with the provisions of the Act' . Therefore, transporting or storing of minerals beyond the
permissible limits are also offences.
18. In this back drop, Section 21 of the Act is to be considered. Section 21 speaks about Penalties and
the same reads as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16534268/ 6
V.Kandasamy vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 14 December, 2021
"21. Penalties.-
(1) Whoever contravenes the provisions of sub-
section (1) or sub-section (1A) of section 4 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which
may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees per hectare of the area.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (2) Any rule made under any provision of
this Act may provide that any contravention thereof shall be punishable with imprisonment for a
term which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees, or with both,
and in the case of a continuing contravention, with additional fine which may extend to fifty
thousand rupees for every day during which such contravention continues after conviction for the
first such contravention.
(3) Where any person trespasses into any land in contravention of the provisions of sub-section (1)
of section 4, such trespasser may be served with an order of eviction by the State Government or any
authority authorised in this behalf by that Government and the State Government or such
authorised authority may, if necessary, obtain the help of the police to evict the trespasser from the
land.
(4) Whenever any person raises, transports or causes to be raised or transported, without any lawful
authority, any mineral from any land, and, for that purpose, uses any tool, equipment, vehicle or any
other thing, such mineral tool, equipment, vehicle or any other thing shall be liable to be seized by
an officer or authority specially empowered in this behalf.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (4A) Any mineral, tool, equipment, vehicle or
any other thing seized under sub-section (4), shall be liable to be confiscated by an order of the court
competent to take cognizance of the offence under sub-section (1) and shall be disposed of in
accordance with the directions of such court.
(5) Whenever any person raises, without any lawful authority, any mineral from any land, the State
Government may recover from such person the mineral so raised, or, where such mineral has
already been disposed of, the price thereof, and may also recover from such person, rent, royalty or
tax, as the case may be, for the period during which the land was occupied by such person without
any lawful authority.
(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an
offence under sub-section (1) shall be cognizable.] Explanation – On and from the date of
commencement of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021,
the expression '' raising, transporting and causing to raise or transport any mineral without any
lawful authority'' occurring in this section, shall mean raising, transporting or causing to raise or
transport any mineral by a person without ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
prospecting license, mining lease or composite license or in contravention of the rules made under
section 23-C."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16534268/ 7
V.Kandasamy vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 14 December, 2021
The above provision contemplates various circumstances and procedures to be followed. Sub
Section 1 to Section 21 of the Act contemplates, ''whoever contravenes the provisions of Sub-Section
(1) or Sub-Section (1-A) of Section 4 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may
extend to five years and with fine.'' 18.1. Sub-Section 2 to Section 21 of the Act states that, "any rule
made under any provisions of this Act, may provide that any contravention thereof shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine which may
extend to five lakhs rupees, or with both."
18.2. Sub Section 5 to Section 21 of the Act enumerates that, "whenever any person raises without
any lawful authority any mineral from any land the State Government may recover from such
person the mineral so raised and he proceeds further."
19. It is relevant to consider Rule 36 A of the Rules, 1959. Sub clause ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 1 to Rule 36 A contemplates, "whenever any person contravenes
the provisions of sub-section (1) and (1-A) of Section 4 of the Act in any land, enhanced seigniorage
fee upto a maximum of fifteen times the normal rate subject to a minimum of twenty five thousand
rupees shall be charged and recovered from that person by the District Collector or the District
Forest Officer, as the case may be or in the alternative, he shall be liable to be punished as provided
in sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Act."
20. As rightly pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, the Rule cannot have an
overriding effect of the provisions of the Act. The Rules must be in consonance with the provisions
of the Act and cannot be repugnant to the Act. Thus, it is relevant to consider Section 21 of the Act
and Rule 36A of the Rules, for the purpose of its implementation so as to ensure that the very
purpose and object of the Act and Rules are achieved. Sub-Section 2 to Section 21 of the Act
unambiguously states that, ''any Rule made under any provisions of this Act, may provide that any
contravention thereof shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two
years with fine''. Therefore, Sub-Section 2 to ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Section 21 of the Act provides an opportunity to frame Rule which may provide that any
contravention thereof, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two
years or with fine, which may extend to five lakhs rupees or with both and in case of a continuing
contravention, with additional fine which may extend to Rs.50,000/- for each day during which
such contravention continues after conviction for the first such contravention.
21. Rule 36A of the Rules also prescribes Penalties. The said Rule also says that whenever any
person contravenes the provisions of Sub-Section 1 and (1-A) to Section 4 of the Act, then, actions
are to be initiated. The only grievance of the writ petitioners are that once Section 21 of the Act
contemplates the procedure for filing of a criminal complaint by following the procedures under the
Criminal Procedure Code, then the State Authorities cannot invoke Rule 36A of the Rules. However,
Sub-Section 2 to Section 21 of the Act unambiguously stipulates that any Rule made under any
provisions of this Act may provide that any contravention thereof shall be punishable with
imprisonment, that is one aspect of the matter. Sub-Section 5 ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis to Section 21 of the Act contemplates, "whenever any person
raises, without any lawful Authority, any mineral from any land, the State Government may recover
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16534268/ 8
V.Kandasamy vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 14 December, 2021
from such person the mineral so raised." Thus, Sub-Section 2 to Section 21 of the Act contemplates
punishment. Sub-Section 5 to Section 21 of the Act provides power to the State Government to
recover such mineral from such person, the mineral so raised or where such mineral has already
been disposed of, the price thereof. Thus, the State Government is empowered to impose
punishment by framing Rules in consonance with Sub-Section 2 to Section 21 of the Act and recover
the loss or damages in accordance with Sub-Section 5 to Section 21 of the Act.
22. In this context, Rule 36 A of the Rules operates and Rule 36A provides both punishment under
Sub-Section 1 to Section 21 of the Act and also the recovery to be made in the event of causing
damage or illegal minings. The cogent reading and understanding of Section 21 of the Act and Rule
36 A of the Rules, this Court is of the considered opinion that the Authorities are competent to
invoke Section 21 (1) of the Act by taking action with reference to Rule 36A of the Rules and to
initiate action for ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis confiscation of the
minerals, if it is available or recover the losses, if any, occurred on account of excess or illegal
mining, or otherwise. When all such circumstances are contemplated both under Section 21 of the
Act as well as under Rule 36 A of the Rules, no doubt, in the present case, the Authorities thought fit
to provide an opportunity to the petitioners so as to consider their explanations, if any, filed. Such
show cause notices are issued only with an object to provide an opportunity and to avoid any
miscarriage of justice which would cause prejudice to the interest of the mining operators, who all
are otherwise conducting their mining operations in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the license. Thus, a balancing approach in this regard is to be adopted and even in the absence of
any contemplation of show cause notice, there is no impediment for the Authorities to seek
explanation so as to get the explanation from the persons against whom such allegations are made
or such illegalities are identified by the inspecting Authorities.
23. This being the scope of the show cause notice, the petitioners are bound to submit their
explanations, if they have chosen to do so. In the event of submitting an explanation, no doubt, the
competent Authorities may ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis provide an
opportunity to the petitioners to peruse the relevant documents, which are all relied upon by the
Department for initiation of action and thereafter, take a decision and proceed further. However,
there is no impediment for the Authorities to invoke Section 21 (1) of the Act by filing an appropriate
complaint before the competent Court of law under the code of Criminal Procedure Code (or) and to
initiate recovery proceedings for the damages or loss caused to the State Exchequer by invoking
Section 36A of the Rules as Section 21 of the Act and Rule 36A of the Rules go together and to
ensure that the illegal mining operations are dealt with in accordance with law.
24. In this regard, the petitioners are permitted to submit their explanations\objections, documents,
if any, within a period of four (04) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and on
receipt of any such explanations, the Authorities competent/respondents shall conduct an enquiry
by providing an opportunity to the writ petitioners and thereafter, take a decision on merits and in
accordance with law and initiate all appropriate further proceedings by following the procedures as
contemplated ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis under the Act and Rules. With
these directions, all these Writ Petitions stand Disposed of. No costs.

25. It is needless to state that the petitioners are entitled to raise all the factual as well as the legal
contentions, which all are made available to them.
26. The respondents are directed to complete the entire exercise within a period of four (04) months
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are
closed.
