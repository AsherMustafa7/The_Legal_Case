W.P.(C) No.9367 of 2024
Sambalpur in respect of the same properties had allowed both the said
writ petitions filed by the petitioner after setting aside the order dated
03.07.2015
passed by the Commissioner, Sambalpur clarifying in paragraph Nos.5 & 9 of the said order that,
"Petitioner had filed Bebandobasta Case No.1 of 2009 under Section 5 of the Odisha Offices of
Village Police (Abolition) Act before the Tahasildar for settlement of property. The Tahasildar in his
order dated 25.08.2010 settled half of the land i.e. measuring Ac.4.110 decimal in favour of the
petitioner and other half Ac.4.110 decimal was directed to be recorded in favour of the deity. Against
the said order of the Tahasildar, the opposite party No.1 approached the Appellate Authority i.e.
Sub-Collector by filing Bebandobasta Appeal No.5 of 2010. After hearing the said Bebandobasta
Appeal No.5 of 2010, as per final order dated 27.07.2012 passed in that Bebandobasta Appeal No.5
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34882860/ 2
Narendra Bhoe @ Jhankar vs State Of Odisha And Others .... Opposite ... on 31 January, 2025
of 2010, the sub-Collector upheld the order passed by the OEA Collector-cum-Tahasildar in
Bebandobasta Case No.1 of 2009. The said order of the Appellate Authority passed in OEA Appeal
No.5 of 2010 has attained finality in absence of further challenge to the same. As per the final order
passed by the Tahasildar in OEA Case No.1 of 2009 and confirmation to the same by the
Sub-Collector in OEA Appeal No.5 of 2010, there was direction to record the case land in favour of
the petitioner as well as deity in equal share."
Inspite of the said findings of the Hon'ble Courts in Paragraph Nos.5 & 9 of the final order passed in
W.P.(C) Nos.14540 & 14541 of 2015 after taking into account the pendency of R.F.A. No.9 of 2015,
the Tahasildar, Sambalpur (opposite party No.3) rejected the Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 of
the petitioner as per Annexure-5A only on the sole ground i.e. for the pendency of the R.F.A. No.9 of
2015 without taking into account to the above observations made by this Hon'ble Courts as per final
order dated 08.12.2023 passed in W.P.(C) Nos.14540 & 14541 of 2015.
6. It is the settled propositions of law that, order passed by the statutory authorities under OEA Act,
cannot be ignored by the Revenue Authorities at the time of making correction of records of land.
The above propositions of law has already been clarified by the Hon'ble Courts in the ratio of the
following decisions:-
(i) In a case between Rama Devi (dead), after her, her legal heirs Ch. Dhananjay
Mohapatra and others Vrs.
Government of Orissa, represented through its Secretary to G.A. Department and others reported in
2014 (1) O.J.R. (509), "order passed by the statutory authority under the O.E.A. Act cannot be
ignored as without jurisdiction by an authority under the O.S.S. Act.
(ii) In a case between Prafulla Chandra Muduli and others Vrs State of Odisha and others reported
in 2005 (Supp.) OLR 950, "an order passed under one statute by a superior authority can under no
stretch of imagination be varied or held to be without jurisdiction by an authority exercising power
under another independent statute. (Para
8)."
(iii) In a case between Sanatan Acharya Vrs. Tahasildar, Panposh & others reported in 2016 (2)
O.J.R. (462), "Tahasildar is to carry out the order of the superior court with regard to entry in the
ROR. He has no authority to sit over the order of Higher Authority."
7. Here in this writ at hand, when as per the reflections made in paragraph Nos.5 & 9 of the final
order dated 08.12.2023 passed in W.P.(C) Nos.14540 & 14541 of 2015 for joint recording of the
properties involved in the writ petitions in favour of the petitioner and deity on the basis of order
passed in Bebandobasta Appeal No.5 of 2010 confirming to the final order in Bebandobasta Case
No.1 of 2009 has already been reached in its finality without being challenged to the same, then at
this juncture, in view of the said direction, the Tahasildar, Sambalpur (opposite party No.3) should

Narendra Bhoe @ Jhankar vs State Of Odisha And Others .... Opposite ... on 31 January, 2025
have recorded the properties involved in the writ petition deleting the recordings thereof in
Annexure-3 & 4. For which, the Tahasildar, Sambalpur (opposite party No.3) should not have
rejected the Revenue Case No.1 of 2024 as per Annexure-5A only on the ground of pendency of
R.F.A. No.9 of 2015.
So, by applying the principles of law enunciated in the ratio of the aforesaid decisions to this writ at
hand, it is held that, the undated order passed by the Tahasildar, Sambalpur (opposite party No.3)
vide Annexure-5A in Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 cannot be sustainable under law, because, it
was the duty of the Revenue Officer for passing the order in Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 for
recording of the properties involved in the writ petition on the basis of final order passed in
Bebandobasta Appeal No.5 of 2010, but, the Tahasildar, Sambalpur has not done so. For which, the
undated order passed in Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 vide Annexure-5A by the Tahasildar,
Sambalpur cannot be sustainable under law.
8. Therefore, this writ petition filed by the petitioner is allowed.
The undated order passed in Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 (Annexure-5A) by the Tahasildar,
Sambalpur is quashed.
The matter vide Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 is remitted back to the Tahasildar, Sambalpur
(opposite party No.3) for deciding the said Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 afresh as per law and to
record the properties involved in that Revenue Misc. Case No.1 of 2024 on the basis of final order
passed in Bebandobasta Case No.1 of 2009 and the confirmation to the same in Bebandobasta
Appeal No.5 of 2010 and to make necessary corrections of the names from the RoRs vide
Annexure-3 & 4 of this writ petition.

No.1 of 2024 within a period of two months positively from the date of communication of this
judgment.
