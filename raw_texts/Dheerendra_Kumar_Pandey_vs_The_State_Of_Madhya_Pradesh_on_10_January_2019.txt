As per prosecution story, short facts of the case are that the complainant Lakhan Lal on 7/9/16
submitted a written complaint at Police Station to the effect that he is a Teacher by profession and
used to go to Govardhan, Mathua (U.P.) for Govardhan Parikrama every month since 1995. During
that time, he met one Sanjay Singh @ Mahendra Pratap, who informed him that he is a Contractor
by profession and along with him the applicant was also present. Sanjay Singh @ Mahendra Pratap
informed him that there is good margin of profit in the business of contractorship, but he does not
have that much amount to invest. Sanjay Singh @ Mahendra Pratap proposed the complainant that
if Rs.25 lakhs is invested then he would give him Rs.10 lakhs per year and will also return the
principal amount after completion of THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dheerendra
Kumar Pandey Vs. State of M.P.) the work. On the basis of aforesaid, the complainant has given Rs.5

Dheerendra Kumar Pandey vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 January, 2019
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant has been falsely implicated. According
to him, after rejection of the last bail application on merits, vide order dated 5/10/18, trial Court has
framed charges against the applicant and charge under section 467 of the IPC, which entails life
imprisonment, has not been framed against him. He is in custody since 9/10/17. Applicant is a
permanent resident of Village Pooremishra, P.S.Deeh, District Raibareli (U.P.) and there is no
likelihood of his absconsion, if released on bail. With the aforesaid submissions, prayer for grant of
bail is made.
Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application and prayed for its rejection by contending that
on the basis of the allegations and the material available on record, no case for grant of bail is made
out.
However, it would not be desirable to enter into the merits of the rival contentions at this juncture.
Considering the material change in the circumstances of the case coupled with the fact that trial is
not likely to conclude in near future and prolonged pre- trial detention being an anathema to the
concept of liberty, this Court is inclined to extend the benefit of bail to the applicant, though on
comparatively stringent conditions.
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dheerendra Kumar Pandey Vs. State of M.P.)
Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, this application is allowed and it
is directed that the applicant namely Dheerendra Kumar Pandey be released on bail on furnishing a

appearance on the dates given by the concerned Court.

1. The applicant will comply with all the terms and conditions of the bond executed
by him;
2. The applicant will cooperate in the investigation/trial, as the case may be;
3. The applicant will not indulge himself in extending inducement, threat or promise
to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him/her from
disclosing such facts to the Court or to the Police Officer, as the case may be;

accused;
5. The applicant will not seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial; and
