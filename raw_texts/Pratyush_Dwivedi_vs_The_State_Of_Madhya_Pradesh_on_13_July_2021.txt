O R D E R (Oral)
(13.7.2021) Per: Mohammad Rafiq, Chief Justice
1. Under challenge in all these writ petitions is the validity of Madhya Pradesh Lok Seva (Anusuchit
Jatiyo, Anusuchit Janjatiyo Evam Anya Pichhade Vargo Ke Liye Arakshan) Sansodhan Adhyadesh,
2019 promulgated on 8th March, 2019, which later on became the Madhya Pradesh Lokseva
Sansodhan Adhiniyam, 2019, as a result of which, the reservation in favour of OBC category has
been raised from 14% to 27% thereby raising the outer limit of the reservation from 50% to 63%.
2. This Court after hearing the learned counsel for the parties passed an interim order in WP
No.5901/2019 on 31.1.2020, which has since then remained in operation. The operative part of the
said order reads as under:-
"Accordingly, after hearing the learned counsels, it is directed that, it shall be open
for the Public Service Commission to go ahead with the selection process. However,
the same shall not be finalized and no appointments shall be made without prior
permission of the High Court."
3. IA No.5654/2021 has been filed by the State Government in WP No.5901/2019 and another IA
No.5601/2021 has been filed on behalf of the State Public Service Commission in WP
No.16522/2019, with a common prayer that in view of the ongoing second wave of Coronavirus and
apprehended third wave, the State Government/Public Service Commission may be allowed to
notify the result of the selection and make appointment on vacant posts of Medical Officer Class-II.
It is submitted that as per the requisition submitted to the MPPSC, an advertisement dated
5.12.2020 was published for appointment of the Medical Officer (Medical) and Medical Officer
(Non-medical) in the Department of Home, Madhya Pradesh advertising 4 posts, out of which 2
posts are for Open Category and 2 posts for OBC Category. Similarly, another advertisement was
issued on 8.2.2021 notifying 727 vacancies for appointment of Medical Officer in the Department of
Public Health and Family Welfare, out of which 253 posts are reserved for ST, 401 posts are reserved
for OBC and 73 posts are reserved for EWS, which includes 83 posts reserved for ST (Female), 132
for OBC (Female) and 24 posts for EWS females. Moreover, 44 posts are reserved for candidates
having Locomotor Disability. Prayer has been made in both the aforementioned Interlocutory
Applications that the aforesaid interim order dated 31.01.2020 passed by this Court may be suitably
modified and the respondents may be allowed to notify the result of the aforesaid two selections by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/78848307/ 2
Pratyush Dwivedi vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 July, 2021
providing reservation to the candidates of OBC only up to 14%, keeping the posts for 13% increased
reservation vacant and make appointment accordingly.
4. In the course of arguments, learned counsel for the petitioners in W.P. No.20293/2019 and WP
No.3757/2011 have submitted that they have in their writ petitions also challenged the reservation
of 10% provided to the candidates of Economically Weaker Sections of Citizens, which if added to
the overall percentage of reservation including 27% reservation provided to the OBC, the total
reservation would far exceed the limit of 50% , thus, taking the total reservation to as highest as
73%, in breach of the ratio of the Constitutional Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in Indra
Sawhney etc. etc. vs. Union of India and others, etc. (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217.
5. However, Shri Purushendra Kaurav, Advocate General submitted that reservation provided to
EWS stands on different footing than the reservation provided to OBC as it has the backing of the
Articles 15(6) and 16(6) and therefore, the two cannot be equated.
6. Having regard to the submissions made and considering that the hearing and final disposal of the
writ petitions may take time, we are inclined, for the time being, to modify the order dated 31.1.2020
passed in WP No.5901/2019, allowing the State Government as well as Public Service Commission
to go ahead with the process of selection and publish the list of all the categories including
reservation to the extent of only 14% to the candidates of OBC and proceed accordingly to issue
appointment on the posts of Medical Officers. It is further directed that a stipulation may be made
in the appointment order of the candidates appointed against the posts reserved for EWS Category
that their appointment shall be provisional, subject to final outcome of the writ petitions.
7. Accordingly, the IA No.5654/2021 (in WP No.5901/2019) and IA No.5601/2021 (in WP
No.16522/2019) stands disposed of.
8. This Court on 17.2.2021 required the learned counsel for the parties to file the written
submissions and further directed that WP No.5901/2021 shall be treated as a lead case while the
learned Advocate General submitted that the reply filed by the State in that case shall be adopted in
other matters too.
9. Learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Advocate General are now again required to
file their written arguments alongwith the case law they seek to rely, positively within a period of
fortnight.
10. IA No.8457/2020 filed in WP No.5901/2019 for taking documents on record is considered and
allowed. The documents are taken on record.
11. IA No.425/2021 filed in WP No.3757/2020, is an application for intervention is also allowed. The
intervernors are permitted to intervene in the matter.
List all these matters alongwith connected matters on 10.8.2021.
