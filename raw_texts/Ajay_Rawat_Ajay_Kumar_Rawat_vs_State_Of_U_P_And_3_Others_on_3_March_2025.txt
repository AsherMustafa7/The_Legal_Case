3. Although the prayer for quashing of FIR has been made, but without insisting on the same, only
submission is that all alleged offences are punishable with imprisonment upto seven years, therefore
the police authorities are bound to follow the procedure laid down under Section 35 B.N.S.S. The
petitioner has been wrongly implicated and could not be arrested. Reliance has been placed on the
judgement of Apex Court in Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273 and Social Action
Forum for Manav Adhikar Vs. Union of India, Ministry of Law and Justice and others in Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 73 of 2015 with Criminal Appeal No. 1265 of 2017 Writ Petition (Criminal) No.
156 of 2017 and in Satendra Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Another (2022) 10
SCC 51 and co-ordinate Division Bench of this Court in Vimal Kumar & 3 others Vs. State of U.P. & 3
others in 2021 (2) ACR 1147.
4. We have gone through the impugned first information report and without interfering in the same,
we are of the opinion that the guidelines framed by the Apex Court in the above noted judgement are
equally applicable to the facts of the instant case.
5. Accordingly, the instant petition also stands disposed of in terms of the judgements as noted
above.
