3. Mrs. Ch. Sundari, the learned Government Advocate submitted that as against the order dated
6.6.2022 passed in WP (C) No.34 of 2020, the petitioners have filed writ appeal along with delay
condonation petition and after condoning the delay, the writ appeal was numbered as W.A.No.117 of
2022.When the writ appeal was listed on 24.1.2023, the learned Government counsel, finding some
technical defect in the memo of appeal, sought permission of this Court to withdraw the writ appeal
with liberty to file a fresh appeal. Accepting the prayer of the Government counsel, this Court
dismissed W.A.No.117 of Ref:- WA No. of 2023 Page |3 2022 with liberty as prayed for by the
petitioners. He would submit that after obtaining the certified copy of the order passed in the writ
petition, the petitioners have filed fresh writ appeal with a delay of 41 days excluding the time taken
in pursuing W.A.No.117 of 2022.
4. The learned Government Advocate further submitted that the delay of 41 days is neither wilful
nor wanton. Further, the Court should take a lenient view as the State represents collective cause of
the community and if the delay is condoned and the appeal is numbered, no prejudice would be
caused to the private respondent and on the other hand, if the delay is not condoned, the petitioners
would be put to irreparable loss and damage. Thus, a prayer has been made to condone the delay of
41 days in filing the writ appeal.
5. Per contra, Mrs. G. Pushpa, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the total
number of days as per the petition is 41 days and the same being wrong and not admissible as per
the order dated 24.1.2023 passed by this Court in W.A.No.117 of 2022. He would submit that the
mistakes committed due to the carelessness and inadvertency of the counsel for the petitioners has
caused irreparable loss to the respondent who is a retired Government employee of the Ref:- WA
No. of 2023 Page |4 Government of Manipur and who has been discriminated by the inaction of the
Government without making any payment of his monthly salary since the year 2016 and the arrear
salary since the year 2012 and the same is still continuing.
6. The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that only this time with respect to the
order dated 6.6.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.34 of 2020, the petitioners have preferred the appeal to
deny the rights and liabilities accrued to the respondent by suppressing the factum of the order
dated 11.3.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No.847 of 2018 against which no appeal has been preferred and
allowed to attain finality. The process of filing the instant writ appeal is only to delay the matter of
the respondent with an ill intention to make him suffer more. Thus, a prayer has been made to
dismiss the petition.
7. We have considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
8. The respondent herein has filed W.P.(C) No.34 of 2020 to set aside the order dated 4.11.2019
passed by the Director, Education(S), Government of Manipur and also the order dated 9.12.2019
passed by the Commissioner, Education(S), Government of Manipur and to implement the Ref:-
WA No. of 2023 Page |5 order passed in W.P.(C) No.847 of 2018. After hearing both sides, the
learned Single Judge, by the order dated 6.6.2022, allowed the writ petition.

9. There is no dispute that as against the order dated 6.6.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.34 of 2020, the
State Government has preferred writ appeal with application to condone the delay. After condoning
the delay by this Court, the appeal has been numbered as W.A.No.117 of 2022. When the writ appeal
was listed on 24.1.2023, the learned State counsel sought permission of the Court to withdraw the
writ appeal with liberty to file a fresh one. By the order dated 24.1.2023, W.A.No.117 of 2022 came
to be dismissed as withdrawn with liberty as prayed for by the petitioners. Thereafter, the
petitioners have filed the fresh writ appeal with an application to condone the admitted delay of 41
days in filing the writ appeal.
10. According to the learned Government Advocate, the total delay from the date of order in the writ
petition till the filing of the present appeal comes to 234 days and after deducting the statutory
period of 30 days and the time taken in pursuing W.A.No.117 of 2022 i.e. 160 days and also 3 days'
time taken for obtaining the certified copy of the order, there is a delay of 41 days and such a shorter
delay is neither wilful nor wanton. Ref:- WA No. of 2023 Page |6
11. The respondent stated that W.A.No.117 of 2022 was pending before this Court till 24.1.2023
though the same was filed on 17.8.2022. In fact, W.A.No.117 of 2022 was filed with a delay of more
than 5 months and the time spent in pursuing W.A.No.117 of 2022 cannot be excluded.
12. The point that arises for consideration is whether the time taken in pursuing W.A.No.117 of 2022
is to be excluded or not while computing the delay. As stated supra, W.A.No.117 of 2022 has been
filed against the order dated 6.6.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.34 of 2020 with a delay of 33 days and
the said delay was condoned by this Court by the order dated 21.11.2022 in MC (WA) No.152 of
2022. After numbering the writ appeal, finding some technical defects in the memo of appeal, the
State counsel, on instructions, withdrawn the appeal with liberty to file a fresh appeal. For proper
appreciation, the order dated 24.1.2023 passed in W.A.No.117 of 2022 is quoted hereunder:
"Ms. G. Pushpa, learned counsel, appears for the respondent in the appeal as well as
in the miscellaneous case.
Ms. Ch. Sundari, learned Government
Advocate, appearing for the
appellants/applicants, seeks leave to
withdraw the appeal and miscellaneous case Ref:- WA No. of 2023 Page |7 reserving
liberty to the appellants/applicants to file an appeal afresh with a miscellaneous case
in accordance with due procedure.
Leave granted.
WA No.117 of 2022 and MC (WA) No.198 of 2022 are accordingly dismissed as
withdrawn with the liberty aforestated.
No order as to costs."

13. It appears that the petitioners have applied the certified copy of the order on 24.1.2023 and after
obtaining the certified copy, filed the writ appeal on 27.1.2023. Since W.A.No.117 of 2022 has been
preferred against the order dated 6.6.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.34 of 2020 and was kept pending
for nearly 160 days, there is no hard and fast rule to deny the exclusion of the time taken in pursuing
W.A.No.117 of 2022 as prayed for by the petitioners. This Court also while permitting to withdraw
W.A.No.117 of 2022, granted liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh writ appeal. In such scenario,
the cause for the delay of 41 days, after deducting the period spent in pursuing W.A.No.117 of 2022,
shown by the petitioners is satisfactory and such delay of 41 is not deliberate and wanton and only
on bona fide reasons.In the facts and circumstances of the present case, the time spent in pursuing
the W.A.No.117 of 2022 is to be taken Ref:- WA No. of 2023 Page |8 as "sufficient cause" for
condoning the delay in filing the writ appeal.
14. The expression "sufficient cause" in Section 5 of the Limitation Act must receive a liberal
construction so as to advance substantial justice and generally delays be condoned in the interest of
justice where gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides is not imputable to the
party seeking condonation of delay. Law of limitation has been enacted to serve the interests of
justice and not to defeat it.
15. In N.Balakrishnan v. M.Krishnamurthy, (1998) 7 SCC 123, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
length of delay is no matter, acceptability of explanation is the only criterion. Thus, the acceptability
of explanation for the delay is the sole criterion and length of delay is not relevant, in the absence of
anything showing mala fide or deliberate delay as a dilatory tactic, the Court should condone the
delay.
16. It is well settled that Section 5 of the Limitation Act gives the Court a discretion which in respect
of jurisdiction is to be exercised in the way in which judicial power and discretion ought to be
exercised upon principles which are well understood; the words 'sufficient cause' receiving a liberal
construction so as Ref:- WA No. of 2023 Page |9 to advance substantial justice when no negligence
nor inaction nor want of bona fide is imputable to the appellant.
17. The delaying tactics stated by the respondent against the petitioners is that they have challenged
the order dated 6.6.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.34 of 2020 alone and no appeal against the order
dated 11.3.2019 passed in W.P.(C) No.847 of 2018 has been preferred. Thus, the process for filing
the present writ appeal is only to delay the matter of the respondent with an ill intention to make
him suffer more cannot be countenanced.
18. We are convinced that when the substantial justice is pitted against the technical consideration,
then substantial justice deserves to be given preference over the latter, which cannot claim to have
vested injustice to be done because of non- deliberate delay, in particular. Thus, in the present facts
and circumstances of the case, it can be safely presumed that the petitioners had considerable and
sufficient reasons for the delay, in filing the writ appeal.
19. That apart, the approach of the Court should be liberal, pragmatic, justice-oriented and
non-pedantic, while dealing with an application for condonation of delay. Applying Ref:- WA No. of

The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Gurumayum Sanayaima Sharma on 13 March, 2023
2023 P a g e | 10 the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, we are of the view that the
cause for the delay has been sufficiently explained by the petitioners and we have satisfied with the
reasons for the delay.
20. Admittedly, refusal to condone the delay would result foreclosing a suitor from putting forth his
cause and there is no presumption that delay in approaching the Court is always deliberate.
Therefore, if the delay is condoned and the writ appeal is numbered, no prejudice would be caused
to the respondent. On the other hand, if the delay of 41 days after exclusion of the period spent in
pursuing W.A.No.117 of 2022 or total 234 days is not condoned, the petitioners would be put to
irreparable loss.
21. For the foregoing reasons, MC (WA) No.17 of 2023 is allowed and the delay of 41 days in filing
the writ appeal against the order dated 6.6.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.34 of 2020 is condoned. The
Registry is directed to number the writ appeal, if it is otherwise in order.
