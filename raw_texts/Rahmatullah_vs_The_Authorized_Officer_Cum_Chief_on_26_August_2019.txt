property which was subjected to a proceeding under the
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred
to as the 'SARFAESI Act 2002'). He is challenging the order dated
22.09.2017
passed by learned Presiding Officer, Debts Recovery Tribunal, Patna (hereinafter referred to as the
'Tribunal') in SARFAESI Application no.44 of 2017 as contained in Annexure- '7' to the writ

application. By the impugned order, the learned Tribunal has been pleased to reject the preliminary
objection taken Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 by the respondent bank
that the SARFAESI application is hopelessly barred by limitation. It was contended on behalf of the
bank that the limitation petition has been filed by the applicant after filing of the SARFAESI
application which is contrary to the order dated 04.02.2017 passed by the Hon'ble High Court in
CWJC No.15510 of 2015. The petitioner has however raised a wider issue by taking a plea that the
Debts Recovery Tribunal ('DRT') while entertaining an application under Section 17(1) of the Act of
2002 has no power to condone the delay.
Brief Facts It is the case of the petitioner before this Court that he had purchased a portion of the
land of plot no.172 and portion of plot no. 169 under khata no. 570, Tauzi no.814, Thana no.12, total
area 6-3/8 decimal situated at Mauza-Kumhrar, P.S.-Sultanganj, District Patna in the auction sale
for consideration of Rs.21,35,000/-. The bank accepted the offer of the petitioner and directed him
to deposit 25% of the bid amount after adjusting the earnest money deposit of Rs.98,000/-. The
petitioner deposited Rs.4,36,000/- in cash with the respondent-bank on 28.06.2011 and thereafter
he deposited balance amount of Rs.16,01,000/- through two bank drafts, thereby he deposited the
entire consideration amount of Rs.21,35,000/- on time.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 It is his further case that even after
deposit of the entire amount when he was not getting the possession of the property, he filed CWJC
No.19421/12 with a prayer to direct the bank to deliver actual physical possession over the property.
By the order dated 10.12.2013 (Annexure-1) the Court fixed 13 th December, 2013 for taking over
possession of the property and handing it over to the bank officials. The petitioner claims to have
constructed boundary wall, room etc. on the said property. It is alleged that there had been some
collusion which led to filing of two SARFAESI appeals by two different persons namely Tapeshwari
Devi who filed SARFAESI appeal no.13 of 2014 in which the learned tribunal has passed the order
dated 05.05.2014 which is subject matter of appeal at the instance of the petitioner before the
appellate tribunal at Allahabad being Appeal no.212/14 which is still pending. In appeal no.13/14 it
was claimed by Tapeshwari Devi that plot no.169 belongs to her and it was wrongly mortgaged to
the bank and another SARFAESI Appeal No.101/14 was filed by one Ramashish Singh on the ground
that plot no.172 belongs to him and the respondent no.3 has played a fraud by mortgaging it to the
bank. SARFAESI Appeal no.101/14 came to be dismissed by the learned Tribunal vide order as
contained in Annexure- '2' to the writ application. Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017
dt.26-08-2019 The respondent no.3 came to this Court in CWJC No.15510 of 2015 stating that no
notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 was served upon him. It is the case of the
petitioner that the respondent no.3 had full knowledge of the proceeding under the SARFAESI Act,
2002 but he chose to file writ petition on 11.09.2015 after a lapse of about ten months from the date
of expiry of 45 days period which is prescribed period of limitation for filing SARFAESI application
under sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002. Annexure-4 dated 24.10.2014 to the
writ application is an application submitted by respondent no.3 before the Certificate Officer, Patna
City in Certificate Case No.117/2009-10 in which he had informed the certificate officer that the
bank had sold the mortgaged land for a sum of Rs.21,00000/-, however till date he had not been
informed about this fact. He had requested the certificate officer to call upon the bank to show cause
as to why no information was given to him about auction sale of the property.

Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
The writ application being CWJC No.15510 of 2015 brought by the respondent no.3 was disposed of
by a learned coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 14.02.2017. The Hon'ble Court granted
four weeks time for filing SARFAESI application before the Tribunal. It is the submission of the
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 petitioner that by virtue of the order
passed by this Court in the writ application, the respondent no.3 filed a securitisation application
within the given period but did not file any application for condonation of delay which was
ultimately filed on 15.06.2017 i.e. after expiry of four weeks. A copy of the petition filed under
Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay has been brought on record as Annexure-5
to the writ application. The respondent no.3 claimed therein that for the first time he came to know
about the sale of the property in the year 2014 in the certificate court and after that he had given an
application for supply of details under the Right to Information Act, but he did not succeed to get
any detail information. In CWJC No.19421 of 2012 filed by the purchaser the respondent no.3 was
not made a party. He submitted that after all efforts he preferred writ application before the High
Court vide CWJC No.15510/15 in which he had been given liberty to raise his grievance before the
learned Tribunal.
In view of the order of the learned writ Court in CWJC No.15510 of 2015, the Tribunal has
considered the preliminary objection and rejected the same.
Submission of the petitioner The main argument of the petitioner is that the learned Tribunal has
wrongly condoned the delay of 2080 days. Reliance has been placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 the case of
International Asset Reconstruction Company of India Ltd. Vs. Official Liquidator of Aldrich
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. reported in AIR 2017 SC 5013 to submit that the Debts Recovery Tribunal
cannot condone the delay in case of an application under Section 17 of the Act of 2002. It is
submitted that Section 24 of the Act of 1993 makes the provision of the Limitation Act applicable
only to an original application made by the bank under Section 19 of the Act of 1993 only.
Mr. T.N. Maitin, learned senior counsel representing the petitioner has in order to support his
contentions mainly relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of International
Asset (supra). Learned senior counsel has further submitted that Section 5 of the Limitation Act,
1963 applies only to the proceedings in "Courts" and not to the Tribunal. He has relied upon a
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Sakuru Vs. Tanaji reported in AIR 1985 SC 1279 in which
by placing reliance upon the earlier judgments in the case of Town Municipal Council, Athani Vs.
Presiding Officer,Labour Court, Hubli (AIR 1969 SC 1335), Nityananda M. Joshi Vs. Life Insurance
Corporation of India (AIR 1970 SC 209) and Sushila Devi Vs. Ramanandan Prasad (AIR 1976 SC
177), the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 applies only to
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 proceedings in "Courts" and not to
appeals or applications before the Bodies other than the Courts such as quasi-judicial tribunals or
executive authorities, notwithstanding the fact that such bodies or authorities may be vested with
certain specified powers conferred on Courts under the Codes of both civil or criminal.
Mr. Maitin, learned Advocate has also relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case
of N. Balakrishnan Vs. M. Krishanmurthy reported in (1998) 7 SCC 123 to submit that the law of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 3
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
limitation is founded on a sound public policy, however a party who is negligent and does not
approach the court of law in time cannot be permitted to seek condonation of delay. Learned senior
counsel has relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of The Bharat Bank
Ltd., Delhi Vs. the Employees of the Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi and the Bharat Bank Employee's Union
reported in AIR 1950 SC 188 in which after going into the functions and duties of the industrial
tribunal, the Hon'ble Apex Court took a view that the Tribunal is discharging the functions very near
those of a court although it is not a Court in the technical sense of the word. The Hon'ble Apex Court
then examined the scope of an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India arising out of an
order passed by the Tribunal held in paragraph 68 of the judgment as under:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 "68. Where the direction is
committed to any body or a tribunal exercising quasi-judicial functions which are not
lettered by ordinary rules of law, the tribunal should in the absense of any provision
to the contrary be deemed to have the final authority in the exercise of that
discretion. We cannot sit in appeal over their decision and substitute our own
discretion for theirs. Questions, however, may and do arise where such quasi-judicial
body attempts to usurp jurisdiction which it does not possess. It may assume
jurisdiction under a mistaken view of law or refuse to exercise jurisdiction properly
by adoption of extraneous or irrelevant considerations; or there may be cases where
in its proceedings the tribunal violates the principles of natural justice. In all such
cases the most proper and adequate remedy would be by writs of certiorari or
prohibition and the court having authority may direct that the decision of the body or
tribunal might be brought up to be quashed for lack of jurisdiction or for mistake
apparent on the face of it; and if the proceedings had not terminated at that time, a
writ of prohibition may also be issued for preventing the tribunal from exceeding its
jurisdiction. The issuing of such writs would not be an exercise of appellate powers
which means the rehearing of the case and passing of such judgment which in the
opinion of the appellate court the original tribunal should have made. The object of
these writs is simply to keep the exercise of powers by these quasi-judicial tribunals
within the limits of jurisdiction assigned to them by law and to restrain them from
acting in excess of their authority. These principles are well-settled and require no
elucidation [Rex v.
Electricity Commissioners, (1924) 1 KB 171;
Board of Education v. Rice, (1911) AC 179;.] .
Our conclusion, therefore, is that Article 136 of the Constitution does not contemplate a
determination given by the Industrial Tribunal." Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017
dt.26-08-2019 Learned senior counsel has again relied upon a recent judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Ganesan Rep. By its Power Agent G. Rukmani Vs. Commissioner,
Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board and others reported in AIR 2019
SC 2343 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court framed one of the questions for consideration in the
following terms:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 4
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
"(2) Whether applicability of Section 29 (2) of the Limitation Act is with regard to
different limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application to be filed only in a
court or Section 29(2) can be pressed in service with regard to filing of a suit, appeal
or application before the statutory authorities and Tribunals provided in a special or
local law."
The Hon'ble Apex Court discussed the various provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 and the judicial
pronouncements on the subject. Mr. Maitin has further relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of International Asset Reconstruction Company of India Ltd. (supra) to
submit that Section 24 of the Act of 1993 applies the Limitation Act 1963 only to the application
under Section 19 of the Act of 1993.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Learned counsel representing the Bank
has supported the argument of Mr. T.N. Maitin, learned senior advocate and endorsed the same on
behalf of the bank.
The writ application has been opposed by Mr. Sanjeev Kumar, learned counsel for respondent no.3
who has filed a counter affidavit stating inter alia that the petitioner has not moved this Court with
clean hands. The learned Tribunal has passed the impugned order dated 22.09.2017 after
considering the securitisation application in the light of the judgment of this Court passed on
14.02.2017 in CWJC No.15510/15. He has drawn the attention towards paragraph 8 of the judgment
of this Court which reads as under:-
" In such view of the matter, this Court directs the present petitioner to approach the
Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Patna under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. If
the petitioner approaches the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Patna, within four
weeks from today, the Tribunal will be obliged to look into the claim of the petitioner
and pass appropriate order in accordance with law without being influenced by the
earlier orders passed by this Court. The Tribunal, while considering the Limitation
Petition, will take into consideration the fact that the petitioner was not made a party
in any proceeding in the past as he has submitted that he has not received any notice.
It is clarified that this Court is not giving any opinion on the merit of the case."
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 It is further submitted that the order
passed by the learned Tribunal is an appealable order. Under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002
the order dated 22.09.2017 which was passed in presence of the petitioner could have been
challenged within a period of 30 days but instead of filing the appeal the petitioner chose to move
this Court in writ application much after the expiry of the period of limitation.
It is further stated that during pendency of the present writ application the petitioner filed a Letters
Patent Appeal vide LPA No.735 of 2018 on 18.05.2018 challenging the order dated 14.02.2017
passed in CWJC No.15510/15. In the said LPA the petitioner did not think it just and proper to place
before the Hon'ble Division Bench that in pursuance to the order dated 14.02.2017 passed in CWJC
No.15510/15 the learned Tribunal had already acted upon and condoned the delay in filing of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 5
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
SARFAESI application and the order of the DRT/Tribunal has also been challenged in the present
writ application. As a result of this no notice was issued to the present respondent no.3 and the
order was passed in the Letters Patent Appeal disposing of the said LPA with a direction to the DRT
to follow the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court without being influenced by the order dated
14.02.2017 passed in CWJC No.15510/15. It is submitted that the Patna High Court CWJC No.17999
of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 conduct of the petitioner in approaching this Court in the Letters Patent
Appeal and then getting an observation without disclosing that the DRT had already passed the
order is required to be deprecated.
It is submitted that in the case of International Asset (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court was
considering a case where an appeal had been preferred before the Tribunal against an order of the
recovery officer beyond the period of limitation of 30 days. In the said context, the Hon'ble Apex
Court took a view that the Tribunal had no power to condone the delay in filing of Appeal against the
order of the recovery officer and further that Section 24 of the Act of 1993 would apply to the
original proceeding before the Tribunal under Section 19 only. It is his submission that issue as to
the applicability of the Limitation Act in condoning the delay by the Tribunal in the SARFAESI Act
had arisen for consideration by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of International Asset (supra).
Respondent no.3 has went on to state that no demand notice dated 03.09.2008 under Section 13(2)
of the Act of 2002, no possession notice under Section 13(4) and no sale notice under Rule 9(1) of
the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 was served upon respondent no.3 at any stage of
the proceeding. It is Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 submitted that the
petitioner has tried to show service of demand notice by annexing a postal receipt dated 13.10.2008
but that does not show service of notice rather it only shows the casual approach taken by the bank
in initiating the SARFAESI action as even the date of dispatch in the postal receipt would take this
Court to show that the notice dated 03.09.2008 is said to have been dispatched 40 days thereafter
on 13.10.2008.
Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 has then referred to Rule 9(1) of the SARFAESI Rules and
relied upon Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to claim that while Rule 9(1) is
mandatory in nature and it requires compliance with the principles of natural justice, the right to
redemption as contained in Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 has not been snatched
away under the SARFAESI Act of 2002 rather the provisions of the Act of 2002 fortifies and in
various judgments the Hon'ble Apex Court has held this right of redemption at the stage of
confirmation and registration of sale. It is stated in paragraph 13 of the counter affidavit that the
petitioner is still ready to pay the bank's dues and as per his knowledge the sale certificate issued in
favour of the petitioner has not been registered till date, therefore right to redemption survives.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Learned counsel representing the
borrower (respondent no.3) has submitted before this Court that the present case is one of those
cases in which there is a complete violation of principles of natural justice inasmuch as neither any
notice under Section 13(2) nor the possession notice under Section 13(4) of the Act of 2002 and sale
notice in terms of Rule 9 (1) of the Act of 2002 could be served upon the petitioner. It is his
submission that the law of limitation being a procedural law as has been held in the case of Hitendra
Vishnu Thakur & ors. vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. (1994) 4 SCC 602, T. Kaliamurthi & Anr. vs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 6
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
Five Gori Thaikkal Wakf & Ors. (2008) 9 SCC 306 and Thirumalai Chemicals Ltd. vs. Union of India
(2011) 6 SCC 739, the provisions of the Limitation Act shall apply in respect of the applications
under Section 17 of the Act of 2002. Learned counsel has submitted that sub-section (7) of Section
17 of the Act of 2002 clearly mandates that the Debts Recovery Tribunal shall, as far as may be,
dispose of application in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1993 and the Rules made
thereunder. It is thus submitted that if this provision is taken care of then an application under
Section 17(1) has to be disposed off in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1993 as applicable
to an application under Section 19 of the Act of 1993. It is his submission that even though Patna
High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 the word 'application' has been defined under
the Act of 1993 to mean and understand an application made to a Tribunal under Section 19, by
virtue of sub-section (7) of Section 17 of the Act of 2002 the provisions of the Act of 1993 and the
Rules made thereunder with regard to the application under Section 19 shall equally apply to an
application under Section 17(1) of the Act of 2002.
Learned counsel submits that before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of International Asset
Reconstruction Company of India Ltd. (supra) the provisions of the Act of 2002 had not fallen for
consideration and the Hon'ble Apex Court had no occasion to consider the scope and ambit of
sub-section(7) of Section 17 and other provisions of the Act of 2002. This being the position, learned
counsel relies upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Bharat Petroelum
Corporation Ltd. & Anr. vs. N.R. Vairamani & Others reported in (2004) 8 SCC 579 that the
judgments of the Court cannot be cited like euclid's theorems because the slightest of change in the
facts of the case would make a sea difference. It is submitted that in the case of Ganesan (supra) the
fourth proposition discussed by the Hon'ble Apex Court clearly lays down that whether special or
local law vide statutory scheme has made applicable any provisions of the Patna High Court CWJC
No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Limitation Act or exclude applicability of any provisions of
Limitation Act can be decided only after looking into the scheme of particular special or local law. It
is apparent that the provisions of the Act of 2002 lays down the applicability of the provisions of the
Act of 1993 and the Rules framed thereunder for purpose of an application under sub-section(1) of
Section 17 of the Act of 2002, therefore under the statutory scheme of the Act of 2002 the provision
of Limitation Act as applicable to an application under Section 19 of the Act of 1993 would equally
apply in respect of the application under Section 17 of the Act of 2002.
Consideration Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records, this Court
deems it just and proper to reproduce some of the relevant provisions of the Act of 1993 and then
the Act of 2002 hereunder:-
Act of 1993 "Section 2(b) "application" means an application made to a Tribunal
under section 19."
Chapter IV lays down the Procedure of Tribunals. Section 19 to Section 24 are falling
under Chapter IV. Section 19 provides for "Application to the Tribunal" by a bank or
financial institution to recover any debt from any person. Under sub- section(3) of
Section 19 every application under sub- section(1) or sub-section(2) shall be in such
form, Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 and shall be

Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
accompanied with true copies of all documents relied on in support of the claim along
with such fee, as may be prescribed. On receipt of an application under sub-section(1)
or sub-section(2), the Tribunal shall issue summons to the defendant in terms of
sub-section(4) of Section 19. The defendant shall within a period of thirty days from
the date of service of summons, present a written statement of his defence including
claim for set-off or a counter claim. Proviso to sub-section(5) of Section 19 provides
that "where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of
thirty days, the Presiding Officer may, in exceptional cases and in special
circumstances to be recorded in writing, extend the said period by such further
period not exceeding fifteen days to file the written statement of his defence". The
written statement containing a claim for set-off or counter claim shall have the same
effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as to enable the Tribunal to pass a final order in
respect of both the claims.
Sub-section (25) of Section 19 reads as under:-
"19(25). The Tribunal may make such orders and give such directions as may be
necessary or expedient to give effect to its orders or to prevent abuse of its process or
to secure the ends of justice."
Section 20 provides for an appeal to the appellate tribunal. Under sub-section (3) of Section 20
every appeal under sub-section(1) shall be filed within a period of thirty days from the date on which
a copy of the order made, or deemed to have been Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017
dt.26-08-2019 made, by the Tribunal is received by him and it shall be in such form and be
accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed. Proviso to sub-section(3) states that "Appellate
Tribunal may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied
that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period."
Section 22 provides the procedure and powers of the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal stating
that the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall not be bound by the procedure laid down by the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice and, subject to
the other provisions of this Act and of any rules, the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall have
powers to regulate their own procedure including the places at which they shall have their sittings.
The Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal have been conferred with the power vested in a civil court
under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 while trying a suit in respect of the matters enumerated
under clause(a) to (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 22.
Section 24 reads as under:-
"24. Limitation.- The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963, shall, as far as may be,
apply to a application made to a Tribunal.
The Central Government has in exercise of its power conferred by sub-sections(1) and
(2) of Section 36 of the Act of 1993 framed rules called "Debts Recovery Tribunal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 8
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
(Procedure) Rules, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Rules of 1993'). Under Patna
High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 the definition clause of the Rules
of 1993 the two words "applicant" and "application" are defined as under:-
"applicant means a person making an application under section 19 or under section
31-A and also includes an "applicant" who files an appeal under section 30(1) of the
Act. application means an application filed under section 19 or under section 31-A
and includes an "appeal" filed under section 30(1) of the Act."
The rules provide for procedure for filing application, presentation and scrutiny of the application,
application fee and documents to be accompanied with the application under section 19 or section
31-A. The Act of 2002 has been amended by Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (31 of 2016).
Chapter III deals with Enforcement of Security Interest. It starts with Section 13. Under sub-section
(2) of Section 13 where any borrower, who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security
agreement, makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any instalment thereof, and his
account in respect of such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non-performing asset, then,
the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities
to the secured creditor within sixty days from the date of Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017
dt.26-08-2019 notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any other
rights under sub-section(4). Once the secured creditor exercises its right under sub-section (4) of
Section 13 by taking any one of the measures enumerated therein, the borrower gets a cause of
action to raise his objection by filing a securitisation application in terms of sub-section (1) of
Section 17 of the Act of 2002. Section 17(1) and (1-A) are quoted hereunder for a ready reference:-
"17(1). Any person (including borrower), aggrieved by any of the measures referred to
in sub-section (4) of section 13 taken by the secured creditor or his authorised officer
under this Chapter, 1[may make an application along with such fee, as may be
prescribed] to the Debts Recovery Tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter within
forty-five days from the date on which such measures had been taken:
[Provided that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the
borrower and the person other than the borrower.] [Explanation.--For the removal of
doubts, it is hereby declared that the communication of the reasons to the borrower
by the secured creditor for not having accepted his representation or objection or the
likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons to the
borrower shall not entitle the person (including borrower) to make an application to
the Debts Recovery Tribunal under this sub-section.
[(1-A) An application under sub-section(1) shall be filed before the Debts Recovery
Tribunal within the local limits of whose jurisdiction-

(c) the branch or any other office of a bank or financial institution is maintaining an
account in which debt claimed is outstanding for the time being.] Patna High Court
CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Sub-section (7) of Section 17 reads as under:-
"17 (7). Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the Debts Recovery Tribunal shall, as
far as may be, dispose of the application in accordance with the provisions of the
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of 1993) and
the rules made thereunder."
Sections 35, 36 and 37 of the Act of 2002 are quoted hereunder for a ready reference:-
"35. The provisions of this Act to override other laws.- The provisions of this Act shall
have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other
law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such
law.
36. Limitation.- No secured creditor shall be entitled to take all or any of the
measures under sub-section(4) of section 13, unless his claim in respect of the
financial asset is made within the period of limitation prescribed under the
Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963).
37. Application of other laws not barred.- The provisions of this Act or the rules made
thereunder shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, the Companies Act, 1956
(1 of 1956), the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), the
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), the Recovery of Debts
Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of 1993) or any other law for
the time being in force."
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 From a bare reading of the aforesaid
provisions of the two special statutes having similar kind of aims and objects, it would appear that
both the statutes are complimentary to each other. The Act of 2002 shall by virtue of Section 35 take
effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being
in force. There would be no doubt that the Act of 1993 being a law operating in the same field, the
word and expression 'any other law' shall take within its fold the Act of 1993.
Section 36 creates an embargo at the right of secured creditor to take all or any of the measures
under sub-section(4) of Section 13, unless his claim in respect of the financial asset is made within
the period of limitation prescribed under the Limitation Act. To this Court therefore it appears that
Section 36 may be invoked by a borrower while raising his objection against the action taken by the
secured creditor in terms of sub-section(4) of Section 13 of the Act of 2002. Section 37 makes it clear
that the provisions of the Act of 2002 or the rules made thereunder shall be in addition to, and not
in derogation of interalia the Act of 1993 or any other law for the time being in force.

Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
The bone of contention is as to whether a reading of sub- section (7) of Section 17 of the Act of 2002
together with Section Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 24 of the Act of
1993 may be construed in a manner so as to hold and declare that the provisions of the Limitation
Act, 1963 as applicable to an application under Section 19 of the Act of 1993 would equally apply to
an application filed before the Debts Recovery Tribunal in terms of sub-section(1) of Section 17 of
the Act of 2002.
Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon a judgment of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of International Asset Reconstruction Company of India Ltd.
(supra). In the said case the Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering a question of law as to whether
Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 can be invoked to condone the prescribed period of 30 days,
under Section 30(1) of the Act of 1993, for preferring an appeal before the Tribunal against an order
of the Recovery Officer.
The Hon'ble Apex Court went through the various provisions of the Act of 1993, referred the
judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sakuru Vs. Tanaji (1985) 3 SCC 590: (AIR
1985 SC 1279) and after noticing Section 2(b) of the Act of 1993 which defined the word
"application" and Section 30 of the said Act held in paragraph 13 and 14 as under:-
"13. A comparative study of Section 30, pre and post-amendment in the year 2000,
reveals that the deemed status of proceedings before the Recovery Officer, as a
Tribunal, stands denuded. Had the proceedings before Patna High Court CWJC
No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 the Recovery Officer deemed to be before a
Tribunal, entirely different considerations may have arisen.
Old Section 30 before the 2000 Section 30 after the 2000 Amendment Amendment
"30. Orders of Recovery Officer "30. Appeal against the order of to be deemed as
order of Recovery Officer.--(1) Notwithstanding Tribunal.--Notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 29, any anything contained in Section 29, person aggrieved by
an order of the an order made by the Recovery Recovery Officer made under this Act

shall be deemed to an appeal to the Tribunal. have been made by the Tribunal (2) On
receipt of an appeal under sub- and an appeal against such orders section (1), the
Tribunal may, after giving shall lie to the Appellate an opportunity to the appellant to
be Tribunal." heard, and after making such enquiry as it deems fit, confirm, modify
or set aside the order made by the Recovery Officer in exercise of his powers under
Sections 25 to 28 (both inclusive)."
14. The RDB Act is a special law. The proceedings are before a statutory Tribunal. The scheme of the
Act manifestly provides that the legislature has provided for application of the Limitation Act to
original proceedings before the Tribunal under Section 19 only. The Appellate Tribunal has been
conferred the power to condone delay beyond 45 days under Section 20(3) of the Act. The
proceedings before the Recovery Officer are not before a Tribunal. Section 24 is limited in its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 11
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
application to proceedings before the Tribunal originating under Section 19 only. The exclusion of
any provision for extension of time by the Tribunal in preferring an appeal under Section 30 of the
Act makes it manifest that the legislative intent for exclusion was express. The application of Section
5 of the Limitation Act by resort to Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 therefore does not
arise. The prescribed period of 30 days under Section 30(1) of the RDB Act for preferring an appeal
against the order of the Recovery Officer therefore cannot be condoned by application of Section 5 of
the Limitation Act."
Recently once again the Hon'ble Apex Court had occasion in the case of Ganeshan Rep. By its Power
Agent G. Rukmani Ganesan Vs. Commissioner, Tamil Nadu Hindu Patna High Court CWJC
No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Religious and Charitable Endowments Board and others (AIR 2019
SC 2343) to consider the following questions:-
"1) Whether The Commissioner while hearing the appeal under Section 69 of Act,
1959, is a Court?
2) Whether applicability of Section 29(2) of Limitation Act is with regard to different
limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application to be filed only in a Court or
Section 29(2) can be pressed in service with regard to filing of a suit, appeal or
application before statutory authorities and tribunals provided in Special or Local
Laws?
3) Whether the Commissioner while hearing the appeal under Section 69 of the Act
1959 is entitled to condone a delay in filing an appeal applying the provisions of
Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963?
4) Whether the statutory scheme of Act 1959 indicate that Section 5 of Limitation Act
is applicable to proceedings before its authorities?"
The Hon'ble Apex Court extensively dealt with the previous case laws on the subject wherein it has
been held that the provisions of the Limitation Act, is to be applied even for suit, appeal or
application under special/local law which is to be filed before the statutory authorities and tribunal.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court then noticed the judgment in the case of Town Municipal Council,
Athani Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Courts, Hubli (1969) 1 SCC 873: (AIR 1969 SC 1335),
Nityananda M. Joshi and others Vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India and others (1965) 2 SCC
199: (AIR 1970 SC 209), The Commissioner of Sales Tax Act, 1948, U.P. Lucknow Vs. M/s Parson
Tools and Plants, Kanpur Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 (1975) 4 SCC
22: (AIR 1975 SC 1039), The Kerala State Electricity Board, Trivandrum V. T.P. Kunhaliumma
(1976) 4 SCC 634: (AIR 1977 SC 282), Sakuru V. Tanaji (supra), Officer on Special Duty (Land
Acquisition) and another V. Shah Manilal Chandulal and others (1996) 9 SCC 414: ( 1996 AIR SCW
941), Consolidated Engineering Enterprises V. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and
others (2008) 7 SCC 169. These are the judgments in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court opined that
Section 3 and 29(2) of the Limitation Act will not apply to proceedings before the tribunal, to
appeals or applications before the tribunals, unless expressly provided. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 12
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
then said that the most elaborate judgment holding that the Limitation Act applies only to courts
and not to the tribunals is the judgment of this Court in M.P. Steel Corporation v. Commissioner of
Central Excise, 2015(7) SCC 58 which reviewed all earlier judgments of two-Judge and three-Judge
Benches of this Court and held in paragraph 39 as under:-
"39. The most elaborate judgment holding that the Limitation Act applies only to
courts and not to the tribunals is the judgment of this Court in M.P. Steel Corpn. v.
CCE [M.P. Steel Corpn. v. CCE, (2015) 7 SCC 58 : (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 510] . Rohinton
Fali Nariman, J. speaking for the Court reviewed all the earlier judgments of
two-Judge and three-Judge Benches of this Court. In paras 11 to 35 all the earlier
judgments have been considered. In the above case, the Commissioner of Customs
(Appeals) dismissed the appeal filed by the Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of
2017 dt.26-08-2019 appellant on the ground that the appeal is barred by time and the
Commissioner (Appeals) had no power to condone the delay beyond the period
specified in Section 128 of the Customs Act. In the above case, benefit of Section 14 of
the Limitation Act was sought. It was contended before this Court that while Section
2 of the Limitation Act, Section 14 of the Limitation Act was also applied to criminal,
special or local law. This Court noticed the ingredients of applicability of Section 14.
The two-Judge Bench has held relying on earlier judgments of this Court that
provisions of the Limitation Act are applicable only to suits, appeals and applications
filed in courts. Section 29(2) was also considered by this Court and the following was
laid down in para 33:
"33. ... Section 29(2) states:
'29. Savings.--(1)* ** (2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal
or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the
Schedule, the provisions of Section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period
prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of
limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law,
the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply only insofar as,
and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local
law.' A bare reading of this section would show that the special or local law described
therein should prescribe for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation
different from the period prescribed by the Schedule. This would necessarily mean
that such special or local law would have to lay down that the suit, appeal or
application to be instituted under it should be a suit, appeal or application of the
nature described in the Schedule. We have already held that such suits, appeals or
applications as are referred to in the Schedule are only to courts and not to quasi-
judicial bodies or tribunals. It is clear, therefore, that only when a suit, appeal or application of the
description in the Schedule is to be filed in a court under a special or local law that the provision gets
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 attracted. This is made even clearer by a
reading of Section 29(3). Section 29(3) states:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 13
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
'29. Savings.--(1)-(2)*** (3) Save as otherwise provided in any law for the time being
in force with respect to marriage and divorce, nothing in this Act shall apply to any
suit or other proceeding under any such law.' When it comes to the law of marriage
and divorce, the section speaks not only of suits but other proceedings as well. Such
proceedings may be proceedings which are neither appeals nor applications thus
making it clear that the laws relating to marriage and divorce, unlike the law of
limitation, may contain proceedings other than suits, appeals or applications filed in
courts. This again is an important pointer to the fact that the entirety of the
Limitation Act including Section 29(2) would apply only to the three kinds of
proceedings mentioned all of which are to be filed in courts."
The Hon'ble Apex Court thereafter found that in one set of cases, a three-judge Bench in the case of
Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. V. M/s. Madan Lal Das & Sons, Bareilly, (1976) 4 SCC 464 held
that Section 12(2) of the Limitation Act can be relied upon in computing the period of limitation
prescribed for filing the revision. The Hon'ble Apex Court in Ganeshan case found that the
revisional authority under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 was not a 'Court' and the earlier three-judge
Bench judgment of the Apex Court in the case of M/s Parson Tools and Plants was not brought to
the notice of the Hon'ble Bench of the Apex Court considering the case of M/s Madan Lal Das
(supra). For this reason in the case Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 of
Ganesan the Hon'ble Apex Court followed the earlier three- Judge Bench Judgment rendered in the
case of M/s Parson Tools and Plants (supra). The Hon'ble Apex Court held that the judgment of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Mukri Gopalan vs. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker (1995) 5
SCC 5 :(AIR 1995 SC 2272) was out of step with at least five earlier binding judgments of the Court
and it was not even square with the subsequent judgment in the case of Consolidated Engineering
Enterprises (supra). The Hon'ble Apex Court held that Parson Tools is an authority for the
proposition that the Limitation Act will not apply to quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals and to that
extent Mukri Gopalan was in conflict with the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Consolidated Engineering Enterprises and is no longer a good law. Having dealt with all the
previous case laws, in the Ganesan's case the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down the ratio of the
judgment of the three-Judge Bench as under:-
"54. The ratio which can be culled from above noted judgments, especially judgment
of three-Judge Benches, as noted above, is as follows:
(1) The suits, appeals and applications referred to in the Limitation Act, 1963 are
suits, appeals and applications which are to be filed in a Court.
(2) The suits, appeals and applications referred to in the Limitation Act are not the
suits, appeals and applications which are to be filed Patna High Court CWJC
No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 before a statutory authority like Commissioner
under Act, 1959.
(3) Operation of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act is confined to the suits, appeals
and applications referred to in a special or local law to be filed in Court and not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 14
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
before statutory authorities like Commissioner under Act, 1959.
(4) However, special or local law vide statutory scheme can make applicable any
provision of the Limitation Act or exclude applicability of any provision of Limitation
Act which can be decided only after looking into the scheme of particular, special or
local law.
55. We, thus, answer question nos.2 and 3 in the following manner:
(i) The applicability of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act is with regard to different
limitations prescribed for any suit, appeal or application when to be filed in a Court.
(ii) Section 29(2) cannot be pressed in service with regard to filing of suits, appeals
and applications before the statutory authorities and tribunals provided in a special
or local law. The Commissioner while hearing of the appeal under Section 69 of the
Act, 1959 is not entitled to condone the delay in filing appeal, since, provision of
Section 5 shall not be attracted by strength of Section 29(2) of the Act.
Question No.4
56. A special or local law can very well provide for applicability of any provision of Limitation Act or
exclude applicability of any provision of Limitation Act. The provisions of Limitation Act including
Section 5 can very well be applied in deciding an appeal by statutory authority which is not a Court
by the statutory scheme of special or local law. We, thus, need to notice the provisions of the Act,
1959 as to whether the scheme under Act, 1959 shows that enactment intended to apply Section 5 of
the Limitation Act."
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 In view of the discussions made
hereinabove, this Court would come to a conclusion that the Debts Recovery Tribunal admittedly
being a 'tribunal' and not a 'court' the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 cannot be applied to it
by virtue of sub- section(2) of Section 29 of the said Act unless special statute provides for
applicability of the same under the statutory scheme. Thus the present case is to be decided by
considering the statutory scheme of the Act of 1993 and that of the Act of 2002.
Judgment of the Hon'ble High Courts in India The Hon'ble Division Bench of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court had occasion to review the case laws of the different High Courts on the point
as to whether the Debts Recovery Tribunal has power to condone the delay in filing of the
application under Section 17 of the Act of 2002. Hon'ble Mr. Justice Hemant Gupta (as His Lordship
then was) in the case of Surinder Mahajan Vs. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal & Others in
C.W.P.No.22567 of 2011 (O&M) and Sat Narain Sharma Vs. Union of India & others decided on
05.04.2013 went through the judgments of the Hon'ble Division Bench of Bombay High Court in
UCO Bank Vs. Kanji Manji Kothari 2008 (3) Bankers' Journal 438 (Bombay) wherein the following
views were taken:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 15
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
In UCO Bank's case (supra), a Division Bench of Bombay High Court considered the
question as to what extent the Limitation Act is Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of
2017 dt.26-08-2019 applicable to the proceedings under Section 17 of the Act. The
Court held that Legislature has not excluded the application of the Limitation Act to
the applications made by the borrower or the aggrieved persons under Section 17 of
the Act. It was held as under:
71. Therefore, the Legislature has made two different provisions for the borrower and
the secured creditor so far as period of limitation is concerned. On a proper reading
of the NPA Act and the DRT Act, we are unable to come to a conclusion that this
indicates that the legislature has consciously excluded the application of the
Limitation Act to applications made by the borrower or the aggrieved person under
section 17 of the NPA Act.
xxx xxx xxx
73. Section 17(7) states that the DRT shall, as far as may be, dispose of the
applications in accordance with the DRT Act and the Rules made thereunder. Under
section 22 of the DRT Act, the DRT is not bound by the procedure laid down by the
Civil Procedure Code, but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice and shall
have power to regulate its own procedure. Under the said section, Debts Recovery
Tribunal, Maharashtra & Goa Regulations of Practice, 2003 have been enacted.
Under Regulation 3(7), "interlocutory application" inter alia means application for
condonation of delay.
74. Section 24 of the DRT Act states that the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963
shall, as far as may be, apply to an application made to a Tribunal. In Transcore's Vs.
Union of India AIR 2007 SC 712, the Supreme Court has, after considering the
statement of objects and reasons of the NPA Act, the scheme of the NPA Act and the
nature of its provisions, held that the enactment of NPA Act is not in derogation of
the DRT Act. Their object is recovery of debts by nonadjudicatory process and they
provide cumulative remedies to the secured creditor. In fact, section 37 of the NPA
Act states that the provisions of the NPA Act shall be in addition to and not
inderogation to the DRT Act. If we examine the relevant provisions of the NPA Act
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 and the observations of the
Supreme Court in Transcore's case (supra), the conclusion is irresistible that section
5 of the Limitation Act is applicable to the NPA Act. There is no express exclusion of
the Limitation Act. So far as borrower's applications under section 17(1) are
concerned, a different period of limitation is prescribed. Hence, on a bare reading of
section 29 (2), section 5 of the Limitation Act would be applicable to them. So far as
the secured creditor is concerned, he can take measures under section 13(4) within
the period prescribed under the Limitation Act. Though section 35 gives overriding
effect to the NPA Act, section 37 states that application of other laws is not barred
and the NPA Act is in addition to DRT Act and not in derogation thereof. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 16
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
important to note that under section 17(7), the DRT has to dispose of the applications
in accordance with the DRT Act and the rules made thereunder and section 24 of the
DRT Act makes provisions of the Limitation Act applicable to the application before
the DRT. Since after considering the scheme, provisions and object of the NPA Act,
the NPA Act and the DRT Act are held complementary to each other by the Supreme
Court in Transcore's case (supra)...."
Again in the case of Punnusamy & another Vs. the Debts Recovery Tribunal 2009 (3) Bankers'
Journal 401 (Madras) the views expressed by the learned single Judge of the Madras High Court has
been quoted and the same reads as under:-
"36. Therefore, it is clear that Section 5 would apply even to some types of
applications, though it may not apply to suits. The proceedings before the D.R.T.
under Section 17 of SRFAESI Act, though original in nature, should be treated as
applications and not strictly like suits. Therefore, the provisions of Section 5 of the
Limitation Act, in my considered view, would apply to applications under Section 17
of SRFAESI Act. Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 But the
same logic cannot be extended to applications filed under Section 19 of RDDBFI Act,
1993, since Section 24 of RDDBFI Act, 1993 makes the provisions of the Limitation
Act, 1963 applicable to an application under the Act, meaning thereby that an
application under Section 19 of RDDBFI Act, 1993 is to be treated as a suit."
Similarly, the Hon'ble Division Bench took note of the Division Bench judgment of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No.22317 of 2012 (Sajida Begum Vs. State Bank of India &
others) decided on 04.09.2012 which held as under:-
"12. In view of that, we are of the view that Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act is
clearly attracted and thereby Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) of the Limitation Act would
be applicable to proceedings under Sections 17 and 18 of the SARFAESI Act before
the DRT as well as DRAT. Consequently, therefore, the order impugned passed by the
DRAT rejecting the petitioner's application for condonation of delay for want of
jurisdiction is liable to be set aside."
The Hon'ble Division Bench then referred the learned Single Judge judgment of the Allahabad High
Court in the case of State Bank of Patiala Vs. Chairperson, Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal,
Allahand and others (AIR 2012 Allahabad 1) in which the UCO Bank's judgment of the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court has been relied upon.
The another learned single Judge judgment of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Chairperson,
Debts Recovery Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Appellate Tribunal has
been taken note of and the observations made thereunder have been quoted as under:-
"As observed earlier, even if the contention of the learned counsel is considered and
accepted that it is a Tribunal and not the Court as per the view taken by the Apex
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 17
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
Court in the case of Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. Vs. Hong Kong and Sanghai
Banking Corporation 2009 (8) SCC 646, then also in view of the observations made
hereinabove, it cannot be accepted that Section 5 of the Limitation Act would not
apply to the proceedings under Section 17 of the Securitisation Act before the Debt
Recovery Tribunal. The reliance upon the decision of the Apex Court in the case of
Consolidated Engineering Enterprises Vs. principal Secretary, Irrigation Department
2008 (7) SCC 169 is ill- founded inasmuch the observations off the Apex Court are to
be considered and applied to the facts of that case. If such observation are
considered, what is being held by the Apex Court that if there is express period
prescribed in the special law, such would apply and not the prescription as provided
under the Limitation Act, but the same cannot be read in absolute so as to excluded
the applicability of other provisions of the Limitation Act which may apply, more
particularly in view of the no express bar provided under the special law. Therefore,
such a decision is of no help to the learned counsel for the petitioner."
The Hon'ble Division Bench then found that only judgment which takes a different view is that of
Hon'ble Kolkata High Court in the case of Akshat Commercial Pvt. Ltd's case.
"22. On the same analogy, the proceedings under Section 17(1) should also be Patna
High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 treated as a suit and thus, Section
5 of the Limitation Act at least does not apply to such proceedings although other
relevant provisions of the said Act may apply.
23. So far as the Division Bench decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Uco
Bank Vs. M/s Kanji Manji Kothari & Co. & others reported in 2008 (1) Bank CLR 773
is concerned, which was strongly relied upon by Mr. Chatterjee, the learned senior
advocate appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner, we find that the Division Bench
in the said case did not take note of the aforesaid decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of Gopal Sardar Vs. Karuna Sardar (2004) 4 SCC 252 as also the point as to
whether a proceeding under Section 17(1) of the SARFAESI Act should be treated to
be suit for the purpose of application of 21 Section 5 of the Limitation Act. Therefore,
the said decision cannot be relied as a precedent in the facts of the present case."
The Hon'ble Division Bench then looked into the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Mardia
Chemicals Ltd. & Others Vs. Union of India Others (2004) 4 SCC 311 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme
Court observed that the proceedings under Section 17 of the Act of 2002 are not appellate
proceedings. It is in fact initial action which is brought before a forum as prescribed under the Act,
raising grievance against the action and measures taken by one of the parties to the contract. It was
held that it is stage of initial proceeding like filing a suit in civil court. The same is quoted hereunder
for a ready reference:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 "We may like to observe
that proceedings under Section 17 of the Act, in fact, are not appellate proceedings. It
seems to be a misnomer. In fact it is the initial action which is brought before a forum
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 18
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
as prescribed under the Act, raising grievance against the action or measures taken
by one of the parties to the contract. It is the stage of initial proceeding like filing a
suit in civil court. As a matter of fact proceedings under Section 17 of the Act are in
lieu of a civil suit which remedy is ordinarily available but for the bar under Section
34 of the Act in the present case."
Thereafter the Hon'ble Division Bench relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur Vs. State of Maharashtra (1994) 4 SCC
602, T. Kalimurthi Vs. Five Gori Thaikkal Wakf (2008) 9 SCC 306 and Thirumalai
Chemicals Limited Vs. Union of India (2011) 6 SCC 379 to reiterate that the law
relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature and the law of limitation
being a procedural law is retrospective in operation and will apply to proceedings
pending at the time of the enactment as also to proceedings commenced thereafter.
The Hon'ble Division Bench in its concluding paragraph held as under:-
"In the present set of cases, the right given to the secured creditor under the Act is
not a complete code. The right given to the secured creditor under the Act is in
addition to the rights conferred on the secured creditor in terms of Section 37 of the
Act. Such right is in addition to many statutes including the 1993 Act. In fact, Section
17(7) and 18(2) of the Act, prescribes the Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017
dt.26-08-2019 procedure before the Tribunal as that under the 1993 Act. The
Limitation Act is extended to the proceedings under the said Act, while treating an
application to be filed under Section 19 of the said Act as a suit. Therefore, the
inference that the limitation Act stands excluded in respect of the proceedings under
the Act is not permissible to be drawn.
Therefore, in the absence of any provision under the Act excluding the applicability of
the Limitation Act to the proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal under
Section 17 or before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal under Section 18 of the
Act, an application for condonation of delay would be maintainable before the
Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal. Therefore, we respectfully agree with the view of
the Andhra Pradesh and Bombay High Court and unable to agree with the view
expressed by Calcutta High Court.
In view of the above, we hold that:
(i) The remedy provided to any person including a borrower under Section 17 of the
Act is in response to the actions and measures taken by the secured creditor through
an application which is in the nature of objections to the action taken by the secured
creditor.
(ii) The provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act are applicable to the
proceedings to be initiated by any person aggrieved including a borrower before the
Debt Recovery Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 19
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
(iii) The provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act are applicable to an
appeal to be preferred against an order passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal before
the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal under Section 18 of the Act.
(iv) Whether sufficient cause is disclosed to seek condonation of delay, is a question
of fact to be determined by the Debt Recovery Tribunal and/or the Debt Recovery
Appellate Tribunal in the facts of each case.
In the light of the findings above, the order dated 23.09.2011 passed by the Debts Recovery
Appellate Tribunal in CWP No.22567 of Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019
2011 is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the Appellate Tribunal to decide the appeal on
merits. The orders dated 31.05.2011 and 19.09.2011 in CWP No.17894 of 2011 are also set aside and
the matter is remitted to the Debt Recovery Tribunal to decide the application for condonation of
delay afresh on merits in accordance with the observations made hereinbefore."
Having discussed the aforesaid judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court and that of the Hon'ble
Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dealing with all previous case laws on the
subject laying down the views expressed by the different High Courts, this Court is of the considered
opinion that by virtue of sub-section (7) of Section 17 of the Act of 2002 an application under
Section 17(1) has to be disposed off in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1993 and the
rules made thereunder. The procedures for dealing with an application under the Act of 1993 are
provided under Chapter IV with the heading of the Chapter as "Procedures of Tribunals". Section 19
to Section 24 of the Act of 1993 are falling under Chapter IV of the Act of 1993. By virtue of Section
24 the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 have been made applicable to an application made to a
tribunal. The word "application" has been defined under Section 2(b) to mean and understand an
application under Section
19. The meaning of the word application as envisaged under Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of
2017 dt.26-08-2019 Section 2(b) of the Act of 1993 is not an issue and the only thing which this
Court is required to consider is as to whether the same procedures which are applicable to an
application under Section 19 read with Section 2(b) of the Act of 1993 will be applicable in respect of
an application under Section 17 (1)of the Act of 2002. By virtue of sub-section (7) of Section 17 there
would be no difficulty in answering this issue because it is crystal clear that the entire provisions
right from Section 19 to Section 24 of the Act of 1993 would as far as may be applicable in respect of
an application under sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the Act of 2002. Any departure from this
position will render sub-section(7) of Section 17 of the Act of 2002 redundant in the eye of law.
To this court it appears that the view taken by Hon'ble Division Bench that an application under
Section 17(1) of the Act of 2002 is in the nature of objections to the action taken by the Bank is
required to be followed.
It is well settled rule of interpretation of Statute that a provision of law should be given it's literal
meaning unless the same gives rise to an absurdity. This Court finds no absurdity in giving effect to
sub-section(7) of Section 17 of the Act of 2002 by taking a view that it adopts the procedure
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 20
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
prescribed under the Act of 1993 for disposal of an application under Section 17(1) in the Patna High
Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 same way as those provisions of the Act of 1993 apply
to the application under Section 19 of the said Act. Even a purposive interpretation would lead this
Court to the same conclusion. Section 35 of the Act of 2002 makes it clear that provisions of this Act
shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the
time being in force. This Court takes a view that a reading of Section 17 with various sub-sections
and scheme of the Act of 2002 and that of Sections 19 to 24 of the Act of 1993 would lead to a
conclusion that there is no inconsistency in the provisions of the Act of 2002 and the Act of 1993
rather inconsistency would arise if a view is taken otherwise saying that the provision of Section 24
of the Act of 1993 would not apply in respect of an application under Section 17(1) of the Act of
2002. This Court say so because while providing for a specific period of limitation for filing an
application under Section 17(1) of the Act of 2002 the legislatures did not expressly exclude the
applicability of the Limitation Act rather knowing fully well that Section 24 of the Act of 1993
provides for applicability of the Limitation Act in relation to an application under the said Act went
on to legislate that the Debts Recovery Tribunal shall as far as may be dispose off application in
accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1993. The real import of sub-section(7) of Section 17 of
the Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Act of 2002 is thus in favour of the
applicability of the Limitation Act being a procedural law by virtue of Section 24 of the Act of 1993
falling under Chapter IV of the said Act.
Now this court would proceed to consider the impugned order whereby the learned Presiding
Officer, Debts Recovery Tribunal, Patna has allowed the application preferred by respondent no.3
and has condoned the delay. The reasoning and rationale provided in the impugned order for
condonation of delay are recorded as under:
"8. The present SARFAESI application has been filed by the applicant on 6.3.2017, in
compliance of the judgment dated 14.02.2017, passed by the Hon'ble High Court of
Patna in CWJC No. 15510 if 2015 and he directions of the Hon'ble High Court of
Patna reads as under-
"In such view of the matter, this court directs the present petitioner to approach the
Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Patna under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. If
the petitioner approaches the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Patna, within four
weeks from today, the Tribunal will be obliged to look into the claim of the petitioner
and pass appropriate order in accordance with law without being influenced by the
earlier orders passed by this Court. The Tribunal, while considering the Limitation
Petition, will take into consideration the fact that the petitioner was not made a party
in any proceeding in the past as he has submitted that he has not received any notice.
It is clarified that this Court is not giving any opinion on the merit of the case."
9. During the course of arguments, ld. Counsel of auction purchaser has objected that the applicant
was well aware Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 about the SARFAESI
Action since 24.10.2014, however, the letter dated 24.10.2014 has already been considered by the
Hon'ble High Court of Patna in the said writ and thereafter, the direction was given to hear the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 21
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
matter on merit, the applicant has filed the SARFAESI application on 6.3.2017, which is within four
weeks from the judgment dated 14.02.2017, as directed by Hon'ble High Court of Patna.
10. In that view of the matter and having regard to the judgments of Hon'ble High Court of Patna, as
cited by ld. Counsel of applicant, the delay, if any, in filing the SA is condoned."
It appears that the Debts Recovery Tribunal was of the view that once the Hon'ble High Court
passed an order in the writ application after considering the letter dated 24.10.2014 and a direction
has been issued to the Tribunal to hear the matter on merit and that the applicant had filed the
SARFAESI application within four weeks from the date of the judgment and order of the Hon'ble
High Court, the delay is to be condoned regard being had to the judgment of the Hon'ble High
Court. The judgment of the High Court in the writ petition is available on the record. The relevant
part of the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 15510 of 2015 may be found in
paragraph '8' of the judgment which reads as under:
-
"8. In such view of the matter, this Court directs the present petitioner to approach
the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Patna under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act.
If the petitioner approaches the Debt Recovery Appellate Patna High Court CWJC
No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 Tribunal, Patna, within four weeks from today, the
Tribunal will be obliged to look into the claim of the petitioner and pass appropriate
order in accordance with law without being influenced by the earlier orders passed by
this Court. The Tribunal, while considering the Limitation Petition, will take into
consideration the fact that the petitioner was not made a party in any proceeding in
the past as he has submitted that he has not received any notice. It is clarified that
this Court is not giving any opinion on the merit of the case."
In it's judgment, the learned writ court had noticed that the auction purchaser (the present
petitioner) had approached this court for handing over the property by filing CWJC No. 19421/2012
in which the present respondent no. 3 was not impleaded, therefore, an observation has been given
in paragraph '4' of the judgment that the order passed by the writ court in CWJC No. 19421/2012
cannot be said to have the binding effect.
As regards the plea of the present respondent no. 3 that he had not received any notice under
Section 13(2) of the Act of 2002, it is apparent that the Hon'ble Writ Court has not recorded any
finding and only observation that has been made is "If that be so, the entire proceeding will vitiate."
To this Court, it appears that while considering the limitation petition the Tribunal had to take into
consideration these submissions, but because the Hon'ble High Court had not given any finding or
opinion on the merit of the plea, therefore, the Tribunal is not correct in giving observation in
paragraph '9' of the impugned order passed in SA No. 44/2017 that letter dated 24.10.2014 had
already been considered by the Hon'ble High Court, and thereafter the direction was Patna High
Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 given to hear the matter on merit. It appears that the
Tribunal has not considered the limitation petition independently keeping in view the direction on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130977117/ 22
Rahmatullah vs The Authorized Officer Cum Chief ... on 26 August, 2019
it's own merit.
Since the impugned order lacks an independent consideration it is liable to be set aside and is
accordingly set aside. The matter is remitted to the Presiding Officer, Debts Recovery Tribunal,
Patna for a fresh consideration of the limitation petition keeping in view the observation of this
court in CWJC No. 15510/2015.
The plea of the petitioner with reference to the order dated 12.07.2018 passed in LPA No. 735/2018
is concerned, this Court finds that in LPA No. 735/2018 the Hon'ble Division Bench (to which I was
a member) has only taken note of the submissions of the petitioner- appellant and observed that the
Tribunal is bound to follow the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and without being
influenced by the impugned direction of the writ court to decide the limitation etc. shall proceed to
decide the question of limitation in accordance with law. By the date L.P.A. was filed and heard, the
Tribunal had already disposed of the Limitation Petition and the petitioner had challenged the same
in the present writ petition. It appears that present respondent no. 3 was not noticed in the Letters
Patent Appeal and the Hon'ble Division Bench was given to understand that the Tribunal has yet to
pass an order. For this absence of information, in course of hearing the Hon'ble Division Bench
Patna High Court CWJC No.17999 of 2017 dt.26-08-2019 gave an observation that while deciding
the application for condonation of delay the Tribunal would be bound to follow the law laid down by
Hon'ble Supreme Court without being influenced by the direction of the writ court however the
Hon'ble Division Bench did not set-aside the order of the writ court. Once this court, after
discussing the various case laws on the subject has decided the issue of competence of the Tribunal
to condone the delay in the matter of an application under Section 17(1) of the Act of 2002, the
Tribunal will proceed to decide the Limitation Petition by taking an independent exercise and shall
dispose of the limitation petition within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt/production of a
copy of this order.
The Writ Application is allowed to the extent indicated hereinabove.
