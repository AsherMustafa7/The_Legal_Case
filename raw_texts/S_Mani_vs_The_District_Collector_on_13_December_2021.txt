ORDER
This Writ Petition has been filed for issuance of Writ of Declaration declaring that the land
acquisition notification No.Rcc.65361/1997/DB dated 31.12.1997 issued by the first respondent
published at page No.2 of Salem District Gazette Extraordinary No.II, dated 17.01.1998 in sofar as
the petitioners lands comprised in S.Nos.68/4A1, 68/4A2A, 68/1A2B and 68/1A2C of Chinnamanli
Village, Edappadi Taluk, Salem District and the consequential actions taken thereon are lapsed as
per Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
2. Heard, Mr.N.Manokaran, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and Mr.C.Kathiravan,
learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents.
3. The case of the petitioner is that on the request made by the Arunthathiyars of
Veerappampalayam Village, the second respondent acquired the lands comprised in survey No.68
sub divided as 68/4A1, 68/4A2A, 68/4A2B and 68/4A2C. The second respondent, by the notice
dated https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 29.11.1995 in Form I of Rule 3(1) of the Tamil Nadu
Acquisition of Lands for Harijan Welfare Schemes Rules, 1979, informed that the properties are
proposed to be acquired for the purpose of provision of houses to Arunthathiars of
Veerappampalayam, a hamlet of Chinnamanali Village, thereby the petitioners were calling upon to
raise their objections within a period of fifteen days. An enquiry was conducted by the second
respondent on 22.12.1995. The petitioners had sent their objections stating that their families were
staying in the lands proposed to be acquired and that already an extent of 2.00 acres has been
acquired for the very same purpose. It is further stated that there are poramboke lands available in
and around the said village and as such, they requested the second respondent to drop the
acquisition proceedings in respect of their lands.
4. The second respondent issued another notice dated 10.07.1997 in Form I under Rule 3 of the
Rules, 1979. Accordingly, the petitioners raised their objections on 26.07.1997 and also appeared for
enquiry on 31.07.1997, but no enquiry has been conducted. Thereafter, the petitioner was duly
served with notice dated 13.03.1998 in Form III as contemplated under Section 5(1) of the Tamil
Nadu Acquisition of lands for Harijan Welfare Schemes Rules so as to appear for an enquiry for
fixing of compensation. Thereafter, notice under https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Section 4(1) of
the Tamil Nadu Act 31 of 1978 was published in the Salem District Gazette dated 17.01.1998.
5. The petitioner also challenged the acquisition proceedings in W.P.No.5463 of 1998 and it was
allowed on 11.08.2004. The Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in W.A.No.1623 of 2006 set aside
the learned Single Judge order and confirmed the acquisition proceedings. It is also confirmed by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP No.29551 of 2009 on 23.11.2009. Thereafter, an award was
passed on 23.03.1998 in Award No.12/97-98.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that however no compensation has been
paid to the petitioners even today. They are also in physical possession and enjoyment of the subject
property. Therefore, the entire acquisition proceeding is as contemplated under Section 24(2) of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83014490/ 2
S. Mani vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement
Act, 2013 .
7. The second respondent filed a counter stating that the petitioners
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis challenged the acquisition proceedings upheld by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India. Subsequently the subject lands were taken possession by the second
respondent as early as on 17.11.2009. In fact, after taking physical possession of the subject land, the
petitioners preferred Special Leave Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and it was
also dismissed by an order dated 23.11.2009. That apart, house site pattas were issued to the
Arunthathiyars as early as on 23.11.2009. The writ petition has been filed after a period of 17 years
from the date of award under Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Insofar as the compensation award
amount is concerned, it was already deposited before the Sub Court, Sankari as early as on
31.03.1998. Therefore, the petitioner failed to fulfill the twin conditions as contemplated under
Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 .
8. In this regard, the learned counsel for the respondents relied upon a Judgment reported in 2020
8 SCC 129 in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and others etc, wherein it is
held as follows:
366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis questions as under:
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2016 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue
as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of 1894 as if it
has not been repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of authorities for
five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has
not been taken nor compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession
has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly, if
compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not
include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is
provided in proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83014490/ 3
S. Mani vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of
notification for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis land acquisition under Section 4 of
the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of
the Act of 2013. In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of
1894 has not been fulfilled, interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted.
Non-deposit of compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land
acquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit with respect to the majority of
holdings for five years or more, compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to
the "landowners" as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of
the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section
31(1) of the Act of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed
under Section 24(2) due to non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court.
The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land
owners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought reference for higher
compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section
24(2) not part of Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under
Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has been
passed on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis taking possession under Section 16 of the
Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under Section 24(2)
of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section
24(2).
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are
applicable in case authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and
pay compensation for five years or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a
proceeding for land acquisition pending with concerned authority as on 1.1.2016. The
period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has to be excluded in the
computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to
question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies
to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2016.
It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded
proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking
possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury
instead of court to invalidate acquisition.

9. In view of the settled position of law, this Court is of the considered view that the writ petition is
liable to be dismissed as devoid of merits. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis However, the learned
counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioners are in physical possession and
enjoyment of the subject property. Therefore, the petitioners are at liberty to make a representation
for re- conveyance of the land in the manner know to law.
10. In the result, the writ petition stands dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition
is closed. No costs.
