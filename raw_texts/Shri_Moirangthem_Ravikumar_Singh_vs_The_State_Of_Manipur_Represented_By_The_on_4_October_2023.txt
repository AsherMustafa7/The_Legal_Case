Date of Hearing and reserving Judgment & Order :: 30.08.2023 Date of Judgment & Order ::
04.10.2023 JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV) This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner for
issuance of writ of certiorarified mandamus to quash the (i) impugned proceedings of the DPC
meeting held on 23.12.2021 for promotion to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police (Male/Civil) so far
as the DPC proceedings relates to promotion under the 15% out- of-turn category; (ii) impugned
order dated 24.12.2021 insofar as appointments on promotion as Sub-Inspector of Police
(Male/Civil) in the Police Department, Manipur under the 15% out-of-turn category are concerned
and to direct the official respondents to appoint the petitioner to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police
(Male/Civil) in the Manipur Police Department on promotion under Page |7 the 15% out-of-turn
category based on his medals and achievements w.e.f. 24.12.2019 by convening a review DPC.
2. Brief facts are as follows:
The petitioner was appointed as Assistant Sub-
Inspector of Police (Male/Civil) on direct recruitment on 4.2.2015.
Since the appointment, the petitioner has been serving with great dedication and
devotion to his duty and to the entire satisfaction of the higher officials without any
adverse remarks till date. The petitioner has been awarded DGP's Commendation
Roll with Disc on 19.10.2017 and also awarded a Good Service Mark vide order dated
4.10.2018 issued by the DGP, Manipur. The petitioner is also a meritorious
sportsperson in the field of Taekwondo. While serving as Assistant Sub-Inspector of
Police (ASI), the petitioner was selected to represent the State of Manipur in the 39th
National Taekwondo Championship, 2019. In the National Taekwondo
Championship in the Individual Senior Male Poomsae Event, the petitioner won gold
medal representing the State of Manipur. In view of the achievements, the petitioner
had a legitimate expectation for getting promotion to the next higher post under the
Recruitment Rules of Sub-Inspector of Police (SI of Police).
Page |8 2.1. The Director General of Police, Manipur had issued Standing Order
No.189 dated 15.4.2021 to the effect that the achievements in sports shall be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 5
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
applicable only to those sports/game disciplines/events which are recognized by the
All India Police Sports Control Board (AIPSCB) and that too at the International or
National/Zonal Level.
2.2. The All India Police Games Rules came into force with effect from 1.12.2012 and
Rule 5 therein provides the events included in the All India Police Games and the
event of Taekwondo is included in the All India Judo Cluster under Rule 5(a)(v)(4).
In other words, Taekwondo is a sports/discipline recognized by the AIPSSCB. In view
of his achievements, the petitioner is eligible to be considered for promotion to the
post of SI of Police under the 15% out-of-turn category in terms of the Recruitment
Rules.
2.3. While so, vide impugned order dated 24.12.2021, as many as 134 ASI's have been
appointed on promotion to the post of SI of Police in order of merit with immediate
effect on the recommendation of a Class-II DPC meeting held on 23.12.2021, which
includes 23 appointments on promotions under the 15% out-
of-turn category. On perusal of the order dated 24.12.2021, the petitioner has reason to believe that
several illegalities and Page |9 irregularities have been committed by the DPC in its meeting held on
23.12.2021 for consideration for promotion of ASI to SI of Police as several officers among the 23
appointees are not recipients of either category of medals.
2.4. The officers appointed at Serial Nos.119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133
and 134 are not the recipients of any gallantry medal or sports medal. The officers who are only
recipients of Good Service Marks cannot be recommended by the DGP for promotion under the 15%
out-of-turn category and their consideration and recommendation by the DPC for appointment on
promotion as SI of Police is illegal, arbitrary and against the provisions of the relevant Recruitment
Rules. 2.5. The achievements of other appointees mentioned at Serial Nos.112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117,
118, 120, 127 and 130 under the 15% out-of-turn category are highly suspicious and doubtful as there
are illegalities committed in the impugned DPC proceedings. When the petitioner has filed RTI
application seeking certain information relevant to the DPC proceedings, the same has been rejected
by the Police Department.
2.6. The impugned proceedings of the DPC meeting held on 23.12.2021 and the impugned order
dated 24.12.2021 are in P a g e | 10 violation of the order dated 22.12.2021 passed in WP(C) No.926
of 2021. The ineligible persons have been considered for promotion under the 15% out-of-turn
category, while the petitioner who is eligible for promotion has been illegally left out and deprived of
his rightful opportunity for promotion to the post of SI of Police. Such arbitrary act of the
respondent authorities is violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under
Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. Hence, the writ petition.
3. The respondents 1 and 2 filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that Schedule-A of Recruitment Rule
of SI of Police has been superseded by the notification dated 17.12.2009. The DGP in order to
streamline the system of out-of-turn promotion in respect of police personnel in the Manipur Police

Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
Department for promotion to Inspector of Police (Male/Female-Civil), Subedar, Sub-Inspector of
Police (Male/Female), Jemadar Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police (Male/Female-Civil), Havildar,
Head Constable (Male-Civil) and Head Constable (Female-Civil) issued Standing Order No.189
dated 15.4.2021 with the approval of the Home Department. In the Standing Order No.189, Good
Service Marks are taken into account for awarding 1 mark per Good Service Mark (GSM) with
maximum limit of 25 Good Service Marks.
P a g e | 11 3.1. It is stated that Taekwondo fighting is recognized by AIPSCB, however, its sub-event
Poomsae is not recognized by AIPSCB. In respect of the petitioner, only one GSM is taken into
account for consideration under the 15% out-of-turn promotion in the DPC. The gold medal in the
sub-event Poomsae was not considered in the DPC as the Screening Committee had excluded the
medal due to non-recognition by the AIPSCB. Hence, prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
4. The third respondent/MPSC filed affidavit-in- opposition stating that no certificate or relevant
documents have been produced to show that the petitioner had won gold medal representing the
State of Manipur in the National Taekwondo Championship before the DPC in its meeting held on
23.12.2021 in connection with the appointment by promotion from ASI to SI of Police. In the
Standing Order issued by the DGP, the methodology of awarding marks applicable to all out-of-turn
promotions is provided at Para C(1) wherein GSM is mentioned as awarded by the DGP and carried
1 mark per GSM with a maximum limit of 25 GSMs.
4.1 It is stated that when the Deputy Secretary (Home) wrote a proposal letter dated 15.12.2021 to
the MPSC for promotion P a g e | 12 from ASI to SI of Police (Male/Civil), the name of the petitioner
was appeared in the recommended list of ASI in order of seniority for consideration under the 15%
category by the DPC at Serial No.91 of the seniority list. Pursuant to the proposal, the MPSC held
DPC on 23.12.2021 for the total vacancies of 154 out of which 23 were under 15% out-of-turn quota
promotion. The Committee after examining the achievements furnished by the Administrative
Department along with the Integrity Certificates recommended 23 ASI for promotion to SI of Police
wherein the name of the petitioner was not included, as the petitioner had achieved only 1 GSM and
scored 1 point. The last recommended ASI under out-of-turn promotion in the above said DPC,
namely respondent No.26 had achieved 3 GSM and scored 3 points which is much higher than the
petitioner and more meritorious in terms of the achievements for the out-of-turn promotion.
Therefore, there is no illegality or irregularity in the DPC proceedings. Hence, prayed for dismissal
of the writ petition.
5. The private respondents filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that on the recommendation of the
DPC meeting held on 23.12.2021 in association with the MPSC, the Deputy Secretary (Home),
issued an order dated 24.12.2021 in the name of Governor thereby appointing the private
respondents as SI of Police P a g e | 13 (Male/Civil) under the 15% out-of-turn promotion quota.
However, the petitioner has filed the present writ petition for quashing the order dated 24.12.2021
insofar as it relates to the appointment on promotion to the post of SI of Police in the Police
Department under the 15% out-of-turn promotion quota.

Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
5.1. It is stated that the private respondents were eligible for consideration for promotion to the post
of SI of Police under the 15% out-of-turn promotion quota and the DPC had considered all the
relevant documents including the ACRs of all the promotes including the private respondents in the
meeting held on 23.12.201. The DPC while recommending the names of the private respondents had
perused all the documents including the ACRs which were placed before them.
5.2. It is further stated that the petitioner had never participated any tournament in the discipline of
Taekwondo conducted by the AIPSCB. Further, the petitioner has not produced any document to
show that he is an outstanding player/sportsperson recognised by AIPSCB. The event Poomsae is
not yet organized in any All India Police Meet/Championship by the Board. As such, any medal in
that event cannot be considered for the purpose of promotion. Since the petitioner is not qualified P
a g e | 14 for promotion to the post of SI of Police, he has no locus to file the writ petition challenging
the promotion of the private respondents. Hence, prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
6. Assailing the impugned proceedings of the DPC meeting held on 23.12.2021 for promotion to the
post of SI of Police (Male/Civil) relating to promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category and the
appointment orders dated 24.12.2021 thereby appointing the private respondents as SI of Police on
promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category, Mr. N. Zequeson, the learned counsel for the
petitioner submitted that the petitioner has been serving as ASI from 4.2.2015 i.e. for more than
eight years on regular basis. He won a gold medal representing the State of Manipur in National
Taekwondo Championship, which is a sports discipline recognized by the AIPSCB and his
participation therein had also been approved by the DGP, Manipur. In view of the achievements, the
petitioner is eligible to be considered for promotion to the post of SI of Police in the Manipur Police
Department under the 15% out-of-turn category in terms of the Recruitment Rules.
7. Mr. N. Zequeson, the learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that, vide impugned
order dated 24.12.2021, as P a g e | 15 many as 134 ASIs have been appointed on promotion to the
post of SI of Police in order of merit with immediate effect on the recommendation of DPC meeting
held on 23.12.2021, which includes 23 appointments on promotion under the 15% out-of-turn
category. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, there are illegalities and irregularities
committed by the DPC in its meeting held on 23.12.2021 for consideration of promotion to the post
of SI of Police (Male/Civil) as several officers among the 23 appointees are not the recipients of
either category of medals.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that respondents 11, 13 to 21 and 23 to 26
are not the recipients of any gallantry medal or sports medal, however, they have been considered
for appointment on promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category.
9. Drawing this Court's attention to Rule 43(1) and (2) of Part-III of the Assam Police Manual, the
learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that for recommendation by the DGP for appointment
by promotion under the 15 out-of-turn category to the post of SI of Police, there is no room for
taking into consideration the GSM awarded to the officers as the same has not been expressly
provided in the Recruitment Rules. Thus, the P a g e | 16 respondents 11, 13 to 21 and 23 to 26 who
are only the recipients of GSM and they cannot be recommended by the DGP for promotion under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 8
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
the 15% out-of-turn category in terms of the relevant Recruitment Rules and their consideration and
recommendation by the DPC for appointment on promotion to the post of SI of Police is illegal,
arbitrary and against the provisions of the Recruitment Rules.
10. It is also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the achievements of the
other appointees found at Serial Nos.112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 127 and 130 in the
impugned DPC proceedings under the 15% out-of-turn category is highly suspicious and the said
persons cannot be considered for appointment on promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category.
Since the ineligible persons have been considered for promotion under the 15% out-of-turn
category, while the petitioner who is eligible for promotion is left out, the impugned proceedings of
the DPC meeting held on 23.12.2021 and the consequential appointment order dated 24.12.2021 are
liable to be set aside and the petitioner should be considered for promotion to the post of SI of Police
under the 15% out-of-turn category for the achievements done by him.
P a g e | 17
11. Per contra, Mr. Sh. Shyam Sharma, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the
respondent State submitted that though Taekwondo fighting is recognised by the AIPSCB, its
sub-event Poomsae is not recognised by the AIPSCB. He would submit that as stipulated in the
Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021, GSMs are taken into account for awarding 1 mark per GSM
with maximum limit of 25 GSMs. In respect of the petitioner, only 1 GSM is taken into account for
consideration under the 15% out-of-turn promotion in the DPC. The gold medal in the sub-event
Poomsae was not considered in the DPC as the Screening Committee has excluded the said medal
due to non- recognition by the AIPSCB. The illegalities and irregularities in the proceedings of DPC
pleaded by the petitioner are concocted. Only taking into consideration the achievements of the
candidates, namely the private respondents, the impugned appointment orders in respect of the 15%
out-of-turn category have been issued. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the writ petition.
12. Mr. RS Reisang, the learned senior counsel for the Manipur Public Service Commission (MPSC)
submitted that the petitioner has achieved only 1 GSM and scored 1 point, whereas the last
recommended ASI under out-of-turn category promotion in the above said DPC had achieved 3
GSMs and scored 3 points, P a g e | 18 which is much higher than the petitioner and more
meritorious in terms of the achievements for the out-of-turn promotion. The learned senior counsel
would submit that though the name of the petitioner was provided in the recommended list of ASI
as issued by the DGP for promotion to the post of SI of Police in order of seniority for consideration
under the 15% out-of-turn category by the DPC, since the petitioner has not fulfilled the criteria, the
DPC has not considered his name. There were no lapses or irregularities in the above said DPC
proceedings, as the DPC had recommended only the eligible and more meritorious incumbents for
promotion under the 15% out-of-turn quota, which is purely merit based irrespective of seniority as
per the relevant Recruitment Rules.
13. The learned senior counsel for the MPSC added that GSMs are awarded by the DGP. Moreover,
in the Recruitment Rules, it is provided that 15% of the promotion quota shall be filled from ASIs
having satisfactorily completed the probation and who have been recommended by the DGP for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 9
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
promotion by reason of their conspicuous acts of gallantry in discharge of official duties or who are
outstanding sportsman recognized by the AIPSCB with two years regular service in the grade. The
GSM awarded by the DGP considered as awards vide the Standing Order No.189, dated 15.4.2021.
P a g e | 19
14. Supporting the decision taken in the impugned DPC proceedings and the appointment orders,
Mr. S. Biswajit, the learned senior counsels for the private respondents submit that on the
recommendation made by the DPC in its meeting held on 23.12.2021, the impugned order dated
24.12.2021 has been issued thereby appointing the private respondents as SI of Police under the 15%
out-of-turn category. The private respondents were eligible for consideration for promotion to the
post of SI of Police under the 15% out-of-turn category and the DPC had considered the relevant
documents and ACRs of all the promotees, including the private respondents in the meeting held on
23.12.2021. Only upon perusing the achievements done by the private respondents and the other
related documents, the DPC had recommended the names of the private respondents for
appointment on promotion to the post of SI of Police under the 15% out-of-turn category.
15. The learned senior counsels for the private respondents further submit that the petitioner never
participate any tournament in the discipline of Taekwondo conducted by the AIPSCB. Further, the
petitioner has not produced any document to show that he is an outstanding player recognised by
the AIPSCB. Though the Taekwondo is recognised by the AIPSCB, its sub-event Pomsae is not yet
organised in any All India Police Meet by the P a g e | 20 Board. As such, any medal in that event
cannot be considered for the purpose of promotion, which the DPC has rightly not considered the
same. Furthermore, the said tournament in which the petitioner is claiming to have participated is
not a National Police Championship. Since the petitioner is not qualified for the promotion to the
post of SI of Police, he has no locus to file the writ petition questioning the recommendation and the
appointment of the private respondents on promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category. Thus, a
prayer has been made to dismiss the writ petition.
16. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
17. The grievance of the petitioner is that he is eligible to be considered for promotion to the post of
SI of Police in the Manipur Police Department under the 15% out-of-turn category in terms of the
Recruitment Rules, as he won a gold medal representing the State of Manipur in National
Taekwondo Championship in the Individual Senior Male Poomsae Event which is a sports discipline
recognized by the AIPSCB and his participation therein had also been approved by the DGP,
Manipur. However, ignoring the same while giving promotion to 134 ASIs which is inclusive of 23
appointments on promotion under the 15% P a g e | 21 out-of-turn category, the name of the
petitioner has been left out. According to the petitioner, such an act of the respondent authorities in
not considering the name of the petitioner is arbitrary. Therefore, the impugned proceedings of the
DPC in not considering the appointment of the petitioner for promotion under the 15% out- of-turn
category and the consequential appointment orders are liable to be quashed and the petitioner has
to be promoted to the post of SI of Police under the 15% out-of-turn category.

18. On the other hand, it is the plea of the official respondents that Taekwondo fighting though
recognized by AIPSCB, its sub-event Poomsae is not recognized by AIPSCB. As far as the case of the
petitioner is concerned, only one GSM is taken into account for consideration under the 15%
out-of-turn promotion in the DPC. The gold medal in the sub-event Poomsae was not considered in
the DPC as the Screening Committee had excluded the said medal due to non-recognition by the
AIPSCB.
19. Rule 5 of the Rules of the All India Police Sports Control Board provides the Events. Under Rule
5(a)(v)(4), the event of Taekwondo Championship is included in the All India Police Judo Cluster.
P a g e | 22
20. The official respondents admitted that Taekwondo fighting is recognized by AIPSCB, however,
they have disputed that its sub-event Poomsae is not recognized by AIPSCB. In this regard, the
learned Government Advocate has drawn this Court's attention to the letter dated 13.1.2022 of the
Addl. DGP (Trg.), Manipur, wherein it has been stated as under:
"With reference to your letter no. E/30/16/2021- PHQ (ADM)(ASI-SI)/503 dated
12th January 2022 regarding intimation whether Taekwondo sub-event "Poomsae" is
recognised by All India Police Sports Control Board (AIPSCB) or not. The said event
comes under the discipline of Taekwondo, whereas Taekwondo is recognised by
AIPSCB, but the event Poomsae is not yet organised in any all India Police
Meet/Championship by the board. Besides, a letter has also been sent to the
Secretary, AIPSCB New Delhi regarding the above for clarification and the reply is
still waited."
21. There is difference in the meaning of the words "organised" and "recognised". The Oxford
dictionary defines "organize" as 'to make arrange for' or 'initiate, arrange for'. Thus, to organize
means to make arrangement. On the other hand, the word "recognize" is defined as 'to realise or
admit' or 'acknowledge P a g e | 23 existence, validity, character or claims of' or 'show appreciation
of, reward'. Thus, to recognize means to acknowledge the existence or validity of a thing or
appreciate or reward.
22. It is undisputed that the sub-event Poomsae is not organized by the AIPSCB in All India Police
Games. However, this does not mean that the said event Poomsae is not recognized by AIPSCB.
23. As could be seen from the order dated 27.5.2019 of the Taekwondo Federation of Manipur, it is
clear that the petitioner and others were selected to represent the State of Manipur in the 39th
National Taekwondo Championship at K.D. Singh Babu National Stadium, Lucknow from 14.6.2019
to 16.06.2019. In order dated 27.5.2019, the names of the players of Taekwondo male and female
have been given. The message dated 7.6.2019 of the Assistant Sports Officer, Manipur Police Sports
Club to the CO-1st MR also clearly states that the petitioner and two others namely Th. Praveen
Singh and M. Romiyo Singh will be participating as players in the 39th National Taekwondo
Championship organised by Taekwondo Federation of India at Lucknow from 14.6.2019 to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 11
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
16.6.2019.
P a g e | 24
24. If really the event Poomsae is not recognised by the AIPSCB, how the authorities have permitted
the petitioner and others to participate in the 39th National Taekwondo Championship. The order of
Taekwondo Federation of Manipur and the message of the Assistant Sports Officer of Manipur
Police Sports Club supra clearly indicate that the petitioner has played Individual - Senior Male -
Male - Poomsae representing the State of Manipur.
25. Poomsae is also a very competitive aspect of Taekwondo and has a vibrant domestic and
international circuit of competitions catering for novices through to elite athletes competing at
world championship level. Taekwondo is variously translated as "the way of hand and foot" or "the
way of kicking and striking".
26. The clarification furnished in the letter dated 13.1.2022 is to the effect that the event Poomsae is
not yet organized in any All India Police Meet by the AIPSCB. No clarification has been given to the
effect that Poomsae is not recognized by AIPSCB. Mere reference of the letter of the Addl. DGP
(Trg.) Manipur referred to supra, cannot be a ground to hold that the event Poomsae has not been
recognized by AIPSCB.
P a g e | 25
27. Rule 5 of the All India Police Games Rules clearly states that the Taekwondo Championship shall
be organised. The Rules further provide that Taekwondo competition will be conducted as per the
latest Rules prescribed by the Taekwondo Federation of India.
28. There cannot be any dispute qua winning of gold medal by the petitioner representing the State
of Manipur in the National Taekwondo Championship in the Individual Senior Male Poomsae
Event. The petitioner and other players who had participated in the 39th National Taekwonda
Championship are called as "Taekwondo Players (Men) of the Manipur Police Sports Club", which
means that whatever the sub-event of Taekwondo Championship (Men and Women) is coming
under the Taekwondo Championship and Poomsae is the event of Taekwondo.
29. The petitioner also produced achievement report in respect of SSB Taekwondo team. On a
perusal of the same, it is seen that various Taekwondoa Championships were held, including 7th
Senior National Poomsae Championship 2014 at Jaipur (Rajasthan) from 2.9.2014 to 5.9.2014 and
the 8th National Senior Poomsae Championship 2015 at Visakhapatnam (AP) from 25.10.2015 to
27.10.2015.
P a g e | 26
30. It is to be pointed out that if the event Poomsae is not recognized and/or approved, Poomsae
Championship would not have been conducted by the 7th Senior National Poomsae Championship
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 12
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
2014 and the 8th National Senior Poomsae Championship 2015. Only because the said event is
approved and recognized by the appropriate authority, the Poomsae National Championships were
organised. Therefore, the presumption is that the event Poomsae is recognized as the said event is
coming under Taekwondo. Therefore, this Court is of the view that when the discipline of
Taekwondo is recognized by the AIPSCB, the event of Taekwondo namely Poomsae is also
considered to have been recognized by the AIPSCB and it cannot be said that event Poomsae is not
recognised. In fact, the respondent authorities have admitted that the event Poomsae comes under
the discipline of Taekwondo.
31. As rightly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the petitioner had a legitimate
expectation for getting promotion to the next higher post as he won gold medal representing the
State of Manipur. It is no doubt true that the petitioner is an outstanding sportsman.
P a g e | 27
32. The Outstanding sportsmen recognized by the All India Police Sports Control Board appearing
in the relevant Recruitment Rules does not mean participation only in tournaments conducted by
the All India Police Sports Control Board. On a perusal of the Standing Order No.189 dated
15.4.2021, it is clear that medals obtained representing the country in international level or
representing the State in National/Zonal level in sports/game disciplines/events recognized by the
All India Police Sports Control Board are eligible for consideration for promotion under the out-of-
turn category.
33. For promotion to the post of SI of Police, the Recruitment Rules stipulates - 50% of the posts are
to be filled up by promotion and 50% by direct recruitment. The criteria for promotion is as follows:
"(1) 85% of the promotion quota shall be filled up from ASIs (Civil) having passed the
pre-promotion selection test prescribed by the state Government after having
satisfactorily completed the probation with 5 (five) years regular service in the grade.
(2) 15% of the promotion quota shall be filled from ASIs (Civil) having satisfactorily
completed the probation, 3 (three) years regular service in the grade, having passed
pre-promotion selected test P a g e | 28 prescribed by the State Government and who
have been recommended by the DGP for promotion by reason of their conspicuous
acts of gallantry in discharge of official duties or who are outstanding sportspersons
recognized by the All India Police Sports Control Board, Provided that -
(i) Officers recommended beyond the normal zone of consideration under category
(2) above shall be placed below officers recommended under normal zone of
consideration in the merit list.
(ii) If the promotion quota under Category (2) above cannot be filled up due to
various reasons, the same may be filled up from the category (1) above during a
particular recruitment year."

"In case two or more officers get the same total marks then the inter se seniority will

35. The All India Police Sports Control Board Rules came into force from 1.12.2012. Rule 5 provides
for events included in the All India Police Games. For proper appreciation, Rule 5 is quoted
hereunder:

(xii) All India Police Golf Championship (for Gazetted Officers only)
(xiii) All India Police Badminton Championship (for both Gazetted & Non Gazetted
Officers - Men & Women)
xiv) All India Police Archery (Men & Women) Championship"
36. Under Rule 5(a)(v)(4), the Taekwondo is included in the All India Police Judo Cluster. As stated
supra, Taekwondo is a sports/discipline recognized by the AIPSCB. Since the event Poomsae is
coming under the Taekwondo, it is also a sports/discipline recognized and organised by the
Taekwondo Federation of India.
P a g e | 33
37. The plea of the petitioner is strengthened by the Certificate issued to the petitioner awarding
gold medal for participation in the event "Individual - Senior Male - Male - Poomsae" in the 39th
National Taekwondo Championship for Senior, Junior, Sub-Junior Pee-Wee Male/Female & Black
Belt Senior 25th National Poomsae Taekwondo Championship. The said certificate would clearly
prove that the event Poomsae has been conducted by the Taekwondo Federation of India and the
petitioner had participated in the said Event representing the State of Manipur and won gold medal.
38. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that Rule 35 provides that any sporting event recognised
by the Indian Olympic Association/concerned National Sports Federation to which AIPSCB is
affiliated to can be included in the All India Police Games. As stated supra, it is also undisputed that
the event Poomsae is recognized by the Taekwondo Federation of India which is the National Sports
Federation. Therefore, it can safely be concluded that Poomsae event is recognised by AIPSCB.
39. Out-of-turn promotions are the promotions which are given to any employee before the other
employees who had right of promotion prior to the said employee. Such type of promotions are P a g
e | 34 given due to some exceptionally good work done by employee during his service
40. The respondent authorities, citing that Poomsae is not organised by All India Police Meet, have
not considered the petitioner under the 15% out-of-turn category. When the participation in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 16
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
National Taekwondo Championship by the petitioner has been approved by the DGP and based on
the approval when the petitioner had participated and won gold medal, it is unfair on the part of the
respondent authorities in not considering the gold medal won by the petitioner for the purpose of
giving promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category. The factual scenario proves that the petitioner
should be considered for promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category. The non- consideration of
winning of gold medal by the petitioner in the event Poomsae representing the State of Manipur in
National Taekwondo Championship is unacceptable.
41. The case of the petitioner is that in terms of the Recruitment Rules, under the 15% out-of-turn
category, the DPC has to consider only those persons who have been recommended by the DGP by
reason of their conspicuous acts of gallantry in discharge of official duties or who are outstanding
sportsmen P a g e | 35 recognised by the AIPSCB. According to the petitioner, as many as 134 ASIs
(Male/Civil) have been appointed on promotion to the post of SI of Police (Male/Civil) on the
recommendation of the DPC meeting held on 23.12.2021, which includes 23 appointments on
promotions under the 15% out-of-turn category.
42. The further case of the petitioner is that in the impugned order dated 24.12.2021 the 15%
out-of-turn category have been listed from Sl. No.112 to 134. According to the petitioner, several
officers among the 23 appointees are not recipients of either category of medals and are not
recipients of any gallantry medal or sports medal. Similarly, the GSMs awarded to the officers have
not been expressly provided in the relevant Recruitment Rules. The private respondents who are
only recipients of GSMs cannot be recommended by the DGP for promotion under the 15%
out-of-turn category and their consideration and recommendation by the DPC for appointment on
promotion as SI of Police is illegal, arbitrary and against the provisions of the Recruitment Rules.
According to learned counsel for the petitioner, ineligible persons have been considered for
promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category leaving the petitioner, who is eligible for promotion
under the 15% out-of-turn category.
P a g e | 36
43. Countering the plea of the petitioner, Mr. RS Reisang, the learned senior counsel for the MPSC
submitted that in the proposal letter sent by the Deputy Secretary (Home) to the MPSC for
promotion from ASI to SI of Police, the name of the petitioner was placed at Serial No.91. Pursuant
to the proposal, DPC meeting was held on 23.12.2021 for a total vacancy of 154, out of which 23 were
under the 15% out-of-turn category promotion. The Committee after careful examination of the
achievements furnished by the Administrative Department recommended 23 ASIs for promotion to
SI of Police wherein the name of the petitioner was not included, as he had achieved only 1 GSM.
According to the learned senior counsel, the last recommended ASI under out-of-turn category in
the said DPC had achieved 3 GSM and scored 3 points which is much higher than the petitioner.
Therefore, there were no lapses or irregularities in the impugned DPC proceedings.
44. As far as awarding of points to the petitioner is concerned, this Court had taken into
consideration the gold medal won by the petitioner for the event Poomsae. As per Standing Order
No.184 dated 15.4.2021, if we take 3 marks and adding 1 GSM, totally the petitioner scored 4 points,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 17
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
which is much higher than the last recommended candidate.
P a g e | 37
45. Though the petitioner contended that the private respondents are ineligible persons for
consideration under the 15% out-of-turn category, nothing has been produced to establish the same.
On the other hand, the learned counsel for the private respondents submitted that the private
respondents have been considered for promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category, as they are
entitled for the same. There is nothing suspicious and doubtful regarding the promotion given to the
private respondents. Prima facie, the respondent State and the MPSC have established that their
action in giving promotion to the private respondents under out-of-turn category is based on the
merits.
46. Mr. Sh. Shyam Sharma, the learned Government Advocate for the respondent State submitted
that the private respondents have been promoted to the post of SI of Police and are performing their
respective duties and functions without any complaint from any quarter and to the satisfaction of
their respective superiors as on today shouldering the responsibility of member of law enforcement
agency of the State.
47. It appears that the private respondents are recipients of medals for gallantry and based on their
achievements only, they were considered for giving promotion to the post of SI of Police P a g e | 38
under the 15% out-of-turn category. The petitioner has not questioned the proceedings of the DPC
on the ground that the DPC has not followed the Office Memorandum dated 15.5.2014 issued by the
Department of P&AR (Personnel Division) while recommending the names of the private
respondents for giving promotion to the post of SI of Police under the 15% out-of-turn category.
48. In the absence of any proof produced by the petitioner to show that the private respondents are
ineligible for promotion to the post of SI of Police under the 15% out-of-turn category, the
petitioner, as a matter of right, cannot seek setting aside the impugned DPC proceedings dated
23.12.2021 in respect of the private respondents. On the other hand, the non-consideration of the
petitioner by the same DPC for promotion under the 15% out- of-turn category for his gold medal
won in the National Taekwondo Championship representing the State of Manipur is not acceptable
and/or appreciable in view of the finding arrived at by this Court in the earlier paragraphs that the
petitioner is eligible to be considered for promotion under the 15% out-of-turn category for his
achievement in the National Taekwondo Championship.
P a g e | 39
49. In the light of the above, the respondent authorities ought to have considered the achievements
made by the petitioner and the gold medal won. As stated supra, the gold medal won by the
petitioner representing the State of Manipur in National Taewkwondo Championship is a sports
discipline recognised by the Taekwondo Federation of India. Rules 28 and 29 contain the provisions
for awarding the police personnel who won medals in National Championships, Olympics, Asian
Games, Commonwealth Games, etc. The undisputed fact remains that Poomsae is sub- event of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187207100/ 18
Shri Moirangthem Ravikumar Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 October, 2023
Taekwondo.
50. This Court is of the considered view that since Poomsae is sub-event of Taekwondo which is
recognized by AIPSCB, the Selection Committee ought not to have come to the conclusion that the
Poomsae is not recognized by AIPSCB without any basis and citing the same, the gold medal
achieved by the petitioner was wrongly and illegally rejected by the Committee and resultantly not
considered by the DPC. Considering the given facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner is
entitled to be promoted as a meritorious sportsperson by giving due consideration of his gold medal
won by him.
P a g e | 40
51. Pending writ petition, the petitioner has moved an application, being MC (WP) No.95 of 2023, to
reserve one post of SI of Police. After hearing both sides, this Court, on 28.3.2023, passed the
following order:
"[1] Heard Mr. N. Zequeson, learned counsel for the applicant; Mr. RS Reisang,
learned senior counsel; Mr. S. Biswajit, learned senior counsel;
Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned counsel for the respondents and Mr. H. Samarjit, learned
GA for the respondents.
[2] The present Misc. case in MC(WP(C)) No. 95 of 2023 has been filed seeking to
reserve one post of Sub-Inspector of Police (Male/Civil) in the Police Department,
Manipur till disposal of the connected writ petition WP(C) No. 991 of 2021.
[3] Learned counsels appearing for the respondents also made no objection in
allowing the Misc. case.
[4] Therefore, the MC(WP(C)) No. 95 of 2023 is allowed by directing the official
respondents to keep one post of Sub-Inspector of Police (Male/Civil) felt vacant in
the Police Department, Manipur till disposal of the connected writ petition WP(C)
No. 991 of 2021."
P a g e | 41
52. Thus, pursuant to the order dated 28.3.2023, one post of SI of Police is reserved. As such, in the
interest of justice, the petitioner can be accommodated in the said post even without disturbing the
promotions already given to the private respondents. If such accommodation is made, no prejudice
would be caused to either of the respondents. The petitioner can be given promotion notionally with
effect from the date of promotion of the private respondents.
53. In the result,
