CRIMINAL PROCEDURE PRAYING TO QUASH THE
ENTIRE PROCEEDINGS IN CRIME NO.0075/2018
DATED 15.08.2018 IN PADUBIDRI POLICE STATION,
PENDING BEFORE THE 2ND ADDITIONAL CIVIL JUDGE
[JR.DN] AND JMFC COURT, UDUPI DISTRICT
REGISTERED FOR THE OFFENCES UNDER SECTION
79 AND 80 OF THE KARNATAKA POLICE ACT,
1963[ANNEXURE-A] AND ETC.
THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR
PRELIMINARY HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE
THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
Heard Sri Akash B. Shetty, learned advocate for petitioners and Sri S. Rachaiah, learned HCGP for
respondents.
2. In these writ petitions, the petitioners have prayed for quashing criminal proceedings initiated
against them for the alleged offences punishable under Sections 78(3) of the Karnataka Police Act,
1963 on the ground of non-compliance of the mandatory requirements prescribed under Section
155(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
3. Learned advocate for petitioners submits that petitioner No.1 runs a club. A raid was conducted
by the police. An FIR was lodged alleging offences under Sections 78 and 80 of the Karnataka Police
Act. Police Inspector, Padubidri Police Station, Udupi District sought permission to conduct
investigation. The offence alleged against the petitioners is a non-cognizable offence and by virtue of
the safeguard provided under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C, the respondent-police could not have
embarked upon investigation into the alleged offence, without the express permission by the
jurisdictional Magistrate.
4. In the case of Praveen Basavanneppa Shivalli - vs- State of Karnataka and Others reported in
2017(1) AKR 461, this Court has held that a mere endorsement made by the Magistrate on the
application submitted by the Police Officer under Section 155 of Cr.P.C. as 'permitted' is not an
'order' in the eye of law and on that ground also, the proceedings initiated against the accused are
rendered illegal and are liable to be quashed.
5. Undeniably, the offence alleged is a non- cognizable offence. Section 155 of the Cr.P.C, deals with
the procedure of investigation and cognizance of non-cognizable cases.
"155. Information as to non- cognizable cases and investigation of such cases.
(1) When information is given to an officer in charge of a police station of the
commission within the limits of such station of a non-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152961474/ 3

cognizable offence, he shall enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book
to be kept by such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf, and
refer the informant to the Magistrate.
(2) No police officer shall investigate a non- cognizable case without the order of a Magistrate having
power to try such case or commit the case for trial.
(3) Any police officer receiving such order may exercise the same powers in respect of the
investigation (except the power to arrest without warrant) as an officer in charge of a police station
may exercise in a cognizable case.
(4) Where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable, the case shall be
deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that the other offences are non- cognizable."
6. As per the above provisions, when an Officer- in-charge of the police station receives an
information with regard to commission of non-cognizable offence/s,
(i) he shall enter or caused to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be
maintained by the said Officer in a prescribed form and (ii) refer the informant to the Magistrate.
Further, Sub-Section (2) of Section 155 Cr.P.C. mandates that no Police Officer shall investigate a
non-cognizable offence without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such case or commit
such case for trial.
7. In the instant case, police have failed to comply with the requirements of Section 155(1) and
155(2) of Cr.P.C. There is nothing on record to show that the respondents have referred the
informant to the concerned Magistrate as required under Section 155(1) of Cr.P.C., or obtained
necessary order as envisaged under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C., before embarking upon investigation.
Thus, on the face of it, the respondents are seen to have violated the provisions of Sections 155(1)
and 155(2) of Cr.P.C.
8. Learned HCGP appearing for the State, however, submitted that the endorsement made by the
learned Magistrate permitting the Police is sufficient compliance.
9. In the light of above discussion, it has to be held that, the endorsement made by learned
Magistrate stating 'permitted' does not satisfy the requirements of Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C.
Resultantly, these petitions merit consideration and are accordingly allowed. All proceedings in
Crime No.75/2018 registered on 15.8.2018 in Padubidiri Police Station pending on the file of II
Additional Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and JMFC Court, Udupi District, are quashed.
No costs.
