OFFENCE PUNISHABLE UNDER SECTION 138 OF N.I.
ACT AND CONSEQUENTLY CONVICTING THE
RESPONDENT/ACCUSED.
THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR JUDGMENT ON 13.03.2018 COMING ON
FOR PRONOUNCEMENT THIS DAY, THE COURT
DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
This appeal is directed against the judgment of acquittal dated 17.12.2009 passed by the XVI Addl.
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore City in C.C.No.23063/2008 acquitting the accused for the
offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred
to as 'the NI Act', for brevity). The same is challenged in this appeal urging various grounds.
2. Heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent/accused in this appeal.
Learned counsel for the appellant has not advanced any arguments and he was not present though
the case was called several times.
3. The factual matrix of the appeal are as under:
The complainant is known to the accused as a family friend. The accused is running a
travel agency business in Gandhinagar area and in the month of October 2004 the
accused has approached the complainant and requested him to give hand loan of
Rs.70,000/- to meet his domestic problems and family commitments and also to
invest some amount in the business. The complainant on considering the request of
the accused, gave an amount of Rs.70,000/-
by way of cash to the accused on 29.10.2004. While receiving the said loan amount,
the accused has also executed Loan agreement and he did give three cheques in
favour of the complainant. The accused also promised the complainant that he would
return the loan amount during the month of April 2008. As per the request made by
the accused, the complainant presented the cheques for encashment. But the cheques
in question were dishonoured with an endorsement Drawee signature
differs/incomplete and insufficient funds. Subsequently, the complainant got issued a
legal notice to the accused both under RPAD and under UCP. The notice sent to the
accused by RPAD returned with an postal acknowledgment "No such person in the
address". But however, the notice sent through UCP was served on the accused.
Despite receipt of legal notice, the accused neither replied nor paid any amount
towards the amount mentioned in the aforesaid cheques in question. Hence, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130220610/ 2
K N Raju vs Manjunath T V on 16 March, 2018
complainant filed the complaint before the court below alleging that the accused has
committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act and to prosecute
the case against the accused.
4. Upon initiation of proceedings, the Trial Court took cognizance of the offence under Section 190
of Cr.P.C. and summons was issued to the accused. On service of summons the accused had put his
appearance before the Trial Court through his counsel and participated in the proceedings. The
copies of the prosecution papers were furnished to the accused and plea was recorded. The
accusation was read over to the accused, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
5. Subsequently, in order to substantiate his contentions, the complainant examined himself as
PW.1 and got marked 13 documents as per Ex.p1 to p13. Even Ex.P2(a), p3(a) and p4(a) were
marked. On the defense part, the accused had examined himself as DW.1 and did not produce any
documentary evidence. The statement under of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. was
recorded. Subsequently, the Trial Court, on hearing the arguments advanced by the learned counsel
for both the parties, had framed the points that arose for its consideration and answered point No.1
in the negative and point No.2 as per the final order and thereby acquitted the accused. It is this
acquittal judgment which is called in question in the present appeal.
6. Heard the learned counsel for the respondent/accused.
7. Ex.P1 is the original complaint. Ex.P2 is the cheque bearing No.644021 dated 28.5.2008 for a sum
of Rs.20,000/-. Ex.P3 is the cheque bearing No.644026 dated 28.5.2008 for a sum of Rs.20,000/-.
Ex.P4 is cheque bearing No.644027 dated 28.5.2008 for a sum of Rs.20,000/-. Ex.P2 to P4 are
drawn on Sree Subramanyeswara Co-operative Bank Ltd., Rajatha Bhavana, Padmanabhanagar
Branch, Bangalore. Complainant states that Ex.P2(a), P3(a) and P4(a) are the signature of the
accused. ExP2 to P4 supports the stand taken by the complainant. Ex.P5 to P7 are the endorsements
issued by the banker showing that the aforesaid three cheques were dishonoured on 29.8.2008 with
an endorsement "Drawers signature differs/incomplete and insufficient funds.
8. It is relevant to note that as per the provisions of NI Act, the complainant was required to make a
demand for repayment of the loan amount within 30 days from the date of receipt of cheque as
unpaid. Ex.P8 to P10 show that complainant has made a demand in writing, calling upon the
accused to make repayment of the said loan amount by issuing notice dated 26.9.2008 which was
within 30 days from the date of receipt of cheque as unpaid. Learned counsel for the
respondent/accused vehemently contended that complainant had to file this complaint on or after
15.10.2008 and on or before 15.11.2008. But the complaint was filed on 30.10.2008 and of course,
the complaint was well within time.
9. Ex.P12 is loan agreement. It contains the information that the accused and his wife and his son
have jointly borrowed Rs.70,000/- from the complainant and inturn the accused and his family
members issued the above referred cheques in favour of the complainant. But the amount
mentioned in the aforesaid cheques, in all, comes to Rs.60,000/-. Therefore, the cumulative effect of
these facts is that on the date of issuance of the cheques in question there was legally recoverable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130220610/ 3
K N Raju vs Manjunath T V on 16 March, 2018
debt, in fact, in existence. Admittedly, Ex.P12 was executed on 29.10.2004 and the cheques in
question bear the dates as 28.5.2008. Learned counsel for the respondent/accused pointed out that
as on the date mentioned in the cheque the amount alleged to have been borrowed by the accused
under Ex.P12 had already become time barred debt and hence, it cannot be said that as on the date
the cheque bear, there was a legally enforceable debt was in existence and hence, the complaint filed
by the complainant needs to be dismissed.
10. On perusal of Ex.P12 it could be noticed that Ex.P12 stipulates 11 months for recovery of loan
amounts. Considering the 11 months time as well as the assurance given by the accused in May
2008, the transaction was legal and there existed a recoverable debt. Therefore, the contention of
the accused that the claim of the complainant is the time barred debt cannot be accepted. Hence, the
Trial court observed that in Ex.P12 it is recited or stipulated that 11 months time has been given to
the accused to pay the said amount.
11. Article 21 of the Indian Limitation Act, the period of limitation for recovery of loan amount starts
from the date on which the amount has been paid. Further, as per Section 18 of the Limitation Act, a
fresh period of limitation shall be computed if any acknowledgement of debt has been executed by
the borrower within the prescribed period of limitation i.e., within three years from the date of
borrowing of the loan. Further Section 19 of the Limitation Act makes it clear that a fresh period of
limitation shall be computed from the date of payment of some money towards the loan in question.
Therefore, it is relevant to extract Sections 18 and 19 of the Limitation Act for the purpose of
deciding the issues under Section 138 of N.I. Act.
Section 18
18. Effect of acknowledgment in writing.--
(1) Where, before the expiration of the prescribed period for a suit of application in
respect of any property or right, an acknowledgment of liability in respect of such
property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such
property or right is claimed, or by any person through whom he derives his title or
liability, a fresh period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the
acknowledgment was so signed. (2) Where the writing containing the
acknowledgment is undated, oral evidence may be given of the time when it was
signed; but subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), oral
evidence of its contents shall not be received.
Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,--
(a) an acknowledgment may be sufficient though it omits to specify the exact nature
of the property or right, or avers that the time for payment, delivery, performance or
enjoyment has not yet come or is accompanied by a refusal to pay, deliver, perform or
permit to enjoy, or is coupled with a claim to set-off, or is addressed to a person other
than a person entitled to the property or right;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130220610/ 4
K N Raju vs Manjunath T V on 16 March, 2018
(b) the word "signed" means signed either personally or by an agent duly authorised
in this behalf; and
(c) an application for the execution of a decree or order shall not be deemed to be an
application in respect of any property or right.
Section 19
19. Effect of payment on account of debt or of interest on legacy.--Where payment on account of a
debt or of interest on a legacy is made before the expiration of the prescribed period by the person
liable to pay the debt or legacy or by his agent duly authorised in this behalf, a fresh period of
limitation shall be computed from the time when the payment was made:
Provided that, save in the case of payment of interest made before the 1st day of
January, 1928, an acknowledgment of the payment appears in the handwriting of, or
in a writing signed by, the person making the payment.
" Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,-- "
(a) where mortgaged land is in the possession of the mortgagee, the receipt of the rent or produce of
such land shall be deemed to be a payment;
(b) "debt" does not include money payable under a decree or order of a court."
12. In the context of limitation point the Trial Court observed in the impugned judgment that it is
not the case of the complainant that the accused has paid some amount towards the repayment of
the amount mentioned in the cheques in question. In that view it was held that the loan in question
cannot be considered as a time barred debt.
13. In so far as bouncing of cheques relating to initiation of the proceedings as under Section 200
Cr.P.C. punishable under Section 138 of NI Act that the limitation point is to be taken into
consideration and so also the contention urged by the complainant. In the instant case, it should be
noted that the complainant who examined himself as PW.1 specifically and categorically has
admitted himself in his cross examination that the accused had given the undated cheques, and the
validity of the loan agreement entered into between complainant and accused had lapsed which was
for a period of three years. The complainant has categorically admitted that after the expiry of the
loan agreement, he had presented the cheques mentioning the dates and upon bouncing of them
had initiated the proceedings against the accused under Section 138 of NI Act. Therefore, on a
careful reading of the said admission of PW.1 it makes it clear that when the cheques in question
were issued by the accused the cheques were undated. Further according to the complaint himself
the cheques in question have been issued to him on the date of execution of the agreement as per
Ex.P12. Even this fact is mentioned in Ex.P12 which was executed on 29.10.2004. Therefore, these
facts make it clear that the cheques in question have been presented for encashment after three
years ten months from the date of issuance. Therefore, the question would be whether the facts and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130220610/ 5
K N Raju vs Manjunath T V on 16 March, 2018
circumstances of this case fall within the ambit of Section 138 of NI Act. The Trial Court in this
regard cited a decision reported in ILR 2007 Karnataka 1708 between Vishnudas Vs. Vijaya
Mahantesh wherein this Court has held as under:
"NI Act 1881 Section 138 - Offence under - Acquittal - Appealed against the issue of
cheque without mentioning the date-Admission of Pw.1 in the cross examination that
there was no debt as on the date of issue of cheque. On facts, held that on the date of
handing over the cheque, there was no debt due to be paid by the respondent and
wherefore the cheque was not issued towards discharge of any debt. The facts elicited
in the cross examination of Pw.1 that the cheque was undated on the date of its issue
and the same was presented for payment after 6 months from the date of issue. The
order of acquittal is justified."
The ratio laid down in the said decision squarely applies to the facts and circumstances of the
present case and so also the initiation of the proceedings for the offence punishable under Section
138 of the NI Act against the accused.
14. Whereas in this appeal, though several opportunities were provided to the appellant, he has not
come forward to address the arguments. Therefore having regard to the facts and circumstances
contained in this appeal which is filed against the impugned judgment of acquittal passed by the
Trial Court in C.C.No.23063/2008 it is relevant to note the admission made by the Pw.1 in his
cross-examination who specifically and categorically admits that when the cheques in question were
issued by the accused, the cheques were undated and he further admits that the cheques in question
have been issued to him on the date of execution of the loan agreement as per Ex.P12 i.e., on
29.10.2004. Further the cheques in question have been presented for encashment on 29.8.2008.
Therefore, these facts make it clear that cheques in question have been presented for encashment
after three years ten months from the date of issuance of the same. Therefore, the Trial Court has
rightly held that the materials made available on record are not sufficient to conclude that the
accused has committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act.
15. The facts and circumstances of this case are identical to the decision stated supra and it is
squarely applicable to the case on hand. In the aforesaid decision it was held that when the cheque
was undated on the date of its issue and the same was presented for payment after 6 months from
the date of issue then the Court had no other option but to acquit the accused. Keeping in view that
position of law, the Trial Court rightly held that the complainant himself had admitted that the
cheques in question were issued on 29.10.2004 and at the time of issuance the cheques were
undated and the complainant had presented the said cheques for encashment in the year 2008. The
said finding of the Trial court in the facts and circumstances of this case is just and proper and there
is no need for this court to interfere with the said finding.
16. For the above reasons, I find that there is no infirmity in the judgment of acquittal rendered by
the Trial Court. Hence, I am of the opinion that there is no necessity to revisit the impugned
judgment. As the appeal is devoid of merits, the same is dismissed. As a consequence, the judgment
of acquittal dated 17.12.2009 passed by the XVI Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore City

138 of N.I. Act, is hereby confirmed.
