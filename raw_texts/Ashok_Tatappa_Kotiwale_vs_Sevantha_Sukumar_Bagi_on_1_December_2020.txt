THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR FINAL
HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT, DELIVERED
THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
Challenging the judgment dated 04.02.2014 passed by the VII Addl. District and Sessions Judge,
Belagavi sitting at Chikodi in Crl.A.No.118/2013 complainant has preferred this appeal. Under the
impugned judgment, the First Appellate Court had allowed the appeal and set aside the order of
conviction and sentence dated 25.04.2012 passed by JMFC Court, Sankeshwar in CC No.206/2009.
2. Brief facts leading to this appeal are as under:
A complaint was filed by the appellant stating that complainant and son of the
accused by name Sanju Sukumar Bagi were friends. Sanju Sukumar Bagi was working
in Hukkeri Municipality and knew him for about 5 to 6 years. On 10.12.2007, Sanju
Sukumar Bagi obtained a loan of Rs.85,000/- from the complainant assuring to
return within one month. When the complainant demanded repayment, the accused
undertook to make the payment herself and as such on 16.08.2008 issued a cheque
bearing No.221884 drawn on State Bank of Mysore, Hukkeri branch for a sum of
Rs.85,000/- in favour of the complainant. When the cheque was presented for
payment, the same returned on 21.08.2008 with an endorsement"funds insufficient".
Therefore, the complainant issued statutory notice to the accused on 06.09.2008
through RPAD. The notice was served on the accused on 08.09.2008.
Despite service, the accused did not either make payment or issued any reply to the notice, thereby
construing the complainant to file a private complaint under Section 200 of Code of Criminal
Procedure,1973 (for short "Cr.P.C.") and for the offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument
Act (For short "NI Act"). After recording of sworn statement of the complainant and issuance of
summons after taking cognizance, the accused entered appearance and pleaded not guilty.
Recording the same, the trial Court proceeded with the trial. Complainant got himself examined as
PW.1 and marked six documents namely Ex.P1-cheque, Ex.P2- Bank endorsement, Ex.P3-Statutory
notice, Ex.P.4-RPAD acknowledgement, Ex.P5- Property extract and Ex.P6- Bank
acknowledgement.
3. Thereafter, the incriminating material was explained to the accused. Accused denied the same
and did no offer any explanation regarding his statement under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. The trial
Court proceeded to frame the following points for it's consideration.
1) Whether the complainant

Ashok Tatappa Kotiwale vs Sevantha Sukumar Bagi on 1 December, 2020
proves beyond reasonable
doubt that as repayment of
the loan borrowed by her
son from the complainant
the accused issued a
cheque bearing No.221884
for a sum of Rs.85,000/-
dated 16.08.2008 drawn on
State Bank of Mysore,
Hukkeri, when the
complainant presented the
said cheque for
encashment through BDCC
Bank, Hebbal Branch it
returned with an
endorsement that "funds
insufficient", inspite of
issuance of legal notice to
the accused she did not
pay the amount in the
dishonored cheque and
thereby committed the
offence punishable under
Section 138 of NI Act?
2) What Order?
4. After answering point No.1 in the affirmative, the trial Court proceeded to convict the accused for
the offence punishable under Section 138 of NI Act and imposed a sentence of simple imprisonment
for a period of six months and a fine of Rs.10,000/-. It was also ordered in default of payment of fine
amount, the accused would undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 45 days. The said sentence
was in addition to payment of sum of Rs.85,000/- to the complainant as compensation under
Section 357 of Cr.P.C. Challenging the said judgment, the accused filed appeal before the First
Appellate Court in Crl.A.No.118/2013. The Appellate Court after hearing, passed the impugned
judgment dated 04.02.2014 setting aside the conviction passed by the trial Court and acquitting the
accused of the offence. Aggrieved by the same, the complainant is in an appeal before this Court.
5. Learned counsel Sri.Srinand A Pachhapure for the appellant submitted that the accused had
admitted her signature on the cheque. Therefore, as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court, in the case of Rangappa Vs. Sri.Mohan, reported in (2010)11 SCC 441, a presumption was
available that cheque was issued towards discharge of legally recoverable debt as per Section 118 and
Section 139 of NI Act. However, Appellate Court by casting the burden to prove the transaction upon
the appellant as if in a Civil Court proceeded to pass the impugned order. It was submitted that the
same is perverse resulted in miscarriage of justice. He further submitted that the complainant had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67504632/ 3
Ashok Tatappa Kotiwale vs Sevantha Sukumar Bagi on 1 December, 2020
neither stated in the statutory notice nor in the complaint and nor in his examination-in-chief that
he had lent amount of Rs.85,000/- by taking loan from bank. Therefore, relating the loan taken by
him from bank to the loan given by him to accused's son, by First Appellate Court, without any
evidence and hence perverse.
6. I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, perused the impugned judgment and the
records.
7. The trial Court had proceeded to convict the accused by raising the presumption and holding that
accused has failed to rebut the presumption. However, it is seen that the trial Court before coming to
the conclusion about failure on the part of the accused to rebut the presumption has not considered
the evidence led by accused. The First Appellate Court on the other hand has reexamined the entire
evidence on record, especially cross examination of PW.1 by accused wherein, to his admissions
substantiated her contention that the complainant did not have financial capacity to lend loan and
that there was no transaction between complainant and her son.
8. Though, both the Courts held that accused had failed to substantiate her contention that there
was no transaction between complainant and her son, the following excerpts from the evidence of
PW.1 would be relevant with regard to the financial capacity of complainant.

9. Further on examining the entries in Ex.P.5, it is seen that entry regarding first loan is dated
12.05.2008 for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- borrowed from Sri. Durdundeshwar Urban Credit
Co-operative Society. The Second entry is for a sum of Rs.18,00,000/- dated 18.03.2011 from
Hebbal Credit Co-operative Bank. Both these loans are subsequent to date of loan as claimed by
complainant i.e. on 10.12.2007. As the complainant has not stated about any other sources of
income to justify his financial capacity to lend loan of Rs.85,000/-, the First Appellate Court has
rightly held that accused rebutted the presumption in favour of complainant and rightly held that he
had failed to prove his financial capacity.
10. On an examination of the entire evidence on record, I find that the conclusion drawn by the
Appellate Court is with reference to evidence on record and the same is neither perverse nor grossly
irregular. Hence, there is no merit in the appeal. Accordingly, appeal is dismissed.
