Prosecution Case
4. The prosecution case is based on the written
application of the informant (PW-1). In his written application
(Exhibit '2'), the informant has alleged that he got a secret
information on 18.12.2020 at 10:10 AM that a big consignment of
illicit ganja is likely to come from Gopalganj side. In this regard,
he recorded his Sanha bearing No. 494 of 2020 dated 18.12.2020
and gave information to the Senior Police Officers and the nearest
Magistrate, who is the Anchaladhikari, Kuchaikote. The
Anchalaadhikari was asked to come to the police station. On the
direction of the Officer Incharge of the Police Station, the
informant (PW-1) along with Sub-Inspector Shankar Paswan and
the force of the Reserve Bal, Hawaldar Ramkumar Singh, Sipahi
Deepak Kumar, Sipahi Lalu Kumar constituted a raiding team and
they along with Anchaladhikari reached Balthari Check Post at

NH-28. It is further alleged that after reaching Balthari Check
Post, checking of the vehicles coming from Gopalganj started and
in course of conducting the check at the Check Post, he came
across a silver coloured Honda City Car coming from Gopalganj
side bearing registration number UP-16-N-1820. The said car was
stopped, the driver and another person who was in the car tried to
flee away but they were caught and on asking, they disclosed their
names as (1) Toofani Ram and (2) Ramkripal Yadav. On seeing the
police action, people from the neighbouring place had assembled
and he took two independent witnesses, namely, (1) Godan Shah
and (2) Sandeep Basfor who agreed to become seizure list
witnesses. Upon search of the vehicle, from the dickey of the car,
the informant found 16 packets in plastic polythene, there were
brown coloured substances in the packets which smell like ganja.
It is alleged that the accused persons said that the substance is
ganja which they were concealing in the dickey of the car and it
belongs to Toofani Ram. Both the apprehended accused were
searched and from both of them one mobile each was recovered.
The informant has further alleged that at the place of seizure
itself, the weighing machine was called for from the police station
and the 16 seized packets were weighed, they were of total 1.30
quintal. At the place of occurrence itself, informant had prepared

sealed also. All the above articles were seized and seizure list was
prepared on which both the independent witnesses and the Circle
Officer had put their signature. The owner of the vehicle Suryakant
Madesia along with two arrested persons were charged for
smuggling of ganja.
5. On the basis of this written application, Kuchaikote
P.S. Case No. 489 of 2020 dated 18.12.2020 was registered under
Sections 20, 22, 25 and 29 of the NDPS Act against three accused
persons, namely, (1) Suryakant Madesia, (2) Toofani Ram and (3)
Ramkripal Yadav. After investigation, Police submitted
chargesheet bearing No. 114 of 2021 dated 30.04.2021 against
three accused persons under Sections 8, 20(b)(ii)(c) and 25 of the
NDPS Act. On the basis of the chargesheet, learned trial court
vide order dated 02.07.2021 took cognizance of the offences
punishable under above-mentioned sections against three accused
persons.
6. Charges were read over and explained to the accused
persons in Hindi to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to
be tried. Accordingly, vide order dated 18.01.2022, charges were
framed against Toofani Ram, Ramkripal Yadav and Suryakant
Madesia under Sections 20(b)(ii)(c) and 22 of the NDPS Act and

Findings of the Learned Trial Court
10. Learned trial court after analysing the evidences
available on the record found that the prosecution has succeeded in
proving the allegation of possessing and transporting ganja in a
vehicle in violation of the NDPS Act and the quantity of the ganja
was found to be commercial.
11. Learned trial court found that the prosecution has
followed the established procedure for making search, seizure and
sampling. Learned trial court found that the prosecution has
proved the place, date and time of the occurrence.
12. Learned trial court found that on the basis of the
cogent, convincing and reliable evidences brought on the record,
prosecution has been able to prove the guilt against the accused
Ramkripal Yadav and Toofani Ram who were caught at the place
of occurrence with the ganja. Hence, learned trial court convicted

the appellants for the offences punishable under Section 20(b)(ii)
(c) of the NDPS Act.
13. Learned trial court further found that the prosecution
has not been able to prove the case against accused, namely,
Suryakant Madesia beyond all reasonable doubts, hence, he has
been acquitted of the charged levelled against him.
Submissions on behalf of the Appellants
14. Learned counsel for the appellants assailed the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157368127/ 6
Toofani Ram vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
impugned judgment and order by submitting that in this case, the
established procedure for making search, seizure and sampling has
not been followed.
15. Learned counsel submits that (1) Godan Shah and
(2) Sandeep Basfor have been made independent witness to the
seizure list but have neither been made chargesheet witness nor
have been examined by the prosecution in course of trial which
shows that the entire seizure list is fabricated. It is submitted that
not a single independent witness has been examined in this case
and the witnesses who have been examined are the police officials.
16. Learned counsel submits that there are material
contradictions between the statement of witnesses regarding the
preparation of seizure list, taking out ganja from the alleged
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025
8/19
vehicle and in fact the prosecution has failed to prove it's case
beyond all reasonable doubts.
17. Learned counsel submits that 16 bundles of ganja
like substance was recovered from the dickey of the vehicle but
individual weight of each bundle has not been mentioned.
18. Learned counsel submits that the seized articles were
not produced before the court along with the accused persons on
19.12.2020
rather alleged samples prepared by the informant were produced before the court after one month
of the occurrence and the same was sent for examination to the FSL after about two months of the
occurrence. The samples kept in two dibbas did not bear signature of the accused. The sampling was
not done in presence of a Magistrate as required under Sub-Section (2) of Section 52A of the NDPS
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157368127/ 7
Toofani Ram vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
Act. Learned counsel relies upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bharat
Aambale Vs. State of Chhattisgarh reported in 2025 SCC Online SC 110 (para 50) to strengthen her
submissions.
19. Learned counsel further submitted that the prosecution has failed to establish that the sample
which was sent for examination to FSL is the same which has been taken from the alleged bundles
recovered from the dickey of the vehicle. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023
dt.15-10-2025
20. Learned counsel submits that the prosecution has failed to prove and establish the reasons for
delay in sending the samples. Accordingly, the impugned judgment of conviction and order of
sentence are bad in the eye of law which are fit to be set aside.
Submission of the State
21. On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has defended the
impugned judgment and order by submitting that the prosecution witnesses have supported the
factum of seizure of ganja like substance from the dickey of the vehicle.
22. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has submitted that the learned trial court
after proper appreciation of the evidences available on the record rightly held the appellants guilty
of the charges levelled against them. The impugned judgment and order do not require any
interference by this Court.
Consideration
23. Having regard to the submissions of learned counsel for the appellants and learned Additional
Public Prosecutor for the State as also on perusal of the trial court's record, it is found that in this
case, the informant Brajnath Singh is the Police Sub-Inspector Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 posted in Kuchaikote Police Station. In his written application
(Exhibit '2'), the informant, who has deposed as prosecution witness no. 1, has stated that he had
received a secret information on 18.12.2020 at 10:10 AM that a big consignment of illicit ganja is
likely to come from Gopalganj side. PW-1 recorded his Sanha No. 494 of 2020 dated 18.12.2020,
gave information of this to the Senior Police Officers and the nearest Magistrate who is the
Anchaladhikari, Kuchaikote, the Anchaladhikari was asked to come to the police station. On the
direction of the Officer Incharge of the Police Station, the informant (PW-1) along with Sub-
Inspector Shankar Paswan and the force of the Reserve Bal, Hawaldar Ramkumar Singh, Sipahi
Deepak Kumar, Sipahi Lalu Kumar constituted a raiding team and they reached Balthari check post
at NH-28. It is his statement that in course of conducting the check at the check post, he came
across a silver coloured Honda City Car which was coming from the Gopalganj side, the registration
number of the vehicle is UP-16-N-1820. He has stated that when the car was stopped, the driver and
another person who was in the car tried to flee away but they were caught and on asking, they
disclosed their names as (1) Toofani Ram and (2) Ramkripal Yadav. In his written statement, he has
stated that on seeing the police action, people from the neighbouring place had Patna High Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157368127/ 8
Toofani Ram vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 assembled and he took two independent witnesses,
namely, (1) Godan Shah and (2) Sandeep Basfor who agreed to become seizure list witnesses. In the
dickey of the car, the informant found 16 packets in plastic polythene, they were brown coloured
substances in the packets which smell like ganja. The informant claimed that at the place of seizure
itself, the weighing machine was called for from the police station and on arrival of the weighing
machine, 16 packets were weighed, they were of total 1.30 quintal. He has stated that at the place of
occurrence itself, he had prepared two samples in two dibbas of 25 gms each which were sealed also.
The informant claimed that on the seizure list, the two independent witnesses and the Circle Officer
had put their signature.
24. It is evident from the materials on the record that the independent seizure list witnesses in this
case have not been examined by the prosecution and no plausible reason for their non- examination
has been offered in course of trial. The Circle Officer has deposed as PW-6 in course of trial. He has
stated that in his presence, the seizure list was prepared and he had put his signature thereon. It is,
however, found that the I.O. (PW-4) has categorically stated in his evidence that in course of
investigation, he had not recorded the statement of the Circle Officer. PW-6 also Patna High Court
CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 said that the witnesses were labourers but he cannot
say they were private labourers or government labourers, he was not aware of the age of the seizure
list witnesses. The I.O. has further stated that he had recorded the statement of the witnesses at the
police station. This Court, therefore, finds that the independent witnesses of the seizure list have not
been examined which will create a lacuna in the prosecution case, however, we will further examine
the other materials available on the record.
25. We have found on perusal of the ordersheets of the learned trial court that in this case, the FIR
was received in the court on 19.12.2020. The accused were also arrested and produced with the
forwarding letter, arrest memo, checklist, however, order dated 19.12.2020 does not mention that
the seized packets of ganja were produced in the court. It is, thus, evident that the seized ganja was
not produced in the court. The evidence of the I.O. (PW-4) would show that he has made a
statement in paragraph '4' that the seized exhibits were produced in the court on 19.12.2020 and the
learned court had put its signature on all the bundles. We are afraid that such statement of the I.O.
(PW-4) is not getting support from the ordersheets of the trial court.
26. From the evidence of the I.O. (PW-4), it may be further found that in paragraph '10' of his
deposition, he has stated Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 that the
seized ganja was not handed over to him but he had received the sample of the seized ganja which
was in a plastic dibba tied with a cloth. He has stated that on the said sample, there were signatures
of the informant, witnesses of the seizure list and the Circle Officer. In the court, the dibba was not
opened. He has stated that on 19.12.2020, when he was going to the court, he was given the sample
by the 'Malkhana Prabhari' but he did not know the name of the 'Malkhana Prabhari'. He did not
know that on the said date how much ganja was lying in the Malkhana. It is, thus, evident from the
statement of the I.O. that the seized ganja was not handed over to him and as such, on 19.12.2020
when he produced the accused in the court, he could not have produced the seized ganja in the
court. His own statements with regard to the production of the seized ganja in court is
self-contradictory.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157368127/ 9
Toofani Ram vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
27. This Court has further noticed from the evidence of the informant (PW-1) in paragraph '20'of his
deposition that on the sample, the signature of the witnesses were obtained but there was no
signature of the accused persons. PW-1 has gone to the extent of saying that the plastic dibba was
sealed but the bundles were not sealed. It is, therefore, evident that the bundles from which some
quantity of ganja was taken out and from which the samples were prepared, were not sealed and
those bundles were Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 kept in the
Malkhana without bundles being sealed. PW-1 has also not stated that he had handed over the
seized ganja to the I.O. (PW-4). It is evident from the deposition of the informant (PW-1) and the
I.O. (PW-4) read together that the bundles of ganja were kept in the police station without sealing
the bundles and the samples which PW-1 claims to have prepared at the place of occurrence were
not containing signature of the accused on the seal.
28. This Court has further found from the ordersheets of the learned trial court that on 27.01.2021,
one application was filed in the court with a request to send the seized exhibits to Forensic Science
Laboratory, Muzaffarpur for testing. The court permitted to send the samples but it is evident from
the deposition of the prosecution witnesses that the dibbas in which samples were kept were not
opened in the court. Despite the order of the court obtained on 27.01.2021 i.e. after five weeks of the
seizure, the samples were sent to the FSL, Muzaffarpur only on 19.02.2021. It is not known where
the samples were lying from the date of seizure of ganja, preparation of samples till sending the
same to the FSL. The FSL Report has been marked exhibit as public document, it is Exhibit '3(4)'. A
perusal of the FSL Report would show that Chaukidar 7/3 Babujaan Ansari and Chaukidar 6/3
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 Vasirudin Ansari had handed over
the sample in the office of FSL on 19.02.2021 but they were not produced in course of trial,
therefore, the defence had no opportunity to cross-examine them on material aspects of the matter.
29. This Court further finds that in this case, police submitted chargesheet on which cognizance was
taken by the learned Special Court on 02.07.2021 but by that date, the FSL Report had not come.
The FSL Report seems to have been prepared only on 26.04.2022 and it was called from the
prosecution by order of the court on 23.11.2022.
30. This Court further finds that in course of trial at the time when the prosecution evidence was on
the verge of closure on 09.11.2022, the 16 bundles material exhibits were produced by the
prosecution. On the same day, PW-7 was examined and the material exhibits were marked 'M1' to
'M16'. It is evident from the deposition of PW-7 that he is Arun Kumar Ram, Chaukidar of
Kuchaikate Police Station who had brought the seized exhibits from Thave Godown on the order of
Station House Officer of Kuchaikate Police Station. He has stated in his deposition that the material
exhibits were produced before the learned court on 19.12.2020. We have already recorded
hereinabove that the order dated 19.12.2020 nowhere shows so. It is evident from the records Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 that after seizure of the alleged ganja, no
certification of inventory was made and the sampling was not done either at the place of occurrence
in accordance with law or thereafter in terms of Sub- Section (2) of Section 52A of the NDPS Act. In
this regard, we would refer the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bharat
Aambale (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court has summerised the law relating to the search,
seizure and sampling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in the following words:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157368127/ 10
Toofani Ram vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
"50. We summarize our final conclusion as under:--
(I) Although Section 52A is primarily for the disposal and destruction of seized
contraband in a safe manner yet it extends beyond the immediate context of drug
disposal, as it serves a broader purpose of also introducing procedural safeguards in
the treatment of narcotics substance after seizure inasmuch as it provides for the
preparation of inventories, taking of photographs of the seized substances and
drawing samples therefrom in the presence and with the certification of a magistrate.
Mere drawing of samples in presence of a gazetted officer would not constitute
sufficient compliance of the mandate under Section 52A sub-section (2) of the NDPS
Act.
(II) Although, there is no mandate that the drawing of samples from the seized
substance must take place at the time of seizure as held in Mohanlal (supra), yet we
are of the opinion that the process of inventorying, photographing and drawing
samples of the seized substance shall as far as possible, take place in the presence of
the accused, though the same may not be done at the very spot of seizure.
(III) Any inventory, photographs or samples of seized substance prepared in
substantial compliance of the procedure prescribed under Section 52A of the NDPS
Act and the Rules/Standing Order(s) thereunder would have to be mandatorily
treated as primary evidence as Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023
dt.15-10-2025 per Section 52A subsection (4) of the NDPS Act, irrespective of
whether the substance in original is actually produced before the court or not. (IV)
The procedure prescribed by the Standing Order(s)/Rules in terms of Section 52A of
the NDPS Act is only intended to guide the officers and to see that a fair procedure is
adopted by the officer in-
charge of the investigation, and as such what is required is substantial compliance of the procedure
laid therein.
(V) Mere non-compliance of the procedure under Section 52A or the Standing Order(s)/Rules
thereunder will not be fatal to the trial unless there are discrepancies in the physical evidence
rendering the prosecution's case doubtful, which may not have been there had such compliance
been done. Courts should take a holistic and cumulative view of the discrepancies that may exist in
the evidence adduced by the prosecution and appreciate the same more carefully keeping in mind
the procedural lapses. (VI) If the other material on record adduced by the prosecution, oral or
documentary inspires confidence and satisfies the court as regards the recovery as-well as conscious
possession of the contraband from the accused persons, then even in such cases, the courts can
without hesitation proceed to hold the accused guilty notwithstanding any procedural defect in
terms of Section 52A of the NDPS Act.
(VII) Non-compliance or delayed compliance of the said provision or rules thereunder may lead the
court to drawing an adverse inference against the prosecution, however no hard and fast rule can be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/157368127/ 11
Toofani Ram vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
laid down as to when such inference may be drawn, and it would all depend on the peculiar facts and
circumstances of each case.
(VIII) Where there has been lapse on the part of the police in either following the procedure laid
down in Section 52A of the NDPS Act or the prosecution in proving the same, it will not be
appropriate for the court to resort to the statutory presumption of commission of an offence from
the possession of illicit material under Section 54 of the NDPS Act, unless the court is otherwise
satisfied as regards the seizure or recovery of such material from the accused persons from the other
material on record.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025 (IX) The initial burden will lie on the
accused to first lay the foundational facts to show that there was non- compliance of Section 52A,
either by leading evidence of its own or by relying upon the evidence of the prosecution, and the
standard required would only be preponderance of probabilities.
(X) Once the foundational facts laid indicate non- compliance of Section 52A of the NDPS Act, the
onus would thereafter be on the prosecution to prove by cogent evidence that either (i) there was
substantial compliance with the mandate of Section 52A of the NDPS Act OR (ii) satisfy the court
that such non- compliance does not affect its case against the accused, and the standard of proof
required would be beyond a reasonable doubt."
31. Recently, in the case of Surepally Srinivas versus The State of Andhra Pradesh (Now State of
Telangana ) reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC 683, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has once again
followed the same view with regard to the effect of non-compliance with the provisions of
Sub-Section (2) of Section 52A of the NDPS Act.
32. In ultimate analysis, we find that in this case, the prosecution is not able to prove the primary
evidence/documents such as seizure and sampling of the ganja in accordance with law. The basic
requirements as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to sustain the prosecution case are
lacking. In such circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that it would not be safe to sustain
the conviction of the appellants.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.406 of 2023 dt.15-10-2025
33. We, therefore, set aside the impugned judgment and order and acquit the appellants of the
charges giving them benefit of doubt.
34. The appellants are in jail, therefore, they shall be released forthwith if not wanted in any other
case.
35. This appeal is allowed.
36. Let the copy of this judgment together with the trial court's record be sent down.
