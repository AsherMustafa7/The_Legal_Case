consequential benefits;
V. Any other relief that the petitioner
may be found to be entitled to in the facts
and circumstances of the present case."
3. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that
pursuant to Advertisement No. 4 of 2018 dated 22.09.2018, the
petitioner had applied for the post of Senior Scientist and Head,
Krishi Vigyan Kendra against the seat reserved for a candidate
belonging to the Extremely Backward Category (EBC). It is
submitted that a person not belonging to the State of Bihar was
candidate for appointment against a post reserved for the
Extremely Backward Category. Accordingly, one Dr. Deokaran
Singh, son of Shri Gaya Dian, who was a resident of the State of
Uttar Pradesh, was appointed by wrongly extending the benefit
Patna High Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021 dt.14-10-2025
4/13
of reservation. Subsequently, realizing the irregularity in his
appointment, the said candidate did not join the post, and as
such, the post continues to remain vacant till date, from the date
of recommendation and his consequential provisional
appointment.
4. It is next submitted that the reasons assigned in the
impugned order as contained in Memo No. 1982 dated
13.01.2021
, at serial no. 5, stating that the application of the petitioner could not be considered as the period of
validity of the panel had expired, is wholly untenable. The petitioner, immediately within a month of
preparation of merit penal and upon learning that the name of Dr. Deokaran had been
recommended for appointment against the EBC post, submitted several representations including a
representation dated 25.07.2019 before respondent no. 4, referring to the provisions of the Bihar
Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services (for SCs, STs and OBCs) Act, 1991, and bringing to
notice that Dr. Deokaran, being a resident of Uttar Pradesh, was not entitled to reservation benefit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13673828/ 3
Dr. Ashok Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
These representations have been annexed as Annexure-4 series to the writ petition.
5. Pursuant to such representations, the University, vide letter no. 692 dated 01.08.2019 issued by
the Director Patna High Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021 dt.14-10-2025 (Administration), instructed
the petitioner to submit an affidavit in support of his assertions within 15 days. The petitioner duly
complied and filed an affidavit (appended at page 40 of the writ petition). However, it appears that
the exercise directed to be carried out by the petitioner, which having been complied but was never
considered.
6. Learned counsel for the respondent University, on the other hand during the course of hearing
has referred to paragraphs 7 to 11 of the counter affidavit and submitted that the petitioner could not
be appointed as he had secured marks lower than other candidates in the merit list. It is submitted
that one Dr. Bipul Kumar Mandal, who scored 65.03 out of 100 marks, was appointed, while Dr.
Deokaran Singh had secured 56.02 marks, and the petitioner had obtained only 55.47 marks out of
100 in the Extremely Backward Category. It is further submitted that the Selection Committee
prepared the merit list on the basis of current and backlog vacancies and did not find any candidate
fit for inclusion in the waiting list. Accordingly, the petitioner's grievance was rejected by the
Grievance Redressal Committee vide order impugned at Annexure-17, page 114.
7. At this stage, learned counsel for the University Patna High Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021
dt.14-10-2025 submits that the petitioner's representation may be directed to be considered afresh,
since the vacancy created due to non-joining of Dr. Deokaran still exists.
8. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and upon perusal of the record, this Court finds that
the entire confusion was created with the illegal appointment of Dr. Deokaran, who never joined the
post and whose appointment was also never confirmed, as is evident from paragraph 10 of the
counter affidavit. The materials on record show that immediately after Dr. Deokaran was
recommended for appointment from the merit list (Annexure-15), the petitioner made
representation before the University authorities, which was under consideration for a considerable
period, and the final rejection order was communicated only after about one and a half years.
Hence, the plea of the University that the panel had expired after one year is wholly unacceptable,
particularly when the University itself continued to entertain and process the petitioner's claim as
against the vacant post of EBC. The delay being attributable to the inaction of the University, the
petitioner cannot be penalized for the same.
9. Learned counsel for the University, does not dispute the fact that after the recommendation for
appointment against Patna High Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021 dt.14-10-2025 the EBC category
having been made in respect of Dr. Devkaran, the said candidate was issued a letter to submit
requisite documents for availing benefit of reservation, which he did not provide to the University
and further he did not join the said post against which the appointment was made. It has also not
been disputed by the learned counsel representing the University that the vacancy under EBC
category which was notified for being filled up by a suitable candidate from the merit list so
prepared, remained vacant since the date of recommendation and consequential provisional
appointment, which was never confirmed and as such eligible candidate next to Dr. Devkaran was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13673828/ 4
Dr. Ashok Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
Dr. Ashok Kumar, who is the petitioner in this case and therefore, subject to fulfillment of other
conditions on merit, this petitioner was entitled to the said post.
10. In the case of Manoj Manu and Others vs Union of India reported in (2013) 12 SCC 171, the
Hon'ble Apex Court has held that a decision not to fill up the post or the vacancies must be
supported with valid reasons and based on sound, rational and consistent and decision of the
authorities with full application of mind but in the present case, there is no such decision where the
authorities with valid reason have decided not to fill-up the said post under EBC category, for which
Dr. Patna High Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021 dt.14-10-2025 Deokaran was not legally entitled, and
knowingly he did not join the post realising the consequence, as such, the appointing authority was
under legal obligation to have recommended the next candidate for the said post. Rather, the reason
for not filling up the vacancy has arisen only because of inaction by the authorities of the University
in deciding the representation filed by the petitioner and because of the delay caused by the
University in deciding the claim, the period of validity of the panel got expired and the same is now
being made a reason by the University for not considering the case of the petitioner and in view of
settled legal position, the authority of the University cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate
at the same time, when it was a legal duty of the authorities under University to have acted
immediately after the recommended candidate having been found not eligible, in view of his
inability having been communicated in submitting the requisite documents, showing his bona fide
to hold the post of EBC vide his communication dated 24/9/2019.
11. In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances where the authorities of the University continued
to consider the case of the petitioner which was ultimately decided not to consider in the year 2021
by indicating a reason that panel prepared with Patna High Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021
dt.14-10-2025 respect to appointment has become more than a year old and no appointment from
the said panel can be made, is wholly unsustainable ground and is contrary to the dictum of Hon'ble
Apex Court and deserves to be interfered with by directing the petitioner's candidature for its
consideration as per his eligibility for which the counsel for the University has submitted that the
representation which is pending can be directed to be considered in accordance with law.
12. Admittedly, in the present case, the name of the petitioner finds place in the merit panel, which
has been prepared by the appointing authority. But, for the reason indicated hereinabove that a
person who was not legally entitled to the benefit of reservation was allowed appointment against
the reserved post and on his non-joining, the post of EBC remained unfilled and the petitioner's
representation was considered and being entertained at the level of the appointing authority by
asking the petitioner to submit requisite documents through affidavit, which having been complied
by this petitioner and because of the timely action having not been taken by the appointing
authority, the period of one year was consumed and the appointment as against the post advertised,
in the reserved category could not be offered to him despite being eligible to the Patna High Court
CWJC No.12457 of 2021 dt.14-10-2025 said post.
13. In view of judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court as rendered in the case of R.S. Mittal vs Union of
India reported in (1995) Supplementary 2 SCC 230, wherein it has been held that it can safely be
declared that a person on the select panel has no vested right to be appointed to the post for which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13673828/ 5
Dr. Ashok Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
he has been selected, but the appointing authority cannot ignore the select panel or on its whims
decline to make the appointment, when a person has been selected by the duly constituted Selection
body and there is a vacancy which can be offered to him, keeping in view his merit position, then,
ordinarily, there would be no justification to ignore him for appointment. There has to be a
justifiable reason to decline to appoint a person, who is in the select panel.
14. It is worth to refer judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in Malik Mazhar Sultan and Anr.
vs. U.P. Public Service Commission & Ors reported in (2008) 17 SCC 703 wherein it has been held
that the vacancy ought to be filled up in the same examination process and taking cue from the
same, this Hon'ble Court in the case of Akash Kumar vs. the State of Bihar and Ors passed in CWJC
No. 1586 of 2013 dated 18.04.2023 has directed the following, which is quoted herein Patna High
Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021 dt.14-10-2025 below :
"Be that as it may, because of non-joining of one Ashish Chandra, one position
definitely falls vacant which should go to the first of the Backward category candidate
who has obtained 536 marks and in this case the candidate is one Nishant Ranjan."
15. And accordingly, in the aforesaid case, the Hon'ble Division Bench directed the State to take a
decision to this effect and same be communicated to the Commission for doing needful.
16. In the present case, it's mere inaction on the part of the appointing authority to have
immediately addressed the issues after it was realized by them that a wrong person has been
recommended but that having not been done and no prudent reason has been assigned as to why the
appointment as against the post of EBC was not offered expeditiously to this petitioner , who was
next to Dr. Deokaran and as such, the approach of the University, is wholly unjustifiable and is
unsustainable in law, in rejecting the claim by assigning a reason, which is contrary to law.
17. Accordingly, this Court finds the grounds taken for Patna High Court CWJC No.12457 of 2021
dt.14-10-2025 rejection of the petitioner's claim to be unsustainable and contrary to the settled legal
position. Consequently, Annexure- 17, to the extent it relates to the petitioner as contained in Memo
No. 1982 dated 13/01/2021, is set aside. The respondent University is directed to consider the
petitioner's representation afresh, keeping in view that the post in question remains vacant due to
wrong recommendation of Dr. Deokaran, who having not fulfilled the criteria for claiming
reservation, did not join the post and the post under EBC category remained vacant since the date of
his recommendation. So the petitioner being next in the merit becomes eligible to the said post in
his category and accordingly his case is required to be considered in accordance with law laid down
in this regard.
18. Consequently, the University shall, therefore, examine the eligibility of the petitioner in the light
of the materials available on record as well as and the merit list, prepared against the said
advertisement and if it is found that the petitioner is eligible for appointment against the said post,
necessary orders shall be passed and communicated within a period of eight weeks from the date of
receipt or production of this order. While doing so, the authorities shall also consider the
petitioner's claim for consequential benefits, including continuity of service, Patna High Court
