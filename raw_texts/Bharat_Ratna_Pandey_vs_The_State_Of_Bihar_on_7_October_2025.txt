Bharat Ratna Pandey vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
16.07.2025 and found to be the lowest bidder (L1) when the financial bid opened on
22.07.2025. However, on 23.07.2025, the Technical Bid Evaluation Committee
reviewed and disqualified him citing an error in the affidavit of not Patna High Court
CWJC No.13744 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025 mentioning name of the work in compliance
to clause 4.4 (b) ii of the ITB of the CMBD and decided to re-tender. The petitioner
filed an objection on 24.07.2025 before the Principal Secretary, RWD, Bihar and
further on 30.07.2025 sent a legal notice to the respondent authorities to declare
petitioner technically qualified. Finally the petitioner had filed this writ petition
challenging the review order dated 23.07.2025."
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that defective affidavit filed in support of the writ
application dated 07.05.2025 is a curable in the light of Clauses-19.1, 24.1, 24.2 and 25.1. In support
of the aforementioned contention, he is relying on a Coordinate Bench decision in C.W.J.C.
No.12254 of 2024 (M/s Jay Mata Di Enterprises and others Versus The State of Bihar and others)
decided on 04.10.2024 on the issue of substantial compliance and so also relying on a decision in
the case of BVG India Ltd. & Ors. Versus State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 2023(6) BLJ 656
(Paragraphs-7, 53, 55, 56 to 59).
4. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents resisted the aforementioned contentions
that affidavit dated 07.05.2025 in paragraph-2, it is left blank. It is a serious defect that too in the
form of affidavit. The same cannot Patna High Court CWJC No.13744 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025 be
rectified in the light of Clause-4.4B which specifically provide for filing affidavit on behalf of the
bidder. The cited various clauses in the NIT read with the cited decisions have no application to the
facts of the case. Further, it is submitted that affidavit dated 07.05.2025 cannot be cured subsequent
to the last date of submission of application.
5. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties.
6. Core issue involved in the present lis is whether the defect in the affidavit dated 07.05.2025 would
be curable at this distance of time or not?
Paragraph-2 of the affidavit dated 07.05.2025 reads as under:
"2. That I the undersigned, do hereby certify that if the contract for the work
namely______________________is awarded than I shall deploy and provide
necessary document in support of Key personnel to meet the following requirement
before Agreement:-
Sr. Position No. Educational Experience Qualification in Road/ No. Bridge Work
(Years) 1 Road Manager 1 Graduate in 2 Civil Engg.
2 Bridge 1 Graduate in 5

7. The petitioner had left blank in respect of name of the work. It is a serious defect
and it is material information required for the purpose of consideration of
petitioner's bid application pursuant to the NIT. Therefore, the same cannot be cured
in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Prakash
Asphaltings and Toll Highways (India) Limited Versus Mandeepa Enterprises and
Others, reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1959 (Para-40 and 41). Para-40 and 41
reads as under:
"40. The above proposition has been followed by another three-Judge Bench of this
Court in the recent case of Subodh Kumar Singh Rathore v. Chief Executive Officer
[2024 SCC OnLine SC 1682], when it examined the concept of public interest in
administrative decisions relating to award of contracts. This Court held that even
assuming for a moment that there was technical fault in the tender, which if rectified
had the possibility of generating more revenue, the same by no stretch could Patna
High Court CWJC No.13744 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025 be said to be a cogent reason for
concealing an already existing tender. This Court highlighted the importance of
maintaining the sanctity of tenders in governmental procurement processes. Public
tenders are the cornerstone of governmental procurement processes, being
competitive and ensuring fairness and transparency in the allocation of public
resources. Public tenders are designed to provide a level playing field for all potential
bidders, fostering an environment where competition thrives. The integrity of this
process ensures that public projects and resources are delivered efficiently and
effectively, benefiting the society at large. Therefore, sanctity of public tenders and
contract is a fundamental principle that underpins the stability and predictability of
legal and commercial relationships. Infact this Court put in a word of caution that
considerations of public interest should not be narrowly confined to financial aspect
only.
41. Applying the above legal principles to the facts of the present case, we are of the
view that the Division Bench of the High Court clearly fell in error in directing
respondent No. 2 to 4 to allow rectification of the financial bid of respondent No. 1 by
treating the amount Patna High Court CWJC No.13744 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025
offered by it as the per day figure and on that basis to compute the total amount for
the entire contractual period of 1095 days. Such an exercise is clearly impermissible
having regard to the terms and conditions of the contract which are required to be
understood on the anvil of this Court's judgments. The authority granted to the
tendering authority by clause 5B (v) of the Instruction to Bidders cannot be stretched
to construe the price bid of respondent No. 1 as the per day offer, contrary to the bid
declaration of respondent No. 1 itself, and thereafter, on that basis to work out a new
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4721111/ 4
Bharat Ratna Pandey vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
bid amount for the entire contractual period making it the highest. In the present
case, respondent No. 1 was not at all vigilant; rather, it displayed a very casual
approach. In such circumstances, clause 5B(v) cannot be invoked to resurrect the bid
of respondent No. 1 to make it H1. Clause 5B(v) of the Instruction to Bidders has to
read conjointly with clause 4(g) of the notice inviting electronic bid."
8. In the light of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforementioned
decision, the petitioner cannot overcome defect in the affidavit dated 07.05.2025 so as to claim the
relief in the present writ petition. The cited decisions and relevant clauses on behalf of the Patna
High Court CWJC No.13744 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025 petitioner cannot be taken into consideration in
the light of the fact that the petitioner has committed glaring mistake by filing affidavit on
07.05.2025 while leaving paragraph-2 viz., name of the work as blank.
9. In the light of these facts and circumstances, the petitioner has not made out a case.
10. Accordingly, instant writ petition stands dismissed.
11. Pending Interlocutory Application(s), if any, stands disposed of.
