JUDGMENT
This Criminal Appeal had been filed seeking to set aside the Judgment dated 20.04.2016 in
S.C.No.74 of 2014 on the file of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri.
2. The brief facts, which are necessary for the disposal of this Court, are as follows:
2.1. The Complainant's elder sister's husband/Ponnusamy was the Pump Operator of
the Panchayat. Five years prior to the date of occurrence, the uncle of the
Complainant/Shanmugam, S/o. Mari @ Puttan wanted his son to be a Pump
Operator. On snatching the key of the pump room attached to the Panchayat Office
from the Pump Operator, the brother-in-law of the Complainant had handed over the
same to his man/Murugan and asked him to operate the pump room. Also, in the
Panchayat Office, there was a TV room for common public. The TV Operator job was
with the elder brother of P.W-1 by name Venu, P.W-2. Therefore, he was responsible
for switching on the TV. On those days, the T.V programmes telecast between 6 p.m.,
and 9 p.m. Since the TV Operators room key was with P.W-2, the members of the
family of P.W-2 were operating the TV on every evening.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
Like the present day, 24 x 7 TV programmes were not available and it was restricted between 6 p.m.,
and 9 p.m.,. The paternal uncle of P.W-1 and P.W-2 namely Shanmugam had objected to the control
of TV operating room with the family of P.W-1 and P.W-2. He wanted it to be under his custody.
Already, he had snatched the post of water motor Pump Operator by snatching the key from the
brother-in-law of P.W-1 and P.W-2. While situation was such that, on 23.03.1998 by around 9.30
p.m., the uncle of P.W-1 and P.W-2 viz., Shanmugam came along with his men and friend stating
that the TV room should not be operated by him/P.W-2. If he violates it, he will be finished off. On
such a threat, P.W-2 replied that he would hand over the keys of TV operator's room to the
Panchayat President on the next day, from whom the uncle of P.W-1 and P.W-2, can take back the
keys. Immediately, Shanmugam locked the TV room with the lock brought by him and P.W-2 went
to his elder brother/Palani and informed him that Shanmugam locked the TV room. Palani
immediately came back to the TV operators room and asked who had locked the TV room and also
he sought the key for opening the lock. At that time, A-1, A-7 and A-5 threatened P.W- 2 that “We
will do what we want to do”. P.W-2-Venu went near the TV https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (

room. At that time, the above stated persons, A-1, A-5 and A-7 caught hold of him and took him to
the backside of the TV room by shouting “you get lost”, the uncle of P.W-1 and P.W-2/A-1 attacked
P.W-2/Venu on the head with an iron rod. A-5 Thangaraj hit P.W-1/Dhanapal on the head with

wooden stick and with the same stick, he also hit behind the backside head of P.W-2 Venu. A-3
Anbazhagan attacked P.W-2 Venu on the back and on the left side of the body with iron pipe. A-6
attacked with iron rod on the hand of P.W-2 causing injuries on his left thumb. A-12-
Dharmalingam pulled P.W-2 by his hair and pushed him to the ground. On seeing this, the father of
P.W-1 and P.W-2 came to the rescue of his son. At that time, A-1 hit his brother/Govindan, the
father of P.W-1 and P.W-2 on the head by uttering “You get lost”. Immediately, P.W-1 and P.W-2
caught hold of the father who had lost conscious and about to fall. Therefore, P.W-1 and P.W-2
caught hold their father and rescued him and moved out from the scene of occurrence. A-3, A-4 and
A-6 hit the father of P.W-1 and P.W-2 on the chest with wooden sticks. A-2 hit the father of P.W-1
and P.W-2 on the wrist with bamboo pole.
2.2. On seeing this, sister-in-law of P.W-1 came out rushing to the rescue of P.W-1 and father. On
seeing her rushing towards P.W-1 and P.W- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:

2, A-8 caught hold on her and pushed her to the ground. She was also attacked by A-8 on her back
and A-1 attacked her with iron rod on the left thigh. On seeing this, A-4, son of P.W-2 came to the
rescue of P.W-1. P.W- 4 also attacked by A-6 with iron rod. A-7 attacked on the head of P.W-4. Also
they attacked the Complainant P.W-1 who had resisted it. A-2 attacked P.W-1 with iron pipe and this

father of P.W-1 and P.W-2, he was attacked on his back by A-1. The father of P.W-1 and P.W-2 cried
in pain. At that time, since buses were not available, P.W-1 and P.W-2 had accompanied in the

2.4. The learned Judicial Magistrate had committed the case to the Court of the learned Sessions
Judge. On appearance of the Accused before the learned Sessions Judge, the learned Sessions Judge
had framed charges under Sections 147 against Accused 3 to 5 and 7 to 13; Section 148 against
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
Accused 1 to 3 and 6; Section 302 against Accused-1 alone; Section 302 r/w 149 against Accused 2 to

Accused 3 and 6); Section 324 against Accused-4, 5, 8 to 10, 12 and 13; Section 325 against
Accused-7 alone. The Accused denied the charges and claimed to be tried. Therefore, the learned

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 5
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
Board for imposing sentence.
3. Aggrieved by the judgment of conviction and sentence, the Accused 1 to 6 and 8 had filed this
Criminal Appeal.
4. The learned Counsel appearing for the first Appellant has https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
invited the attention of this Court to the cross-examination of the prosecution witness examined
before the trial Court, wherein, P.W-14 Dr.Jeyaraman admitted that on the same day of occurrence,
Accused-5 Thangaraj was also admitted in hospital for the injuries. The learned Counsel for the first
Appellant has also submitted that inspite of the evidence available in the cross-examination that the
Accused were also injured in the same incident, the prosecution was unable to explain the injuries
on the Accused.
5. The learned Trial Judge had rejected the defence of the Accused stating that the evidence of the
Doctor/P.W-14 who had issued Ex.D-1 Wound Certificate to the Accused-5 Thangaraj, is
unacceptable, since he had retired from service and was employed in a private hospital.
6. It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the first Appellant that there is evidence available
before the Trial Court that from the group clash between two groups, the prosecution witnesses as
well as Accused have suffered injuries, whereas the prosecution failed to place all the materials fairly
before the Trial Court, which led to miscarriage of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
justice.
7. The learned Counsel for the first Appellant has also invited the attention of this Court to the fact
that the 5th Accused Thangaraj was injured and he has also given complaint. Based on it,
prosecution witnesses were shown as the Accused in the counter-complaint. Ex.D-5, is the copy of
the First Information Report, which was registered at Harur Police Station based on the complaint
given by the said Thangaraj 5th Appellant herein.
8. It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the first Appellant that the finding of guilt by the
learned Trial Judge is perverse as the learned Trial Judge failed to appreciate the fact that the
Accused had also been injured in the group clash. Inspite of the evidence available before the Trial
Court, during the cross-examination of the prosecution evidence and the evidence on the defence of
D.W-1 to D.W-4, particularly in paragraph No.45 of the Judgment, the observation of the learned
Trial Judge with reference to Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-5, is perverse.
9. Further, the learned Counsel for the first Appellant also invited https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 6
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
the attention of this Court to the charges framed by the trial Court which mentioned the time of
occurrence in Ex.D-5 First Information Report marked on the part of the accused, which is perverse
.
10. In support of his contention, the learned Counsel for the first Appellant relied on the following
reported rulings:
10.1. In 1954 MWN (Cr) 9 in the case of Thota Ramakrishnayya & Ors., Vs. The State
this Court had observed as under:
“39. ... The net result of this analysis is that the prosecution evidence in this case for
bringing home the offence to the accused consists of partisan evidence unsifted by
investigation, lopsided in its presentation in court and incapable of being properly
tested by reason of not committing to the sessions court both the case and the
counter.
40. In these circumstances it cannot be legitimately held that the prosecution has
brought home the offences to the accused persons with which they stood charged and
for which they nave been convicted. The accused are entitled to the benefit of the
reasonable doubt arising from the aforesaid factors & their convictions and sentences
are set aside and they are acquitted and these appeals are allowed.” 10.2. In AIR 1957
SC 614 in the case of Vadivelu Thevar and Ors., Vs. State of Madras the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has observed as follows:
“12. In the first category of proof, the court should have no difficulty in coming to its
conclusion either way — it may convict or may acquit on the testimony of a single
witness, if it is found to be above reproach or suspicion of interestedness,
incompetence or subornation. In the second https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
category, the court equally has no difficulty in coming to its conclusion. It is in the
third category of cases, that the court has to be circumspect and has to look for
corroboration in material particulars by reliable testimony, direct or circumstantial.
There is another danger in insisting on plurality of witnesses. Irrespective of the
quality of the oral evidence of a single witness, if courts were to insist on plurality of
witnesses in proof of any fact, they will be indirectly encouraging subornation of
witnesses. Situations may arise and do arise where only a single person is available to
give evidence in support of a disputed fact. The court naturally has to weigh carefully
such a testimony and if it is satisfied that the evidence is reliable and free from all
taints which tend to render oral testimony open to suspicion, it becomes its duty to
act upon such testimony. The law reports contain many precedents where the court
had to depend and act upon the testimony of a single witness in support of the
prosecution. There are exceptions to this rule, for example, in cases of sexual offences
or of the testimony of an approver; both these are cases in which the oral testimony
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 7
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
is, by its very nature, suspect, being that of a participator in crime. But, where there
are no such exceptional reasons operating, it becomes the duty of the court to convict,
if it is satisfied that the testimony of a single witness is entirely reliable. We have
therefore, no reasons to refuse to act upon the testimony of the first witness, which is
the only reliable evidence in support of the prosecution.” 10.3. In 1976 (4) SCC 394 in
the case of Lakshmi Singh and Others Vs. State of Bihar the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has observed as under:
“18. Thus in view of the inherent improbabilities, the serious omissions and
infirmities, the Interested or inimical nature of the evidence and other circumstances
point- ed out by us, we are clearly of the I opinion that the prosecution has miserably
failed to prove the case against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Normally
this Court i does not interfere in an appeal by i special leave with concurrent finding
of fact, but this is one of these cases where the judgment of the High Court is
manifestly perverse and where the High Court has not considered important
circumstances which completely demolish the prosecution case. In fact the High
Court has hardly made any real attempt to analyse or discuss the evidence and
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm )
.Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
has merely affirmed the finding of the Sessions Judge by narrating the evidence
relied upon by it. We have already pointed out that on one of the most important
points arising in : a criminal trial, namely, the non-explanation of the injuries on the
person of the accused by the prosecution, the High Court has not only committed an
error of fact but an error of law by showing a lack of proper appreciation of the
principles decided by this Court. For these reasons, therefore, we think! there are
special circumstances in the present case which have compelled us to interfere in this
appeal by special leave.” 10.4. In 1987 L.W. (Cri) 400 in the case of Pandurangan Vs.
The State by Inspector of Police, Thirukazhukundram this Court has held as under:
“Held – There is no definition of the term 'case and counter case'. The term in its
general important stands for cases registered on the basis of rival versions of the
same incident. The same incident may not form a single incident, but also constitute
several incidents in the course of the same transaction. To call a series of acts as acts
that have taken lace in the course of the same transaction, there must be a connection
between the series of acts before they could be regarded as forming part of the same
transaction. If several acts committed by several persons, say in a case of a riot, may
show unity of purpose or design so as to indicate a strong circumstances that, those
acts form part of the same transaction. The connection between a series of acts seems
to be essential ingredient for those acts to constitute the 'same transactions'.
11. Relying on the above rulings, the learned Counsel for the first Appellant submitted that in the
above decisions, guidelines were given for being followed by the Investigation Officers in a case
relating to group clash. In this case, such guidelines have not been followed by the Investigation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 8
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
Officer as well as the Trial Judge. The prosecution also failed https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
to explain the injuries of the Accused-5 Thangaraj, therefore, the valid defence of the Accused is
probabilized before the Court. Therefore, the learned Counsel for the first Appellant seeks to set
aside the Judgment of conviction and order of sentence recorded by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Dharmapuri made in S.C.No.74 of 2014, dated 20.04.2016.
12. The learned Counsel appearing for Appellants Nos.2 to 7 would submit that he adopts the same
submissions made by the learned Counsel for the first Appellant.
13. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the occurrence took place in the year
1998. It was with regard to one party asking the another party not to switch on the T.V. as there had
been enmity between the two groups in the village. Both groups are related to each other. They are
relatives. The Complainant's elder sister's husband, as a Pump Operator in the Panchayat was
employed. The complainant had preferred the Complaint.
14. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor further submitted that
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
the Accused had taken the plea of the defence that they were attacked by the Prosecution Witnesses.
Also, in support of defence of the Accused, the Accused examined witnesses D.W1 to D.W-4 and
marked documents Ex.D1-1 to Ex.D-5. On completion of trial, arguments were heard. Based on the
arguments, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri, had on appreciation of facts held
the whole Accused guilty. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor invited the attention of this
Court to the judgment of the learned trial Judge wherein the learned trial Judge had clearly stated
that the Accused filed Petition seeking to adduce additional evidence, that was dismissed. The
evidence of the Prosecution Witnesses were accepted and attempt of the Accused to let in evidence
and to mark additional documents was rejected. The Accused were examined as D.W-1 to D.W-4
and documents Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-5 were marked. The learned trial Judge had rejected the contention
of the learned Counsel for the Accused stating that to escape from the criminal liability, the Accused
voluntarily obtained documents as though they were attacked. The learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Dharmapuri, had rejected the contention of the learned Counsel for the Accused and had
convicted the Accused for the offence under Sections, 147, 148, 302, 302 r/w 149, 307, 324 and 325
of IPC. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of
2016.
15. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor invited the attention of this Court to the Judgment of
the learned trial Judge who had appreciated the facts and had arrived at a just conclusion by
Judgment dated 20.04.2016, by convicting the Accused. The arguments of the learned Counsel for
the Appellants is not at all be maintainable, as witnesses had clearly stated about what had
happened on the intervening night.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 9
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
16. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor also submitted that the occurrence took place on
23.03.1998 at about 9.30 p.m.,the trial could not be conducted early, due to the dilatory tactics of
the Accused. The trial commenced only in the year 2015. Therefore, there are minor contradictions
which cannot be taken as an advantage by the Accused. There is medical evidence through Doctors
and the learned Additional Sessions Judge had rejected the theory of the Accused that the Accused
had also suffered injuries and for the death caused to the father of P.W-1 and P.W-2, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri, had convicted the Accused for the offence under Section
304 (1) of IPC. The Judgment of conviction recorded by the learned trial Judge is a well-reasoned
order. Therefore, this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm )
.Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
Appeal lacks merits and is to be dismissed.
Point for consideration:
Whether the Judgment dated 20.04.2016 in S.C.No.74 of 2014 on the file of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri, is to be to set aside as perverse?
17. Perused the evidence of Prosecution Witnesses viz., P.W-1 to P.W-19 and the documents under
Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-17 and Defence Witnesses viz., D.W-1 to D.W-4 and documents on the side of defence
under Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-5 and the Judgment of the learned Sessions Judge in S.C.No.74 of 2014, dated
20.04.2016. On perusal of the evidence of P.W-1 and P.W-2, it is found that they had cogently
narrated the occurrence and that all of them are relatives. In the cross-examination, it was stated
that on the same day, the Accused were attacked by the Prosecution Witnesses that was effected in
the cross-examination. P.W-14-Doctor who had issued wound certificates to P.W-1 and P.W-2 and
marked as Ex.P-8 and Ex.P-9 had admitted in his cross-examination that he had issued Ex.D-1 to
Accused-5. On the same day, Ex.D-2 to Accused-7, Ex.D-3 to Govindammal, relative of the
Prosecution Witness. Also, the Investigation Officer P.W-18 and P.W-19
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
had in their cross-examination admitted that on the same day of occurrence, the Accused had also
preferred the complaint which was registered as FIR in Cr.No.335/1998 for the offence under
Section 394 of IPC. The FIR was registered on the same day and the occurrence time is shown as in
Ex.P-17. It is true that there had been clashes between two groups. The victim is the father of P.W-1
and P.W-2, the victim had suffered death due to the attack of A-1. The fact that the Accused also
suffered is found acceptable. From the evidence, the fact that the Accused also underwent treatment
for the injuries caused by the Prosecution Witnesses are available in Ex.D-1 and Ex.D-2. When there
is a case and a case in counter, the Investigation Officer is to investigate fairly and file charge sheet
in both the cases fairly before the Court.
18. As per Order No.566 of Tamil Nadu Police Standing Orders, the Investigation Officer has two
options (i) to investigate fairly and find out who is the aggressor and who is the victim, based on
which, one FIR can be closed or to close both the FIRs. (ii) When the Investigation Officer is unable
to arrive at a conclusion as to who the victim is and who the aggressor is, they either close both the

cases or investigate both the FIRs https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025
05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
and file appropriate charge sheet before the Judicial Magistrate concerned. Here in this case, there
is no explanation regarding the FIR preferred by the Accused, registered in Cr.No.335/1998.
P.W-14-Doctor had clearly stated that on the same day, Accused-5 also came for treatment. He also
issued wound certificate which was marked during the course of evidence of Doctor.
19. On appreciation of evidence, the learned trial Judge had stated clearly that the wound certificate
was marked under Ex.D-1 to Accused-1 and Ex.D-2 to Accused-7 and Ex.D-3 to Govindammal who
is not an Accused and who is a relative of the family of the Accused and who is the Witness for the
Defence. On cross-examination of D.W-4, he had stated in his cross-examination that Ex.D-1 wound
certificate of D.W-4 was obtained from the private Hospital of Dr.Jayaraman. He had retired from
Government Service. To the pointed question that whether D.W-4 had obtained seal from the
Government Hospital regarding wound certificate issued by Dr.Jayaraman under Ex.D-4, it is stated
that he had not obtained seal. Therefore, it was suggested by the learned Public Prosecutor before
the trial Court that the Accused/A-5 was not at all treated in the Government
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
Hospital either at Harur or Dharmapuri which he had denied. Only as a defence, the documents had
been obtained surreptitiously from the Doctor who had treated the Witnesses P.W-1 and P.W-2 in
the Government Hospital. The suggestion that after his retirement, he was working in a Private
Hospital, was denied by D.W-4/Accused-5. Therefore, the learned Judge had discussed about the
defence of the Accused that in the clashes, the Accused also suffered injuries and therefore, the
Prosecution had not placed fairly all the materials before the trial Court. Under those circumstances,
the Prosecution case has to be rejected was not accepted by the learned trial Judge on the ground
that the documents under Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-3 were obtained long after the occurrence, after the
retirement of P.W- 14-Doctor.
20. On perusal of the evidence, the Doctor who had issued Ex.P-6- wound certificate of P.W-2,
Ex.P-7-wound certificate of P.W-4, Ex.P-8- wound certificate of P.W-1 and Ex.P-9-wound certificate
of P.W-3 had admitted in cross examination that he had issued wound certificates to Accused-5 and
Accused-7. Ex.D-1 is the wound certificate of A-7-Juvenile in this case and Ex.D-3 is the wound
certificate for D.W-1 in which cross- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025
05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
examination of Doctor clearly admitted that he had issued it after his retirement. When A-5 and A-7
requested to issue wound certificate to the pointed question by the learned Public Prosecutor before
the trial Court, ater his retirement, he had in obedience to issue as though he issued as Medical
Officer by the Government, he claims ignorance of such act. He also added to verify the records of
the Government Hospital to be issued to A-5 to A-7. Had it been so, the defence ought to have
summoned the documents from the Government Hospital containing particulars regarding the
registration number of those who had been admitted or treated in the Government Hospital with the
records maintained in the Government Hospital either at Harur or Dharmapuri. The Accused in this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 11
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
case could have done so. Therefore, the learned Judge had on appreciation of evidence from the
cross-examination of D.W-4 and re-examination of P.W-14-Doctor, after the documents were shown
to him admitted that he had issued it after his retirement. The documents marked as Ex.D-1 to
Ex.D-3 does not have seal of the Government Hospital. Under those circumstances, the learned trial
Judge had on appreciation of evidence arrived at a conclusion that the Accused had created
documents to set the defence and rejected the contention of the Accused that they also suffered
injuries. In the light of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50
pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
appreciation of evidence, the learned Judge had rejected the evidence let in by the D.W-1 to D.W-4
as they suffered injuries.
21. It is to be noted that the documents under Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-3- wound certificates of A-5 to A-7 and
relative of the Accused were obtained after the retirement of P.W-14-Doctor. He had in his
re-examination, after cross-examination of the defence witnesses by the learned Public Prosecutor
admitted that he had retired on 31.01.2008. The Ex.D-1 is signed on 20.12.2014 and it contains the
seal and sign. On that date, how the wound certificate was obtained was stated by the A-5/D.W-4.
During cross- examination he stated that he obtained wound certificate from the Government
Hospital. If it had been true, it should contain the name of the Doctor, date of admission and date of
discharge. Further, if the records are available in the Hospital, they should have summoned the
documents from the Government Hospital. It is to be noted that the date on which the victims
suffered injuries were on 23.03.1998 whereas the documents under Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-3 were issued on
20.12.2014. After the alleged occurrence in the absence of original records will be produced before
the Government Hospital in the light of the evidence of P.W-14 in re-examination by the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
learned Public Prosecutor and in the light of the cross-examination of A-5 as D.W-4, the learned
Additional District Judge had rejected the defence of the Accused. Therefore, in the light of the
evidence of victims viz., P.W-1 to P.W-6 and P.W-10, the learned Judge had convicted the Accused
for the offence framed against them.
22. On perusal of the Judgment of the learned trial Judge, it is found that nothing is found perverse.
If the defence of the Accused had been true, the Investigation Officer would have dropped the FIR
marked in Ex.D-4 and Ex.D-5 and would not have proceeded further. That be so the Accused in this
case should have approached the learned Judicial Magistrate and proceeded further, either by filing
protest petition or private complaint. The injuries suffered by D.W-4 is found to be only simple
injury whereas the injury caused on the father of P.W-1 and P.W-2 resulted in death. Therefore, the
Accused in this case are aggressor as per the evidence available before the trial Court.
23. As per Police Standing Order, Investigation Officer has a discretion to investigate and lay the
final report either to drop the case as the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 12
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
complainants are aggressor and the other one aggressor, and proceed with the complaint or
investigation if it is found that the victim are aggressor. The Second option is that he has to close it
as not found true. Third option is that if both the parties have suffered injuries that resulted in
grievous injuries or death on both sides, it is to be proceeded with fair investigation and then lay the
final report before the Court concerned. It is for the Court after the conclusion of trial to arrive at a
conclusion as to who really the aggressor is and who the victim is, and to deliver judgment
accordingly and to punish the Accused for the offence. Here in this case, in the cross- examination of
P.W-17-Investigation officer who conducted investigation, had stated in the investigation to the
pointed question that two FIRs were registered but they are not proceeded with the investigation in
Cr.No.335/1998. He stated that he had on his investigation found that the Accused herein was the
aggressor. It is to be noted that the Investigation Officer had retired from service on the date of
examination of the Investigation Officer on 10.07.2015. In the cross-examination, he has stated that
the details regarding closure of Cr.No.335/1998 will be only on perusal of the original records from
the Police Station. He had given a clear statement that on his investigation, the Accused herein were
aggressors. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm )
.Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
Therefore, he had not proceeded with the Cr.No.335/1998 based on the complaint of A-5.
24. The learned Counsel for the Appellants Thiru.R.Sankarasubbu placed reliance on the reported
decision of the Hon'ble High Court in 1954- M.W.N.(Cr.) 9 [Thota Ramakrishnayya and others -vs-
The State] which was a case involving clash between two groups where one of the group alone was
proceeded against by the Investigation Officer in which there was evidence in the Court that it was a
group clash in which the Accused were also injured. In this case, there was evidence before the trial
Court that the Accused was also injured but the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri
rejected the evidence claiming it was made only for the purpose of defence.
25. It is true that the medical document under Ex.D-1 to D-3 were procured after the retirement of
Dr.Jayaraman. In the cross-examination the Investigation Officer, P.W-17 Thiru.Balaraman had
admitted that he had registered the case in Crime No.335 of 1998 based on the complaint of the
Accused No.5 Thangaraj. He had evaded direct question that as per his
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
evidence, he had arrested Accused 5 Thangaraj from the at Harur. Whereas there was evidence that
Accused 5 had been under treatment for four days at Dharmapuri Government Hospital as he was
forwarded to Dharmapuri Government Hospital after treatment at Harur. To the specific question,
whether he had verified the medical records pertaining to Thangaraj, he was unable to give a specific
answer. In the subsequent part of his cross- examination, he admits that A-5 Thangaraj and A-7
Udhayasuriyan were in treatment was informed to him. To the pointed question, whether he had
examined the Doctor who treated the Prosecution Witness 1 and 2, the same Doctor who had treated
A-5 and -7, he would submit that since he had retired from service, he is unable to answer the
Cross-examination without the help of CD file. As per the Prosecution case, the Accused herein
recognised the Prosecution witness. The deceased Govindan is the elder brother of Accused-1
Shanmugam. If there had been clash between two groups, there is every likelihood of the Accused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 13
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
also suffering injuries. That is the presumption from the normal human conduct. When there are
clashes between relatives one group will not remain to be at the receiving end. They would also be
retaliated and inflicted by the other group. Under those circumstances, even if the documents
procured by the Accused is as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025
05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
per the evidence of A-5 after the retirement of P.W-14 Dr.Jayaraman, it is surreptitiously procured.
At the same time, they should have summoned the Documents from the Government Hospital,
Harur or from the Government Hospital, Dharmapuri. The evidence of P.W-17 Investigation Officer
hints that he had been acted fairly. As per the reported decision in 1954- M.W.N.(Cr.) 9 [Thota
Ramakrishnayya and others -vs- The State] the Investigation Officer had to place all the materials
before the Court and it is for the Court, based on the evidence let in by the witnesses, to arrive at a
conclusion as to who are the aggressors and who are the victims.
26. The submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellants/Accused probablise the case that there
was a group clash. Since the father of P.W-1 and P.W-2 in S.C.No.74 of 2014 died in the hospital, the
Accused in this case were treated as Accused and the injury suffered on the side of the Accused were
suppressed by the Prosecution. The Prosecution has to explain the injury suffered by the Accused.
The observation of the learned Sessions Judge that the documents were procured subsequently is
true but that cannot be rejected in its entirety. Even if the documents are rejected the existence of
the case and counter case is made out from the fact, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded
on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
and the Prosecution has to explain whether further investigation was done or not regarding the
Crime No.335 of 1998.
27. The learned Counsel for the Appellants also invited the attention of this Court to the reported
decision in 1957 SCR 981 [Vadivel Thevar vs. State of Madras) regarding corroborating witness. The
learned Counsel for the Appellants invited the attention of this Court to the reported decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in (1976) 4 SCC 394 [Lakshmi Singh and others vs. State of Bihar] regarding
the failure of Prosecution to explain the injuries caused to the Accused. Here, it is true that the
father of P.W-1 and P.W-2 died in the clash in which the first Accused hit him on the head. Since the
Prosecution failed to place all the relevant materials fairly before the Court and had acted partially
by placing incriminating materials against the Accused alone and not the incriminating materials
against the Prosecution witnesses, the conviction by the learned Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri in
convicting the Accused is found unreasonable, unacceptable considering the criminal conspiracy.
Therefore, the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri in S.C.No.74 of 2014 dated
20.04.2016 is perverse and is to be set aside.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
28. In the light of the above discussion, the conduct of the Prosecution before the trial Court is
found to be not attracting the principles of fair trial. They had not placed all materials available
regarding the riot that took place in the year 1998. Further, on perusal of the judgment, it is found
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88760694/ 14
Shanmugam vs State Rep By on 21 December, 2024
that the occurrence took place in the year 1998, FIR was lodged on both parties on the same day.
Final report was laid in 1999. The Sessions Case was numbered only in 2014. Charges were framed
on 18.09.2014. The judgment was pronounced on 20.04.2016. By the conduct of the Accused only
the case was not tried at the earliest point of time. Even though final report was laid in the year
1999, the trial commenced only in the year 2015.
29. In the light of the above discussion, the Point for consideration is answered in favour of the
Appellants and against the Prosecution. The Judgment dated 20.04.2016 in S.C.No.74 of 2014 on
the file of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri, is found perverse and the same is to
be to set aside.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 16/07/2025 05:28:50 pm ) .Crl.A.No.351 of 2016.
In the result, this Criminal Appeal is allowed. The Judgment dated 20.04.2016 in S.C.No.74 of 2014
on the file of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri, is set aside. The
Appellants/Accused are acquitted from all the charges. The bail bond, if any, executed by the
Appellants/Accused shall stand cancelled. The fine amount, if any, paid by the Appellant/Accused
shall be refunded to them.
