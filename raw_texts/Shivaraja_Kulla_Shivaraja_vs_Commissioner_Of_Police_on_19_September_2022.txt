rights of petitioner No.1 under Articles 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India being infringed.
I. Facts:
3. The facts leading to the filing of the present writ petition are as under:
(a) Petitioner No.1 is aged 32 years, son of Ravikumar and Bhagyamma and married
to one Kamala and he has studied up to IX standard in primary and secondary
education, Gangardeshwara School, Kamalanagar. Petitioner No.2 is the wife of
petitioner No.1.
(b) One Jagadeesh, Inspector of the Karnataka State Police, who was later posted at
Tavarekere Police Station as a Circle Inspector and since 2021 he has been constantly
harassing the petitioner and his family members and the said inspector would often
come near the house and workplace of petitioners and threatened to eliminate
petitioner No.1 in an encounter and further threatened petitioner No.1 with dire
consequences if he did not vacate his residential house and move out of Bengaluru
City and being aggrieved by the said Act of the inspector, the petitioner complained
with the Karnataka State Human Rights Commission on 20/04/2021.
(c) The lodging of a complaint by petitioner No.1 with the State Human Rights
Commission came to the knowledge of said inspector Jagadish, who summoned
petitioner No.1 and his family members on 21/04/2021 and abused them in filthy
language and obtained the identification marks of petitioner No.1. It is stated that in
the presence of the petitioners, the said inspector Jagadish telephoned to the police
at Byadarahalli Police Station and directed them to implicate petitioners in 2 to 3
false cases. Further, in blatant abuse of his power, on 23/04/2021, the said inspector
coaxed his fellow policemen to seek permission from the higher police authorities for
the opening of "A" Rowdy Sheet against the petitioners and on 06/05/2021
permission was granted and apart from this, several false cases came to be registered
against petitioner No.1.
(d) On 11/08/2021, the Byadarahalli Police registered Cr. No.329/2021 for the

Darmesh and on 12/08/2021 i.e., on the next day Cr. No.331/2021 another case was
registered for the offence punishable under Section 353 read with Section 34 of the
IPC on the false ground that petitioner No.1 and his associates sprayed pepper spray
in the eyes of the PSI Harish when he attempted to arrest petitioner No.1 and that the
police officer Jagadish threatened to lodge additional false cases against petitioner
No.1.
(e) When the facts stood thus, it is stated that on 28/12/2021, respondent No.1
passed an order bearing No.26/CRM(4)/DTN/2021 (Annexure -A) invoking power
under Section 3(1) of the Goonda Act directing the petitioner's detention in Central
Prison, Bengaluru, wherein respondent No.1 inter alia falsely alleged that petitioner
No.1 along with his associates was engaged in several criminal activities and violated
conditions of bail on several occasions.
(f) Thereafter, without giving adequate time to the petitioner to submit his
representation, respondent No.1 sought confirmation of the order dated 28/12/2021
under Section 3(3) of the Goonda Act on 03/01/2022 and after five days after passing
the order dated 28/12/2021, under Section 3(1) of the Goonda Act.
(g) It is stated that on 04/01/2022 petitioner No.1 submitted a detailed
representation against the order of preventive detention passed by respondent No.1
to the Advisory Committee (Annexure - E).

petitioner No.1, respondent No.2 confirmed the order dated 28/12/2021 (Annexure -
A) passed by respondent No.1 under Section 3(3) of the Goonda Act vide order
No.HD 1 SST 2022 dated 06/01/2022, respondent No.2 recorded its subjective
satisfaction inter alia observed that there were seven criminal cases against petitioner
No.1; petitioner No.1 habitually committed offences under Sections XVI, XVII and
XXII of the IPC and therefore qualified as a "goonda" under the Goonda Act; thirdly,
the petitioner carried weapons intending to create fear in the general public and that
the general public were allegedly fearful of lodging complaints against him and giving
evidence in Court; there are two "A" rowdy sheets against petitioner No.1; petitioner
No.1 constantly violated the bail conditions imposed by the Courts and that ordinary
laws of the land are not sufficient to contain petitioner No.1's activities.
4. According to petitioner No.1, though a detailed representation was submitted and the same was
forwarded by respondent No.3 on 10/01/2022 to 2nd respondent and though the said
representation was within the knowledge of 2nd respondent as evident from the letter issued by
respondent No.2 admitting for having received the representation dated 04/01/2022 by respondent
No.2, a final order was passed by respondent No.2.

IV. Arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners:

stands vitiated;
- 20 -

documents underneath each of the grounds of the detention order and thereby violated the
fundamental right of petitioner No.1 to make a representation under Article 22 of the Constitution of
India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 8
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
(iii) Contrary to the directions/guidelines issued by this Court, the respondents failed to indicate the
timeline within which the representation has to be considered has not been followed by the
respondents.
(iv) The detention order stands vitiated by malice improper exercise of the powers.
(v) The detention orders are based on vague, irrelevant and cryptic grounds and therefore detention
is liable to be quashed.
(vi) The detention orders are ultra vires the Goonda Act as the actions of petitioner No.1 are not
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
- 21 -
(vii) Ordinary laws of the land are sufficient to deal with the situation;
(viii) The detention orders are violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
9. The sum and substance of the arguments canvassed by the learned counsel for the petitioner is
that respondent No.1 passed an order under Section 3(1) of the Goonda Act on 28/12/2021 and the
same was forwarded to respondent No.2 for confirmation under Section 3(3) of the said Act on
03/01/2022. Learned counsel contends that the representation dated 04/01/2022 was submitted to
the Advisory Board and without considering the said representation respondent No.2/State
Government confirmed the order of detention under Section 3 of the Goonda Act on 14/02/2022. It
is the specific contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that the representation of the
petitioner submitted to the Advisory Board was within the knowledge of respondent No.2 as is
evident
- 22 -
from Annexure - F, in the letter issued by the Under Secretary on 19/01/2022 admitting having
received the representation dated 04/01/2022 by respondent No.2 on 10/01/2022 and the copy of
representation was forwarded to the Secretary. It is the specific assertion of the petitioner that
respondent No.2 confirmed the order of detention on 14/02/2022 without considering the
representation submitted by petitioner No.1 addressed to the Advisory Board on 04/01/2022
though was within the knowledge of respondent No.2 on 10/01/2022. It is the assertion and specific
contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that the respondent considered the representation
on 28/06/2022 as is evident from Annexure - R9 produced along with the statement of objections
by the State and the State Government has failed to consider the representation of the detenue dated
04/01/2022 at the earliest point of time and therefore the detention orders are liable to be
- 23 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 9
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
quashed and that the State Government was bound to consider the representation of the detenue
and communicate the outcome to the detenue at the earliest point of time, failing which, the
detention order stands vitiated as stated by the Apex Court in a catena of judgments. It is further
contended that the consideration of the representation by the Advisory Board does not exonerate
the State Government of its duty to independently apply its mind and satisfy itself that the detention
is in order.
10. In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon several judgments
of the Apex Court contending that there is an inordinate delay in considering the representation
vitiates the detention order itself, which is stated as under:
(I) Leelavathi vs. Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru & others [ILR 2019 Kar.
4105] (Leelavathi) paragraph Nos. 8 and 12.
- 24 -
(II) Smt. Gracy vs. State of Kerala & another [(1991)2 SCC 1] (Smt. Gracy) paragraph No.7.
(III) Judgment of Coordinate Bench of this Court in Makuko Chukwuka Moulowo vs. State of
Karnataka [ILR 2020 Karnataka 5447] (Makuko Chukwuka Moulowo) paragraph Nos.11 to 14,
wherein the Division Bench had held that R.Keshava's case has no application when the
representation is within the knowledge of the Government even if the representation is addressed to
the Advisory Board.
(IV) It is also specifically averred by the learned counsel that the detaining authority has not
disclosed the documents concerning each of the grounds of detention and relied upon the judgment
in Smt. Jayamma vs. Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru [ILR 2019 Kar. 1543] (Jayamma)
paragraph No.49(4).
- 25 -
(V) The non-compliance with the timeline set out in Suresh Shetty vs. State of Karnataka
[Manu/KAR/4711/2018](Suresh Shetty) at para Nos.13 and 14.
(VI) It is also stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that preventive detention order cannot be
invoked to contend "law and order" problem and only to "public order" situations. It is also
contended by the learned counsel "those Acts which cause general disturbance of public tranquillity.
Example: one person stabbing another person and the ultra vires provisions of Goonda Act have no
public order situation and according to the learned counsel "public order situation" is not ultra vires
of the provisions of Goonda Act as stated in K.K.Saravana Babu vs. State of Tamil Nadu & others
[(2008)9 SCC 89] (Saravana Babu) paragraph No.18.

(VII) In Sheikh Naveen vs. State of Telangana [2022 Live Law SC 559] (Sheikh Naveen) paragraphs
Nos.15 and 17.
11. It is further stated that the detention order is passed on vague and cryptic grounds and baseless
grounds have been made for detention and there is no proof of detenue has violated the bail
conditions and threatened the witnesses. Further vehemently contends that the detention order is
vitiated by mala fides and the detention order is due to the complaint against one Jagadeesh
Inspector to the Human Rights Commission on 20/04/2021. Urging these grounds, the petitioners
sought to allow the writ petition. V. Contentions of the learned SPP-II for respondents:
12. Per contra, learned Special Public Prosecutor
-II, Sri V.S.Hegde along with Sri Thejas P., High Court Government Pleader for the State would
contend that the in addition to the contention raised in the
- 27 -
statement of objections and the additional statement of objections wherein it is stated that the
petitioner has not pleaded in his writ petition about the date of knowledge of representation by the
State Government and the detaining authority. In light of non-pleading about the knowledge of the
State Government about the receipt of the representation submitted on 04/01/2022 addressed to
the Advisory Board, it cannot be stated by the petitioner that the respondents have kept the
petitioner in dark to advert to a plea of non-consideration of his representation within the
reasonable time.
13. It is contended by the learned SPP that the date of receipt of representation by the Government
and the consideration of the same by the Government can be duly found by an endorsement dated
28/06/2022 which was served on the petitioner on 29/06/2022 and the same was within the
reasonable time and the petitioners cannot take a contention that
- 28 -
despite respondent/State having full knowledge of his representation, the same has not been
considered. The representation was addressed only to the Advisory Board and it is the specific
assertion of the SPP-II that the petitioner's representation was considered on 28/06/2022 by a
reasoned order and thus the contention of the petitioner that his representation was not considered.
It is submitted that the petitioner is involved in around seven criminal cases and the same is
pending consideration and the following cases are registered against the petitioner:
Sl. Police Station, Date Role of the Petitioner as Nos. of commission of per the

(11.08.2021)
14. Thus, according to the learned SPP-II, petitioner No.1 was involved in various unlawful
- 30 -
activities and had created fear in the minds of the general public and respondent No.1, being
convinced has passed the detention order under the Goonda Act as defined under Section 2(G) and
the same is confirmed by communicating the grounds for passing the detention order dated
28/12/2021 and the State Government has approved the order of detention on 06/01/2022 and the
same was communicated to the detenue on 14/02/2022. The representation submitted by the
detenue was placed before the Advisory Board and the confirmation order of detention was
confirmed by the Government on 14/02/2022, the representation of the detenue has been
considered and rejected by the Government by its order GO No.HD 1 SST 2022 Bengaluru dated
28/06/2022 and in light of the said contentions, it is urged by the learned SPP-II that the petition
filed by the petitioner is devoid of merit and is liable to be dismissed.
- 31 -
15. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, the point that arises for our consideration is:
"Whether, if a representation is submitted to the Advisory Board, and the
representation is within the knowledge of the State Government, was it the duty of
the State Government to decide on the representation independently with the
opinion of Advisory Board as contemplated under Article 22 (5) of the Constitution?
16. We have carefully considered the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties and
perused the material on record carefully. VI. Consideration
17. The relevant factual aspect of the case is that respondent No.1 passed an order under Section 3(1)
of the Goonda Act by its order dated 28/12/2021 detaining the petitioner for the following criminal
cases registered:
- 32 -
(i) Tavarekere Police Station, Cr. No.479/2015 under Sections 5, 38 and 39
Karnataka Money Lenders Act, 1961 & Sections 3 and 4 KPCEIA-2004.
(ii) Tavarekere Police Station, Cr.No.154/2017 under Sections 307 & 302 of IPC.
(iii) Kumbalgodu Police Station Cr. No.226/2019 under Section 395 of IPC.
(iv) Byadarahalli Police Station, Cr.No.308/2019 under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323,
307, 504 R/w.149 IPC.

34 IPC.
(vii) Byadarahalli Police Station, Cr.No.331/2021 under Section 353 r/w. 34 IPC.
18. In the argument of learned SPP-II/State would rely upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of R. Keshava vs. M.B. Prakash and others
- 33 -
[(2001)2 SCC 145] (Keshava) and substantiate his contention that the Apex Court's decision in the
case of Smt. Gracy relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner has been subsequently
explained and the Co-ordinate Bench of the Apex Court has held that if the representation is not
addressed to the State Government or the request is not made to the State Government to consider
the representation made to the Advisory Board, the failure of the Government to consider the
representation is neither unconstitutional nor illegal and relying on Keshava's case, would contend
that the said precedent is binding on this Court as well as the proposition is on account of failure on
the part of the petitioner to forward the representation to the State Government or even to make a
request to the State Government to independently consider the representation made to the Advisory
Board and non-consideration of the said representation without the same being forwarded to
- 34 -
the State Government, there is no violation of the constitutional laws and no interference can be
called for by the petitioner and order of detention passed by the State Government is not vitiated by
any constitutional laws.
19. It is the case of the petitioner that the representation submitted to the Advisory Board on
04/01/2022 as stated in his writ petition at para No.10 and the corresponding Annexure - E wherein
the representation dated 04/02/2022 is addressed to the Advisory Board. On a reading of the
representation, it is evident that the petitioner has furnished a detailed representation stating that
the main reason for making false charges and arraying the petitioner as accused by the Tavarekere
Police Station in Cr. No.479/2015 is due to the complaint lodged by petitioner No.1 against
Inspector Jagadeesh on 23/04/2021 and on that basis having an act of vengeance on petitioner No.1
the said police inspector
- 35 -
instructed the Byadarahalli Police Station to open a rowdy sheet and accordingly, without examining
the false claims and recommendations made by the said Jagadeesh and approval were given on
06/05/2021. The detailed representation of the petitioner could be found in Annexure - E, which
depicts that the detention of the petitioner under the Goonda Act is false and the representation was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 14
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
submitted on 04/01/2022 itself. This contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, though
was stated in the writ petition in paragraph No.10 was denied by the learned SPP-II by way of an
additional statement of objections contending that the petitioner has not pleaded or proved by way
of producing documents concerning the dates and the respondents having factually received the
representation dated 04/01/2022 addressed to the Advisory Board. This assertion made by the State
Government does not find a place for the reason that the petitioner has
- 36 -
categorically stated in his writ petition that the representation submitted to the Advisory Board was
within the knowledge of respondent No.2 as is evident from Annexure-R7 produced by the
respondent/State along with the statement of objections and though the representation addressed to
the Advisory Board was within the knowledge of respondent No.2 from 10/01/2022 as evident from
Annexure-F endorsement issued by the State Government which reads as under:

Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
(Emphasis supplied) This disproves the contention of the State that they had no knowledge of the
representation submitted by petitioner No.1. Therefore, from the
- 38 -
facts of the present case what can be gathered is that there was a representation given by the
petitioner on 04/01/2022 and was within the knowledge of the respondent from 10/01/2022 and
the consideration on 28/06/2022 after lapse of 168 days is in violation of Article 22(5) of the
Constitution of India. Article 22(5) of the Constitution reads as under:
"22. Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases.--(5) When any person is
detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive
detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to
such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the
earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order."
20. Sub-clause 5 of Article 22, of the Constitution of India does not expressly say to whom the
representation should be made and how a detaining authority is to deal with the representation.
- 39 -
But the language of Article 22 (5) implicitly states that the earliest opportunity is to be given to the
detenue to make the representation and the said representation should be properly considered by
the detaining authority as expeditiously as possible. The Constitution of Advisory Board under
Section 8 of the Preventive Detention Act does not relieve the State Government from the legal
obligation to consider the representation of the detune as soon as it was received or had come to the
knowledge of the State.
21. Our view is fortified by the dictum of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Jayamma's case
stated supra has issued certain guidelines while initiating Preventive Detention order at paragraph
No.49, which reads as under:
"49. Before parting with this judgment, though we cannot exhaustively laid down
meticulous guidelines, we prefer to lay down certain guidelines which may be helpful
to the Government and the detaining authority while
- 40 -
initiating the proceedings under the Preventive Detention Laws. According to us, the
following are the few guidelines framed for passing the preventive detention order
under the Act, for the benefit of the state holders:
(1) Detention order in writing, soon after it is passed, should be communicated to the
detenu. The detaining authority should also communicate the grounds of detention
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 16
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
comprising of basic facts, and relied upon materials, in their entirety with documents,
statements, or other materials, not later than 5 days from the date of passing of the
detention order.
(2) If two or more grounds are relied upon by the authority, each of the grounds shall
be separately and distinctly mentioned in the Detention order, as each one of the
ground if valid is sufficient to validate the order even if other grounds are vitiated or
invalidated for any reason.
(3) Every Detention order shall be supplied with the translated legible version of all
the scripts and documents relied upon, in the language he understands to make an
effective representation.
- 41 -
(4) Detaining authority shall specifically disclose with reference to each of the grounds for detention,
which are all the documents relied upon and which are the documents casually or passingly referred
to in the course of narration of facts (including the bail orders) and shall furnish the relied upon
documents along with the detention order. If the detaining authority prefers to furnish the referred
documents also, those materials also to be furnished in compliance with the first and third
guidelines noted supra.
(5) So far as bail applications and orders, and violation of bail conditions are concerned, if the
detenu is on bail, if the bail application and bail orders, conditions therein are with reference to any
vital ground or vital materials, placing of those materials though may not always be mandatory but
such requirement depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case, which the detaining
authority and later Courts have to very carefully examine whether non placing of those materials in
any way prejudiced the detenu. However failure to furnish any or all the referred
- 42 -
documents shall not invalidate the order of Detention.
(6) If the order of detention is challenged, the courts also shall have to independently consider each
ground, to ascertain on each ground whether the order is sustainable or not with reference to the
guidelines herein refereed.
(7) If any representation is submitted by the detenu before the Detaining Authority, addressing the
same to the Detaining Authority, government, or to Advisory Board, irrespective of the fact that, to
whom it is addressed, the same shall be as early as possible considered by the appropriate
Government, before sending the papers to the Advisory Board. If the appropriate Government
revokes the detention order and directs release of the detenu, there arises no question of sending the
case papers to the Advisory Board.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 17
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
(8) The Government shall within three weeks from the date of the detention order, place the order
before the Advisory Board along with all the materials, grounds, representation if any made by the
detenu,
- 43 -
along with any report by such officer made under sub-sec (3) of section 3 of the Act. (9) The
Advisory Board shall maintain records disclosing the date of receipt of the detention order and other
materials, including the representation of the detenu. The Advisory Board shall consider all the
materials placed before it, including the representation if any of the detenu, if necessary after calling
for such further information as it deems it necessary, and if the person concerned desires to be
heard, after hearing him in person and then send its report to the Government within Seven Weeks
from the date of detention of the person concerned.
(10) After receipt of the report from the Advisory Board, the Government before passing any order
of confirmation under section 12 of the act shall consider the representation of the detenu, if not
already considered by it for reasons that, it was either directly submitted before the advisory board
or the sub delegated Authority or received later after the Advisory Board's report. Therefore, it is
mandatory that appropriate Government
- 44 -
shall consider the representation of the detenu, at least once at any stage before passing the final
order of confirmation.
(11) The consideration of the
representation if received before
confirmation, order at any stretch
of imagination, cannot be done after the confirmation of the detention order. It amounts to no
consideration in accordance with law and procedure.
(12) If the Advisory Board has sent a report, stating that there is sufficient cause for the detention of
the person concerned the Government, may confirm or revoke the said order. If the report says that
there is no sufficient cause for detention, the Government, shall revoke the detention order and
cause the person to be released forth with. It has no discretion to detain such person any more for
any reason on the basis of such detention order.
(13) If the order is revoked either under section 12 or under section 14 as the case may be, or the
period of detention under the order is fully undergone by the detenu, in such an event the detaining
- 45 -
authority shall forth with release such person from detention. Further the detaining authority shall
not pass any extended or further detention order on the same grounds. However, if any subsequent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 18
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
order of detention has to be passed, it shall be by a separate order on fresh grounds after again
following the procedure, but not on the grounds on which earlier order was passed."
22. Our view is also fortified by the dictum of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of
Leelavathi stated supra, wherein it is held that any delay in considering the representation of the
detenue is fatal to the detention order and the detention itself becomes illegal. At paragraph Nos. 7,
8 and 12 it is held as under:
"7. The duty cast on the State to consider the representation of the Detenu is not
disputed. It has to be exercised at the earliest point of time. The delay in considering
the representation of the Detenu, would constitute a ground to nullify the order of
detention.
- 46 -
8. The well settled law is that, whenever a representation is made, the same shall be
considered at the earliest point of time. What is the 'earliest point of time' is
necessarily subjective. Assuming that there is a delay, the State is entitled to explain
the delay. But however, the principle that the representation has to be considered at
the earliest point of time is not disputed. If there is a delay in considering the
representation then the entire detention order would have to be set aside on that
ground alone.
x x x
12. So far as the facts involved in the present case is concerned, the State has taken 57
days to consider the representation. The judgment of this Court in KOKILA'S case
involved a delay of 40 days. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in PABITRA
N.RANA's case involved a delay of about two weeks."
23. Thus, the perusal of the judgment would depict that a duty is cast on the State to consider the
- 47 -
representation of the detenue and it has to be exercised at the earliest point of time. The delay in
considering the representation of the detenue would constitute a ground to nullify the order of
detention. What is the 'earliest point of time' is necessarily subjective and the settled principle being
that the representation has to be considered at the earliest point of time and if there is a delay in
considering the representation, then the entire detention order would have to be set aside on that
ground alone.
24. Thus, the representation of petitioner No.1 dated 04/01/2022 being within the knowledge of the
State Government as early as 10/01/2022 itself and the representation being considered by the State
Government on 28/06/2022 would show that much time has been lost to consider the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 19
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
representation and thus non-consideration of the representation had adversely affected the right of
petitioner No.1 due to the failure on the part of the
- 48 -
State Government to consider the representation as nearly six months from the date of
representation the order at Annexure - R9 has been passed by the State Government. Though the
learned SPP-II sought to contend that the same was not within the knowledge of the Government as
on the date of passing of the order dated 14/02/2022 which was the confirmation of the detention
by respondent No.2, the same cannot be accepted as the endorsement addressed to the detune
depicts that the same was within the knowledge of the petitioner at the earliest point of time i.e., on
10/01/2022. It is also evident that the petitioner was not given adequate time to submit his
representation as respondent No.1 sought confirmation of the order of detention dated 28/12/2021
on 03/01/2022 i.e., within five days of passing the order of detention dated 28/12/2021, and the
representation submitted on 04/01/2022, though was within the knowledge of the State as early as
on 10/01/2022, while confirming
- 49 -
the order of detention on 14/2/2022 by respondent No.2 State, is contrary to the guidelines laid
down by the Co-Ordinate Bench of this Court, thus the order of the detention passed by the
respondent against the petitioner stands vitiated.
25. The Apex Court in the case of Smt. Gracy stated supra relied upon by the learned counsel for the
petitioners at paragraphs Nos.7 to 10 it is held as under:
"7. The learned Solicitor General, however, contended that in the present case there
being no representation addressed to the Central Government, the only
representation made by the detenu being addressed to the Advisory Board during
pendency of the reference, there was in fact no representation of the detenu giving
rise to the Central Government's obligation to consider the same. The question is:
Whether this contention can be accepted in the face of the clear mandate in Article
22(5) of the Constitution?
- 50 -
8. It is undisputed that if there be only one representation by the detenu addressed to
the detaining authority, the obligation arises under Article 22(5) of its consideration
by the detaining authority independent of the opinion of the Advisory Board in
addition to its consideration by the Advisory Board while giving its opinion. In other
words, one representation of the detenu addressed only to the Central Government
and not also to the Advisory Board does not dispense with the requirement of its
consideration also by the Advisory Board. The question, therefore, is: Whether one of
the requirements of consideration by government is dispensed with when the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 20
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
detenu's representation instead of being addressed to the government or also to the
government is addressed only to the Advisory Board and submitted to the Advisory
Board instead of the government? On principle, we find it difficult to uphold the
learned Solicitor General's contention which would reduce the duty of the detaining
authority from one of substance to mere form. The nature of duty imposed on the
detaining authority under Article 22(5) in the
- 51 -
context of the extraordinary power of preventive detention is sufficient to indicate
that strict compliance is necessary to justify interference with personal liberty. It is
more so since the liberty involved is of a person in detention and not of a free agent.
Article 22(5) casts an important duty on the detaining authority to communicate the
grounds of detention to the detenu at the earliest to afford him the earliest
opportunity of making a representation against the detention order which implies the
duty to consider and decide the representation when made, as soon as possible.
Article 22(5) speaks of the detenu's 'representation against the order', and imposes
the obligation on the detaining authority. Thus, any representation of the detenu
against the order of his detention has to be considered and decided by the detaining
authority, the requirement of its separate consideration by the Advisory Board being
an additional requirement implied by reading together clauses (4) and (5) of Article
22, even though express mention in Article 22(5) is only of the detaining authority.
Moreover, the order of detention is by the detaining authority and so also the order of
its revocation if the
- 52 -
representation is accepted, the Advisory Board's role being merely advisory in nature
without the power to make any order itself. It is not as if there are two separate and
distinct provisions for representation to two different authorities viz. the detaining
authority and the Advisory Board, both having independent power to act on its own.
9. It being settled that the aforesaid dual obligation of consideration of the detenu's
representation by the Advisory Board and independently by the detaining authority
flows from Article 22(5) when only one representation is made addressed to the
detaining authority, there is no reason to hold that the detaining authority is relieved
of this obligation merely because the representation is addressed to the Advisory
Board instead of the detaining authority and submitted to the Advisory Board during
pendency of the reference before it. It is difficult to spell out such an inference from
the contents of Article 22(5) in support of the contention of the learned Solicitor
General. The contents of Article 22(5) as well as the nature of duty imposed thereby
on the detaining authority support the view that so long as there is a
- 53 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 21
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
representation made by the detenu against the order of detention, the aforesaid dual
obligation under Article 22(5) arises irrespective of the fact whether the
representation is addressed to the detaining authority or to the Advisory Board or to
both. The mode of address is only a matter of form which cannot whittle down the
requirement of the Constitutional mandate in Article 22(5) enacted as one of the
safeguards provided to the detenu in case of preventive detention.
10. We are, therefore, unable to accept the only argument advanced by the learned
Solicitor General to support the detention. On this conclusion, it is not disputed that
there has been a breach by the Central Government of its duty under Article 22(5) of
the Constitution of India to consider and decide the representation independently of
the Advisory Board's opinion. The order of detention dated January 25, 1990 as well
as the order dated April 24, 1990 of its confirmation passed by the Central
Government are, therefore, quashed. This shall not, however, affect the detenu's
prosecution for the alleged offence and it shall also not be construed as a direction to
release him in case he is in custody as a
- 54 -
result of refusal of bail. The writ petition is allowed, accordingly."
26. The judgment relied upon by the respondent/State in the case of Keshava stated supra at
paragraphs Nos.12 and 17 which read as under:
"12. A perusal of the aforesaid Section and other relevant provisions of the Act makes
it abundantly clear that no duty is cast upon the Advisory Board to furnish the whole
of the record and the representation addressed to it only to the Government along
with its report prepared under Section 8(c) of the Act. It may be appropriate for the
Board to transmit the whole record along with the report, if deemed expedient but
omission to send such record or report would not render the detention illegal or cast
an obligation upon the appropriate Government to make inquiries for finding out as
to whether the detenu has made any representation, to any person or authority,
against his detention or not. We are of the opinion that in Gracy case it was not held
that any such duty was cast upon the Board but even if the observations are stretched
to that extent, we feel that those observations were
- 55 -
uncalled for in view of the scheme of the Act and the mandate of the Constitution.
x x x
17. We are satisfied that the detenu in this case was apprised of his right to make
representation to the appropriate Government/authorities against his order of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 22
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
detention as mandated in Article 22(5) of the Constitution. Despite knowledge, the
detenu did not avail of the opportunity. Instead of making a representation to the
appropriate Government or the confirming authority, the detenu chose to address a
representation to the Advisory Board alone even without a request to send its copy to
the concerned authorities under the Act. In the absence of representation or the
knowledge of the representation having been made by the detenu, the appropriate
Government was justified in confirming the order of detention on perusal of record
and documents excluding the representation made by the detenu to the Advisory
Board. For this alleged failure of the appropriate Government, the order of detention
of the appropriate Government is neither rendered unconstitutional nor illegal."
- 56 -
27. The judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Smt. Gracy stated supra is under the
circumstances wherein even if a representation is submitted to the Advisory Board, it was the duty
of the State Government to decide on the representation independently with the opinion of the
Advisory Board as contemplated under Article 22(5) of the Constitution and whereas in Keshava's
case, the careful perusal of the principles laid down in paragraph No.17 would state that in the
absence of representation to the appropriate Government or knowledge of the representation is not
within the knowledge of the Government, then the appropriate Government's failure to decide the
representation independently is not unconstitutional or illegal. Admittedly, in the present case, the
State Government had knowledge of the representation at the earliest point of time on 10/01/2022
before respondent No.2 confirmed the detention order dated 14/02/2022 itself
- 57 -
and the consideration of representation by petitioner No.1 by the respondents on 28/06/2022 is
clearly vitiating the detention order passed by the State Government.
28. The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court has distinguished the judgment of Smt. Gracy supra and
R.Keshava's case stated supra in the matter of Makuko Chukwuka Moulowo at paragraph Nos.10 to
13 read as under:
"10. The law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of SMT. GRACY (supra) is to the
effect that even if a representation is made by the detenue to the Advisory Board, it is
the duty of the appropriate Government to decide the same independently and
uninfluenced by the views/opinion expressed by Advisory Board. Careful perusal of
the principles laid down in paragraph 17 of the decision of the Apex Court in the case
of R. KESHAVA (supra) will show that in absence of a representation addressed to
the appropriate Government or absence of the knowledge of
- 58 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186934810/ 23
Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
the representation having been made by the detenue, the appropriate Government's failure to decide
the same independently is not unconstitutional or illegal. However, in the present case, we are
dealing with the case where the State Government had a clear knowledge of the representation made
by the detenue. Firstly, the representation dated 6th May, 2020 was sent to the Advisory Board
through the Chief Superintendent of the Central Prison. Secondly, there is an endorsement
appearing on the covering letter of the Chief Superintendent of the Central Prison, Bengaluru
enclosing therewith a copy of the representation made by the detenue. The endorsement is
admittedly by a Section Officer of the Government. In the statement of objections filed by the
Detaining Authority, it is admitted that the Advisory Board heard the petitioner on his
representation. In paragraph 30, there is a specific admission to that effect. The only contention
raised in paragraph 31 is that the representation was not given before the first meeting of the
Advisory Board. Paragraph 17 of the statement of objections filed by the State Government, it is
admitted that the petitioner had made a representation
- 59 -
on 6th May, 2020. Paragraph 17 of the statement of objections reads as under:
"17. It is submitted that consequently, the Advisory Board has fixed the date of
hearing on 04.05.2020 through video conference vide Letter dated 30.04.2020.
A copy of the notice 30.04.2020 is produced herewith and marked as
ANNEXURE-R9. It is further submitted that the petitioner had made a
Representation on 05.05.2020 to the Advisory Board, Government and other
through the Superintendent of Central Prison, Bengaluru against the Detention
Order. The Advisory Board has heard the Petitioner in respect of the Representation
filed by the Petitioner."
(Underline supplied) This clearly indicates that the State Government, despite having a knowledge
and having a copy of the representation having been made by the petitioner-detenue, failed to
consider the representation. It is admitted by the State Government that the representation was also
made to it. Moreover, the Detaining Authority was represented before the Advisory
- 60 -
Board by an officer of the rank of the Deputy Commissioner of Police who was subordinate to the
Detaining Authority. Therefore, the State Government cannot plead ignorance about the knowledge
of the representation made by the petitioner-detenue.
11. In the decision in SMT. GRACY (supra), the representation of the detenu was addressed to the
Advisory Board. The Advisory Board considered the representation and enclosed the same along
with its report to the Central Government. In that case, the Central Government accepted the report
of the Advisory Board, without independently applying its mind to the representation of the detenu
that was found in the file. It was in this backdrop that the Apex Court held that, the Central

Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
Government was under a constitutional duty under Article 22(4) and (5) to consider the
representation which was part of the report of the Advisory Board, though the representation was
not addressed to the Central Government.
12. In the case of R. KESHAVA (supra), the representation of the detenu was though addressed to
the Advisory Board, the
- 61 -
representation did not form part of the report of the Advisory Board to the State Government and
the State Government had no knowledge of the representation. The argument of the State
Government that the Advisory Board was required to forward the representation of the detenu to
the State Government was rejected by the Apex Court in the following words:
"In the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions, we are unable to observe
that the Advisory Board was under an obligation to forward the whole of the record of
its proceedings to the State Government. The State Government while confirming the
order of detention has to peruse the report of the Advisory Board along with other
records, if any, in its possession, and cannot determine the legality of the procedure
adopted by the Advisory Board."
13. Thus, this Court is of the considered view that the facts of the case before the Apex Court in the
case of R. KESHAVA (supra) were entirely different from the facts of the case in the case of SMT.
- 62 -
GRACY (supra). In the case of R. KESHAVA, the Government had no knowledge of the
representation. It is in the light of this factual position that the Apex Court held that the decision in
the case of SMT. GRACY (supra) had no application to the facts of the case before it. The other two
decisions relied upon by the State are not on the point involved. It must be noted here that the right
conferred upon the detenue under Clause (5) of Article 22 of the Constitution of India is to ensure
that a representation made by the detenue is considered at the earliest.
29. Thus, in light of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Smt. Gracy and the judgment of
the Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Makuko Chukwuka Moulowo stated supra wherein the
judgment of Smt. Gracy and R.Keshava were distinguished and is squarely applicable to the facts of
the present case and the representation dated 04/01/2022 was very well within the knowledge of
the State Government and the non-consideration of the said representation which was received by
the State
- 63 -
on 10/01/2022, the detaining authority cannot plead ignorance of the representation and
accordingly, the principles laid down in the judgment of the Apex court in the case of Smt. Gracy is

Shivaraja @ Kulla Shivaraja vs Commissioner Of Police on 19 September, 2022
squarely applicable to the present facts and circumstances of the case and therefore, the rights of the
detenue has been violated as conferred upon the petitioner under clause 5 of Article 22 of the
Constitution and hence, the order of detention to be continued is rendered illegal and the point
framed for consideration is answered in favour of the petitioner.
30. In the result, we pass the following:
ORDER
(i) The writ petition is allowed.
(ii) The impugned order passed by respondent No.1 under
No.26/CRM/(4)/DTN/2021 dated 28/12/2021 passed by the Commissioner of

order
- 64 -
passed by respondent No.2 bearing No.HD 1 SST 2022 dated 06/01/2022 under Section 3(3) of the
Goonda Act and the order No.HD 1 SST 2022 dated 14/02/2022 (Annexure - C) is hereby set aside.
(iii) We direct respondent No.3/Senior Superintendent Central Prison, Bangalore to set at liberty
petitioner No.1/detenue forthwith, if he is not required in any other case.
