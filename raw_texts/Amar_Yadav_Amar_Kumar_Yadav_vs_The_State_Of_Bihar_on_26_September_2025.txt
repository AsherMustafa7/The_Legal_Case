counsels appearing on behalf of the informant .
2. The present application has been filed for
quashing the order dated 15.10.2022 passed by learned Judicial
Magistrate Ist Class, Darbhanga, arising out of Kamtoul P.S.
Case No.238 of 2020, by which cognizance of the offences has
been taken under Sections 147, 148, 149, 341, 323, 354(B), 307,
504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioners.
3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners submitted that the petitioners and the informant are
own family members, between whom there was partition of land
in past and the dispute arose in respect to a path connecting to
the main road in respect of the ancestral land, which fell in the
share of the petitioners. For the said reason on the alleged date
of occurrence, as per the FIR, the tension between the parties
resulted into free fight, in which some persons were injured.
Even FIR was lodged three days after the said incidence.
Learned counsel submitted that one of the petitioners is
advocate of this Court and out of 7 petitioners, 5 petitioners are
female family members and petitioner nos.1 and 2 are male
family members. He further submitted that petitioner no.2 is
handicapped, having 40% benchmark disability. Learned
counsel submitted that the allegations made in the FIR against

Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.25719 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025

the petitioners are ornamental and are made with an intention to
drag the name of the petitioners and not to allow them to have
access to their own land, which is in the back side of the
partition land. The informant being in the front of the road
wants to take advantage of her land due to high value of the
land.
4. Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the informant submitted that considering element of
criminality and the offence against the woman, it is not a case
where the dispute is civil in nature and as such, the order taking
cognizance cannot be interfered by this Court. He informs that
the matter was adjourned, so that the parties can explore, as to
whether they want to compromise but the parties did not agree.
Learned counsel submitted that even otherwise also Section 307
of the Indian Penal Code is non-compoundable and if the matter
is considered on merit, the learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class,
Darbhanga, has not erred in any manner in considering the
materials, which has come in course of investigation, before
taking cognizance of the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149,
341, 323, 354(B), 307, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code
against the petitioners. Learned counsel however is of the
opinion that the materials, which have been collected against the

Amar Yadav @ Amar Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
female members of the family, are not convincing and also
considering that the informant is own family members of the
petitioner, they don't want to drag them into criminal case,
subject to certain conditions imposed by this Court.
5. Heard the parties.
6. The main allegation against the petitioners is that
they assaulted the informant and her son, causing injury on head
of the informant, allegedly with an intention to kill and all the
accused persons had outraged the modesty of the informant.
Upon examining the background of the dispute, I find that
because of the obstruction made by the informant in respect of
the passage, which leads to land of the petitioners, the parties
had dispute in spite of the fact that the partition between them is
admitted. The injury is on the head of the informant and said
injury is corroborated with the C.T. scan report, in which it has
been opined that the injury is on the right parietal region of the
head, which has been found to be simple in nature and the same
is a result of assault by lathi and iron bar. Considering the nature
of allegation and the fact that the injury is simple in nature, this
Court leads to conclude that the overt act attributed to the
petitioners cannot bring them within the four corners of the
Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. In this regard, I find it apt
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.25719 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025

to take note of the observation made by the Apex Court recently
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118794264/ 4
Amar Yadav @ Amar Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
in case of Naushey Ali & Ors. Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &
Anr. reported in (2025) 4 SCC 78.
in para-11 to 20, which is reproduced hereinafter:
"11. Before we apply this judgment to the
facts, it will be worthwhile to recall the observations of
Sikri, J. in Narinder Singh (supra):-
"26. Having said so, we would hasten to add that though
it is a serious offence as the accused person(s) attempted
to take the life of another person/victim, at the same time
the court cannot be oblivious to hard realities that many
times whenever there is a quarrel between the parties
leading to physical commotion and sustaining of injury
by either or both the parties, there is a tendency to give it
a slant of an offence under Section 307 IPC as well..."
(Emphasis supplied)
12. Coming back to Laxmi Narayan (supra), this Court
has held that mere mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR
or the charge-sheet should not be the basis for adopting
a hands-off approach. It has further held that it would be
open for the court to examine as to whether
incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of
it or whether there is evidence to back it. It has been held
that the courts may go by the nature of injuries
sustained; as to whether the injuries are inflicted on the
vital/ delicate parts of the body and the nature of weapon
used. It has also been clarified that such an exercise
would be permissible after investigation and filing of
chargesheet/framing of charges or during the trial. [See
15.4 of Laxmi Narayan (supra)].
13. Coming to the facts of the case, admittedly, there is a
settlement between the parties. The case filed by the
appellants' party which was prior in point of time and
that too on the same day of occurrence, has been settled.
14. It should be recalled that, at the outset, after
investigation, the police actually closed the case in its
final report of 07.09.1991. It was the trial Court, which
by its order of 05.09.1992, refused to accept the same
and summoned the appellants. The incident is of

, i.e. about 33Â½ years back. No doubt, there is a reference to the firing in the FIR but admittedly
there was no injury. The allegation is that firing was done by Abdul Waris. He is since deceased. The
facts, assuming to be true, also do not make out a case of common object for the appellants under
Section 149 IPC insofar as the offence of Section 307 is concerned.
15. The role attributed to the seven members, including the five appellants is not specific. General
allegation was that they abused in filthy language and assaulted Mahmood with lathi and iron bars.
The specific individual role was only attributed to Adbul Waris, who is since deceased.
16. In any event, the police who investigated disbelieved the entire story. No recoveries have been
made of any pellets. What engaged the attention of the High Court was only the fracture of the head
of the distal phalanx of left finger of respondent No.2.
17. We have seen the injuries sustained by Mahmood (R-
2) from the medical evidence collected. From the injury report, it is clear that while the first four
injuries were contusions and abrasions, injury Nos. 5, 6 and 7 pertained to incised lacerated wound
and swelling on the middle finger of the left hand. We have also seen the x- ray report which shows
that in the left hand there was a fracture of the head of distal phalanx of left ring finger. Assuming
that this was the result of injury with lathis or iron bar, applying the test in Laxmi Narayan (supra),
considering the injury and the nature of the weapon used, certainly no offence under Section 307
IPC is made out.
18. Section 307 of IPC reads as under:-
"307. Attempt to murder.-
Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such
circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such
act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or to such punishment
as is hereinbefore mentioned.
Attempts by life convicts.- When any person offending under this section is under
sentence of imprisonment for Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.25719 of 2025
dt.26-09-2025 life, he may, if hurt is caused, be punished with death."
19. Keeping in mind the surrounding circumstances, the nature of the weapon and the nature of the
injury, on facts, we are inclined to conclude that the overt act attributed to the appellants does not
bring the case within the four corners of the Section 307 of IPC, either on a stand-alone basis or as
held above with the aid of Section 149 of IPC.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118794264/ 6
Amar Yadav @ Amar Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
20. We are also inclined to conclude that considering the overall circumstances, the nature of the
weapon and the nature of the injury (fracture of the head of distal phalanx of left ring finger), the
offence alleged, on facts, does not fall in that category of cases where the court should deny relief in
the event of a settlement. At the highest, the offence alleged could be one under Section 326 of IPC.
It could not be said, on facts, considering all the circumstances that this is a crime which has such an
harmful effect on the public and that it has the effect of seriously threatening the well-being of the
society. We make it clear that we are saying so on the facts of the present case. We are also firmly of
the opinion that proceeding with the trial, when parties have amicably resolved the dispute in the
present case, would be futile and the ends of justice require that the settlement be given effect to by
quashing the proceedings. It would be a grave abuse of process to let this trial remain pending under
the above circumstances, particularly when the dispute is settled and resolved."
7. So far as, the allegation under Section 354 (b) is concerned, the same appears to be ornamental in
nature. In this regard, I find it apt to take note of the observation made by the Apex Court recently in
case of Naresh Aneja @ Naresh Kumar Aneja Versus State Of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. reported in
(2025) INSC 19 in para-10 and 11, which is reproduced hereinafter:
"10. It is well settled that when considering an application u/s 482 CrPC, the court
cannot conduct a mini-trial but instead is to be satisfied that prima facie the offences
as alleged are made out. To put it differently, Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.25719
of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 it is to be seen, without undertaking a minute examination of
the record, that there is some substance in the allegations made which could meet the
threshold of statutory language.
11. Let us now consider the sections under which the offences have been alleged.
"354. Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty.--
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any woman, intending to outrage or
knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than one
year but which may extend to five years, and shall also be liable to fine. 503. Criminal
intimidation.--Whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation
or property, or to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is
interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any
act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is
legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threats, commits
criminal intimidation. Explanation.--A threat to injure the reputation of any deceased
person in whom the person threatened is interested, is within this section. 506.
Punishment for criminal intimidation.--Whoever commits the offence of criminal
intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both; if threat be to cause death
or grievous hurt, etc.--and if the threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, or to cause
the destruction of any property by fire, or to cause an offence punishable with death
or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven
years, or to impute unchastity to a woman, shall be punished with imprisonment of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118794264/ 7
Amar Yadav @ Amar Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with
both."
8. Turning to the facts of the instant case keeping in view the contents of the FIR the allegation
leveled against the petitioners are general and omnibus in nature as out of 7 petitioners, 5
petitioners are female family members and petitioner nos.1 and 2 are male family members, the
discussion made hereinabove and the law laid down by the Apex Court in case of Naushey Ali
(Supra) and Naresh Aneja (Supra) the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.25719 of 2025
dt.26-09-2025 order taking cognizance in connection with Kamtoul P.S. Case No.238 of 2020, is
hereby set-aside and quashed.
9. However, this Court making an observation that the parties, who are family members, shall not
indulged into frivoulous litigation to harass each other.
10. Accordingly, the present application stands disposed of.
