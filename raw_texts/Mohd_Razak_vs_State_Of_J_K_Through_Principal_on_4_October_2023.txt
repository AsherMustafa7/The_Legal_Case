6. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in case Abdul Qayoom Guroo vs. Ajeet Kumar Sahoo and Ors.
CCP(S) No. 144/2020, decided on 29.09.2021 has, while considering the question as to whether
Central Administrative Tribunal constituted under Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act,
1985 ["the Act"] has power and authority under Section 17 of the Act to punish for contempt in
relation to an interim order passed by the High Court in a writ petition, which was subsequently
transferred to it under Section 29 of the Act, held that contempt proceedings in relation to orders
passed by this Court in the petitions, which subsequently stand transferred to the Tribunal under
Section 29 of the Act, shall lie only and only before the Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act.
7. In view of the above ratio laid down by this Court, the instant petition is held to be not
maintainable. The same is, accordingly, dismissed with liberty to the petitioner to approach the
Central Administrative Tribunal by way of an application under Section 17 of the Act, read with
Contempt of Courts (CAT) Rules, 1992.
