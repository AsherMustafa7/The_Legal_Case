Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S J.Ashok Kumar & Sons on 16 December, 2020
29.11.2019 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chennai, 'A' Bench ('the Tribunal' for
brevity) in I.T.A.No.2519/Chny/2019 for the Assessment Year 2015-16. The appeal was admitted on
31.08.2020 on the following Substantial Questions of Law:
"(i) Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right and justified in setting aside the order
passed by the assessing officer to re-examine the matter when the assessing officer has already duly
examined the matter before passing the assessment order?
(ii) Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in justified in remitting the issue back to
the file of the assessing officer and shifting the onus to the Revenue with a direction that the
assessing officer shall bring on record the role of the assessee in promoting the company and the
relationship of the assessee, if any with the promotors, role of the assessee in inflating the price of
shares etc.,
2. We have heard Mr.M.Swaminathan, learned counsel appearing http://www.judis.nic.in for the
appellant/revenue and Mr.Ashok Pathy, learned counsel for the respondent/assessee for M/s Pass
Associates.
3. The learned counsel for the respondent / assessee, on instructions, submitted that the respondent
/ assessee intends to avail the benefit of Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme ('VVS Scheme' for brevity) and in
this regard, the assessee is taking steps to file the application / declaration in Form No.I.
4. It may not be necessary for this Court to decide the Substantial Questions of Law framed for
consideration on account of certain subsequent developments. The Government of India enacted the
Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Act, 2020 (Act 3 of 2020) to provide for resolution of disputed tax and
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Act of the Parliament received the assent
of the President on 17th March 2020 and published in the Gazette of India on 17th March 2020.
5. In terms of the said Act, the assessee has been given an option http://www.judis.nic.in to put an
end to the tax disputes, which may be pending at different levels either before the First Appellate
Authority or before the Tribunal or before the High Court or before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India. Under Section 2(j) “disputed tax” has been defined. In terms of Section 3, where a declarant
means a person, who files a declaration under Section 4 on or before the last date files a declaration
to the designated authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 in respect of tax arrears,
then, notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax Act or any other law for the time being
in force, the amount payable by the declarant shall be determined in terms of Section 3(a-c)
thereunder.
6. The First Proviso to Section 3 states that in case, where an Appeal or Writ Petition or Special
Leave Petition is filed by the Income Tax authority on any issue before the Appellate Forum, the
amount payable shall be one-half of the amount in the table stipulated in Section 3 calculated on
such issue, in such a manner as may be prescribed. The second proviso deals with the cases, where
the matter is before the Commissioner (Appeals) or before the Dispute Resolution Panel. The third
proviso deals with cases, where the issue is pending before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The

Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S J.Ashok Kumar & Sons on 16 December, 2020
http://www.judis.nic.in filing of the declaration is as per Section 4 of the Act and the particulars to
be furnished are also mentioned in the Sub Sections of Section 4. Section 5 of the Act deals with the
time and manner of the payment and Section 6 deals with Immunity from initiation of proceedings
in respect of offence and imposition of penalty in certain cases. Section 9 of the Act deals with cases,
where the Act 3 of 2020 will not be applicable.
7. As observed, the assessee is given liberty to restore this appeal in the event the ultimate decision
to be taken on the declaration to be filed by the assessee under Section 4 of the said Act is not in
favour of the assessee. If such a prayer is made, the Registry shall entertain the prayer without
insisting upon any application to be filed for condonation of delay in restoration of the appeal and
on such request made by the assessee by filing a Miscellaneous Petition for Restoration, the Registry
shall place such petition before the Division Bench for orders.
8. In the light of the above, We direct the respondent / assessee to file the Form No.I on or before
30.12.2020 and the competent authority shall process the application / declaration in accordance
with the Act and http://www.judis.nic.in pass appropriate orders as expeditiously as possible
preferably within a period of six (6) weeks from the date on which the declaration is filed in the
proper form.
9. With this direction, the Tax Case Appeal stands disposed of with the aforementioned liberty and
Consequently, the Substantial Questions of Law are left open. No costs.
