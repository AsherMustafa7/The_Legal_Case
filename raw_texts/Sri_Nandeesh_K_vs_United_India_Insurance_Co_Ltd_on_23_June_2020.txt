petitioner's vehicle. It is stated that the petitioner fell down and suffered injuries. Immediately he
was shifted to RMV Hospital where he underwent surgery and took medical treatment. The
petitioner submits that he was working as an Accountant and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per
month. Thereafter, the petitioner has filed the claim petition seeking compensation. The learned
Tribunal on appreciating the oral and documentary evidence has awarded the compensation as
aforestated.
3. The petitioner submits that the Tribunal has taken the income of the petitioner at Rs.4,500/- per
month though the petitioner has produced the salary certificate issued by his employer M/s.MSV
Network Private Limited as per Ex.P18 to show that he was being paid salary of Rs.15,000/- per
month. The petitioner further submits that he has adduced the evidence of PW.3- Lakshmikanth,
who is the employer in respect of proof of employment and salary. The petitioner submits that the
Tribunal has quantified the loss of earnings during the laid up period at Rs.13,500/- which is on
lesser side and the same needs to be enhanced. The petitioner submits that he has adduced the
evidence treating doctor viz., PW.2- Dr. Chandrashekar, Orthopaedic Surgeon of RMV Hospital,
Bangalore. The evidence of PW.2 does indicate that even after the treatment, the petitioner is still
undergoing certain inconveniences as he had difficulty in walking, standing for more than 30
minutes, not able to squat comfortably and had difficulty in climbing up staircase, which is reflected
at Para 8 and 9 of the deposition of PW.2.
4. The learned counsel for petitioner further submits the compensation of Rs.10,000/- awarded by
the Tribunal under the head 'Discomfort and loss of amenities' is meager and the same needs to be
enhanced. It is also submitted that the Tribunal has not awarded compensation towards 'future
medical expenditure' despite the Doctor having stated that the petitioner would require
physiotherapy.
5. The learned counsel for the Insurer submits that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is
just and proper and does not call for interference by this court.
6. Heard the learned counsels on both sides.
7. It has been contended by the insurer that despite Doctor having pointed out that petitioner has
disability of 11% of the right lower limb 4% to the whole body, and observed in the affidavit that
unless the petitioner is able to prove that the said disability has affected his earning capacity, he is
not entitled for compensation under the head 'loss of future earnings' Reliance is rightly placed on
the judgments of this court in the case of United India Insurance Co.Ltd. v. D.C.Rajanna and
Another [ ILR 2000 KAR 3443] and North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation v. Babu @
Babusab [ 2007 (1) KCCR 654]. This proposition is indeed correct position of law. Even in the
present case, looking into the nature of work carried out by the petitioner, it cannot be stated that
the disability he has suffered would affect his loss of earning capacity.
7. Insofar as the submission of learned counsel for petitioner as regards the income of the petitioner,
the Tribunal has taken the income at Rs.4,500/- per month. The Tribunal has disbelieved the
assertion of the petitioner that he was drawing a salary of Rs.15,000/- per month and also asserted

that the petitioner has not produced the documents pertaining to his educational qualification.
However, in light of Ex.P18 though in cross-examination various other facts are elicited, but taking
note of the fact that petitioner has completed PUC as per the marks card produced and also
completed First Year B.Com as evidenced by Ex.P 13, it would be appropriate to take the income of
the petitioner at Rs.10,000/- per month taking judicial notice of the income that an Accountant
would earn. Accordingly, the loss of earning during the laid up period would appropriately be
required to be enhanced.
8. Insofar as awarding compensation towards 'future medical expenditure, it is borne out from the
evidence that implant has been removed after the surgery and he has to undergo physiotherapy and
follow up treatment. Though there is no definite estimation of future medical expenses, it would be
appropriate to award compensation of Rs.8,500/- under the head 'future medical expenditure'.
Insofar as compensation awarded under the head 'pain and suffering', looking into the nature of
injuries and surgery, the same is required to be enhanced by Rs.5,000/-. As regards awarding
compensation for disability, in light of evidence of the Doctor at Para 8 and 9 of his affidavit, though
the petitioner may not be entitled for compensation under the head 'future loss of income', however,
in light of the evidence of the Doctor and taking note of the assertions made at Para 8 and 9,
petitioner is entitled for enhancement of Rs.20,000/- as regards the compensation awarded under
the head 'loss of amenities'.
10. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part. The impugned judgment and award dated
06.03.2013, passed by the XIX Additional Sessions Judge & MACT, Bangalore (SCCH-17) in MVC
No.2886/2011 is modified as under:
Compensation under As awarded As awarded different Heads by the by this Tribunal
Court (Rs.) (Rs.) Towards Pain and Sufferings 45,000 50,000 Towards Medical
Expenses 63,500 63,500 Towards loss of Earnings 13,500 30,000 Towards
Conveyance, 12,000 12,000 Attendant and Nourishing Food Towards discomfort loss
of 10,000 30,000 amenities in life and future unhappiness Towards future medical
--- 8,500 expenditure TOTAL 1,44,000 1,94,000 Thus, the claimant is entitled to
enhanced compensation of Rs.50,000/- payable with interest at 8% per annum as
awarded by the Tribunal from the date of petition till the date of realization of
amount. The respondent nos.2 and 3 shall deposit the enhanced compensation with
accrued interest before the tribunal within four weeks from the date of receipt of
certified copy of this judgment and on such deposit, the same shall be disbursed to
the claimant, on proper identification. However, the interest for the delayed period is
disallowed as per the order dated 13.11.2017.
There shall be no order as to the costs. Office to draw the decree accordingly.
