ORDER
This writ petition is filed as against the orders of recovery issued by the respondents in reference
Ref.No. 57/RRC/00/047411/000/0101/SRO/MDU, dated 07.10.2021, for a sum of Rs.5,03,862/-

from June 2005 to September 2009.
2.According to the petitioner, the orders impugned in this writ petition are the liability of the
petitioner's vendor and the petitioner purchased M/s.Thomas Spinning Mills India Pvt Ltd only in
the year 2014. The order impugned is also by way of attachment, even without providing any
opportunity to this petitioner.
3.The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on Section 45 (A) of ESI Act,which reads as follows:-
“45A.Determination of contributions in certain cases.
(1) Where in respect of a factory or establishment no returns, particulars, registers or
records are submitted, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis furnished or maintained in
accordance with the provisions of section 44 or any (Social Security officer) or other
official of the Corporation referred to in sub-section (2) of section 45 is [prevented in
any manner] by the principal or immediate employer or any other person, in
exercising his functions or discharging his duties under section 45, the Corporation
may, on the basis of information available to it, by order, determine the amount of
contributions payable in respect of the employees of that factory or establishment.
[Provided that no such order shall be passed by the Corporation unless the principal or immediate
employer or the person in charge of the factory or establishment has been given a reasonable
opportunity of being heard:] [Provided further that no such order shall be passed by the Corporation
in respect of the period beyond five years from the date on which the contribution shall become
payable.]
4.The learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of this Court in batch of writ petitions in
W.P.Nos.3590 of 2021 etc., dated https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 16.02.2021, wherein, this Court
in similar circumstances, by referring to the orders of the Honourable Apex Court, in Hafeez Motor
Transport Vs.Deputy Regional Director, reported in 2000 SCC Online Mad 1123, has set aside the
order, on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice and remitted the matter back to the
authority, with a direction to provide an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner and decide
the matter afresh, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of that order.
5.The learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of this Court in W.P. No.18776 of 2004,
wherein, in similar such circumstances, the matter was remitted back to the authority for fresh
consideration.

6.Mr.C.Karthick, learned counsel appearing for the respondents takes notice and submits that
vendor of this petitioner was already issued with notice under Section 45(A) of ESI Act and he has
also challenged the same before the ESI Court, in ESI Case No.58 of 2010 and the same was
dismissed for default on 02.08.2018 and order under Section 45(A) of ESI Act was passed on
29.06.2010 itself. More over, notice under Section 45(A) of ESI Act, has already been issued to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the subsequent purchaser for the subsequent period and
therefore, there is no error in the impugned orders of recovery.
7.The learned counsel also relied on the judgment of this Court in W.P.(MD) No.11208 of 2005,
wherein, this Court has held as follows:-
13.Subsequently, the respondents ESI Corporation had filed a counter affidavit dated
29.01.2010. It was stated that under Section 93 of the ESI Act, any transfer made, the
transferee is jointly and severally liable to pay the amount due to the corporation.
The contentions raised in these writ petition are no longer res integra.
14.The Supreme Court very recently while analysing the scope of the EPF vide its
decision in Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Ltd. v.
Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner and others reported in (2009) 10 SCC 123 has held in
paragraphs 66 to 69 which is as follows:-
"66. Section 11 gives statutory priority to the amount due from the employer vis-`-vis
all other debts. Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 11 is applicable to cases where
an employer is adjudicated insolvent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis or, being a
company, an order of its winding up is made. In that situation, the amount due from
the employer in relation to an establishment to which any scheme or the Insurance
Scheme applies in respect of any contribution payable to the Fund or, as the case may
be, the Insurance Fund, damages recoverable under Section 14-B, accumulations
required to be transferred under Section 15(2) or any other charges payable by him
under any other provision of this Act or of any provision of the Scheme or the
Insurance Scheme. Clause
(b) is applicable to cases where the amount is due from the employer in relation to
exempted establishment in respect of any contribution to the provident fund or any
insurance fund insofar it relates to exempted employees under the rules of provident
fund or any insurance fund, any contribution payable by him towards the Pension
Fund under Section 17(6), damages recoverable under Section 14-B or any charges
payable by him to the appropriate Government under the Act or under any of the
conditions specified in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Section 17. This sub-section
then lays down that such amount shall be paid in priority to all other debts in the
distribution of the property of the insolvent or the assets of the company being
wound up. Sub-section (2) lays down that any amount due from the employer
whether in respect of the employees# contribution deducted from the wages of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91860032/ 3
M.Saravanakumar vs The Recovery Officer on 13 December, 2021
employee or the employer#s contribution shall be deemed to be the first charge on
the assets of the establishment, and shall be paid in priority to all other debts.
67. The expression #any amount due from an employer# appearing in sub-section (2)
of Section 11 has to be interpreted keeping in view the object of the Act and other
provisions contained therein including sub-
section (1) of Section 11 and Sections 7-A, 7-Q, 14-B and 15(2) which provide for determination of
the dues payable by the employer, liability of the employer to pay interest in case the payment of the
amount due is delayed and also pay damages, if there is default in making contribution to the Fund.
If any amount payable by the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis employer becomes due and the same
is not paid within the stipulated time, then the employer is required to pay interest in terms of the
mandate of Section 7-Q. Likewise, default on the employer#s part to pay any contribution to the
Fund can visit him with the consequence of levy of damages.
68. As mentioned earlier, sub-section (2) was inserted in Section 11 by Amendment Act 40 of 1973
with a view to ensure that payment of provident fund dues of the workers are not defeated by the
prior claims of the secured and/or of the unsecured creditors. While enacting sub- section (2), the
legislature was conscious of the fact that in terms of existing Section 11 priority has been given to the
amount due from an employer in relation to an establishment to which any scheme or fund is
applicable including damages recoverable under Section 14-B and accumulations required to be
transferred under Section 15(2). The legislature was also aware that in case of delay the employer is
statutorily responsible to pay https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis interest in terms of Section 17.
Therefore, there is no plausible reason to give a restricted meaning to the expression #any amount
due from the employer# and confine it to the amount determined under Section 7-A or the
contribution payable under Section 8.
69. If interest payable by the employer under Section 7-Q and damages leviable under Section 14
(sic Section 14-B) are excluded from the ambit of expression #any amount due from an employer#,
every employer will conveniently refrain from paying contribution to the Fund and other dues and
resist the efforts of the authorities concerned to recover the dues as arrears of land revenue by
contending that the movable or immovable property of the establishment is subject to other debts.
Any such interpretation would frustrate the object of introducing the deeming provision and non
obstante clause in Section 11(2). Therefore, it is not possible to agree with the learned Senior
Counsel for the appellant Bank that the amount of interest payable under Section 7-Q and damages
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis leviable under Section 14-B do not form part of the amount due
from an employer for the purpose of Section 11(2) of the Act."
15.Therefore, this Court is not inclined to entertain the writ petitions solely on the ground that one
petitioner is a purchaser under the SARFAESI Act and therefore, they are not liable to pay any
amount either to the PF or ESI Corporation. Further, the contention that SARFAESI Act is a special
law and therefore, it overrides the other prior enactment cannot be countenanced in the light of the
judgment of the Supreme Court referred to above.

16.The writ petition in W.P.No.11208 of 2005 will stand dismissed as it is only a notice under
Section 7A of the EPF Act. If at all the writ petitioner company was aggrieved by that order, they
should have moved the Appellate Tribunal constituted under Section 7I of the EPF Act.
17.Similarly in W.P.No.19413 of 2009, the petitioner if at all aggrieved, he has to raise a dispute
before the ESI Court under Section 75 and not rush to this Court on an intimation of taking
possession of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis property which was already under attachment.
Hence, W.P.No.19413 of 2009 stands dismissed.”
8.This Court paid its anxious consideration to the rival submissions made and also perused the
materials placed on record.
9.The orders impugned in this writ petition are the notices issued under Section 45(A) of ESI Act
and consequent orders of recovery. As against the two notices, this writ petition is filed.
Admittedly, this petitioner is the subsequent purchaser of M/s. Thomas Spinning Mills India Pvt
Ltd, Dindigul. The erstwhile owner has already contested the notice before the concerned ESI Court,
in ESI Case No.58 of 2010 and the same was dismissed for default on 02.08.2018.
Admittedly, it was not decided on merits. Under such circumstances, in order to provide one more
opportunity to this petitioner, this Court set aside the impugned orders and remits the matter back
to the respondent to provide an opportunity to the petitioner and to take further course of action, in
accordance with law, within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
The petitioner shall also work out https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the possibility, if any, to restore
the ESI Case No.58 of 2010, which was already dismissed for default.
10.With the above said directions, the Writ Petition is disposed of. No costs. Consequently,
connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
