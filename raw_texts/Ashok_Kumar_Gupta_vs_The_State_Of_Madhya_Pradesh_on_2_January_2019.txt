ORDER
( 02 /01 / 2019 ) PER VIRENDER SINGH J:-
1. All these petitions have arisen out of the same order of framing charges against the
petitioners, therefore, they were heard analogously and are being decided by this
common order.
2. Grievance of the petitioners is that without any basis, without any CRR
Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 evidence

Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
appreciating the evidence and in a very casual manner the learned trial Court has
framed charges under section 120-B, 420, 467/34, 468/34, 471/34, 409/34 of the
IPC and section 13(1)(D) read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act
(hereinafter referred to as "The Act of 1988") vide order dated 23.03.2017 against
them. This order is under challenge in all five petitions.
3. Undisputed facts of the case are that for the area likely to submerge in the Sardar
Sarover Dam, the Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) deployed several
officers to carry out the work of survey, assessment, valuation, determination of
compensation and other subsequent/consequential works necessary for acquisition
of the land, plots, houses etc. Several divisions and sub-divisions were constituted to
carry out the work. Villages Mandwara and Chichli were under Sub- division No.7 of
Division No.3.
4. Allegation against the petitioners is that they all together hatched a conspiracy and
in furtherance of the same, carried out misleading and erroneous survey of back
water level of Sardar Sarover Dam, brought 13 houses of village Mandawa and 1
house of village Chichli in expected submergence area while actually they were not
falling under that area, did valuation of those houses, fabricated falls documents,
prepared sham proposals, caused publication of notice under section 4 & 6 of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894, forwarded it to the Collector and ensured the payment of
compensation to the persons not entitled for the same and thus, caused wrongful loss
to the tune of Rs.59,86,393/- to the State Exchequer.
5. Petitioner Ajay Rishi (CRR 765/17) was In-charge Executive Engineer, Pramil
Kumar Yadav (Cr.R No.919/2017) was Executive Engineer, Ashok Kumar Gupta
(CRR No.974/2017) and Jai Narayan Taur (CRR No.1201/2017) were Sub Divisional
Officers (SDO) and Jitendra Kumar Jain (CRR 752/17) and Baburao Lokhande (CRR
765/17) were Sub Engineers posted at Rehabilitation Division No. 3, CRR
Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 District
Badwani, Madhya Pradesh.
6. Broadly, common grounds taken by all the petitioners to challenge the impugned
order are that the entire proceeding of showing those 14 houses under submergence
area is based on the survey and notification published under Section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 carried out by the officials posted at Sub-Division No.7, while
none of them was posted at this Division/Sub-Division at that time and they only
followed the norms as prescribed by their predecessors, a departmental inquiry was
initiated against them for the same charge but all of them are exonerated and for the
same charges criminal proceedings cannot be initiated and lastly prosecution
sanction to prosecute them is granted by an incompetent authority, therefore, their
prosecution cannot be permitted to continue as it is sheer abuse of process of law.

7. It is the ground of Sub engineer Jitendra Kumar Jain that he was posted at
Sub-Division No. 8 (from 15/07/2002 till 30/04/2003 Annx P/7) at the time of
publication of notification under Section 4 of the Act, 1894. Survey of the properties
which were likely to come under submergence was conducted by Sub Division No. 7.
After the survey, acquisition of the properties in the village Mandwara and Chichli
coming under submergence was recommended to the Land Acquisition Officer (LAO)
vide letter dated 30/08/2002 & 06/09/2002 (Anx P/2 & 3). Based on the aforesaid
recommendation the Collector Badwani published gazette notification dated
13/09/2002 under Section 4 of the Act, 1894.
He was only asked to prepare proposal for notification under Section 6 of the Act, 1894 for village
Mandwara. He prepared such proposal in terms of and in consequence of the notification already
published under Section 4 of the Act, 1894, which was forwarded to the Tehsildar Thikri, District
Badwani by the SDO (PWD) NVDA Sub-Division No.8 vide letter dated 30/11/2002. Based on this
proposal, notification under Section 6 was published. Thereafter, He did valuation of the properties
included in the notification and submitted it to the LAO to onward dispatch to the Collector with its
recommendation.
CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017
8. Petitioner Ajay Rishi (CRR 765/17) has stated that charge against him is that he changed the
water level but the same was determined by the Central Committee of the Government of India and
he was not having any authority to change it nor has he changed it. He was only posted as Executive
Engineer of Division No.3 at the fake end of the work only to wind up the unit/division. Faction of
the work assigned to him was pertaining to Section 9 of the Act, 1894 to do valuation of the property
of village Mandwara coming under submergence and to forward it to the persons authorized to
finalize the same and he discharged his duty diligently and bona-fidely.
9. Petitioner Baburao Lokhande (CRR 765/17) has stated that he was assigned the work of valuation
of the properties of village Chinchli and he also discharged his duty diligently and bona-fidely.
10. Petitioner Pramil Kumar Yadav (CRR No.919/2017) has stated that he had given additional
charge of Executive Engineer of Rehabilitation Division No.3 of NVDA from 27.06.2002 to
28.08.2002 and had handed it over to his successor on 28.08.2002. Charge against him is that he
along with his team conducted an erroneous survey in respect to back water level of the houses to
ascertain as to whether those houses are expected submergence and it is alleged that due to said
survey, the alleged loss was caused. It is stated that he handed over the said additional charge on
28.08.2002 while notifications under section 4 and 6 were published on 13.09.2002 and 18.12.2002
when he was not In-charge of said Division no.3. He has challenged the prosecution sanction mainly
on two ground namely incompetency of sanctioning authority and non application of mind. For the
sake of convenience the both the grounds are being reproduced here :-
"A Incompetency-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 3
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
i. That the observance of the Business Allocation Rules is mandatory and not directory as held by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Delhi International Airport Ltd. Vs. International lease Finance CRR
Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 Corporation and others
(decided on 17.03.2015.).
ii. That by virtue of provisions of the Business Allocation Rules, the Law Department had been
exercising the power of granting sanction under section 19 of the P.C. Act and this power was
divested by amending the Business Allocation Rules on 06.10.2015, meaning thereby that the Law
Department had the power to grant sanction till 06.10.2015.
iii. That the Government of MP without amending the Business Allocation Rules, issued a
circular/executive order dated 05.09.2014 and purportedly delegated the power of sanction to the
concerned Administrative Department i.e. Water Resources Department in the case of applicant. It
is submitted that the aforesaid circular is void ab-initio and non-est in law so far as it sought to
entrust the power of sanction to the Administrative Department as it was issued in complete
derogation and contradiction of the Business Allocation Rules. If the government wanted to delegate
the power of sanction to Administrative Department, it should have amended the Business
Allocation Rules, which was actually done on 06.10.2015. This power could not be delegated by
issuing a circular/executive order as was done on 05.09.2014 without amending the Rules.
iv. That on 27.10.2014, when the sanction order was issued, two provisions existed firstly; executive
order dated 05.09.2014 empowering the administrative department to grant sanction and secondly;
the provision of business allocation rules empowering the Law Department to grant sanction.
v. That the government of MP after issuing the defective circular dated 05.09.2014 sought to amend
the Business Allocation Rules, only on 06.10.2015 to bring the circular in consonance with the
Rules. It is submitted that the period from 05.09.2014 to 06.10.2015 CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017,
919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 (referred to as the intervening period) between the
issuance of the circular and amendment of the rules would be governed by the Rules as the circular
was void ab-inito as the provision of the Rules cannot be amended by issuing the executive
instruction. Thus the Administrative Department did not have power to grant sanction in the
intervening period and the impugned sanction order dated 27.10.2014 has obviously been issued by
the incompetent authority i.e. Administrative Department and is thus not a valid sanction on
account of incompetency.
vi. That, alternatively, if at any point of time if executive order and Rules co-exist on the issue, the
provisions of Rules shall prevail over the provision of the Executive Order.
vii. That moreover the executive order dated 05.09.2014 does not bear the caption "In the name of
and by the order of Governor" and therefore, not the order of State Government as it does not
comply the provision of Rule 6 of the Business Allocation Rules which makes it mandatory that all
the orders of the State Government are to be mandatorily issued in the name of Governor and also
the provision of Article 166(1) of the Constitution.

Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
viii. That the question regarding validity of sanction can be raised at any stage of proceedings and if
the Trial Court proceeds despite the invalidity attached to the sanction order, the same shall be
deemed to be non-est in the eyes of law.
ix. That the Trial Court failed to appreciate that the sanction order was issued by the incompetent
authority and thus it was an invalid sanction.
x. That from the aforesaid facts and legal positions it is prima facie established that the sanction
order dated 27.10.2014 passed by the Administrative Department was without authority and void
ab-initio and non-est in law and the trial Court should have discharged the CRR Nos.752/2017,
765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 accused as held by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Nanjappa Vs. State of Karnataka (decided on 24.07.2015).
B. Non-application of mind- The trial Court has also failed to appreciate that the Administrative
Department did not peruse the entire case which was based on the written evidences and oral
evidences has no bearing in the present case. The details follows:-
i. That, it is pertinent to mention that for acquiring land for government use, a
notification is first issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1994
specifying the land to be acquired for any project of public importance. Thereafter in
the said area, survey is made as to the house situated in the said land and thereafter a
notification is issued under section 6 of the Act specifying the names of the house
owners situated in the said land. Thereafter, inviting objections and suggestions in
the notification issued under section 6, the list is finalized after adjudicating the
objections received and thereafter the list is sent to the Land Acquisition Officer for
disbursing the compensation to the house owners so finalized and situated in the said
land.
ii. That from the perusal of letter dated 30.08.2002 (Annexure-9) sending the
proposal for issuing the notification under section 4 of the Act, it is clear that it has
not been signed by the applicant. Similarly, the letter dated 06.09.2002
(Annexure-10) sending the proposal for inviting the objections from the house
owners situated in the said land, also does not bear the signature of the applicant.
Both of these letters have been annexed with the charge sheet by the prosecution
itself.
iii. That on the basis of letter dated 18.09.2007 (Annexure-11) which depicts the
incumbency of the officers from 28.08.2002 to 30.04.2003, the prosecution has
made all of them the accused in the case. The prosecution must have investigated and
examined the role CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and
3093/2017 of each officer posted during the period who was instrumental in sending
the proposal under section 4 and 6 of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 5
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
iv. The sanctioning authority has not even ventured to see that the applicant was only posted for a
period of 01 months and 20 days and had neither sent the proposal for notification under section 4
or neither sent the proposal for notification under section 6 of the Act and thus he was in no way
related with the case.
v. That, the note sheet (Annexure-12) regarding sanction as obtained under RTI Act, clearly reveals
the above facts that the applicant was in no way related to the issuance of notifications under section
4 and 6 and this has not even been seen which was the genesis of the case.
vi. That, from the foregoing paras, it is crystal clear that the sanctioning authority has not applied its
mind while granting the sanction and it has just reiterated that facts as mentioned in the
prosecution story. Thus, the grant of sanction being mechanical and without application of mind is
invalid sanction in the eyes of law and the Hon'ble court cannot proceed on the basis of this invalid
sanction. The trial Court has failed to appreciate that the sanctioning authority has not applied its
mind rendering the sanction order as invalid. "
11. Petitioners Ashok Kumar Gupta (CRR No.974/2017) and Jai Narayan Taur (CRR
No.1201/2017) were posted as Sub-Divisional Officers at Division no.3 on 07.10.2002
and 06.11.2002 and by that time the list of villagers, records, field map,
measurements and water levels etc were already prepared and forwarded by the
Tehsildar Thikri much prior to their posting, therefore, they cannot be held
responsible for inclusion of 14 houses into submergence due to incorrect
measurement of back water level, preparation of calculation sheet for determination
and distribution of the compensation amount as proceedings for the same had
already been CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and
3093/2017 done before their posting. No objections were received against
notification under section 4 of the Act, 1894, therefore, proceedings under section 6
of the Act, 1894 were initiated and the notification was published. Thereafter, notice
under section 9 of the Act, 1894 was issued on 17.01.2003 and on 28.01.2003 final
award was passed in respect to village Mandwara Tehsil and District Badwani.
12. There were two reports of measurement of back water level, which clearly shows
that a mistake was committed in measurement of back water level and hut
measurement and the petitioners were not responsible for the said mistake. The
allegation against them is that they in collusion with other co-accused persons have
taken wrong back water level while they have not taken the same. The petitioners
were not expert to take such measurement, therefore, they cannot be held liable for
wrong measurement of back water level. Validity of sanction is also challenged by
them.
13. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties at length and have gone
through the records.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 6
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
14. The question as to what would be the standards to examine the material produced
by the prosecution at the time of framing of charge was considered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in State of M.P. v. Mohanlal Soni, (2000) 6 SCC 338 : 2000 SCC (Cri)
1110 at page 342. The Court answered the same in the following terms:
7. The crystallised judicial view is that at the stage of framing charge, the court has to
prima facie consider whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused. The court is not required to appreciate evidence to conclude whether the
materials produced are sufficient or not for convicting the accused.
8. In Ananda Bezbaruah v. Union of India [1994 Cri LJ 12 (Gau)] the Gauhati High
Court was of the view that where the CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017,
974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 accused was charged with the offence of having
resources and property disproportionate to his income and the trial court failed to
consider and evaluate the income tax return which clearly established that the
property included in the assets of the accused and shown to be disproportionate is
the wife's property bought from her own resources and should have been excluded
from the assets of the accused.
9. Yet in another decision of this Court in Niranjan Singh Karam Singh Punjabi v.
Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya [(1990) 4 SCC 76 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 47] it is held that at the
time of framing charges having regard to Sections 227 and 228 CrPC, the court is
required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view of finding out
if the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value disclose the existence of all
the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. The court may for this limited
purpose to sift the evidence, as it cannot be expected even at the initial stage to accept
all that the prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is opposed to common sense
or broad probabilities of the case.
10. Further in Satish Mehra case [(1996) 9 SCC 766 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 1104 : (1996) 3
Crimes 85 (SC)] this Court has stated that the Sessions Judge was not expected to
hold a roving inquiry into the pros and cons of the case at the stage of framing
charges by weighing the evidence as if he was conducting the trial.
11. Decision in the case of State of M.P. v. S.B. Johari [(2000) 2 SCC 57 : 2000 SCC
(Cri) 311 : (2000) 1 Scale 138] strongly relied on by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, in our view does not advance or support the case of the petitioner. That
was a case where FIR was lodged at the police station, Bhopal to the effect that there
was criminal conspiracy in purchase of CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017,
974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 medicines by the hospital authorities concerned
including the Dean, Superintendent, Medical Officer-In-Charge and others.
It was alleged that aforesaid accused entered into criminal conspiracy with some local businessmen
of Indore by misusing their posts and also by using some forged documents caused wrongful loss to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 7
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
the Government. It was stated that though many of the items had not been purchased, amount was
paid on bogus vouchers. After considering the material on record, learned Sessions Judge framed
the charges against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 5(1)(d) and 5(2) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1948 read with Section 120-B IPC and in the alternative for the
offence punishable under Section 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988. The High Court in revision quashed the charges accepting the contentions raised by the
accused after detailed consideration of material produced on record. Having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case and referring to earlier decisions of this Court in para 4 it is held thus:
(SCC pp. 60-61) "4. In our view, it is apparent that the entire approach of the High Court is illegal
and erroneous. From the reasons recorded by the High Court, it appears that instead of considering
the prima facie case, the High Court has appreciated and weighed the materials on record for
coming to the conclusion that charge against the respondents could not have been framed. It is
settled law that at the stage of framing the charge, the court has to prima facie consider whether
there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The court is not required to appreciate
the evidence and arrive at the conclusion that the materials produced are sufficient or CRR
Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 not for convicting the
accused. If the court is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out for proceeding further then a
charge has to be framed. The charge can be quashed if the evidence which the prosecutor proposes
to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused, even if fully accepted before it is challenged by cross-
examination or rebutted by defence evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused committed the
particular offence. In such case, there would be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial. In
Niranjan SinghKaram Singh Punjabi v. Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya [(1990) 4 SCC 76 : 1991 SCC (Cri)
47] after considering the provisions of Sections 227 and 228 CrPC, the Court posed a question,
whether at the stage of framing the charge, the trial court should marshal the materials on the
record of the case as he would do on the conclusion of the trial. The Court held that at the stage of
framing the charge inquiry must necessarily be limited to deciding if the facts emerging from such
materials constitute the offence with which the accused could be charged. The court may peruse the
records for that limited purpose, but it is not required to marshal it with a view to decide the
reliability thereof. The Court referred to earlier decisions in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh [(1977) 4
SCC 39 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 533] , Union of India v. Prafulla Kumar Samal [(1979) 3 SCC 4 :
1979 SCC (Cri) 609] and Supdt. & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, W.B. v. Anil
Kumar Bhunja [(1979) 4 SCC 274 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 1038] and held thus: (SCC p. 85,
para 7) 'From the above discussion it seems well settled that at the CRR
Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 Sections
227-228 stage the court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record
with a view to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value
disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. The court
may for this limited purpose sift the evidence as it cannot be expected even at the
initial stage to accept all that the prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is
opposed to common sense or the broad probabilities of the case.' "
As is evident from the paragraph extracted above if the court is satisfied that a prima
facie case is made out for proceeding further then a charge has to be framed. Per
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 8
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
contra, if the evidence which the prosecution proposes to produce to prove the guilt
of the accused, even if fully accepted before it is challenged by the cross-examination
or rebutted by the defence evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused committed
the particular offence then the charge can be quashed.
15. Keeping in view the aforesaid norms, we examined the material available on
record and find that FTL (full tank level) of Sardar Sarover Dam was 138.68 meters.
The Central Water Commission had taken 'Back Water Level' of the villages coming
under submergence of the back water of the dam. According to the report; back water
level of village Mandwara was 145.09 and of village Chichli was 145.95 meters. As per
this water level, all the land, houses and properties coming under submergence were
acquired by the government and compensation was awarded to the owners. The
offence came into the light when in the year 2006-07, at the time of flood in the river
Nahla Kundli minimum hut level of these houses was taken. Their level was found
more than back water level of the dam. It was revealed that those houses were not
coming in the submergence area of the dam, the petitioners had falsely shown them
falling in such CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and
3093/2017 area and their acquisition was wrong. It was found in the investigation
that all the petitioners were involved in the procedure of acquisition of these houses
at one stage or the other. They prepared false documents, field books, maps,
measurement books, submitted reports to show that these houses are also coming in
submergence area of the dam and facilitated payment of compensation to the persons
not entitled for the same. Claim of the prosecution is based on several documents
seized during investigation and affidavit of Magan Singh Ajnare, Chief Engineer,
PWD, NVDA, Bhopal dated 20/03/2018 and affidavits of Ashutosh Mishra, Dy.S.P.,
EOW, Indore dated 13/09/2017, 06/12/2017 & 20/03/2018 regarding period of
posting of the petitioners at the relevant time and also regarding submission of the
documents showing their involvement. In our considered opinion, prima facie all this
evidence is sufficient to frame the charges against the petitioners and the impugned
order does not warrant interference by this court.
16. Learned counsel for the petitioner Ashok has placed reliance on State of
Karnataka Vs. L.Muniswamy and Others (1977) 2 SCC 699, Gorige Pentaiah Vs. State
of Andhra Pradesh and another (2008) 12 SCC 531, P.Vihayan Vs. State of Kerala and
Another (2010) 2 SCC 398, Satish Mehra Vs. State (NCT of Delhi ) and another
(2012) 3 SCC 614 learned counsel for the petitioner Ajay has placed reliance on Union

find out as to CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and
3093/2017 whether any prima facie case is made out or not for the purpose of
framing of charges or for quashing the criminal proceedings and the same we have
already discussed above while considering the Mohanlal case (supra), therefore, we
do not find it necessary to discuss all these judgements again in detail. We have
carefully gone through the judgments and followed the principles articulated in these
judgments.
17. A three judge bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered the issue as to
whether criminal trial of a public servant can be continued even when for the same
charges he is exonerated in the departmental enquiry? The answer was given in
positive. Relevant paras of State (NCT of Delhi) Vs. Ajay Kumar Tyagi, (2012) 9 SCC
685 reads thus :
19. Even at the cost of repetition, we hasten to add that none of the heads in P.S.
Rajya [(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 897] is in relation to the effect of exoneration
in the departmental proceedings on criminal prosecution on identical charge. The
decision in P.S. Rajya [(1996) 9 SCC 1 :
1996 SCC (Cri) 897], therefore, does not lay down any proposition that on
exoneration of an employee in the departmental proceeding, the criminal prosecution
on the identical charge or the evidence has to be quashed.
20. It is well settled that the decision is an authority for what it actually decides and
not what flows from it. The mere fact that in P.S. Rajya [(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC
(Cri) 897] , this Court quashed the prosecution when the accused was exonerated in
the departmental proceeding would not mean that it was quashed on that ground.
This would be evident from para 23 of the judgment, which reads as follows: (SCC p.
9) "23. Even though all these facts including the report of the Central Vigilance
Commission were brought to the CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017,
1201/2017 and 3093/2017 notice of the High Court, unfortunately, the High Court
took a view that the issues raised had to be gone into in the final proceedings and the
report of the Central Vigilance Commission, exonerating the appellant of the same
charge in departmental proceedings would not conclude the criminal case against the
appellant. We have already held that for the reasons given, on the peculiar facts of
this case, the criminal proceedings initiated against the appellant cannot be pursued.
Therefore, we do not agree with the view taken by the High Court as stated above. These are the
reasons for our order dated 27-3-1996 [P.S. Rajya v. State of Bihar, Criminal Appeal No. 434 of
1996, order dated 27-3- 1996 (SC)] for allowing the appeal and quashing the impugned criminal
proceedings and giving consequential reliefs." (emphasis supplied) From the reading of the
aforesaid passage of the judgment it is evident that the prosecution was not terminated on the
ground of exoneration in the departmental proceeding but, on its peculiar facts.

Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
21. It is worth mentioning that the decision in P.S. Rajya [(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 897] came
up for consideration before a two-Judge Bench of this Court earlier, in State v. M. Krishna Mohan
[(2007) 14 SCC 667 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 922]. While answering an identical question i.e. whether a
person exonerated in the departmental enquiry would be entitled to acquittal in the criminal
proceeding on that ground alone, this Court came to the conclusion that exoneration in
departmental proceeding ipso facto would not lead to the acquittal of the accused in the criminal
trial. This Court observed emphatically that the decision in P.S. Rajya CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017,
919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 [(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 897] was rendered
on peculiar facts obtaining therein. It is apt to reproduce paras 32 and 33 of the said judgment in
this connection: (M. Krishna Mohan case [(2007) 14 SCC 667 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 922] , SCC p. 676)
"32. Mr Nageswara Rao relied upon a decision of this Court in P.S. Rajya v. State of Bihar [(1996) 9
SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 897] . The fact situation obtaining therein was absolutely different. In that
case, in the vigilance report, the delinquent officer was shown to be innocent. It was at that juncture,
an application for quashing of the proceedings was filed before the High Court under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure which was allowed relying on State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [1992
Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426] holding: (P.S. Rajya case [(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri)
897] , SCC p. 9, para 23) '23. Even though all these facts including the report of the Central Vigilance
Commission were brought to the notice of the High Court, unfortunately, the High Court took a view
that the issues raised had to be gone into in the final proceedings and the report of the Central
Vigilance Commission, exonerating the appellant of the same charge in departmental proceedings
would not conclude the criminal case against the appellant. We have already held that for the
reasons given, on the peculiar facts of this case, the criminal CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017,
919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 proceedings initiated against the appellant cannot
be pursued." (emphasis in original) Ultimately this Court concluded as follows: (M. Krishna Mohan
case [(2007) 14 SCC 667 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 922] , SCC p. 676, para 33) "33. The said decision was,
therefore, rendered on the facts obtaining therein and cannot be said to be an authority for the
proposition that exoneration in departmental proceeding ipso facto would lead to a judgment of
acquittal in a criminal trial."
22. This point also fell for consideration before this Court in Supt. of Police (CBI) v. Deepak
Chowdhary [(1995) 6 SCC 225 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 1095] , where quashing was sought for on two
grounds and one of the grounds urged was that the accused having been exonerated of the charge in
the departmental proceeding, the prosecution is fit to be quashed. The said submission did not find
favour with this Court and it rejected the same in the following words: (SCC p. 227, para
6) "6. The second ground of departmental exoneration by the disciplinary authority is also not
relevant. What is necessary and material is whether the facts collected during investigation would
constitute the offence for which the sanction has been sought for."
23. The decision of this Court in CBI v. V.K. Bhutiani [(2009) 10 SCC 674 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 407] ,
also throws light on the question involved. In the said case, the accused against whom the criminal
proceeding and the departmental proceeding were going on, was exonerated in the departmental
proceeding by the Central Vigilance CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017
and 3093/2017 Commission. The accused challenged his prosecution before the High Court relying
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 11
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
on the decision of this Court in P.S. Rajya [(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 897] and the High Court
quashed the prosecution. On a challenge by the Central Bureau of Investigation, the decision was
reversed and after relying on the decision in M. Krishna Mohan [(2007) 14 SCC 667 : (2009) 1 SCC
(Cri) 922] , this Court came to the conclusion that the quashing of the prosecution was illegal and
while doing so observed as follows: (V.K. Bhutiani case [(2009) 10 SCC 674 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 407]
, SCC p. 678, para 6) "6. ... In our opinion, the reliance of the High Court on the ruling of P.S. Rajya
[(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 897] was totally uncalled for as the factual situation in that case
was entirely different than the one prevalent here in this case."
24. Therefore, in our opinion, the High Court quashed the prosecution on total misreading of the
judgment in P.S. Rajya case [(1996) 9 SCC 1 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 897] . In fact, there are precedents, to
which we have referred to above, that speak eloquently a contrary view i.e. exoneration in
departmental proceeding ipso facto would not lead to exoneration or acquittal in a criminal case. On
principle also, this view commends us. It is well settled that the standard of proof in a department
proceeding is lower than that of criminal prosecution. It is equally well settled that the departmental
proceeding or for that matter criminal cases have to be decided only on the basis of evidence
adduced therein. Truthfulness of the evidence in the criminal case can be judged only after the
evidence is adduced therein and the criminal case cannot be rejected on the basis of the evidence
CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 in the departmental
proceeding or the report of the inquiry officer based on those evidence.
18. As far as exoneration of the petitioners by the Inquiry Officer is concerned, in our opinion, the
said order does not preclude the prosecution from taking an action if it is otherwise permissible. The
law is fairly well settled. Exoneration by the department does not ipso facto bar the criminal court
from exercising power in accordance with the law in force. The two proceedings, criminal and
departmental, are entirely different. They operate in different fields and have different objectives.
Whereas the object of criminal trial is to inflict appropriate punishment on the offender, the purpose
of enquiry proceedings is to deal with the delinquent departmentally and to impose penalty in
accordance with the service rules. Strict rules of evidence and procedure do not apply to
departmental proceedings. The degree of proof which is necessary to order a conviction is different
from the degree of proof necessary to record the commission of delinquency. The rule relating to
appreciation of evidence in the two proceedings is also not similar. In criminal law, burden of proof
is on the prosecution and unless the prosecution is able to prove the guilt of the accused "beyond
reasonable doubt", he cannot be convicted by a court of law. In a departmental enquiry, on the other
hand, penalty can be imposed on the delinquent officer on a finding recorded on the basis of
"preponderance of probability".
19. We have carefully gone through the findings recorded by the Inquiry Officer and also the
evidence collected in the investigation and produced with the charge-sheet and we are of the view
that looking to the availability of prima facie sufficient evidence and on the peculiar facts of this
case, the criminal proceedings initiated against the petitioners cannot be quashed on this ground.
We are, therefore, unable to uphold the contention of the petitioners that since they are exonerated
in the Departmental Enquiry, the impugned order of framing charge deserves to be quashed and set
aside.

Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017
20. Challenge to validity of the prosecution sanction is made on two grounds; first incompetency of
the authority granted sanction; second non application of mind by the authority.
21. So far as the first ground is concerned suffice is to say that validity or constitutionality of any
order of circular etc cannot be challenged while exercising revisional jurisdiction and when a
sanction is granted by the administrative department following the circular which is not declared
invalid, the sanction cannot be considered invalid or without authority. However, we are observing
the facts only with the purpose to find out as to whether any prima facie case exists against the
petitioner or not.
22. Circular dated 05/09/2014 is issued by the General Administration Department, Government of
M.P. in exercise of the powers conferred by the Rules of Business of the Executive Government of
Madhya Pradesh framed in exercise of the powers conferred under Art. 166 (2) & (3) of the
Constitution of India by the Governor of Madhya Pradesh. Rule 7 & 13 of Part I of these Rules
empowers the Government to issue any circular or direction in exigencies. Rule 13 of Part I of these
Rules is as under:
Rule-7- Cases shall be brought before the Council in accordance with the law general,
directions issued hereunder or by a special direction of-
(i) The Chief Minister
(ii) The Minister-in-charge of the case with the consent of
the Chief Minister; or
(iii) The Governor under article 167(c):
Provided that no case in regard to which the finance department is required to be
consulted under rule 11 shall, save in an emergency under the direction of the Chief
Minister, be discussed by the Council of Ministers unless the CRR Nos.752/2017,
765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 Finance Minister is ready
for its consideration.
Rule-13- These rules may, to such extent as may be necessary be supplemented by
instructions to be issued from time to time.
23. Clause xxvi of part II of these Rules, which deals with the instruction issued by the Governor
under Rule 7 is also relevant here, which reads thus: :-
PART-II- Directions issued under Rule 7 of the Business Rules in regard to Council
cases or cases to be brought before the Council:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 13
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
Under Rule-7 of the Business Rules, the Governor of Madhya Pradesh is pleased to
issue the following directions to the cases which shall be brought before the Council:-
The following cases shall be brought before the council, subject to the proviso that if
the Chief Minister consider any case to be so urgent as to necessitate the immediate
issue of orders, he may direct the issue of orders at once, and when the orders have
been issued, the papers shall without avoidable delay, be circulated and brought
before a meeting of the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in
supplementary instructions 18 under rule 13:-
xxvi- Circulars embodying any important changes in the administrative system to the
State.
24. Thus, at this stage, it cannot be said that the Government has issued the circular dated
05/09/2014 without any authority to do so.
25. There is no dispute that in the case of the petitioners, Government of M.P. was the competent
authority to grant or refuse prosecution sanction. In the case in hand, it is the state government,
who accorded the sanction. It does not make any difference as to which department of the
Government has dealt with the matter or has accorded the sanction.
CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 Allocation of work is
an administrative action and only meant for the convenience of work or smooth functioning of the
executive government. Therefore, the plea of the petitioners is not tenable until and unless the vires
of the circular is not decided in their favour.
26. In the present case there is no conflict in the Business Allocation Rules or the executive
instruction issued by the State Government. It is settled law that only in case of conflict between
both of them, the Rule would prevail. Referring the judgement passed in DDA and others v.
Joginder S. Monga and others (2004) 2 SCC 297 Bench comprising Hon'ble Justice Deepak Mishra
and Justice Prafulla C. Pant has observed in AIR 2015 SC (Supp) 2093 State of Madhya Pradesh and
Ors. v. Anand Mohan and Anr. that:
14. In DDA and others v. Joginder S. Monga and others (2004) 2 SCC 297 : (AIR
2004 SC 3291), discussing the situation of conflict between statutory rule and
executive instruction, this Court has clarified as under:
"30. It is not a case where a conflict has arisen between a statute or a statutory rule
on the one hand and an executive instruction, on the other. Only in a case where a
conflict arises between a statute and an executive instruction, indisputably, the
former will prevail over the latter. The lessor under the deed of lease is to fix the
market value. It could do it areawise or plotwise. Once it does it areawise which being
final and binding, it cannot resile therefrom at a later stage and take a stand that in a
particular case it will fix the market value on the basis of the price disclosed in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 14
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
agreement of sale."
27. As there is no conflict between the Rules or the executive instruction, we have no hesitation to
discard the stand taken by the petitioners.
CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017
28. In writ petitions WP 18235 and 16793/2015 G.N. Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others decided on
21/06/2017, Division Bench of this Court considered the prosecution sanction accorded under the
G.A.D. circular dated 05/09/2014 and holding that there is nothing wrong in the procedure
prescribed by this circular, dismissed the petitions.
29. Issue of error in the sanction is also raised before us. This issue is set at rest by the Division
Bench of this Court at Principal Seat, Jabalpur in B.S. Waskel Vs. State of M.P. & others (WP Nos.
8043 of 2014, 6917, 6919 & 7302 of 2015) decided on 28/07/2015. The Division Bench has dealt
with this question in para 8,10,13 to 19, which are being reproduced here:
8. Shri Rajendra Tiwari, learned Senior Advocate and Shri Amal Pushp Shroti,
learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in all these cases prosecution has been
sanctioned by the concerned department and not by the law department. It is said
that on the basis of certain procedure laid down by the State Government in the
Circular issued on 05.09.2014 by the Chief Administrative Department sanction for
prosecution is being accorded, this according to petitioners is illegal. In as much as
vide notification dated 03.02.1988 by amending the Business Allocation Rule the
power to accord sanction was entrusted to the Department of Law and by subsequent
circular issued on 09.02.1988 it was contemplated that before according of sanction,
the Law Department would obtain the opinion of the Administrative Department
concerned, where the government servant was employed. It was further pointed out
that vide another circular dated 21.04.1997 a provision was made for referring of
matter to the competent authority of Council of Ministers in case of conflict of
opinion in the matter of granting sanction by the Administrative Department and the
Law Department. Subsequently, this provision for reference to the Sub-Committee
was deleted on 10.07.1997 CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017,
1201/2017 and 3093/2017 and various other procedures were laid down. For the
present, we need not to deal with all these questions for the simple reason that in
each case, the case of petitioners is that the sanction is granted by the concerned
department based on the procedure contemplated in the circular dated 05.09.2014
which is illegal, this circular has not been authenticated under Article 166 of the
Constitution of India and the Rules of Business. Accordingly, the first ground of
challenge is that the sanction granted is unsustainable and it is based on the illegal
sanction, the prosecution cannot be launched.
10. In support of their contention they invite our attention to recent judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court decided on 24.7.2015 in Criminal Appeal No.1867/2012
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 15
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
Nanjappa Vs. State of Karnataka, Criminal Appeal No.1838/2013 CBI Vs. Ashok
Kumar Aggarwal decided on 22.11.2013, Gulf Goans Hotels Company Ltd. and
Another Vs. Union of India and Others, (2014) 10 SCC 673 and para 21 thereof with
regard to validity of the circular and in the case of Jaipur Development Authority and
Another Vs. Vijay Kumar Data and Another, (2011) 12 SCC 94 para 53 again with
regard to validity of the circular. Accordingly, learned counsel argued that when the
sanction granted is not in accordance with law the entire prosecution becomes null
and non-est in the eyes of law and such a prosecution should be quashed.
11. Taking us through various observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Nanjappa (supra) learned counsel says that a sanction which is not in accordance with law is not a
sanction at all in the eyes of law, it is void ab initio, it goes to the root of prosecution and, therefore,
it being non-est the entire trial becomes illegal. The learned Senior Advocate Shri Rajendra Tiwari
and Shri A.P. CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 Shroti
seeks for quashment of the entire prosecution on account of fact that the sanction granted is not
proper. .........
14. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and we have perused the record. As far
as issuance of circular dated 05.09.l2014 and its validity is concerned no prayer is made in the writ
petitions to declare that this circular is illegal, unsustainable and therefore liable to be quashed.
That being so, we cannot go into the tenability of this circular, without such a specific prayer being
made. Therefore, the only question would be as to whether the sanction granted by the State
Government or the Department concerned is liable to be quashed at this stage in these proceedings
under Article 226 of the Constitution.
15. The judgment in the case of Nanjappa and Ashok Kumar Aggarwal (supra) relied upon by the
learned counsel for the parties are regular criminal appeals after complete trials have been
conducted and persons concerned have been convicted or they may be acquitted and while dealing
with those matters in a regular appeal, the question of sanction and procedure followed for sanction
have been considered. In the present petitions, the question before us is as to whether we can
interfere with the irregular or illegal sanction when the question can very well be considered by the
trial court. Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 provides for sanction which is
necessary for prosecution. sub section (3) of Section 19 and sub clause (b) & (c) thereof
contemplates that no Court shall stay a proceeding under the Act on the ground of any error,
omission or irregularity in the sanction granted by the authoritiy, unless it is satisfied that such
error, omission or irregularity committed has resulted in a failure of justice.
CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017
16. Similarly sub-section (4) of Section 19 also contemplates such a provision. This provision have
been subjected to interpretation by the Supreme Court in the case of Rajmangal Ram (Supra) and
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case has considered the question of interfering into the
question of grant of sanction by a competent authority by the High Court invoking its powers under
Section 482 of CrPC which is similar to power available under Article 226 of the Constitution. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 16
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case and after laying down the facts came to the conclusion
that the short question of law arising for consideration is as follows :
"Whether a criminal prosecution ought to be interfered with by the High Courts at
the instance of an accused who seeks midcourse relief from the criminal charges
levelled against him on grounds of defects/omissions or errors in the order granting
sanction to prosecute including errors of jurisdiction to grant such sanction ?"
17. The aforesaid question is precisely the question which is before us in all these petitions, the
question is as to whether this Court at the instance of the petitioners, who are accused, can interfere
into the matter at this stage and as the question involved in these writ petitions are also answered by
the Supreme Court after formulating the question, as indicated herinabove, in the case of Rajmangal
Ram (supra), we are required to apply the principle as laid down by the Supreme Court in the said
case. As indicated hereinabove, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in para 5 and 6 has elaborated the
object behind the grant of sanction to prosecute a public servant, need not detain the court, the
rights available to a public servant the requirement of Section 19 of the Prevention of CRR
Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 Corruption Act, Section
465 of CrPC and after referring to various judgments has considered the question and the statutory
enactment provided for interference in the matter of error, omission or irregularity in sanction, the
concept of failure of justice occurring as indicated in statutory provision particularly Section
19(3)(4) and in para 8 has laid down the principle in the following manner :
"8. The above view also found reiteration in Prakash Singh Badal and Another vs.
State of Punjab and Others wherein it was, inter alia, held that mere omission, error
or irregularity in sanction is not to be considered fatal unless it has resulted in failure
of justice. In Prakash Singh Badal (supra) it was further held that Section 19(1) of the
PC Act is a matter of procedure and does not go to the root of jurisdiction. On the
same line is the decision of this Court in R. Venkatkrishnan vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation. In fact, a three Judge Bench in State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Virender
Kumar Tripathi while considering an identical issue, namely, the validity of the grant
of sanction by the Additional Secretary of the Department of Law and Legislative
Affairs of the Government of Madhya Pradesh instead of the authority in the parent
department, this Court held that in view of Section 19 (3) of the PC Act, interdicting a
criminal proceeding mid-course on ground of invalidity of the sanction order will not
be appropriate unless the court can also reach the conclusion that failure of justice
had been occasioned by any such error, omission or irregularity in the sanction. It
was further held that failure of justice can be established not at the stage of framing
of charge but CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and
3093/2017 only after the trial has commenced and evidence is led (Para 10 of the
Report)."
18. Thereafter in para 9 the Hon'ble Supreme Court refers to a contrary view in the case of State of
Goa Vs. Babu Thomas (2005) 8 SCC 130, distinguishes it in the light of the judgment in the case of
State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Virendra Kumar Tripathi (2009) 15 SCC 533 and has quashed the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/167102965/ 17
Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
orders passed by the High Court interfering with the sanction, by so observing in para 10 and 11:-
"10. In the instant cases the High Court had interdicted the criminal proceedings on
the ground that the Law Department was not the competent authority to accord
sanction for the prosecution of the respondents. Even assuming that the Law
Department was not competent, it was still necessary for the High Court to reach the
conclusion that a failure of justice has been occasioned. Such a finding is
conspicuously absent rendering it difficult to sustain the impugned orders of the
High Court.
11. The High Court in both the cases had also come to the conclusion that the
sanction orders in question were passed mechanically and without consideration of
the relevant facts and records. This was treated as an additional ground for
interference with the criminal proceedings registered against the respondents.
Having perused the relevant part of the orders under challenge we do not think that
the High Court was justified in coming to the said findings at the stage when the
same were recorded. A more appropriate stage for reaching the said conclusion
would have been only after evidence in the cases had been led on the issue in CRR
Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 question."
19. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the aforesaid case in the back drop of aforesaid
legal principle laid down by the Supreme Court, we are of the considered view that the material
available before us is not sufficient enough to indicate that failure of justice has occasioned in the
matter and in the absence of the entire evidence we cannot go into all these questions. That apart,
when all these questions can be considered by the trial court, and when the question of sanction
granted being illegally or irregularity can be challenged before the trial court, interfering into the
matter by this Court at this stage is not called for.
30. Some of the petitioners themselves approached this Court by filing Writ Petition Nos. 6847,
6858 and 6860 of 2016 to challenge the prosecution sanction accorded against them on the similar
ground. Their petitions were dismissed by Division Bench of this Court observing that:
2. It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Department,
who had granted the sanction, do not have power to grant sanction for prosecution
and only the Law and Legislative Affairs Department, which was competent to
sanction the same. It is further submitted that on the same charge, the petitioner has
been exonerated in the Departmental Enquiry conducted by the respondent No.2 and
enquiry report dated 10.10.2011 was passed vide Annexure P/6. There was no fault on
behalf of the petitioner. Hence, it is prayed that the impugned order dated 27.10.2014
granting prosecution sanction by the respondent No.1 be quashed.
3. A detailed reply has been filed by the respondent No.1 stating wherein that as per
Section 19 (3) & (4) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 as well as the law laid
down by the CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and

Ashok Kumar Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 January, 2019
3093/2017 Division Bench of this High Court at Principal Seat Jabalpur in the matter
of B.S.Waskel and others vs. State of M.P. and others {W.P. Nos. 8043/2014,
6917,6010 and 7302 of 2015} decided on 28.7.2015, so also the order of Division
Bench of this Court in the case of Arvind Geete vs. Law & Legislative Affairs
Department {W.P.No.7892/2015} decided on 02.8.2016, the validity of sanction
cannot be considered at this stage under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The
petitioner is at liberty to challenge the same in appropriate proceeding at appropriate
stage.
4. The facts of the present case and the facts of the case of B.S. Waskel (supra) are
similar. Paragraphs Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 19 to 22 are the relevant
parts of the order, which are reproduced as under:-
19. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the aforesaid case in the back
drop of aforesaid legal principle laid down by the Supreme Court, we are of the
considered view that the material available before us is not sufficient enough to
indicate that failure of justice has occasioned in the matter and in the absence of the
entire evidence we cannot go into all these questions.
That apart, when all these questions can be considered by the trial court, and when the question of
sanction granted being illegally or irregularity can be challenged before the trial court, interfering
into the matter by this Court at this stage is not called for.
20. Apart from challenging the sanction of prosecution granted, in some of the petitions the
petitioner B.S. Waskel has also made a prayer that the respondents be restrained from suspending
the petitioner due to his involvement in criminal case.
CRR Nos.752/2017, 765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017
21. In accordance to rule 9 of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)
Rules in anticipation that the petitioner may be suspended no preventive direction can be issued.
That apart, under the statutory rule there is a provision for appeal against order of suspension and,
therefore, at this stage when suspension order has not been issued, in anticipation of suspension,
interference cannot be made. Accordingly, we find no ground to interfere on such ground.
22. In view of above, for the present, we find no reason to interfere into the matter. All the four
petitions are, therefore, dismissed.
5. In view of the aforesaid, so also the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of State of
Madhya Pradesh vs. Pradeep Kumar Gupta reported in (2011) 6 SCC 389 and the law laid down by
Division Bench of this Court in the case of B.S. Waskel and others (supra) shall apply mutatis
mutandis and therefore, we are of the view that the validity of sanction cannot be considered at this
stage. The petitioner is at liberty to challenge the same in appropriate proceeding at appropriate
stage.

6. In view of the above, all the three petitions are, therefore, dismissed.
31. In Dinesh Kumar v. Chairman, Airport Authority of India and Anr AIR 2012 Sc 858 the Hon'ble
Apex Court held that:
13. In our view, having regard to the facts of the present case, now since cognizance
has already been taken against the appellant by the Trial Judge, the High Court
cannot be said to have erred in leaving the question of validity of sanction open for
consideration by the Trial Court and giving liberty to the CRR Nos.752/2017,
765/2017, 919/2017, 974/2017, 1201/2017 and 3093/2017 appellant to raise the issue
concerning validity of sanction order in the course of trial. Such course is in accord
with the decision of this Court in Parkash Singh Badal5 and not unjustified.
32. At the stage of granting sanction meticulous or legalistic examination or analysis of the evidence
placed before the authority is not required. When all relevant material/evidence collected by the
Investigating Agency is properly placed before the sanctioning authority and the sanction itself is
very expressive or itself is eloquent enough, then in that case, the argument that the sanctioning
authority has not applied its mind becomes unsustainable. In the present case, from the order
granting sanction itself, it is evident that the facts contained in the sanction order read with
evidence placed before the sanctioning authority makes it clear that before granting the sanction,
the authority has examined the material available on record and has accorded sanction accordingly.
33. Thus, on the question of validity of the sanction on the ground that it has not been issued by the
competent authority, we are not impress by the arguments putforth by the learned counsels of the
petitioners and so far as its validity on the ground of non application of mind is concern, the plea of
the petitioners is not sustainable.
34. In view of the foregoing discussion, we do not see any error, illegality or perversity in the
impugned order of framing charge against the petitioners. Therefore, we are not inclined to interfere
with the same. In our considered opinion, the petitions are devoid of merits, deserve to be and are
dismissed hereby. However, no order as to the cost.
