ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996, PRAYING TO APPOINT

M/S Sobha Limited vs M/S Nava Vishwa Shashi Vijaya Krishna ... on 10 June, 2022
AN ARBITRATOR TO ADJUDICATE THE DISPUTES THAT HAVE ARISEN
BETWEEN THE PETITIONER AND THE RESPONDENTS AS PER CLAUSE
11 OF THE WORK ORDER DATED 15.01.2014 (ANNEXURE-'A') AND
ETC.
THIS PETITION, HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED FOR
ORDERS, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT THIS DAY, THE COURT
MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
Heard counsel for the petitioner and perused the record.
2. The Civil Miscellaneous Petition is filed under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 seeking appointment of an Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute that has arisen between the
petitioner and respondents as per clause 11 of the Work Order dated 15.01.2014 (Annexure-'A').
3. The facts of the case in brevity are that the 1st respondent approached the petitioner and
informed that it is interested in entrusting design and construction of residential building work at
No.25, 15 th Main Road, 10th Cross, RMV Extension, Bangalore, on a plot. Accordingly 1st
respondent issued Work Order dated 15.01.2014 in favour of the petitioner. It is alleged that the
respondents also entrusted to the petitioner the work of carrying out residential building
construction work at their Plot No.32-33, Road No.11, Next to M.P. Rajagopal House, Film Nagar,
Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad and the petitioner agreed for the same.
4. It is submitted that the petitioner had completed construction works of both the residential
buildings during the period 2014 to 2018. The possession of the buildings situated at Bangalore and
Hyderabad were handed over to respondents and the same has been accepted by the respondents
without any demur. The respondents are in complete occupation and enjoyment of the same.
However, they have not paid the balance amount for construction work done by the petitioner. The
respondents have made part payment and have paid only Rs.3,53,57,520/-. The respondents are
required to pay a sum of Rs.18,44,30,380/- along with interest as balance amount which is due to
the petitioner. The petitioner has repeatedly requested the respondents to make the payment of the
balance amount, however, the respondents did not bother to reply to the letters of the petitioner or
make the payment of the balance amount with interest. The petitioner has sent several letters to the
respondents. The petitioner has invoked clause 11 of the Work Order by sending a notice dated
14.07.2020 to respondents and nominated Sri. S.S.Nagarale, retired District Judge as Sole
Arbitrator. The said notice has been served on respondent No.1 on 27.07.2020. However, he has not
sent any reply. The petitioner has received the reply only from respondent Nos.2 to 9 and they have
baldly denied the lawful claim made by the petitioner. The respondent Nos.2 to 9 are the Directors /
officials of respondent No.1. The petitioner is therefore left with no other option but to file the
instant petition under Section 11(6) for appointment of Arbitrator. The petitioner has also filed
Commercial A.A. No. 9/2021 before the City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru, under Section 9 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

M/S Sobha Limited vs M/S Nava Vishwa Shashi Vijaya Krishna ... on 10 June, 2022
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the Hon'ble Supreme Court's decisions
in MTNL v. Canara Bank1, and Punjab State v. Dina Nath2, to submit and establish that there is a
valid arbitration agreement in existence between the petitioner and the Respondents. (2020) 12 SCC
767 (2007) 5 SCC 28
6. Reliance is also placed upon decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohd. Masroor Shaikh v.
Bharat Bhushan Gupta3 and Sanjiv Prakash v. Seema Kukreja4 to submit that this Court has a
limited scope of interference at this referral stage under Section 11 of the Act of 1996 for
appointment of arbitrator, particularly after the introduction of Section 6A post the 2015
Amendment to the Act of 1996. Hence, the power of a court under Section 11 should be limited to
viewing whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties and any elaborate review of
facts and law which appears to be arguable would be non-determinable at the stage of reference.
7. The respondents have remained unrepresented in view of the office objection raised to seek
clarification as to how Respondents No. 2 to 9 have been made parties in this petition, when those
are not parties in the work order vide Annexure-'A'. However, office objection stands overruled.
8. The issue before this Court is required to determine in the present petition as to whether the
prayer of the petitioner (2022) 4 SCC 156 (2021) 9 SCC 732 seeking appointment of an Arbitrator
under the provisions of Section 11 of the Act of 1996 is maintainable in view of Clause 11 of the work
order dated 15.01.2014, which stipulates that in the event of failure of parties to resolve their dispute
through conciliation, they shall refer their dispute to the sole arbitrator under the Act of 1996, which
has not been resorted to by the petitioner.
9. The work order dated 15.01.2014 at Annexure-'A' contains an arbitration clause for adjudication
of the dispute, which is as under:
"Clause 11- In the event of any dispute arises out of this work order, which could not
be settled through conciliation between the parties concerned, shall be referred to the
sole arbitrator appointed by awarder in accordance with the Arbitration and
Reconciliation Act and the arbitration award shall be binding on all the parties
concerned and final. Place of arbitration is Bangalore."
10. It is clear from the materials on record that the dispute, particularly concerning the Bengaluru
property, has arisen between the parties in relation to the aforesaid work order. A bare perusal of
the aforesaid Clause makes it manifestly clear that parties have mutually made an arrangement to
initiate conciliation to resolve the dispute and if differences were still left unresolved after the stage
of conciliation, then the dispute was agreed to be referred to arbitration.
11. Part III of the Act of 1996 deals with conciliation. Section 61 provides:
61. Application and scope.--(1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time
being in force and unless the parties have otherwise agreed, this Part shall apply to
conciliation of disputes arising out of legal relationship, whether contractual or not,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128278448/ 5
M/S Sobha Limited vs M/S Nava Vishwa Shashi Vijaya Krishna ... on 10 June, 2022
and to all proceedings relating thereto.
(2) This Part shall not apply where by virtue of any law for the time being in force certain disputes
may not be submitted to conciliation.
Section 62 speaks of commencement of conciliation proceedings, which provides that a party
initiating conciliation shall send to the other party a written invitation to conciliate under Part III,
briefly identifying the subject of the dispute and the conciliation proceedings shall commence when
the other party accepts in writing the invitation of conciliation. If the other party rejects the
invitation, there will be no conciliation proceedings. The conciliator provides guidance as provided
for under Section 67 of the Act of 1996, which is to only assist the parties in an independent and
impartial manner to reach a conciliatory settlement of their dispute. Under Section 73, the
conciliator formulates the terms of a possible settlement when it appears to him or her that there
exist elements of a settlement which is acceptable to the parties. Nonetheless, it is the parties who
are required to reach an agreement on a settlement of dispute whereby the conciliator merely
authenticates the settlement agreement.
12. The language in Clause 11 of the work order dated 15.01.2014 where an initial step of conciliation
had been agreed for between the petitioner and respondent, clearly shows the confidence which the
parties had in each other to resolve the dispute and hence, provides to refer the dispute to
arbitration in case such conciliation fails; thereby, making it a precondition before further referring
the dispute for arbitration.
13. In the instant case, from the correspondence exchanged between the parties at Annexures-B to
F2, it is clearly seen that no steps have been taken nor any attempt was made by the petitioner to
initiate conciliation proceedings with the Respondents before issuing the notice dated 14.07.2020
that invoked the arbitration clause for resolving the dispute by referring it to arbitration, which
happens to be a condition precedent as seen from the set-up of Clause 11 of the work order dated
15.01.2014 for triggering the process of arbitration. However, by approaching this Court for seeking
appointment of an Arbitrator, it appears the petitioner is trying to bypass or skip this preceding
condition of taking recourse to conciliation, thereby making an attempt to render the substance of
Clause 11 of the work order as ineffectual.
14. Hence, a question also arises at this point as to whether the petitioner has satisfied the
conditions for appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act of 1996 and if this Court is
justified to consider this question at this stage. At this juncture, I may refer to Paras 39 and 47(iv) of
SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,5 which are as follows:
39. It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice, approached with an
application under Section 11 of the Act, is to decide at that stage.
Obviously, he has to decide his own jurisdiction in the sense whether the party making the motion
has approached the right High Court. He has to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement, as
defined in the Act and whether the person who has made the request before him, is a party to such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128278448/ 6
M/S Sobha Limited vs M/S Nava Vishwa Shashi Vijaya Krishna ... on 10 June, 2022
an agreement. It is necessary to indicate that he can also decide the question whether the claim was
a dead one; or a long-barred claim that was sought to be resurrected and whether the parties have
concluded the transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by
receiving the final payment without objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to decide whether
a live claim made, is one which comes within the purview of the arbitration clause. It will be
appropriate to leave that question to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal on taking evidence, along
with the merits of the claims involved in the arbitration. The Chief Justice has to decide whether the
applicant has satisfied the (2005) 8 SCC 618 conditions for appointing an arbitrator under Section
11(6) of the Act. For the purpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the Chief Justice can either
proceed on the basis of affidavits and the documents produced or take such evidence or get such
evidence recorded, as may be necessary. We think that adoption of this procedure in the context of
the Act would best serve the purpose sought to be achieved by the Act of expediting the process of
arbitration, without too many approaches to the court at various stages of the proceedings before
the Arbitral Tribunal.
47. We, therefore, sum up our conclusions as follows:
(iv) The Chief Justice or the designated Judge will have the right to decide the preliminary aspects
as indicated in the earlier part of this judgment. These will be his own jurisdiction to entertain the
request, the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise of a live claim, the
existence of the condition for the exercise of his power and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or
arbitrators. The Chief Justice or the designated Judge would be entitled to seek the opinion of an
institution in the matter of nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of Section 11(8) of the Act if
the need arises but the order appointing the arbitrator could only be that of the Chief Justice or the
designated Judge.
15. In the aforesaid decision of the Constitution Bench, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has emphasized
in paras 39 and 47(iv) whether the petitioner has satisfied the condition for appointing the
Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act of 1996. The opening words of Section 11(6) read along
with clause (a) of the sub-section are "where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the
parties, a party fails to act as required under that procedure". Here, the petitioner has failed to act as
required under the appointment procedure of initiating conciliation proceedings with the
Respondents before referring the dispute for arbitration by invoking Clause 11 of the work order
which carries the arbitration clause. This also falls foul of the principle recognized by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in M.K. Shah Engineers & Contractors v. State of M.P.,6 that the steps preceding the
coming into operation of the arbitration clause are (1999) 2 SCC 594 essential in nature and parties
cannot bypass or skip the prerequisites to invoke arbitration directly.
16. In view of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view that where an agreed procedure of dispute
resolution has been made a condition precedent for invoking the arbitration clause, the same is
required to be followed.
17. The learned counsel for the petitioner has stressed on the limited scope of interference of this
Court under Section 11 of the Act of 1996 for the appointment of an arbitrator by relying on Mohd.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128278448/ 7
M/S Sobha Limited vs M/S Nava Vishwa Shashi Vijaya Krishna ... on 10 June, 2022
Masroor Shaikh v. Bharat Bhushan Gupta (supra) and Sanjiv Prakash v. Seema Kukreja (supra)
whereby this Court should not indulge in a mini-trial at this referral stage. It is made clear that
nowhere in the instant matter is this Court pertained to delving into an elaborate review of facts and
law, which is subject to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. As stated supra, this Court is concerned
with the satisfaction of the petitioner's making out a prima facie arbitrable case at this referral stage
under Section 11 and particularly, sub-section (6) of the said provision.
18. Similar view has also been reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in DLF Home Developers
Limited v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd.,7 but it has also clearly stated that even within its limited
jurisdiction under Section 11, "[this] Court is not denuded of its judicial function to look beyond the
bare existence of an arbitration clause to cut the dead wood." This decision had also followed the
eloquent clarification by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.,8 where it
had observed that "the court may for legitimate reasons, to prevent wastage of public resources, can
exercise judicial discretion to conduct an intense yet summary prima facie review while remaining
conscious that it is to assist the arbitration procedure and not usurp jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal."
19. Taking further recourse to these views of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and without causing any
prejudice to the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal, I would like to make two cursory
observations as obiter dicta in the capacity of my judicial discretion that had appeared to me during
the prima facie review. First, the instant petition sought for an appointment 2021 SCC Online SC 781
(2021) 2 SCC 1, para 139 of an arbitrator as per the work order dated 15.01.2014 pertaining to the
dispute between the parties related to the Hyderabad property as well, in addition to the Bengaluru
property. It is interesting to note that the work order forms the existence of an arbitration
agreement concerning only the Bengaluru property. There is no written agreement between the
parties concerning the Hyderabad property that may refer to a contract formation and hence, does
not establish the existence of an arbitration agreement in that regard. Second, the claim also
appears to be a dead one, albeit not patently, in light of a technical distinction made to the
elucidating illustration for what is a dead or time-barred claim in the Hon'ble Supreme Court's
decision in Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. SPS Engg. Ltd.9 The Hon'ble Apex Court, speaking through
Raveendran, J., observed that:
14. [...] We may elucidate by an illustration: If the contractor makes a claim a decade
or so after completion of the work without referring to any acknowledgement of a
liability or other factors that kept the claim alive in law, and the claim is patently long
time barred, the Chief Justice or his Designate will examine whether the claim is a
dead claim (that (2011) 3 SCC 507 is, a long time barred claim). On the other hand, if
the contractor makes a claim for payment, beyond three years of completing of the
work but say within five years of completion of work, and alleges that the final bill
was drawn up and payments were made within three years before the claim, the court
will not enter into a disputed question whether the claim was barred by limitation or
not. The court will leave the matter to the decision of the Tribunal.

M/S Sobha Limited vs M/S Nava Vishwa Shashi Vijaya Krishna ... on 10 June, 2022
Applying this illustration on the facts of the instant case, there is no doubt that the claim for
payment has been made by the petitioner beyond three years of completing the work i.e., in 2018
but within five years of completion of work. However, as per the cheque placed on record by the
petitioner dated 14.08.2018, which was the last payment received by the petitioner, this does not fall
within the three year timeline with respect to the concerned claim made through this instant
petition filed on 03.01.2022, which had expired on 14.08.2021 and hence, may warrant this Court to
enter into the question whether the claim is barred by limitation or not.
20. In view of the above, it is better to leave the question of limitation at this stage for final
determination by the Tribunal as it requires detail examination which may also require the parties
to place the evidence on record in this regard.
21. In the end, I am of the considered view that the petitioner having not fulfilled the precondition of
conciliation before invoking arbitration clause under the work order dated 15.01.2014, has no right
to invoke the arbitration clause at this stage. Petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act is premature and liable to be dismissed. It is hereby dismissed.
Before parting with the judgment, this Court places on record its deep appreciation for the research
and assistance rendered by Mr. Sourabh Roy, Law-Clerk-cum-Research Assistant.
