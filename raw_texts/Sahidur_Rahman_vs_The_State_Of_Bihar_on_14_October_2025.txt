CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE PURNENDU SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 14-10-2025 Heard Ms. Namrata Mishra, learned Senior Advocate along with Mr. Ratnakar
Jha, learned counsels appearing on behalf of the petitioner and the learned APP for the State.
2. The present application has been filed under Section 528 of BNSS for quashing of order dated
17.05.2025 passed in Mahila PS Case No.21 of 2021 (GR No.268/2021) CRI Case No.268 of 2021 by
the learned SDJM, Madhubani, whereby the cognizance has been taken under Sections 323, 341,
498(A), 494/34 of the IPC and Sections Â¾ of DP At.
3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that prior to lodging of the
present FIR, OP Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.56702 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 No.2 had lodged
Complaint Case No.53 of 2021. Learned counsel further submitted that for the same offence, the
petitioner can not be subjected to face two prosecutions. Otherwise also, learned counsel submitted
that the petitioner is ready for settlement and for that she seeks some time so that the effort can be
taken to settle the strained relationship between the parties, who are husband and wife. Learned
Counsel further submitted that marriage is a sacred ceremony but little matrimonial skirmish
suddenly erupts into hatred and the parties ponder to reconcile their dispute outside the court. He

further submitted that matter be referred for mediation.
4. Learned APP submitted that opportunity shall be given to the parties to reconcile their dispute
amicably.
5. Heard the parties.
6. Having considered the rival submissions made on behalf of the parties, I find that the parties have
strained the matrimonial relationship, in such circumstances, the Court till last minute must strive
to give opportunity to the parties to settle the dispute between the husband and wife amicably. The
matrimonial dispute is not an offense against the society rather a matrimonial dispute is a private
conflict between spouses and does not inherently constitute an offence against society. Patna High
Court CR. MISC. No.56702 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 However, a false case can have a disastrous
consequence in absence of any criminal content. The personal dispute cannot call for a criminal
offence. Continuation of the proceeding would amount to abuse of process of law leading to
vexatious proceeding against the petitioners.
7. In this regard, the Apex Court in the case of B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana, reported in, (2003) 4
SCC 675, in paragraph nos. 12 and 13 has held as under:-
" 12. The special features in such matrimonial matters are evident. It becomes the
duty of the court to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes.
13. The observations made by this Court, though in a slightly different context, in
G.V. Rao v. L.H.V. Prasad [(2000) 3 SCC 693 :
2000 SCC (Cri) 733] are very apt for determining the approach required to be kept in
view in a matrimonial dispute by the courts. It was said that there has been an
outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent times. Marriage is a sacred ceremony, the
main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down in life and live
peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly erupt which often assume
serious proportions resulting in commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the
family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and
brought about rapprochement are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as
accused in the criminal case. There are many other reasons which need not be
mentioned here for not encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may
ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law where it takes years and years to
conclude and in that process the parties lose their "young" days in chasing their
"cases" in different courts.
8. Petitioner is directed to appear before the learned District Court on 27.11.2025 at 10:30 AM.

9. Learned District Court is directed to take necessary steps to refer the matter before the learned
Mediator of the District Mediation Center.
10. Learned Mediator of the District Mediation Center concerned shall make his/her best efforts to
settle the dispute between the parties amicably and thereafter submit his/her report before the
concerned learned District Court, well within a period of four months, till then, no coercive action
shall be taken against the petitioner no. 1 in connection with the aforesaid case.
11. In case, the parties resolve their dispute amicably, then the proceeding is required to be dropped
in light of the law laid down by the Apex Court as referred hereinabove.
12. In case of failure on the part of the petitioner to appear on 27.11.2025 before the learned District
Court or any date fixed by the learned Mediator, the interim protection granted to the petitioner
shall automatically lose its force.
13. In case, it is deliberate on the part of the Petitioner and he fails to reconcile, then in that case, the
learned District Court shall proceed with the trial. In case, it is deliberate on the part of the O P No.
2 to reconcile then in that case, continuing with the criminal proceeding will amount to abuse of the
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.56702 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 process of the court and the interim
protection granted to the petitioner shall continue and the proceeding against her is required to be
dropped in accordance with law.
14. Accordingly, the present quashing application stands disposed of.
