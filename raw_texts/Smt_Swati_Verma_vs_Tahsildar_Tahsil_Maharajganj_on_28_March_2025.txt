this Hon'ble Court."
Considering the fact that the case in issue relates to mutation and as per Rule 34(7) of U.P. Revenue

summary in nature, ought to have been decided within 45 days, if there is no dispute and if there is
dispute, then the same should preferably be decided within 90 days, this Court is of the view that no
gainful purpose will be served in keeping the present petition pending.
In view of above, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondent
No.1/Tehsildar, Tehsil-Maharajganj, District Raebareli to consider and decide the Case
No.6690/2024 (Computerized Case No.T202410580106690) (Smt. Shiv Devi versus Ashish Kumar
Chaudhari), most expeditiously after affording full opportunity of hearing to the party to the
litigation and without granting unnecessary adjournment to either party preferably within a period
of three months from the next date fixed in the case, if there is no other legal impediment in this
regard.
It is made clear that the Court has not examined the case of either party on merits and the Authority
concerned shall be free to decide the matter strictly in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid, the petition is disposed of.
