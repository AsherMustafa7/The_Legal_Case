JUDGMENT
(The matter is heard through Video Conferencing/Hybrid mode) This appeal has been filed by the
appellant-Insurance Company against the liability fastened on them in the award dated 15.07.2013
made in M.C.O.P.No.153 of 2011 on the file of the III Additional District & Sessions Court, (Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal), Kallakurichi, Villupuram District.
2.The appellant is the 2nd respondent in M.C.O.P. No.153 of 2011 on the file of the III Additional
District & Sessions Court, (Motor Accident Claims Tribunal), Kallakurichi, Villupuram District. The
1st respondent/claimant filed the said claim petition, claiming a sum of Rs.21,08,000/- as
compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the accident that took place on 02.07.2008.
_____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
3.According to the 1st respondent, on the date of accident, when he was riding the Motorcycle
bearing Registration No.TN-31-M-9844 from Erumbur to Neyveli, near Veenangeni Bus Stop at
Cuddalore to Vridhachalam Main Road, one unidentified Tata Sumo Car dashed against the
Motorcycle and caused the accident. In the accident, the 1 st respondent suffered grievous and
multiple injuries all over the body. The accident has occurred only due to rash and negligent driving
by driver of the unidentified Tata Sumo Car. Hence, the 1st respondent filed the claim petition
claiming compensation against the 2 nd respondent as owner of the Motorcycle which he was riding
and appellant, as insurer of the said vehicle.
4.The 2nd respondent, owner of the Motorcycle, remained exparte before the Tribunal.
5.The appellant-Insurance Company, filed counter statement and denied all the averments made by
the 1st respondent in the claim petition. _____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis According to the
appellant, the Motorcycle owned by the 2nd respondent was not insured with them, as the 1st
respondent neither mentioned the Policy number in the claim petition nor produced the policy copy
along with the claim petition. The claim petition is not maintainable as the owner, driver and
insurer of the Tata Sumo Car are not impleaded as a party. FIR has been registered against the
driver of the unidentified Tata Sumo Car on 09.08.2008, belatedly. As the 1st respondent is a
gratuitous passenger, he cannot claim compensation from the appellant, for an accident that
occurred due to his own negligence. The 1st respondent has to prove his age, avocation and income
to claim compensation. In any event, the total compensation claimed is excessive and prayed for
dismissal of the claim petition.

6.Before the Tribunal, the 1st respondent examined himself as P.W.1, examined Dr.Visvanathan as
P.W.2 and marked 17 documents as Exs.P1 to P17. The appellant examined one Sampath, Legal
Adviser of the appellant- Transport Corporation as R.W.1 and marked Policy copy as Ex.R1. _____
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7.The Tribunal considering the pleadings, oral and documentary evidence, held that the 1st
respondent is entitled to compensation for the injuries sustained in the accident and directed the
appellant, as insurer of the said vehicle, to pay a sum of Rs.5,80,000/- as compensation to the 1 st
respondent.
8.Challenging the liability fastened on them by the award of the Tribunal dated 15.07.2013 made in
M.C.O.P.No.153 of 2011, the appellant - Insurance Company has come out with the present appeal.
9.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the Tribunal failed to see that the
1st respondent is the tort-feasor and he is not entitled to get compensation from the
appellant-Insurance Company. The Tribunal erred in fastening the liability on the
appellant-Insurance Company, as he is not covered under the policy issued by the appellant. The
Tribunal, considering the oral and documentary evidence let in by the appellant, ought to have
exonerated the appellant-Insurance Company from the liability. The _____
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Tribunal failed to consider the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex
Court reported in (2009) 13 SCC 710 [Ningamma and another Vs. United India Insurance Company
Limited] and 2021 (2) TN MAC 574 [New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Gurumoorthy and others]
and prayed for setting aside the award of the Tribunal.
10.Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the 1 st respondent contended that while the 1st
respondent was riding the Motorcycle, one unidentified Tata Sumo Car, driven in a rash and
negligent manner, dashed against the Motorcycle in which the 1st respondent was riding. The Tata
Sumo Car did not stop and Police could not trace the vehicle. Unfortunately, the said Tata Sumo Car
escaped in the hit and run case accident. The 1 st respondent has filed the claim petition under
Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act [hereinafter, referred to as, 'the Act']. When the claim
petition is filed under Section 163 of the Act, the claimant need not plead and prove the negligence
on the part of the driver or owner of the vehicle. The claimant has to prove that the accident
occurred arising out of use of Motorcycle and owner and _____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
insurer are liable for death or permanent disability. As per the provisions of Section 163A, the user
of the vehicle steps into the shoes of the owner and hence, the owner and Insurance Company are
liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. The compensation claimed under Section 163A of
the Act is for own damage from the Insurance Company. The Hon'ble Apex Court, in the judgment
reported in (2009) 13 SCC 710 [Ningamma and another Vs. United India Insurance Company
Limited], held that when the Motorcycle involved in the accident hit the bullock cart, the claimant
was entitled to just compensation not only under Section 163A of the Act, but also under Section 166
of the Act. The learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent relied on paragraph nos.36 and 37
of the judgment reported in (2009) 13 SCC 710, which reads as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/11991376/ 3
The Branch Office vs P.Selvakumaravel on 15 December, 2021
“36.The High Court was required to consider the aforesaid issues even if it found that
the provision of Section 163-A of MVA was not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case. Since all the aforesaid issues are purely questions
of fact, we do not propose to deal with these issues and we send the matter back to
the High Court for dealing with the said issues and to render its decision in
accordance with law.
_____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
37.The High Court will also consider the question of quantum of compensation, if
any, to which the claimants might be entitled to, having regard to the earning
capacity of the deceased and "Just Compensation", if any. Since the claim is a very
old claim, we request the High Court to consider the matter as expeditiously as
possible.” The learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent further submitted
that the said judgment was affirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment
reported in 2020 (2) SCC 550 [Ramkhiladi and another Vs. United India Insurance
Company Limited and another]. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court,
the 1st respondent has filed the claim petition under Section 163 A of the Act. The 1st
respondent is entitled to just compensation.
The Tribunal considering the nature of injuries and avocation, has awarded compensation. There is
no error in the said award of the Tribunal and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.
11.Though notice has been served on the 2nd respondent and his name is printed in the cause list,
there is no representation for him either in person or through counsel.
_____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
12.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant-Insurance Company as well as the 1st
respondent and perused the entire materials available on record.
13.From the materials on record, it is seen that it is the admitted case of the 1st respondent that
while he was riding the Motorcycle, one unidentified Tata Sumo Car dashed against the Motorcycle
in which he was riding and caused the accident. In the said accident, the 1st respondent sustained
grievous injuries all over the body, fracture on both bones of right leg and middle finger of right
hand and amputation of distal pulp middle finger of right hand. It is the specific case of the 1st
respondent that accident occurred due to the negligence of driver of the unidentified Tata Sumo Car
and accident is a hit and run case. The 1st respondent as well as the Police could not identify the
Tata Sumo Car, which caused the accident. In such circumstances, the 1 st respondent filed claim
petition against the 2nd respondent, as owner of the Motorcycle in which he was riding and
appellant, as insurer of the _____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Motorcycle. The 1st
respondent has filed the claim petition under Section 163A of the Act. According to the 1st
respondent, the compensation claimed by him is for own damages from the Insurance Company.
Section 163 A of the Act is extracted hereunder for ready reference:

The Branch Office vs P.Selvakumaravel on 15 December, 2021
"163-A. Special provisions as to payment of compensation on structured- formula
basis. -
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time
being in force or instrument having the force of law, the owner of the motor vehicle or
the authorised insurer shall be liable to pay in the case of death or permanent
disablement due to accident arising out of the use of motor vehicle, compensation, as
indicated in the Second Schedule, to the legal heirs or the victim, as the case may be.
Explanation. – For the purposes of this sub-section, “permanent disability” shall have the same
meaning and extent as in the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923.
(2) In any claim for compensation under sub-section (1), the claimant shall not be required to plead
or establish that the death or permanent disablement in _____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
respect of which the claim has been made was due to any wrongful act or neglect or default of the
owner of the vehicle or vehicles concerned or of any other person.
(3) The Central Government may, keeping in view the cost of living by notification in the Official
Gazette, from time to time amend the Second Schedule.” As per the above said Section, the owner of
the Motorcycle or authorized insurer is liable to pay compensation in case of permanent disability
due to “accident arising out of use of Motorcycle as per Second Schedule”. As per Sub Section (2) of
Section 163A of the Act, the claimant is not required to plead and establish that the death or
permanent disability in respect of the claim made was due to any wrongful act or neglect or default
of the owner of the vehicle or vehicles concerned or of any other person. The Hon'ble Apex Court, in
the judgment referred to by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant as well as the
respondents, held that the rider of Two Wheeler, who has borrowed the Two Wheeler from the
owner of the vehicle, steps into shoes of the owner of the vehicle. It is also held that owner of the
vehicle is not entitled to claim compensation against his own insurer. The reason for the _____
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis same is that the Insurance Company is liable to pay compensation
on behalf of the owner of the vehicle and liability of the Insurance Company arises only when the
insured owner of the vehicle is liable to pay compensation. The issue whether rider of the Two
Wheeler can claim compensation from owner of the vehicle in which he was riding at the time of
accident and from the Insurance Company of the said vehicle is no longer res-integra. The Hon'ble
Apex Court has held that rider of the Two Wheeler cannot claim compensation against the owner of
the vehicle and also the Insurance Company, as a tort-feasor is not entitled to claim such
compensation. I had an occasion to consider the very same issue in the judgment reported in 2021
(2) TN MAC 574 (referred to above). After considering the following judgments of the Hon'ble Apex
Court and this Court reported in 2009 (2) TNMAC 169 (SC) [Ningamma & another v. United India
Insurance Co. Ltd.], (2008) 2 TNMAC 336 SC [Oriental Insurance Company vs. Rajni Devi and
others], 2017 (2) TNMAC 753 (SC) [United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Sunil Kumar and another],
2018 (2) TNMAC 149 (SC) [Shivaji and another Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.], 2020 (1) TN
MAC 1 (SC) [Ramkhiladi and _____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis another Vs. United India
Insurance Co. Ltd., and another], 2004 (1) TN MAC (SC) 193 [Deepal Girishbhai Soni and others v.
United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Baroda], 2018 (2) TN MAC 286 (SC) and judgment made in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/11991376/ 5
The Branch Office vs P.Selvakumaravel on 15 December, 2021
C.M.A.No.3414 of 2019 dated 28.05.2020, I held as follows:
“24.In the present case, from the materials available on record, it is seen that the
deceased who was riding the motorcycle at the time of accident, borrowed the
motorcycle from the 3rd respondent who is the brother of the pillion rider, dashed
against another motorcycle and both of them fell down. The pillion rider, who has
lodged the complaint, has stated that the deceased dashed against other motorcycle,
they fell down and sustained injuries. He has also stated that they could not notice
the other motorcycle. From the above materials, it is clear that at the time of
accident, the deceased was riding the motorcycle borrowed from the owner and had
stepped into the shoes of the owner. In view of the judgments referred to above, the
legal heirs of the deceased who was the tort-feasor, are not entitled to maintain the
claim petition under Section 163-A of the Act, as the deceased himself was the
tort-feasor.” _____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
14.The ratio in the said judgment and ratio of various judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court referred
to above are squarely applicable to the facts of the present case. In view of the well settled judicial
pronouncement that owner of the vehicle cannot claim compensation against his own insurer and
rider of the Two Wheeler who borrows the vehicle from the owner of the vehicle steps into the shoes
of the owner, the appellant-Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation to the 1st
respondent. The Tribunal failed to appreciate the scope of Section 163A of the Act and erroneously
held that the claim petition filed under Section 163A of the Act is maintainable against the 2nd
respondent, owner and appellant-Insurance Company, as insurer. In view of the judgments referred
to above, the claim petition filed by the 1st respondent is not maintainable and is liable to be
dismissed.
For the above reason, the award of the Tribunal dated 15.07.2013 made in M.C.O.P.No.153 of 2011 is
set aside and the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is _____ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis allowed.
The appellant-Insurance Company is permitted to withdraw the award amount if any deposited to
the credit of M.C.O.P. No.153 of 2011. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is
closed.
