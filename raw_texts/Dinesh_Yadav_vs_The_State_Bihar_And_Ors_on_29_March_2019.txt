Date : 29-03-2019
Per: Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, CJ.:-
1. I have had the benefit of going through the scholarly judgments of
my esteemed colleagues Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad and
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohit Kumar Shah and I find myself in full agreement
with the same. However, I would like to add a few words to support the
conclusions already drawn in order to understand the status of the Bihar
Police Manual as well as scope and extent of the powers of Director
General of Police/Inspector General of Police to make appointments.
2. The issue with regard to the power of the Director General
of Police/Inspector General of Police to make appointments without
issuing any advertisement already stands concluded by the judgment of the
Apex Court in the case of State of Bihar & Ors. vs. Chandreswar Pathak
reported in (2014) 13 SCC 232. Apart from this, the contention that a
higher authority also enjoys the same powers as possessed by a
subordinate officer has to be gathered from the provisions under which
such authority is being claimed. I have not been able to find any residuary
power in the Director or Inspector General of Police or any such authority
conferred on him to appoint a Constable in the manner in which it was
done in the cases giving rise to the present controversy. The observations
made by a learned Single Judge in the case of Dhrub Prasad & Ors. vs. The
State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 1995(2) PLJR 205 in the matter of
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
3/70
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 2
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
appointment of Excise Constables that the power which was vested with
the subordinate officer, automatically stands vested in the superior officer
as the power is administrative in nature, does not appear to be an
observation so as to cover the exercise of authority by the Director or
Inspector General of Police in the present case. The Bihar Police Manual
clearly prescribes that the appointing authority of Constable shall be the
Superintendent of Police. There is nothing in the Manual which may give
an automatic authority on a superior officer to make appointments on the
post of Constable. An administrative power also, which creates any rights
or divests a person of something tangible, has to be by way of codified
authority and cannot be presumed to be suo motu in existence. The
assumption of power for being exercised is dependent upon the existence
of the power and not otherwise. There is, therefore, no rule of
administrative law which may on the facts and issues arising in the present
case allow the Court to presume the existence of such authority or power
in the Director or Inspector General of Police, that too even without
advertisement.
3. Coming to the issue of the status of the Bihar Police Manual,
in the state of Uttar Pradesh there are a set of regulations namely U.P.
Police Regulations, the status whereof came up for consideration in several
decisions. I would like to refer to the Division Bench Judgment in the case
of Moonglal vs. The D.I.G. (Karmik) U.P. Police and others reported in
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
4/70
(1994) 2 SLR 473 (DB) = 1993 SCC Online ALL 301. Paragraphs 12 to 15
of the said judgment are extracted hereinunder:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 3
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
"12. U.P. Police Regulations is compilation of Government
Orders issued from time to time. Certain regulations are
referable to Section 7 of the Police Act; they have statutory
force. Other regulations do not have statutory force; they
only contain guidance for the officers and officials
concerned. A later Government Order supersedes the
earlier Government Order on the same subject. If
Government Order referable to Regulation 520 was issued
subsequent to Government Order referable to Regulation,
the former will prevail over the latter. There is no material
on record to show that the Government Order referable to
Regulation 1 was issued subsequent to the Government
Order referable to Regulation 520. Accordingly we are
unable to sustain the appellant's plea that Regulation 520 is
invalid as it is contrary to Regulation 1.
13. It also needs to be pointed out that Regulation 1
prohibits Inspector General of Police from delegating his
power to transfer clerical staff to Deputy Inspector General
of Police but it does not prohibit the State Government from
making fresh prescription of the authority competent to
effect transfer. In our opinion, Regulation 520 contains a
fresh and independent conferment of power upon the Deputy
Inspector General of Police.
14. We have mentioned, hereinabove, that the U.P. Police
Regulations is mostly compilation of the Government
Orders issued from time to time except a few provisions
which are referable to statutory provisions. Chapter XXXII,
which bears the heading "Departmental Punishment and
Criminal Prosecution of Police Officers," contains
regulations which have been framed in exercise of powers
conferred under Section 7 of the Police Act, 1861. The
regulation contained in this chapter have therefore
statutory force as held by their Lordships of the Supreme
Court of India in State of U.P. V. Babu Ram Upadhyaya.
The regulations contained in Chapter XXXIV have not
been framed either under section 7 of the Police Act or
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
5/70
under any other statutory force. Regulation 520 dealing
with transfer falls under this chapter.
15. By reference to the provision of Government of India
Act, 1935 and of Constitution of India, the learned counsel
for the appellant tried to submit that the regulations have
statutory force. Even by acceptance of this argument the
impugned order of transfer does not suffer from any
infirmity as in our opinion the transfer order is fully within
the ambit the scope of Regulation 520. In view of the above ,
the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed with costs to the
respondents."

4. A learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court in the
case of Shesh Mani Dubey vs. State of U.P. and Ors. decided on 25th July,
2007 followed the Division Bench Judgment in the case of Moongalal
(supra). A challenge raised to the order of transfer, the same view has been
reiterated in Paragraph 18 of the said judgment reported in 2007 7AWC
7663All. Consequently, if the provisions can be correlated to any statutory
law then the same would partake the nature of enforceable law.
5. My esteemed Brother Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J. has very
lucidly expressed the meaning of the word rule by referring to the
provisions of the General Clauses Act. I would like to add at this stage that
the Bihar Police Manual in the strict sense is not a regulation as understood
under our legal framework and for which I would place reliance on the
Constitution Bench pronouncement of the Apex Court in the case of
Sukhdev Singh and Ors. vs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and
Anr. reported in (1975) 1 SCC 421. The same was a case where a
Corporation had framed certain regulations and that came up for
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
6/70
consideration before the Apex Court. The regulations framed by companies
incorporated under the Companies Act and regulations framed by statutory
corporations was distinguished and while doing so the principles of
administrative law relating to subordinate legislations, rules and
regulations as well as delegated legislation was discussed in detail.
Reference be had to paragraphs 10 to 33 in particular of the said reported
judgment that has been again reiterated in a three Judges decision in the
case of St. Johns Teachers Training Institute vs. Regional Director,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 5
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
National Council For Teacher Education and Anr. reported in (2003) 3
SCC 321. Paragraph 10 of the said report which in turn relies on Sukhdev
Singh Case (supra) is extracted hereinunder:-
"10. A regulation is a rule or order prescribed by a
superior for the management of some business and implies
a rule for general course of action. Rules and regulations
are all comprised in delegated legislations. The power to
make subordinate legislation is derived from the enabling
Act and it is fundamental that the delegate on whom such a
power is conferred has to act within the limits of authority
conferred by the Act. Rules cannot be made to supplant the
provisions of the enabling Act but to supplement it. What is
permitted is the delegation of ancillary or subordinate
legislative functions, or, what is fictionally called, a power
to fill up details. The legislature may, after laying down the
legislative policy confer discretion on an administrative
agency as to the execution of the policy and leave it to the
agency to work out the details within the framework of
policy. The need for delegated legislation is that they are
framed with care and minuteness when the statutory
authority making the rule, after coming into force of the
Act, is in a better position to adapt the Act to special
circumstances. Delegated legislation permits utilisation of
experience and consultation with interests affected by the
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
7/70
practical operation of statues. Rules and regulations made
by reason of the specific power conferred by the statutes to
make rules and regulations establish the pattern of conduct
to be followed. Regulations are in aid of enforcement of the
provisions of the statute. The process of legislation by
departmental regulations saves time and is intended to deal
with local variations and the power to legislate by statutory
instrument in the form of rules and regulations is conferred
by Parliament. The main justification for delegated
legislation is that the legislature being overburdened and
the needs of the modern-day society being complex, it
cannot possibly foresee every administrative difficulty that
may arise after the statute has begun to operate. Delegated
legislation fills those needs. The regulations made under
power conferred by the statute are supporting legislation
and have the force and effect, if validly made, as an Act
passed by the competent legislature."

Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
6. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the Bihar
Police Manual is a compilation of administrative instructions or
Government orders then if a pre-Constitution Act, namely the Police Act,
1861 has been taken recourse to for framing certain revised administrative
instructions, they can also be construed to be in continuation of such laws
and instructions (in the present case the Bihar and Orissa Police Manual,
1930) that were in force immediately before the commencement of the
Constitution so as to save State action keeping in view the provisions of
Article 313 of the Constitution of India. I would like to adopt the reasoning
of the principle which leans in favour of even saving administrative
instructions that may be necessary for governance in the absence of
Statutory Rules or any law to the contrary. The Bihar Police Manual is a
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
8/70
compilation which has continued to be observed for the purpose, as
presently involved, for appointments throughout the State in the Bihar
Police Forces. It therefore has the mandate of the Government which in
turn is entrusted with the obligation of governance including police
administration being an exclusive State subject. The observance of the
instructions contained in the Bihar Police Manual are binding on the State
of Bihar and even it is argued that some of the provisions are directory in
nature, then too even such provisions are not meant to be disobeyed or
acted in breach thereof. A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court
while interpreting the provisions of Regulation 541 of U.P. Police
Regulations relating to termination and period of probation held that the
regulations did have mandatory force. The said judgment is in the case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 7
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
State of U.P. and Ors. vs. Radha Kishan and Anr. (Writ Petition No. 8251
(S/B) of 1987) decided on 23.12.2009.
7. I am therefore inclined to hold that even though the
compilation of the Bihar Police Manual cannot be described as rule or
regulation having been framed in the exercise of powers under any
statutory law, and may not partake the nature either of subordinate or
delegated legislation, yet the Bihar Police Manual being binding on the
Government, they deserve to be followed by the respondents so long as no
rule is been framed in this regard.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019

8. I would also concur with the opinion of my esteemed
colleagues that taking a clue from the complications that gave rise to a
spurt of litigation, the Government of Bihar needs to address itself on the
issue of incorporating an appropriate State amendment in the Police Act,
1861 on the same pattern as has been done by the State of U.P. and the
State of West Bengal conferring authority on the State to frame rules, and
frame them, when the State Government already has rules in place for
most of the Government services in the State of Bihar. This will help a
long way in maintaining transparency and prevent any ambiguity or
arbitrariness in the exercise of powers by any authority of the State Police
Services.
9. I would also, therefore, answer the reference on the same
terms as opined by my esteemed Brother Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J. in the
concluding part of his judgment.
Per: Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J.:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 8
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
1. This Full Bench has been called upon to resolve the conflicts
noticed firstly by the learned Single Judge while hearing the two writ
applications. Vide order dated 22.04.2015 the learned Single Judge
referred the cases in hand to Hon'ble the Chief Justice to consider as to
whether the matter has to be referred to a larger bench. These matters were,
thereafter, placed before the Hon'ble Division Bench on 16.04.2018 when
having noticed the observations of the learned Single Judge in the
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
10/70
order dated 22.04.2015, the Hon'ble Division Bench directed for placing
the matter before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for referring the matter to a
Larger Bench for resolving the issue in question. I will reproduce the order
dated 22.04.2015 passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the order
dated 16.04.2018 passed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court but
before doing that it would be appropriate to first notice the brief facts of
the cases hereunder:
CWJC No. 14455 of 2007.
2. The petitioner in the present case happens to be an informer
of Police. It is said that on the basis of the information supplied by him,
the Police had been able to investigate the cases in the appropriate
direction leading to arrest of the accused which proved helpful in
containing the crime. Vide letter No. 185 dated 21.01.1997 the
Superintendent of Police, Kaimur at Bhabhua recommended this petitioner
for appointment on the post of constable under special circumstances to
the Deputy Inspector General (Hq.), Bihar, Patna in the following words:

3. Thereafter, vide Memo No. 1780 dated 22.03.1997 as
contained in Annexure-4 to the writ application, the Director General and
Inspector General of Police issued the directions to the Superintendent of
Police, Kaimur in the following words:

4. The petitioner, thereafter, is said to have undergone physical
and written tests for the post of Constable by the appropriate competent
authority and was allowed to join on the post of Constable in the year
1997 by the order of the Superintendent of Police, Bhabhua. He was dully
allotted Constable No. 272 and was serving in the Police Force. The
petitioner was, however, served with a show cause notice dated
31.10.2000 vide Annexure-5 to the writ application calling upon him to
show cause as to why his appointment be not cancelled because the same
has been done illegally. The petitioner submitted his explanation
contending that his appointment has been done considering his acts of
bravery and in terms of the provisions of the Bihar Board Miscellaneous
Rules, 1958 a higher authority has all the powers of the lower authority
hence, in exercise of that power and in larger public interest of the State if
the competent authority has appointed him on the post of Constable, it
cannot be said to be illegal or for extraneous consideration.
5. The appointment of the petitioner was, however, cancelled
by the Superintendent of Police, Kaimur at Bhabhua. A copy of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 10
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
termination letter as contained in Kaimur ftykns"k la[;k 549 /2002 is
available at Annexure-8 to the writ application which reads as under:

6. The petitioner preferred an appeal before the Director General and Inspector
General of Police, however, those were not considered. The petitioner, thereafter,
challenged his termination from service on the grounds inter alia that there was
neither any due inquiry held by the respondents nor proper opportunity was given to
the petitioner before removal from service. In the writ application he also took a plea
that the case of the petitioner is exactly similar to the case of Kamal Chandra Sah Vs.
The State of Bihar and Others reported in 2006 (3)PLJR 468. It is one of the
contentions of the petitioner that the Bihar Police Manual 1978 (hereinafter referred
as 'the Bihar Police Manual' or 'the Manual') is a non-statutory piece of instructions
issued by the Government for its' own functioning, it is not akin to legislative act of
the Government and therefore, the Government may in appropriate case relax the
conditions for appointment and extend the benefits of appointment on the ground of
bravery as has been done in the case of this petitioner.
7. The State official respondents have contested the case of the petitioners on the
ground that the procedures for appointment to the post of a Constable have been
provided under Rule 661(b), 663(d) Appendix 72 Clause 4 of the Police Manual and
Police Order No. 288/88. It is Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 contended that the petitioners' appointment has not been made by
following the said Rules or the procedures known to law, the appointment being
wholly illegal is void ab initio. It is also the stand of the respondents that there was
nothing like an absolute power vested in any authority to appoint any person on the
ground of his likes as has been done in this case. It is submitted that in the
circumstances the petitioner was appointed on the post of constable without making
advertisement in terms of requirement of Rule 663(d) as well as without following
the procedure of selection, it does not vest any right in him.
8. It is categorically stated by the respondents that the State Government took a decision to cancel
the appointments of Police Constables made on large scale in the name of special circumstance
without following the due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant Rules. An appointment of
a person being Mukhbir/Informer can in no case be treated as appointment in special circumstance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 11
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
The petitioner was given an opportunity to show cause which was availed by the petitioner as he
filed his reply but the petitioner was not able to defend himself. In such circumstance the
appointment of the petitioner has been cancelled.
9. In this case the admitted fact is that earlier pursuant to the Advertisement No. 1/98 for
appointment of Constable the petitioner had Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 participated in the selection process but he was not appointed on the ground of his
height not being appropriate as per requirement. It is stated that the petitioner applied for
appointment on the ground that his father Jeetan Yadav was murdered in encounter with the
dacoits and one Suryadeo Yadav was also murdered whose son was also appointed as Constable so
he should also be appointed as Constable in the light of Police Manual Rules 663. The case of the
petitioner was considered and was appointed as Constable. He was also served with a show cause
notice which was replied by the petitioner but thereafter, his appointment was cancelled vide Memo
No. 671 dated 19.06.2003 as contained in Annexure-3 to the writ application.
10. The stand of the State respondents are that these kinds of appointments were done by the then
Director General of Police, Shri S. K. Suxena. It is stated that this Hon'ble Court while hearing
C.W.J.C. No. 3959 of 2002 and other analogous maters found that a large number of appointments
have been made by Mr. Suxena the then Director General of Police without any advertisement, an
inquiry was directed in the said matter which subsequently revealed that a large number of persons
were appointed without following any procedure. A decision was then taken to give individual notice
to such persons, if they had not been appointed through the procedure as laid down in the Police
Manual then their services were required to be terminated. These appointments were Patna High
Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 held to be a backdoor appointment. The Court relied
upon the judgment of Sudhir Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar reported in 2000 (3) PLJR 717 in which
it has been held that the Director General of Police has no discretion or power to make appointment
on the post of Constable. The said judgment of the learned Single Judge was challenged by filing
Letters Patent Appeal which was numbered as L.P.A.No. 1496 of 2001 and L.P.A. No. 1514 of 2001.
The Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court upheld the order of the learned Single Judge in the Letters
Patent Appeal. A challenge to the termination of the petitioners in all these writ applications, lead
case being C.W.J.C. No. 3959 of 2002 was rejected. Thus, the stand of the respondents is that the
case of the petitioners being similar, no fault may be found with the order cancellation of their
appointments.
11. It appears that the issue arising out of these terminations did not stop here. A writ application
being C.W.J.C. No. 3461 of 2004 (Kamal Chandra Sah Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) came for
consideration before a learned Single Judge of this Court. This was also case of a Constable who had
been appointed on Ist November, 2004 without there being any advertisement published offering
any such selection. The respondent authorities were of the view that the appointment of the
petitioner was contrary to the procedures laid down in Rule 661B of the Police Manual and the
appointment is irregular. It was Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
challenged by the petitioner. The learned Single Judge of this Court allowed the writ application
after taking the following views:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 12
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
" It is true that the Government of Bihar, by making the Manual and by providing
therein Rule 661B has directed all its officers including the Director General of Police
to recruit constables in the manner as has been provided for in the said Rule. It is the
Government of Bihar who has created that Rule and it is, therefore, open to the
Government of Bihar to make a departure from that Rule in appropriate cases and
the same was done in the instant case by the Government of Bihar for the purpose of
rewarding the petitioner for his bravery. It was unjust on the part of the Police
Department of the State to think that Government of Bihar cannot make a departure
in an appropriate case. It is true that no Officer of the Government of Bihar is capable
of acting contrary to the said rule and, accordingly, no officer of the Government can
give an appointment contrary to what has been prescribed in Rule 661B of the
Manual. However, the Government of Bihar itself could make an exception and the
same was done in the instant case. It must be kept in mind that the Manual, as it
stands, is a creation of the Government of Bihar in its executive side and not of the
Government of Bihar in its legislative side and, accordingly, executive Government of
Bihar can always make an exception to Rule 661B of the Manual in deserving cases,
but such exception must be made consciously and the same must be apparent on the
face of the records.
In those circumstances, the writ petition is allowed and the impugned judgment
order dated 3rd February, 2003 as well as the appellate order dated 4th July, 2003
are quashed. Petitioner shall be deemed to be on service all throughout despite the
orders dated 3rd February, 2003 and 4th July, 2003 but shall only be entitled to, in
the facts and circumstances of the case, remuneration on and from today. Let the
petitioner be reinstated forthwith and not later than one month from today".
12. Again an identical issue came or consideration before a Division Bench of this Court in the case
of Hemkant Jha Vs. State of Bihar &Ors., reported in 2007(3) PLJR 657. The Hon'ble Division
Bench took a view that the appointment of a Constable without following the relevant provisions of
the Bihar Police Manual is in violation of the Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 constitutional provisions thus appointment is without following the due process of
law and such appointment being illegal could be terminated.
13. Thereafter, came another judgment of the Hon'ble Division bench of this Court in L.P.A. No.
1167 of 2009 and 1015 of 2009 (State of Bihar Vs. Md. Manjoor Alam &Ors.) decided on 08.08.2011
which is at a later point of time. This judgment takes note of the case of Hemkant Jha (supra) but
took a different view which is in conflict with the judgment in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra).
14. In the aforementioned circumstances, when the learned Single Judge hearing these two
applications found that there is a conflicting view, after noticing the facts of the case, recorded in the
concluding part of the order dated 22.04.2015 as under:-
"It was submitted by learned Addl. Advocate General-3 that while the L.P.A. was
recently being heard by a Division Bench of this Court i.e. L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009, it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 13
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
appears that earlier Division Bench order of this Court i.e. Annexure- 'C' to the
supplementary counter affidavit was not brought to the notice of the Division Bench.
He submits that on the same issue, earlier Division Bench had already disapproved
the appointment of the Constable, which was contrary to the Rule 661(b) & 663
Appendix 72 Clause 4 of the Police Manual and Police Order No. 202 of 1988. The
Division bench not only dismissed the L.P.A. which was preferred against the order of
the writ court rejecting the writ petitions against such termination, but also the
Division Bench has given some observation, which is as follows:-
"This Court on earlier occasion has already directed the State Government to look
into such back-door illegal appointments made by the Police Department by violating
the rules governing the appointment of constables. In our view, the authorities have
rightly acted in cancelling the appointments of the appellants."
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 In view of the fact that on one issue, there
are two contradictory judgments of the Division Bench, this Court is unable to adjudicate on this
issue.
Accordingly, it is necessary to direct the Registry to place this matter before Hon'ble the Chief
Justice so that the issue may be set at rest by a Larger Bench."
Reference to the Full Bench
15. These writ applications were, however, listed again before another learned Single Judge on
04.08.2015. This time his Lordship in order dated 04.08.2015 recorded that the issue in hand
stands clearly settled by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Bihar & Ors. Vs.
Chandreshwar Pathak reported in (2014)13 SCC 232 as well as the Division Bench of this Court in
the case of Hemkant Jha (supra). The cases, however, were placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice
and then both the matters were placed before the Hon'ble Division Bench on 16.04.2018 when the
following order was passed :-
"Having heard learned counsel for the parties and keeping in view the observations
made by the learned Single Bench on 22.04.2015, we find that there are two
conflicting judgments with regard to the issue in question i.e., the appointment on
the post of Constable and their termination in the case of Hemkant Jha Vs. The State
of Bihar &Ors. reported in 2007 (3) PLJR 657 a detailed consideration of various
provisions have been made and an identical writ petition filed has been dismissed. It
has been held by the Division Bench in the aforesaid case that once a Constable is
appointed in the Department without following the relevant provisions of the Police
Manual and in violation of the Constitutional provisions i.e., appointment without
following the due process of law such an appointment being illegally could be
terminated. However, another Division Bench took a totally different view and held
such termination to be illegal and allowed the writ petition in L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009
and 1015 of 2009 (State of Bihar & Ors. Vs. Md. Manzoor Alam and Ors.). Patna High

Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 We find that even though in the
judgment rendered in the case of Md. Manzoor Alam on 08.08.2011 which is later
point of time the law laid down in the case of Hemkant Jha Vs. The State of Bihar &
Ors. has been taken note of, but there is no discussion and no reason has been given
as to why such judgment is not being followed. Therefore, finding that there is
conflict in the two Division Benches judgments the order passed on 22.04.2015 by
the learned writ Court is for reference of the matter to a Larger Bench. However,
while considering the matter on 04.08.2015, the Bench again found that the issue in
question stands settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court judgment in the case of State
of Bihar & Ors. Vs. Chandreshwar Pathak reported in (2014) 13 SCC 232 wherein the
stand of the State Government has been approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
However, finding the issue to be conflicting in nature the matter has been placed
before us.
We find that there being two inconsistent judgments on the same issue by two
Division Benches of this Court one in the case of Hemkant Jha Vs. the State of Bihar
& Ors. and another in the case of Md. Manzoor Alam (supra), we direct for placing
the matter before the Chief Justice for referring the matter to a Larger Bench for
resolving the issue in question."
16. The aforesaid order dated 16.04.2018 is therefore, the order of reference which this Full Bench
has to answer.
Case-laws discussed:
17. Before the Full Bench constituted for this purpose could have taken up these matters for
consideration, yet another matter came for consideration before the Hon'ble Division Bench of this
Court presided over by one of us (Hon'ble the Chief Justice) in L.P.A.No. 569 of 2018 (Shailesh
Kumar Mall @ Shailesh Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.). The Hon'ble Division Bench noticed
that earlier certain writ applications arising out of similar dismissals came to be filed including
C.W.J.C. No. 5279 of 2005, decided on 18th May, 2005, whereby the writ petition was allowed on
account of violation of Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 principles of
natural justice. The judgment of the learned Writ Court was affirmed in L.P.A. No. 945 of 010 which
had arisen out of C.W.J.C. No. 204 of 2004. A Division Bench of this Court on 5 th January, 2012
approved the order passed in C.W.J.C. No. 5279 of 2005. In C.W.J.C. No. 3799 of 2006 and
C.W.J.C. No. 4097 of 2006 decided on 23 rd July, 2012, again learned Single Judge of this Court
came to a conclusion that the violation of the principle of natural justice vitiated the impugned order
and ultimately orders were quashed with liberty to the respondents to proceed afresh. The Hon'ble
Division Bench found that even though the judgment of the learned Single Judge in the case of
Sudhir Kumar (supra) was noticed, yet no consideration thereof was given. The Hon'ble Division
Bench quoted the relevant part from the judgment in L.P.A. No. 1131 of 1999 which had arisen out of
the judgment of the learned Single Judge in the case of Sudhir Kumar (supra). I reproduce the
relevant part of the Division Bench judgment dated 15.02.2000 as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 15
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
"Heard learned counsel for the appellant. We are not persuaded to interfere in this
appeal because we find that the appellant was not even applicant for the post of
Constable and his appointment was made de hors the rules on the approval of the
Director General of Police. The learned Judge in the impugned judgment and order
has carefully considered various provisions of law and has found that the Director
General of Police has no special power to recommend/approve an appointment, that
too of a person who was not even an applicant. The appeal is dismissed."
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
18. In the aforementioned background, the Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of Shailesh Kumar
Mall (supra) noticed the earlier judgment in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra) and the judgment of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Chandreshwar Pathak (supra) which affirmed the decision in
the case of Hemkant Jha (supra). In the case of Shailesh Kumar Mall (supra) the Hon'ble Division
Bench vide its judgment dated 08.02.2019 held that the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of Chandreshwar Pathak (supra) finally clinches the issue and the judgments running contrary
to the said ratio, therefore, cannot be said to lay down the law correctly.
19. The Full Bench started hearing all these applications on 28.02.2019. The Bench was prima-facie
of the view that the issue stands concluded with the pronouncements of the judgment of the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of Chandreshwar Pathak (supra) but then the hearing proceeded in view of
the submissions made on behalf of the petitioners in the light of the judgments of the learned Single
Judge of this Court in the case of Kamla Chandra Sah (supra) it would be apt to reproduce the order
passed after noticing the contentions of the parties on 28.02.2019:
"Heard Sri Ramchandra Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners and Sri Ram
Hriday Prasad, learned counsel in the connected writ application. Sri Anjani Kumar
and Sri S.D. Yadav learned Additional Advocate Generals have appeared in both the
writ petitions for the respondents-State.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 Prima-facie it did appear
to us that the issue stands concluded with the pronouncement of the Apex Court in
the case of State of Bihar and others Vs. Chandreshwar Pathak reported in (2014) 13
SCC 232 but there is yet another submission made on behalf of the petitioners that
deserves to be answered keeping in view the fact that this Full Bench has been
constituted to give an authoritative pronouncement in the light of the conflict of the
two Division Benches and other judgments that have been placed on record. One of
such judgments relied on, and which was part of the pleading, is in the case of Kamal
Chandra Sah Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors reported in 2006 (3) PLJR 468.
A learned Single Judge of this Court has opined that the Bihar Police Manual in effect
is an executive act and not a Legislative Act so as to deprive the State Government
from taking an exceptional stand by making appointments. It is urged by the learned
counsel for the petitioners that if the Bihar Police Manual is required to be followed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 16
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
then in that event the State Government also has the power to proceed to make
appointments including an appointment of the nature presently involved and the
same should not be annulled on the ground of any alleged statutory violation which
otherwise does not exist.
On the other hand, learned Additional Advocate Generals of the State have urged that
the Bihar Police Manual derives itself authority in terms of Section 7 read with
Section 12 of the Police Act, 1861 as amended thereafter and the preface to the Bihar
Police Manual, 1978 itself discloses the status of the source of such power under
which the said instructions have been compiled as the Bihar Police Manual. The
question therefore is about the status of the said manual and the instructions
contained therein keeping in view the pronouncement of the learned Single Judge in
the case of Kamal Chandra Sah (supra).
The Police Act, 1861 stands saved as the State legislature has exclusive competence to
frame laws relating to the subject of policing with the exceptions as contained in
Entry 2 of List II of the VII Schedule of the Constitution of India.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 Learned counsel for the
State may, therefore, assist the Court with an answer on the aforesaid issue which
does not appear to have been the subject matter of consideration in any of the
judgments including the judgment in the case of State of Bihar and others Vs.
Chandreshwar Pathak (supra) to enable us to further proceed in the matter.
Learned counsel for the petitioners and the respondents may also take notice of a
Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case Shailesh Kumar Mall @ Shailesh
Kumar vs. The State of Bihar and others decided on 18th February, 2019 in LPA No.
569 of 2018.
Let the matter as prayed for come up on 14th March, 2019."
20. As the status of the Bihar Police Manual has fallen for consideration in order to assist us in
answering the reference, the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Additional Advocate
General No. 4 have addressed this Court on this issue. While it is the contention of learned counsel
for the petitioners that the provisions contained in the Bihar Police Manual are not akin to 'Rule' or
'Regulations' akin to a legislative enactment, learned Additional Advocate General-3 has submitted
before us that the Bihar Police Manual derives it authority under Section 7 read with Section 12 of
the Police Act, 1861 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Police Act' or 'the Act of 1861').
21. A notification dated 27th February, 1979 has been brought on record as Annexure -A to the
counter affidavit sworn on 12.03.2019 (it should have been stated as supplementary counter
affidavit). According to the notification, issued under the signature of the Special Secretary to Patna
High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 the Government Department of Home (Police),
by order of His Excellency Governor of State of Bihar, the Governor of Bihar while repealing the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 17
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
Bihar and Orissa Police Manual 1930, made applicable Bihar Police Manual, 1978 with effect from
its notification i.e. 27.02.1979. This notification is said to have been published in the official gazette
of the State of Bihar. It is the contention of learned Additional Advocate General-4 that the
provisions of the Bihar Police Manual have got a force of law inasmuch as those are in the nature of
piece of sub-ordinate legislation. He has relied upon a learned Single Judge judgment of this Court
in the case of Prem Chandra Jha & Ors. vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2007 (2) PLJR 566
to contend that the status / character of the Manual is a separate Legislation under the rule making
powers.
22. Yet another judgment of Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of The State of Bihar
and Others Vs. Rameshwar Nath Mishr reported in 1994 (2) PLJR 98 has been brought to the notice
of this Court wherein certain provisions of the Bihar Police Manual came for consideration. In the
said case the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court held that the procedure laid down in the Rules
were mandatory and the Bihar Police Manual so far as the same relates to the conditions of services
is a rule deemed to have been made under the proviso appended to Article 309 of Constitution of
India. It was held that Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 the Rule is
legislative in character. Learned Additional Advocate General- 4, thus, submits that the Status of
Bihar Police Manual is akin to a legislative enactment and therefore, any departure from the
provisions of the Police Manual in the matter of appointment of the petitioners will be taken as
violation of the procedure which are mandatory in nature.
23. Learned Additional Advocate General-4 has, therefore, contested the submissions of learned
counsel for the petitioners that following the views expressed by the learned Single Judge in the case
of Kamal Chandra Sah (supra) it may be held that it is open to the Government of Bihar to make a
departure from the Rule in appropriate cases. The Government of Bihar, it is submitted, never took
any policy decision to relax the procedure of appointment nor authorised the then Director General
of Police to make appointments on the grounds referred to therein, that too without any publication
of an advertisement for selections in any newspaper.
Consideration
24. Having considered the rival submissions at the Bar, I am of the considered opinion that a little
exercise in respect of the status of the Bihar Police Manual would be necessary before answering the
reference. It appears from the 'F O R E W O R D' of the Bihar Police Manual that prior to its coming
into force the position as existed may be well Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 understood by going through the following words recorded by the then Inspector
General of Police, Bihar, Patna :-
"The Bengal Police Manual, first issued in 1884, was a compilation of Government
orders by Mr. Botelho, Registrar of the Bengal Police Office. Thereafter, the following
revisions took place:-
(i) From 1890 to 1893 by Mr. A. H. Giles, P.A. to the Inspector General and Mr.
C.A.Wilkins, I.C.S., (ii) in 1897 by Mr. E.M. Showers, Personal Assistant to Inspector

Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
General during the time of Edward Henry (then Mr. Henry), (iii) from 1906 to 1907
by Mr. Daly and from 1909 to 1910 by Mr. Swain, both Personal Assistants to
Inspector-General who did the revision in addition to their own duties, assisted by
Mr. B.A. Collins, I.C.S. which was finally published in 191, (iv) in 1912 by Dr. J. V.
Ryan, LL.D., Superintendent of Police when its name was first changed in 1914 as
Bihar and Orissa Police Manual. (v) The last revision, before this present Manual,
was done in 1923-24 by Mr. R.J. Hirst, Deputy Inspector-General, C.I.D., which was
later continued from 1927 to 1929 by Mr. W.A.P.Sealy, Super-
intendent of Police on Special Duty and Mr. E.A.O. Perkin, As- sistant to the Inspector-General and
was concluded in 1929-30 by Mr. C.R.B. Murray, assisted by Mr. R.A.P. Hare, Assistant to the
Inspector-General.
2. After India's Independence, Police Manual, Volume I was reprinted in 1949 and 1955 at the
Government Press, Gulzarbagh where all the amendments issued serially for several decades and
kept there in booklets were incorporated. Subsequently, the translation of Police Manual, Vol. I in
Hindi was done at the initiative of Sri Sarda Prasad Verma, the then Inspector-General of Police by
Deputy Superintendent of Police Sri Kedar Nath Mishra "Prabhat" and Sri Ram Gopal Sharma
"Rudra". This was published in two parts. The first part which contained chapters 1-14 and the
second part which contained chapters 15-36 were published in 1965 and 1971 respectively.
3. The State Government particularly at the initiative of Sri Ramanand Tiwari, Minister, Home
(Police) (formerly a constable who had joined the freedom movement of Mahatma Gandhi in 1942)
took the decision of revising the Police Manual and Sri Badri Narain Sinha, I.P.S. Deputy Inspector-
General of Police was specially selected for this work. He started the work of revision from Ist June,
1971 in right earnest. Later, a committee was formed of the following persons:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 (1) Sri Trilok Nath, I.P.,
Inspector-General of Police-on Special Duty-cum-Chairman.
(2) Sri Fazlur Rahman, M.L.A. (later Union Minister) .....Member.
(3) Sri Jai Narayan, who after resigning from I.P.S...... Member.
(4) Sri Kumar Taranand Singh, Resident Director, .......Member.
(5) Sri Satyendra Narain Agrawal, Ex-Deputy........... ..Member.
(6) Finance Commissioner, (7) Home Secretary, (8) Law Secretary, and (9) Dy. I.G.
(Admin.) as ex-officio members, besides (10) Member-Secretary Sri Badri Narain
Sinha.
4. Sri Sinha, prepared an exhaustive questionnaire which was widely circulated. On transfer, he
handed over charge to Sri Duniya Lal, I.P.S., Dy. I.G. of Police in July, 1972. Unfortunately, Sri D.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 19
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
Lal died premature on 9th August, 1972.
5. Sri Jyotindra Mohan Prasad, I.P.S., Superintendent of Police was posted as
Member-cum-Secretary in August 1972, later promoted as Dy. I.G. the same year. He is still
continuing.
6. The Police Manual Revision Committee incorporated the recommendations of the Bihar Police
Commission submitted in 1961 by Sri Mithilesh Kumar Sinha, I.P., retired Inspector-General of
Police and it took extracts from the Police Order book also which had been revised in 1969.
Moreover, the new Criminal Procedure Code (2 of 1974), Bihar Accounts Code and new system of
Accounts and the recommendations of the sub-committee of the Legislative Assembly specially set
up for reforms in the Police organization have made significant changes in the Manual. The
committee interviewed a large number of persons, both officials and non-officials and finished
revision of all the three Volumes of Police Manual by October, 1974 in Hindi.
7. An Implementation Committee was then set up with Sri Ajit Kumar Ghosh, I. P.,
Director-cum-Inspector-General of Police as Chairman in November, 1974 with Sri Narendra Pal
Singh, I.A.S., Joint Secretary, (later Additional Secretary), Home (Police) as Member, but soon, this
committee was reconstituted with Sri Narendra Pal Singh as Chairman and Finance Secretary, Law
Secretary and Dy. I. G. (Admin.) as ex- officio members. In this the names of Sri Ram Nandan
Prasad, Addl. L.r. and later Sri Gobind Prasad, Dy. L.R. deserve mention. Sri Jyotindra Mohan
Prasad, Member-Secretary continued as before. Sri Prasad also translated all the three Volumes of
the Police Manual into English with the help of Sri Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 Satish Chandra Misra, Rajbhasha Officer and thus, both English and Hindi versions
are being published. Sri A. K. Ghosh, who later took over as Special Secretary, Home (Police) made a
thorough check of Police Manual, Volume I before he retired on 31st March, 1977. The Cabinet
approved the revised Manual in December, 1977.
8. Lastly, the assistance given by Assistants Sarbshri Birendra Narain Jha, Singheshwari Prasad
Singh and Chandra Shekhar Prasad Singh and Typist Sri Sheo Nath Pandit has to be appreciated.
9. The revised Manual is dedicated to the cause of selfless public service by policemen and is offered
to all. Any suggestions for its improvement are welcome."
25. The preface of the Bihar Police Manual reads as under:-
"PREFACE The Bihar Police Manual, 1978 [Vol. I (Rules), Vol. II (Forms) and Vol. III
(Appendices) ] is issued by and with the authority of the State Government under
sections 7 and 12 of the Police Act V, 1861. All the rules etc. therein are binding on all
police officers and are an authoritative guide to other concerned officers of

State Amendments by incorporating Section 2-A conferring powers upon the State Government to
make Rules relating to recruitment, conditions of service, disciplinary proceedings and punishment
in respect of the members of the Subordinate Ranks of the Police Force. At the Bar this Court has
been informed that so far as the State of Bihar is concerned, no State Amendment has been brought

29. In the present case, as I have seen that the heading of Section 7 started with the words
"Appointment" but the Section no where talks of appointment. This has compelled me to discuss as
to how the heading of Section 7 should be interpreted. There are conflicting opinions on the
question as to the weightage to be assigned to the headings. G.P.Singh in his book "Principles of
Statutory Interpretation" has discussed and quoted the view of M. Patanjali Sastri, J. (as His
Lordship then was) in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax Bombay Vs. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai
and Co., Bombay reported in AIR 1950 SC 134 saying that "
Nor can the title of a chapter be legitimately used to restrict the plain Patna High
Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 terms of an enactment". In the case of
M/S FRICK INDIA LTD. VS.
UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS reported in AIR 1990 SC 689 the Hon'ble Supreme
Court expressed as follows:-
"the headings prefixed to sections or entries (of a Tarrif Schedule) cannot control the
plain words of the provision; they cannot also be referred to for the purpose of
construing the provision when the words used in the provision are clear and
unambiguous; nor can they be used for cutting down the plain meaning of the words
in the provision. Only, in the case of ambiguity or doubt the heading or sub-heading
may be referred to as an aid in construing the provision but even in such a case it
could not be used for cutting down the wide application of the clear words used in the
provision."
30. In the case of Raichurmatham Prbhakar and another Vs. Rawatmal Dugar reported in (2004)
4SCC 766 at page 775, referring to the conflicting opinions relating to the use of heading or titles
prefix to sections or group of sections, Lahoti, J. expressed himself as follows:-
"it is permissible to assign the heading or title of a section a limited role to play in the
construction of statutes. They may be taken as very broad and general indicators of
the nature of the subject-matter dealt with thereunder. The heading or title may also
be taken as a condensed name assigned to indicate collectively the characteristics of
the subject-matter dealt with by the enactment underneath; though the name would
always be brief having its own limitations. In case of conflict between the plain
language of the provision and the meaning of the heading or title, the heading or title
would not control the meaning which is clearly and plainly discernible from the
language of the provision thereunder."

31. There is no dispute that under the Entry 2, List II of the VII Schedule of the Constitution of
India, 'Police' (including railway and village police) subject to the provisions of Entry 2A List I falls
in the State List and it is the State Legislature that is competent to make laws relating to 'Policing' in
the State. The contention of the learned Additional Advocate General as regards the Status of Bihar
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 25
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
Police Manual, when is examined in the light of Section 7 of the Act of 1861, it would appear that
heading of the Section start with words 'Appointment, dismissal, etc. of interior officers', the body of
section no where talks of 'appointment'. This provision specifically says that it is subject to the
provisions of Article 311 of the Constitution of India and to such rules as the State Government may
make under this Act.
32. The question is whether Bihar Police Manual may be said to be a Rule framed by the State
Government under Section 7 of the Police Ac. I am of the considered opinion that it cannot be said
to be a Rule as envisaged under Section 7 of the Act of 1861. It is at best the revised version of the
compilation of the various government orders which existed in the pre-independence era coupled
with certain recommendations of the Police Commission. It has no doubt been revised by a
Committee constituted for this purpose by the State Government. The Police Manual Revision
Committee has, while revising the Police Manual incorporated the recommendations of the Bihar
Police Manual Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 Commission submitted in
the year 1961, brought some significant changes in the light of the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 2 of
the 1971). The revised Manual was placed before the Cabinet which approved it in the year 1977.
Such approval of the Cabinet alone cannot be said to be in exercise of a Rule making power, for that
I find no material placed before us that the approved manual was ever placed before the Governor of
the State. The Bihar Police Manual has been approved by the Cabinet, but has not been issued under
authentication of the Governor, and not published in the official gazette of the State of Bihar.
33. At this stage it would be in the fitness of the things to take note of Article 13 and 309 of the
Constitution of India as under:
"13. Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights.- (1) All laws in
force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this
Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall,
to the extent of such inconsistency, be void. (2) The State shall not make any law
which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in
contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.
(3) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires,-
(a) "law" includes any Ordinance, order, bye-
law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law;
(b) "laws in force" includes laws passed or made by a Legislature or other competent authority in the
territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed, Patna
High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 notwithstanding that any such law or any part
thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas.
[(4) Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under article
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 26

368.]"
"309. Recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving the Union or a
State.-Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Acts of the appropriate
Legislature may regulate the recruitment, and conditions of service of persons
appointed, to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or
of any State:
Provided that it shall be competent for the President or such persons as he may direct
in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union, and for
the Governor92[***] of a State or such person as he may direct in the case of services
and posts in connection with the affairs of the State, to make rules regulating the
recruitment, and the conditions of service of persons appointed, to such services and
posts until provision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate
Legislature under this article, and any rules so made shall have effect subject to the
provisions of any such Act."
34. By virtue of Article 13 it may be easily found that the Police Act being a pre-independence Act
applies to the extent they are not inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution of
India. In Clause 3 of Article 13 the word "law" will take into its fold those Government's Order which
found part of the compilation of the Bengal Police Manual first issued in 1884 but then after India's
independence
9. Inserted by the Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1971, SZ
92. The words "or Rajpramukh" omitted by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, S. 29
and Sch.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 when the State Government was looking
to make rules regulating the recruitment and conditions of service of the posts in connection with
the affairs of the State, it could have been done only under an Act of appropriate Legislature under
Article 309 and rule framed thereunder or until that time by making rules under proviso to Article
309 of the Constitution of India. Such rules could have been made by inserting an enabling
provision after Section 2 of the Act of 1861. It is for this reason that the State like the State of West
Bengal inserted section 2-A by State Amendment after Section 2 of the Police Act 1861 and also
declared that any rules, orders or regulations made before the commencement of the Police (West
Bengal Amendment) Act, 1963, by any authority in respect of those matters will be deemed to have
been validly made and shall continue in force.
35. The Bihar Police Manual no where says that the Manual has been made in exercise of the power
conferred by a statutory provision. All that it's preface says is that it has got authority of the State
under Sections 7 and 12. In case of a delegated legislation, it is well settled that the authority is to be
stated as it would be impermissible if the delegatee is allowed to take shelter behind the undisclosed
authority. In the case of U.P. State v. Murtaza ali and another (F.B.) reported in AIR 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 27
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
ALLAHABAD 477 (V 48 C 120) the Hon'ble Bench was considering the question referred to the Full
Bench "as to whether the regulations Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
regarding dismissal, removal or reduction of Municipal employees, printed at page 654 of the
Municipal Manual, 1952 Edn. are valid ?" The Hon'ble Full Bench answered the question in
negative. In the said case the Hon'ble Full Bench found that the regulation was not in respect of the
matter regarding which a rule could have been made, it was held in the said case that the rule
making authority cannot enlarge legislatively that field and it would not be open for the rule making
authority to add to the efficacy of the power by additional means. The view of the Hon'ble Full
Bench has been summarized in the following paragraphs:-
"In the guise of the phrase it is not open to the rule- making authority to add to the
efficacy of the power by additional means. In other words, one may complement but
not supplement a granted power.(Carbines v. Powell, 36 C.L.R. 88 at p. 92). The
power bestowed by the phrase will authorise the provision of subsidiary means of
carrying into effect what is enacted in the Act or any other law itself and will
comprehend what is incidental to the execution of their specific provisions. But such
a power will not enable the rule making authority to add new and different means of
carrying them out........."
36. The logic which may be deduced from the aforesaid judgment of the Full Bench of Allahabad
High Court is that in absence of their being any enabling provision either under Section 7 or Section
12 of the Act of 1861 conferring the power upon Inspector-General of Police to frame such orders
and rules relating to recruitment or conditions of service of a members of the Police force, it cannot
be held that the Bihar Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 Police Manual is a
piece of delegated legislation much less a subordinate legislation.
37. As it appears from Annexure-'A' to the counter affidavit of the State of Bihar, a notification dated
27th February, 1979 was issued saying that the Bihar Police Manual is made applicable with effect
from the date of notification. I respectfully beg to differ with the views taken by the Hon'ble Division
Bench of this Court in the case of Rameshwar Nath Mishr (supra) saying that Bihar Police Manual is
a Rule deemed to have been made under the proviso appended to Article 309 of the Constitution of
India and it is legislative in character. It is neither the stand of the State that the Bihar Police
Manual has been issued by way of a Rule under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India
nor this Court would be justified in conferring the status of 'a deemed rule' upon the Bihar Police
Manual while answering the reference. By no stretch of imagination it can be said to be legislative in
character. Similarly with utmost respect, I am of the view that the Hon'ble Single Judge of this Court
in the case of Premchandra Jha &Ors. (supra) had no legal foundation available to hold that the
Bihar Police Manual is a subordinate legislation under the rule making powers. It is certainly not a
piece of a subordinate legislature inasmuch as the Manual has not been framed by the State
Government under any Rule making powers. It is a document published under the signature of the
Inspector-General which is said to Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 have
got approval of the Cabinet. Section 7 as noticed above no where confers any power upon the State
Government to make Rules relating to appointment. The State Government has not inserted any
provision after Section 2 of the Act of 1861. No order under Section 2 has been issued so far.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 28
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
38. The word "Rule" has been defined under Section 3 (51) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and the
same definition has been reiterated under Section 4 (46) of the Bihar & Orissa General Clauses Act,
1917. It reads as under:-
"4 (46) "Rule" shall mean a rule made in exercise of a power conferred by any
enactment, and shall include a Regulation made as a rule under any enactment;".
39. As stated above, neither Section 7 nor Section 12 of the Act of 1861 are the enabling provisions
conferring power upon the State Government to make Rules relating to recruitment and conditions
of service, therefore, if the State Government has approved the Bihar Police Manual conferring
power upon certain authorities to make appointment in the Police force, it will be a case of exercise
of power in excess to the delegations made under the Act of 1861. It is interesting to note that that
under Section 3 which provides for superintendence in the State Government the word "Appoint"
which was earlier existing was omitted by A.O. 1937. To meet the exigencies, therefore, the State of
Uttar Prades and the State of West Bengal have brought State Amendments in respect Patna High
Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 to the application of Section 4 of the Police Act 1861.
The notification dated 27th February, 1978 as contained in Annexure-A to the counter affidavit of
the State of Bihar only mentions that Bihar Police Manual 1978 is made applicable with effect from
the date of issuance of the notification. It cannot be interpreted to mean and understand that the
Bihar Police Manual is a rule framed by the State or the Inspector-General in accordance with the
delegated power under Rule 7 and 12 of the Act of 1861.
40. Going through Section 12 of the Act of 1861, I find that under this provision the Inspector
General of Police has been conferred with power, subject to the approval of the State Government to
frame such orders and rules as it shall deem expedient relating to the organization, qualification and
distribution of the Police Force, places at which the members of the force shall reside and the
particular services to be performed by them, their inspection, the description of arms,
accouterments and other necessaries to be furnished to them. Whole reading of Section 12 would
show that the Inspector General of Police has not been conferred with any power, subject to the
approval of the State Government to frame orders and rules relating to appointment of members of
Police Force. The cluster of words namely, 'organization, classification and distribution' of Police
Force are the words of same feather and if 'Noscitur a Sociis' is a rule of interpretation then the
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 meaning of a word is to be judged by the
company it keeps. "It is a legitimate rule of construction to construe words in an Act of Parliament
with reference to words formed in immediate connection with them." (Refer Angus Robertson in
George Day (1879) 5 AC 63 p.69) as quoted in Chapter 5, Syn 8 in the book Principles of Statutory
Interpretations).
41. Learned Additional Advocate General has submitted before us that the word 'organization' will
take within its fold the power to make orders and rules with regard to appointment also. This
contention is unacceptable as the Bihar Police Manual, in the context of the present case which
relates to appointment of Police Constables, cannot be said to be either a Rule under Section 7 or 12
of the Act of 1861. At the Bar this Court has been informed that while the State Government has
framed Rules relating to appointment and service conditions of the persons holding a civil post in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 29
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
the State Government, no Rule relating to the members of the Police Force has been framed. I can
only expect that after this judgment the State Government will be required to analyze the need for
appropriate measures for bringing adequate State Amendments in the Act of 1861 and by making
Rules relevant for this purpose.
42. In view of the foregoing discussions, it is my firm opinion that the status of Bihar Police Manual,
1978 is not that of 'Rule' or 'Regulations' framed by the State Government.
43. In the context of these cases, I now proceed consider as to whether the contention of learned
counsel for the petitioners that the Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 Bihar
Police Manual being a creation of Government of Bihar in its executive side, the provision thereof
may be relaxed by the Government so as to make an exception to Rule 661B of the Manual in certain
cases.
44. In this connection, I find that Bihar Police Manual has got approval of the Cabinet. Its'
applicability has, however, been notified under order of the Governor, referring to Sections 7 and 12
of the Act of 1861. To me it appears that reference of Section 7 and 12 is a wrong labelling of the
provision of law. I am of the view that the notification as contained in Annexure- 'A' to the counter
affidavit is in the nature of an executive order as envisaged under Article 166(3) of the Constitution
of India. The executive power of the State is co-extensive and co-incidental to the legislative power.
By virtue of Entry 2, List II under the Seventh Schedule, the State Government in its' executive side
can make orders and issue the same by order of the Governor. It will govern the field until by a
legislative enactment and rule framed thereunder the field is occupied. In view of the law laid down
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the catena of decisions particularly the Constitution Bench
judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Karnataka Vs. Uma Devi reported in
2006 (4) SCC 1 it has now been settled that the appointments made without following due process
as per mandate of the Constitution are illegal appointments. The Manual being an executive
document contains provisions such as Rule 663(d) which says that Patna High Court CWJC
No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 selection shall be made after publication of notice in the
newspaper. In absence of any rule, regulations or an order contrary to the provisions of the Manual,
the provisions contained in the Manual relating to process of appointment is required to be followed
as it is in tune with the Constitutional Mandate. Paragraph 33, 39 and 54 of the Hon'ble
Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Uma Devi (supra) are quoted hereunder for ready
reference:
"33. It is not necessary to notice all the decisions of this Court on this aspect. By and
large what emerges is that regular recruitment should be insisted upon, only in a
contingency can an ad hoc appointment be made in a permanent vacancy, but the
same should soon be followed by a regular recruitment and that appointments to
non-available posts should not be taken note of for regularisation. The cases directing
regularisation have mainly proceeded on the basis that having permitted the
employee to work for some period, he should be absorbed, without really laying down
any law to that effect, after discussing the constitutional scheme for public
employment.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 30
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
39. There have been decisions which have taken the cue from Dharwad case1 and
given directions for regularisation, absorption or making permanent, employees
engaged or appointed without following the due process or the rules for appointment.
The philosophy behind this approach is seen set out in the recent decision in
Workmen v. Bhurkunda Colliery of Central Coalfields Ltd.24 though the legality or
validity of such an approach has not been independently examined. But on a survey
of authorities, the predominant view is seen to be that such appointments did not
confer any right on the appointees and that the Court cannot direct their absorption
or regularisation or re-engagement or making them permanent.
54. It is also clarified that those decisions which run counter to the principle settled
in this decision, or in which directions running counter to what we have held herein,
will stand denuded of their status as precedents."

45. In the case of Sudhir Kumar (supra) this Court has taken note of the fact that no general order or
regulation of the State Government is available to support the contention that the appointment of
the appellants is akin to compassionate appointment for which the State Government has taken a
policy decision and prescribed Rules. It is apparent from the materials available on the record in
these cases that save and except that it was presumed by the petitioners that in their cases the State
Government has relaxed the conditions which power it has, there is no material to show that the
State Government had at any point of time taken a policy decision to make appointment on the
ground of bravery without following the due process of appointment. No such authority was vested
with the then Director General of Police. In the case of Kamalchandra Sah (supra), to me it appears,
with utmost respect to the learned Single Judge, the Hon'ble Single Judge proceeded to assume that
the State Government had approved the appointment of the petitioner in the said case as a
deserving candidate and had made out an exception. No material was placed before the learned
Single Judge in the case of Kamalchandra Sah (supra) to show that any such policy decision was in
existence on the said date. If there was no such policy decision, I would reiterate that in absence of
there being any Rule, even the guidelines in terms of Rule 660 (b) read with 663(d) of the Bihar
Police Manual were required to be followed.

46. In the case of Hamkant Jha (supra) the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court has recorded as
under in paragraph 6, 7 and 8 ......
"6. On going through the impugned judgments, the relevant facts and the judgment
in the case of Sudhir Kumar, it is found that on facts there is no meaningful and
serious challenge to the relevant facts that concerned employees in these matters
have been appointed on the post of Constable without any advertisement and without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 31
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
following procedure of appointment. No general decision or order or regulation of the
State Government is available to support the contention that appointment of the
appellants is akin to compassionate appointment for which the State Government has
taken a policy decision and prescribed rules. In fact, there is no controversy or issue
in these matters because on admitted facts it is clear that the appointment of the
appellants on the post of Constable were made through a backdoor method in
complete disregard of procedure for appointment laid down in relevant rules in the
Police Manual and in violation of constitutional mandate of equality in public
employment. The State has rightly relied upon various judgments including that of a
Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka v.
Uma Devi, reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 [:2006(2) PLJR (SC) 363], to submit that such
appointment do not confer any right on the appointees and in such cases of
appointments made without following due process as per mandate of the
Constitution or the relevant rules for appointment, the Court cannot direct for grant
of benefits like absorption, regularization or re-engagement. Those principles, though
considered in that case in the context of absorption/regularization, will apply with
equal force where such illegal appointment has been terminated and the Court is
called upon to consider such order and the connected issue of ordering for
reinstatement i.e. for continuation of such illegal appointments. That constitution
Bench judgment has emphasized the relevant aspects in paragraphs 33 and 39 and in
paragraph 54 it has been clarified that those decision which run counter to the
principles settled in that decision, or in which direction run counter to that decision,
will stand denuded of their status as precedents. The same principles of law flows
from a Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Amrendra Singh v. State
of Bihar, 1999 (3) PLJR
984.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
7. Having found that the appellants/employees concerned are backdoor appointees as held by the
learned Judges in the impugned orders and they have no right to their posts, we are now required to
consider the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellants that the impugned orders should be
set aside because the termination orders were issued by the various Superintendents of Police not of
their own free will but rather under the directions of the higher authorities including the State
Government and that principles of natural justice were not complied with in relation to some of the
petitioners/appellants.
8. The submissions noticed above must be decided in the background of facts of each case. In the
present case the facts noticed in brief disclose that large scale backdoor appointments were detected
to have been made during the tenure of a particular Director General of Police. An enquiry was held
and thereafter, as a result of such enquiry directions were issued by the higher authorities to the
Superintendents of Police, the competent authority to make appointments to the post of Constable,
to issue show Cause notices wherever such backdoor appointments are detected and to take action

for their termination. The issue is whether the State Government and the successor Director General
of Police could have held such enquiry and issued such directions or not. In order to ensure rule of
law and obedience to constitutional mandate governing public employment, the State and its
officials must be held duty bound to take such steps and there is no legal infirmity in such action."
47. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Chandeshwar Pathak (supra) has also taken note of
paragraph 35 and 36 of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Orissa and
another v. Mamata Mohanty, (2011) 3 SCC 436 which are reproduced hereunder:
"35. At one time this Court had been of the view that calling the names from
employment exchange would curb to certain extent the menace of nepotism and
corruption in public employment. But, later on, it came to the conclusion that some
appropriate method consistent with the requirements of Article 16 should be
followed. In other Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 words
there must be a notice published in the appropriate manner calling for applications
and all those who apply in response thereto should be considered fairly. Even if the
names of candidates are requisitioned from employment exchange, in addition
thereto it is mandatory on the part of the employer to invite applications from all
eligible candidates from the open market by advertising the vacancies in newspapers
having wide circulation or by announcement in radio and television as merely calling
the names from the employment exchange does not meet the requirement of the said
article of the Constitution. (Vide Delhi Development Horticulture Employees' Union
v. Delhi Admn.7, State of Haryana v. Piara Singh8, Excise Supdt. v. K.B.N.
Visweshwara Rao9, Arun Tewari v. Zila Mansavi Shikshak Sangh10, Binod Kumar
Gupta v. Ram Ashray Mahoto11, National Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh12, Telecom
District Manager v. Keshab Deb13, State of Bihar v. Upendra Narayan Singh14 and
State of M.P. v. Mohd. Abrahim15 .)
36. Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition that no person can be appointed even
on a temporary or ad hoc basis without inviting applications from all eligible
candidates. If any appointment is made by merely inviting names from the
employment exchange or putting a note on the noticeboard, etc. that will not meet
the requirement of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Such a course violates the
mandates of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India as it deprives the
candidates who are eligible for the post, from being considered. A person employed
in violation of these provisions is not entitled to any relief including salary. For a
valid and legal appointment mandatory compliance with the said constitutional
requirement is to be fulfilled. The equality clause enshrined in Article 16 requires that
every such appointment be made by an open advertisement as to enable all eligible
persons to compete on merit."

48. After taking note of the aforesaid judgments, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that in the absence of
any advertisement or selection process the appointment of respondents is not protected and could
be validly terminated.
49. The Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court has in the case of Shailesh Kumar Mall (supra) also
took note of the aforesaid judgments and agreed with the views of the Hemkant Jha (supra).
50. On going through the judgment dated 08.08.2011 passed by Hon'ble Division Bench of this
Court in L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009 and L.P.A. No. 1015 of 2009, it appears that although the earlier
judgment of this Court of a co-ordinate Bench in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra) was relied upon
on behalf of the State and the same was taken note of, but the Division Bench was impressed with
the submissions that in similar circumstance in the case of Mithilesh Kumar Singh and Sushil
Kumar Yadav the matters had gone to the Hon'ble Apex Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.
3508 of 2008 (arising out of L.P.A. No. 690 of 2006) and in Civil Appeal No. 280 of 2007 where the
Hon'ble Apex Court rejected the argument of the State of Bihar and observed as under:-
"We are satisfied on the ground of equity that the incumbent should be allowed to
continue as he has been in service from 1993 and was appointed only on the ground
of his father being died while discharging his duties during the Election. Therefore, it
was an equity which prevails with us."
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
51. In L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009 and L.P.A. No. 1015 of 2009 the Hon'ble Division Bench has also
taken note of the fact that the Apex Court had observed that without going into the merits of the case
their Lordships thought it proper to allow him to continue in service as his father died while
discharging the duty during election.
52. It appears to me that the Hon'ble Division Bench while hearing L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009 and
L.P.A. No. 1015 of 2009 could not appreciate that there was a co-ordinate Bench judgment in the
case of Hemkant Jha (supra), therefore, in case any contrary view was to be taken, the matters were
required to be referred to a larger bench. The judgment dated 08.08.2011 in L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009
(State of Bihar Vs. Md. Manjoor Alam &Ors.) and L.P.A. No. 1015 of 2009 (State of Bihar Vs. Md.
Manjoor Alam &Ors.) are, thus, per incurium and do not lay down the correct law.
53. On the strength of the aforesaid discussions which have been made hereinabove, I would answer
the reference as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 34
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
54. The judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra) lays down the
correct law. The corollary of the same would be that the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in
L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009 and 1015 of 2009 are in the teeth of the judicial pronouncements by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the catena of decisions noted hereinabove and has been rendered without
considering the prior Division Bench judgment in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra) rendered by a
Bench of Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 equal strength hence, the
judgments in L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009 and 1015 of 2009 are per incurium. Consequently the view
expressed by this Court's judgment in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra) and in view of the law laid
down by the Apex Court in the case of Chandreshwar Pathak (supra) is upheld. All judgments of this
Court taking a contrary view are overruled.
55. The reference is answered accordingly.
Per: Mohit Kumar Sah, J.:
The undisputed material facts of these cases and the questions for determination by
this Full Bench have been succinctly set out in the erudite judgment of Hon'ble the
Chief Justice and my esteem brother Hon'ble Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad which I
have had the benefit of going through and I fully agree with the line of reasoning as
well as the conclusion arrived at, for answering the reference. With a view to buttress
the same, I would humbly like to further expound the issue in brief.
2. As regards the status of the Bihar Police Manual, 1978, admittedly, the same has
got approval of the Cabinet and its applicability has been notified under the orders of
the Governor in purported exercise of powers conferred under Section 7 and Section
12 of the Bihar Police Act, 1861 by a notification dated 27.02.1979 issued by the Home
(Police) Department, under the orders of the Governor of Bihar. At this juncture, it
would be relevant to note that it is a well settled law that the State Government has
executive powers, in relation to all matters with respect to which the Patna High
Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 legislature of the State has power to
make laws. There is no dispute that under Entry 2 List II of the VII th Schedule to the
Constitution of India, "Police", subject to the provisions of Entry 2A List I, falls in the
said list.
It is the State legislature which is competent to make laws relating to "Policing" in the State.
3. It is equally a well settled law that it is not obligatory for the State Government, under the proviso
to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, to make rules of recruitment, appointment etc. before a
service can be constituted or a post created or filled, and the State Government, in exercise of its
executive power, in relation to all matters with respect to which the legislature of the State has
power to make laws, can act under Article 162 of the Constitution of India without a law on the
subject matter and there is nothing in terms of Article 309 of the Constitution of India which
abridges the said power of the executive. Thus, I am of the view that till statutory rules are framed,
in this regard, by the Government under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 35
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
Government can definitely issue administrative/ executive instructions/guidelines regarding the
principles to be followed in matters of recruitment, appointment, promotion, punishments, transfer,
leave, retirement etc. In this regard, it would be relevant to refer to a judgment rendered by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of B.N. Nagarajan & Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 Others Vs. State of Mysore & Others, reported in AIR 1966 SC 1942, paragraph nos. 3
to 8 whereof are reproduced herein below:-
"3. We may here dispose of the point whether these rules are executive rules or
statutory rules made under Art. 309 of the Constitution. The High Court held that
"there can be little doubt that to the extent the Rules deal with the topic of regulating
recruitment to Civil Services under the State, the source of the power could only be
the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution." In our opinion, these rules are not rules
made under Art. 309. First, the rules do not expressly say so, and secondly, the rules
are dealing with the functions of the commission rather than with laying down the
rules regarding recruitment to services or posts. Under Art. 320 (3) of the
Constitution, it is the duty of the Government to consult and the duty of the Public
Service Commission to advise, inter alia "on the principles to be followed in making
appointments to civil services and posts and on the suitability of candidates for such
appointments, promotions or transfers." Sub-rule (1) of R. 4 clearly provides the
same thing as does Art. 320 (3) (b) and the other sub-rules are really administrative
arrangements apparently arrived at between the Commission and the Government as
to how the Government and the Public Service Commission will take steps to recruit
persons for the State Services or posts.
4. To resume the narrative, on February 10, 1958, the Governor of Mysore, in exercise
of the powers conferred by the proviso so art. 309 of the Constitution, made the
Mysore State Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1957, hereinafter called the
General Recruitment Rules. There is no dispute that these are statutory rules and in
so far as they direct anything to be done in a particular way, the Government would
have to comply with the directions. Rule 3 of these Rules, on which reliance has been
placed Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 by the learned
counsel for the respondents to urge that the Government cannot recruit Assistant
Engineers without framing rules, is in the following terms:
"Method of recruitment.-Recruitment to the State Civil Services shall be made by
competitive examination or by promotion. The method of recruitment and
qualifications for each State Civil Service shall be as set forth in the rules of
recruitment of such service specially made in that behalf."
5. It would be convenient to deal with this argument at this stage. Mr. Nambiar contends that the
words "shall be as set forth in the rules of recruitment of such service specially made in that behalf
"clearly show that till the rules are made in that behalf no recruitment can be made to any service.
We are unable to accept this contention. First it is not obligatory under proviso to art. 309 to make
rules of recruitment, etc., before a service can be constituted or a post created or filled. This is not to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 36
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
say that it is not desirable that ordinarily rules should be made on all matters which are susceptible
of being embodied in rules. Secondly, the State Government has executive power, in relation to all
matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws. It follows from
this that the State Government will have executive power in respect of List II, Entry 41, State Public
Services. It was settled by this Court in Ram Jawaya Kapur v. The State of Punjab(1) that it is not
necessary that there must be a law already in existence before the executive is enabled to function
and that the powers of the executive are limited merely to the carrying out of these laws. We see
nothing in the terms of art.
309 of the Constitution which abridges the power of the executive to act under art. 162 of the
Constitution without a law. It is hardly necessary to mention that if there is a statutory rule or an act
on the matter, the executive must abide by Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 that act or rule and it cannot in exercise of the executive power under art. 162 of the
Constitution ignore or act contrary to that rule or act.
6. In the background of this position we are unable to interpret Rule 3 of the General Recruitment
Rules as suspending the executive power of the State till rules of recruitment of a service are
specially made in that behalf. Rules usually take a long time to make; various authorities have to be
consulted and it could not have been the intention of r. 3 of the General Recruitment Rules, 1957, to
halt the working of the public departments till rules were framed.
This Court considered a similar point in T. Cajee v. U. Jormanik Siem, 1961-1 SCR 750 at pp. 762-
764: (AIR 1961 SC 276 at p. 281), and arrived at a similar conclusion. The following observations of
Wanchoo, J., who delivered the judgment on behalf of the majority, bring out clearly the fallacy in
Mr. Nambiar's argument:
"The High Court has taken the view that the appointment and succession of a Siem
was not an administrative function of the District Council and that the District
Council could only act by making a law with the assent of the Governor so far as the
appointment and removal of a Siem was concerned. In this connection, the High
Court relied on para 3 (1) (g) of the Schedule, which lays down that the District
Council shall have the power to make laws with respect to the appointment and
succession of Chiefs and Headmen. The High Court seems to be of the view that until
such a law is made there could be no power of appointment of a Chief or Siem like the
respondent and in consequence there would be no power of removal either. With
respect, it seems to us that the High Court has read far more into para 3 (1) (g) than is
justified by its language. Paragraph 3 (1) is in fact something like a legislative list and
enumerates the subjects on which the District Council is competent to make laws.
Under para 3 (1) (g) it has power to Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 make laws with respect to the appointment or succession of Chiefs or
Headmen and this would naturally include the power to remove them. But it does not
follow from this that the appointment or removal of a Chief is a legislative act or that
no appointment or removal can be made without there being first a law to that
effect."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 37
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
"Further once the power of appointment falls within the power of administration of
the district the power of removal of officers and others so appointed would
necessarily follow as a corollary. The Constitution could not have intended that all
administration in the autonomous districts should come to a stop till the Governor
made regulations under para 19 (1) (b) or till the District Council passed laws under
para 3 (1) (g). The Governor in the first instance and the District Councils thereafter
were vested with the power to carry on the administration and that in our opinion
included the power to appoint and remove the personnel for carryinig on
administration. Doubtless when regulations are made under para 19 (1) (b) or laws
are passed under para 3 (1) with respect to the appointment or removal of the
personnel of the administration, the administrative authorities would be bound to
follow the regulations go made or the laws so passed. But from this it does not follow
that till the regulations were made or the laws were passed, there could be no
appointment or dismissal of the personnel of the administration. In our opinion, the
authorities concerned would at all relevant times have the power to appoint or
remove administrative personnel under the general power of administration vested
in them by the Sixth Schedule. The view therefore taken by the High Court that there
could be no appointment or removal by the District Council without a law having
been first passed in that behalf under para 3 (1) (g) cannot be sustained."
7. Mr. Nambiar in this connection also relied on Arts. 15 and 16 of the Constitution. He urged Patna
High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 that if the executive is held to have power to
make appointments and lay down conditions of service without making rules in that behalf under
the proviso to Art. 309, Arts. 15 and 16 would be breached because the appointments in that case
would be arbitrary and dependent on the mere whim of the executive. We are unable to hold that
arts. 15 and 16 in any way lead us to this conclusion. If the Government advertises the appointments
and the conditions of service of the appointments and makes a selection after advertisement there
would be no breach of Art.
15 or Art. 16 of the Constitution because everybody who is eligible in view of the conditions of
service would be,entitled to be considered by the State.
8. In conclusion we hold that r. 3 of the General Recruitment Rules, 1957, did not prevent the State
from exercising its executive power of appointing Assistant Engineers and determining their
conditions of service by executive order."
4. Another leading judgment on the aforesaid issue is the one rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of Sant Ram Sharma Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr., reported in AIR 1967 SC 1910,
paragraph nos. 7 to 9 whereof are reproduced herein below:-
7. We proceed to consider the next contention of Mr. N.C. Chatterjee that in the
absence of any statutory rules governing promotions to selection grade posts the
Government cannot issue administrative instructions and such administrative
instructions cannot impose any restrictions not found in the Rules already framed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 38
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
We are unable to accept this argument as correct. It is true that there is no specific
provision in the Rules laying down the principle of promotion of junior or senior
grade officers to Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 selection
grade posts. But that does not mean that till statutory rules are framed in this behalf
the Government cannot issue administrative instructions regarding the principle to
be followed in promotions of the officers concerned to selection grade posts. It is true
that Government cannot amend or supersede statutory rules by administrative
instructions, but if the rules are silent on any particular point Government can fill up
the gaps and supplement the rules and issue instructions not inconsistent with the
rules already framed.
8. In B. N. Nagaraja'n v. State of Mysore,(1) it was pointed out by this Court that it is
not obligatory under the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution to make rules of
recruitment, etc., before a service can be constituted or a post created or filled, and,
secondly, the State Government has executive power, in relation to all matters with
respect to which the Legislature of the State has power, to make laws. It follows from
this that the State Government will have executive power in respect of Sch. 7, List II.
Entry 41, State Public Services, and there is nothing in the terms of Art. 309 of the Constitution
which abridges the power of the executive to act under Art. 162 of the Constitution without a law. A
similar view was taken by this Court in T. Cajee v. U. Jormanik Siem, 1961-1 SCR 750=(AIR 1961 SC
276) where Wanchoo, J., as he then was, who delivered judgment on behalf of the majority,
observed as follows at pp. 762-764 of the Report (SCR) = (at p. 281 of AIR):
"The High Court has taken the view that the appointment and succession of a Siem
was not an administrative function of the District Council and that the District
Council could only act by making a law with the assent of the Governor so far as the
appointment and removal of a Siem was concerned. In this connection, the High
Court relied on para. 3(1)(g) of the Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007
dt.29-03-2019 Schedule, which lays down that the District Council shall have the
power to make laws with respect to the appointment and succession of Chiefs and
Headmen. The High Court seems to be of the view that until such a law is made there
could be no power of appointment of a Chief or Siem like the respondent and in
consequence there would be no power of removal either. With respect, it seems to us
that the High Court has read far more into para. 3(1)(g) than is justified by its
language. Paragraph 3(1) is in fact something like a legislative list and enumerates the
subjects on which the District Council is competent to make laws. Under para. 3(1)(g)
it has power to make laws with respect to the appointment or succession of Chiefs or
Headmen and this would naturally include the power to remove them. But it does not
follow from this that the appointment or removal of a Chief is a legislative act or that
no appointment or removal can be made without there being first a law to that
effect......................................................... .........
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 39
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
..............................Further once the power of appointment falls within the power of
administration of the district the power of removal of officers and others so
appointed would necessarily follow as a corollary. The Constitution could not have
intended that all administration in the autonomous districts should come to a stop
till the Governor made regulations under para. 19(1)(b) or till the District Council
passed laws under para. 3(1)(g). The Governor in the first instance and the District
Councils thereafter were vested with the power to carry on the administration and
that in our opinion included the power to appoint and remove the personnel for
carrying on the administration. Doubtless when regulations are made under para.
19(1)(b) or laws are passed under para. 3(1) with respect to the appointment or
removal of the personnel of the administra- tion, the administrative authorities
would be Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 bound to follow
the regulations so made or the laws so passed. But from this it does not follow that till
the regulations were made or the laws were passed, there could be no appointment or
dismissal of the personnel of the administration. In our opinion, the authorities
concerned would at all relevant times have the power to appoint or remove
administrative personnel under the general power of administration vested in them
by the Sixth Schedule. The view therefore taken by the High Court that there could be
no appointment or removal by the District Council without a law having been first
passed in that behalf under para. 3(1)(g) cannot be sustained."
9. We pass on to consider the next contention of Mr. N.C. Chatterjee that if the executive
Government is held to have power to make appointments and lay down conditions of service
without making rules in that behalf under the proviso to Art. 309, there will be a violation of Arts. 14
and 16 because the appointments would be arbitrary and capricious. In our view, there is no
substance in this contention of the petitioner. If the State of Rajasthan had considered the case of
the petitioner along with the other eligible candidates before appointments to the selection posts
there would be no breach of the provisions of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution because everyone
who was eligible in view of the conditions of service and was entitled to consideration was actually
considered before promotion to those selection posts was actually made. It was said by Mr. C. B.
Agarwala on behalf of the respondents that an objective evaluation of the merit of the officers is
made each year and promotion is made on scrutiny of the record- sheets dealing with the
competence, efficiency and experience of the officers concerned. .............................................
.....................It is therefore not possible to accept the argument of Mr. N. C. Chatterjee that there was
any violation of the constitutional Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
guarantee under Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution in the present case."
5. Having regard to the well settled law as enunciated by the Hon'ble Apex Court and referred to by
me hereinabove, I am of the view that the Bihar Police Manual, which has got approval of the
Cabinet and has been notified under the orders of the Governor, will govern the field pertaining to
the matters relating to the recruitment, appointment, promotion, punishments, transfer, leave,
retirement etc., in the police services, until by a legislative enactment, statutory rules are framed by
the State Government. Thus the Bihar Police manual can definitely be said to be very much alive and
having the force of Law by virtue of exercise of executive powers by the State Government.

Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
6. Now coming to the complete divergent view taken by a Division Bench of this Court in a judgment
dated 08.08.2011, passed in L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009 (State of Bihar Vs. Md. Manjoor Alam & Ors.)
and L.P. A. No. 1015 of 2009 (State of Bihar Vs. Md. Manjoor Alam & Ors.), it would suffice to state
that firstly, though in the said judgment dated 08.08.2011, the Judgment rendered by a Division
Bench of this Court, reported in 2007 (3) PLJR 657 (Hemkant Jha Vs. State of Bihar & Ors.) has
been referred to, wherein the Division Bench has held that an appointment made without adherence
to the rules of police manual governing appointment to the post of constable, especially in absence
of any decision of the State Government to relax the same, cannot be Patna High Court CWJC
No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 sustained inasmuch as the incumbents have failed to show any
right in themselves to hold the post of constable, nonetheless, the Division Bench, in the said
Judgment dated 08.08.2011 has neither distinguished the Judgment rendered in the case of
Hemkant Jha (Supra) nor followed the same. Secondly, in the aforesaid judgment dated 08.08.2011,
rendered in the case of Md. Manjoor Alam & Ors. (Supra), a so called judgment dated 10.3.2008,
passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 3508 of 2008 (The State of
Bihar & Ors. Vs. Mithlesh Kumar Singh) (the number having been wrongly mentioned which should
in fact be Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)......CC No. 3508 of 2008), has been relied upon, however,
upon probe it has transpired that the said Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)......CC No. 3508 of 2008
has in fact been dismissed in limine by a one line order, passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court, hence,
the same cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be treated to be a binding precedent.
7. It is a well settled law that a Special Leave Petition, dismissed in limine without expressing any
opinion on the merits of the impugned judgment by a non speaking order, does not amount to
acceptance of the correctness of the decision sought to be appealed against. The effect of such a
non-speaking order of dismissal in one line only means that the Hon'ble Apex Court has decided
that the case is not a fit case where the special leave should be granted, hence, such an order Patna
High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 does not constitute a law laid down by the
Hon'ble Apex Court for the purposes of Article 141 of the Constitution of India. Reference in this
connection be had to a judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Manipur
Vs. Thingujam Brojen Meettei, reported in (1996) 9 SCC 29. In fact, an order refusing Special Leave
to Appeal, passed in one line, does not attract the doctrine of merger and such order passed by the
Hon'ble Apex Court does not stand substituted in place of the order under challenge nor amounts to
approval of the view expressed in the decision sought to be appealed against. Another treatise on the
aforesaid issue is the celebrated judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Kunhayammed & Ors Vs. The State of Kerala & Anr., reported in AIR 2000 SC 2587.
8. Thirdly, in the aforesaid judgment dated 08.08.2011, rendered in the case of Md. Manjoor Alam &
Ors. (Supra), a judgment dated 24.07.2008 passed by the Hon'ble Apex court in Civil Appeal No.
2899 of 2007 (Sushil Kumar Yadav Vs. State of Bihar & Ors.) has been relied upon, however, the
same cannot also be treated to be a binding precedent inasmuch as in the said judgment dated
24.07.2008 itself, the Hon'ble Apex Court has clarified that the said judgment will not be regarded
as a precedent and moreover the said judgment has been rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court
without either going into the merits of the case or laying down any law. Thus, I am of the view that
the aforesaid judgment Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 dated 08.08.2011,
passed by the Ld. Division Bench in L.P.A. No. 1167 of 2009 and L.P.A. No. 1015 of 2009 (State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 41
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
Bihar Vs. Md. Manjoor Alam & Ors.), has been delivered without appreciating the earlier judgment
rendered by a coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra), as also relying
upon such judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court which cannot be regarded as a binding precedent
much less having any force of law inasmuch as no law has been laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the said judgments. In such view of the matter, I am of the view that the judgment dated
08.08.2011 rendered in the case of Md. Manjoor Alam & Ors. (Supra) does not lay down the correct
law, especially, since the same is not based on any rational or principle of law, but on equity and on
the ground that similarly situated persons are still continuing in the police department which, in my
considered opinion, cannot be a ground to approve illegal appointments. It is a well settled law that
Courts cannot confer benediction to make appointments on sympathetical grounds when the rules /
regulations framed with regard to the same does not contemplate or cover such appointment. It is
equally a well settled law that ameliorating relief should not be taken as opening an alternative
mode of recruitment to public employment.
9. Last but not the least, the issue in hand stands fully covered by a judgment rendered by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
Bihar & Ors. Vs. Chandeshwar Pathak, reported in (2014) 13 SCC 232 as well as by a judgment
rendered by the learned Division Bench of this Court in the case of Hemkant Jha (supra), as also by
the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in a recent judgment rendered in the case of
State of Bihar Vs. Kirti Narayan Prasad & Ors., reported in 2019 (1) PLJR 102 SC :: 2018 SCC online
SC 2615, paragraph nos. 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17 whereof are reproduced hereinbelow:-
10. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners submitted that the writ
petitioners have the requisite qualification for being appointed to the post in question. They have
been appointed by the committee constituted and headed by the Regional Deputy Director
considering their past health service experience and qualification and posted in different primary
health centres and worked for the past 2 to 3 decades. Their appointment is fully protected by the
judgment in Umadevi (supra) and M.L. Kesari (supra). Therefore, they cannot be terminated from
service at this stage of their career, that too without holding any disciplinary enquiry against them.
12. It is not in dispute that the Government of Bihar in its Administrative Reforms department had
issued instructions for appointment to Class III posts in the Government office under its circular
No. 16440 dated 03.12.1980. The said circular applies to Class III posts other than the posts which
are filled in by appointment of candidates selected by Bihar Public Service Commission after a
competitive examination and to the posts which are governed by the Government resolution dated
28.01.1976. The said circular sets out a detailed procedure for notifying the vacancies in Secretariat
and its attached offices, District Magistrates and other Muffassil Offices and for calling for
applications, preparation of a common merit list and appointment from the said common merit list
in the order of merit. It also provides the procedure for constitution of selection committee,
preparation of merit lists and wait list, Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019
duration of merit lists and wait list. A similar circular No. 16441 was also issued on 03.12.1980 for
appointment to Class IV posts in the Muffassil Offices of the Government. These circulars had been
issued to avoid discrimination in appointment to Class III and Class IV posts in the Government
offices and provide for generalized procedure in consonance with Articles 14 and 16 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 42
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
Constitution. The appointment of the writ petitioners have not been made in accordance with these
circulars. Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the writ petitioners is that since the
writ petitioners have served for more than 10 years and some of them have even completed 20 years
of service, they ought to have been regularized in terms of the judgment in Umadevi (supra) and
M.L. Kesari (supra).
13. In Umadevi (supra) the Constitution Bench has held that unless appointment is made in terms of
the relevant rules and after a proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not
confer any right on the appointee. If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an
end at the end of the contract, if it was an engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual
basis, the same would come to an end when it is discontinued. A temporary employee could not
claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It was also clarified that
merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time beyond the
term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made
permanent, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not made
by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. In paragraph 43 of
Umadevi (supra), it was held as under:
"43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a
basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our
Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled from passing an order upholding a
violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with the
requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of the Constitution. Therefore,
consistent with the scheme for public employment, this Court while laying down the
law, has necessarily to hold that unless the appointment Patna High Court CWJC
No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 is in terms of the relevant rules and after a proper
competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any right on the
appointee. If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an end at the
end of the contract, if it were an engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual
basis, the same would come to an end when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary
employee could not claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term of
appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or
a casual wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he
would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely
on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not made by
following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open
to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the instance of temporary employees
whose period of employment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the
very nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. The High Courts acting
under Article 226 of the Constitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for
absorption, regularisation, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself
was made regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because an
employee had continued under cover of an order of the court, which we have
described as "litigious employment" in the earlier part of the judgment, he would not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109820048/ 43
Dinesh Yadav vs The State Bihar And Ors on 29 March, 2019
be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the service. In fact, in
such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing interim directions, since,
after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be
possible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no prejudice will
be caused to him, whereas an interim direction to continue his employment would
hold up the regular procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of
paying an employee who is really not required. The courts must be careful in
ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of its
affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to
facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates."

15.In some of the LPAs the Division Bench appears to have followed paragraph 11 in M.L. Kesari
(supra) for directing regularisation of service without considering the observations contained in
paragraph 7 of the judgment. In paragraph 11, it was observed that "the true effect of the direction is
that all persons who have worked for more than ten years as on 10.4.2006 [the date of decision in
Umadevi (3)] without the protection of any interim order of any court or tribunal, in vacant posts,
possessing the requisite qualification, are entitled to be considered for regularisation within six
months of the decision in Umadevi (3) as a one-time measure ............". However, in paragraph 7
after considering Umadevi (supra) this Court has categorically held that for regularisation, the
appointment of employee should not be illegal even if irregular.
"7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to the general principles
against "regularisation" enunciated in Umadevi (3), if the following conditions are
fulfilled:
(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or more in duly
sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the interim order of any court or
tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its instrumentality should have
employed the employee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously
for more than ten years.
(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if irregular. Where
the appointments are not made or continued against sanctioned posts or where the
persons appointed do not possess the prescribed minimum qualifications, the
appointments will be considered to be illegal. But where the person employed
possessed the prescribed qualifications and was working against sanctioned posts,
but had been selected without undergoing the process of open competitive selection,
such appointments are considered to be irregular."

16.In State of Orissa v. Mamata Mohanty, (2011) 3 SCC 436, this Court has held that once an order
of appointment itself had been bad at the time of initial appointment, it cannot be sanctified at a
later stage. It was held thus:
"68(i) The procedure prescribed under the 1974 Rules has not been followed in all the
cases while making the appointment of the respondents/teachers at initial stage.
Some of the persons had admittedly been appointed merely by putting some note on
the notice board of the College. Some of these teachers did not face the interview test
before the Selection Board. Once an order of appointment itself had been bad at the
time of initial appointment, it cannot be sanctified at a later stage".
(Emphasis supplied)
17. In the instant cases the writ petitioners have filed the petitions before the High Court with a
specific prayer to regularize their service and to set aside the order of termination of their services.
They have also challenged the report submitted by the State Committee. The real controversy is
whether the writ petitioners were legally and validly appointed. The finding of the State Committee
is that many writ petitioners had secured appointment by producing fake or forged appointment
letter or had been inducted in Government service surreptitiously by concerned Civil
Surgeon-cum-Chief Medical Officer by issuing a posting order. The writ petitioners are the
beneficiaries of illegal orders made by the Civil Surgeon- cum-Chief Medical Officer. They were
given notice to establish the genuineness of their appointment and to show cause. None of them
could establish the genuineness or legality of their appointment before the State Committee. The
State Committee on appreciation of the materials on record has opined that their appointment was
illegal and void ab initio. We do not find any ground to disagree with the finding of the State
Committee. In the circumstances, the question of regularisation of their services by invoking para 53
of the judgment in Umadevi (supra) does not arise. Since the appointment of the petitioners is ab
initio void, they cannot be said to be the civil servants of the State. Therefore, holding disciplinary
Patna High Court CWJC No.14455 of 2007 dt.29-03-2019 proceedings envisaged by Article 311 of
the Constitution or under any other disciplinary rules shall not arise.
10. In conclusion, therefore, I fully agree with the opinion expressed by Hon'ble the Chief Justice
and of brother Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad. Accordingly, the reference stands answered in the
terms already explicated in the judgment of brother Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad.
