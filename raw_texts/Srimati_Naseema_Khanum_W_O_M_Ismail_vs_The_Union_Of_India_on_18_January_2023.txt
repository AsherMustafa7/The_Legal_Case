2. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the respondents. Perused the

3. The material on record discloses that pursuant to expiry of the passport of the petitioner,
petitioner applied for renewal of the same on 23.09.2021 which was rejected by the respondents
vide impugned communication dated 22.10.2021 on the ground that a criminal case was pending
against the petitioner as per the police verification report in Crime No.42/2020. It is also seen that

is arrayed as accused No.2. The petitioner and other accused having approached this Court in
Criminal Petition No.101576/2021, the proceedings of the Criminal Court have been stayed by this

Srimati Naseema Khanum W/O M Ismail vs The Union Of India on 18 January, 2023
pending adjudication before this Court even till today. In this context, it is relevant to refer to
judgment of this Court in the case of Mr.Krishna Chiranjeevi Rao Palukuri Venkata V/s The Union
of India and others, W.P.No.9141/2020 dated 01.10.2020 where under identical circumstances, this
Court directed renewal of the passport of the petitioner therein and issued certain directions. The
said order reads as under:
"Petitioner states that, he was working at Sri Sarita Software Industries Limited at
Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh from 1996 to 2002. In 2002, he moved to
Tanzania, East Africa, where he was employed in Pharmaceutical Company. In 2006,
he relocated to USA as an ERP consultant and since then residing there along with
his family on H1B visa. He further states that his passport was renewed in 2010.
2. On 6.12.2019, petitioner traveled to India to attend Visa interview at the Consulate
General of the United States of America in Chennai and on 16.1.2020, he went back
to USA after completing the Visa interview. On 22.1.2020, he applied for renewal of
his passport bearing No.J2032048 through his travel agency before the Indian
Consulate, New York, USA. On 18.5.2020, petitioner sent an e-mail to the Indian
Consulate, New York USA informing that his passport was due to expire on 6.7.2020
and followed it up with several requests to renew his passport.
3. In response to the multiple requests made by the petitioner, finally on 17.6.2020,
he received an e- mail from respondent No.3 stating that a letter has been received
from respondent No.4 informing that a criminal case has been registered against the
petitioner. Petitioner was shocked to learn that a criminal case has been registered
against him which he was not aware and also the nature of the proceedings pending
against him.
4. In response to the communication dated 17.6.2020, the petitioner replied on
18.6.2020 stating that he has absolutely no knowledge of any criminal case pending
against him and he has been residing abroad since 2002 and has not received any
information in this regard from any Authority. Petitioner also made request with
respondent No.3 so as to issue a temporary passport so that he can travel to India to
ascertain the details of alleged criminal case pending against him. Since there was no
response by respondent No.3, petitioner has filed the instant writ petition.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner has made the following submissions:
i) Alleged criminal case pending against the petitioner is not a ground for refusal to
renewal of his passport;
ii) Petitioner was not aware of the pendency of the criminal case and non bailable
warrant issued by the jurisdictional Magistrate against him at the time of renewal of
his passport in 2010 before the Consulate General of India at New York;

Srimati Naseema Khanum W/O M Ismail vs The Union Of India on 18 January, 2023
iii) Section 6(2)(f) of the Passport Act, 1967 is not applicable to cases where an
applicant seeks for renewal of passport and is applicable to cases for issuing fresh
passport as held by the Delhi High Court in Ashok Khanna -vs- Central Bureau of
Investigation (265 (2019) DLT 614);
iv) Right to travel is indeed a fundamental right and the same cannot be arbitrarily
and illegally denied by the State. In support of his submission, reliance has been
placed on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Satwant Singh Sawhney -vs- D
Ramarathnam and Ors. (AIR 1967 SC 1836),he also relied on the decision of the Apex
Court in the case Suresh Nanda -
vs- CBI ((2008) 3 SCC 674), wherein it was held that despite criminal case filed against the
petitioner therein he was entitled to hold the passport since the passport had not been impounded
in accordance with law;
v) Petitioner does not fall in the category so as to obtain an Emergency Certificate under the
Passport Act, 1967 read with Passport Rules 1980 since no Lookout Circular and Red Corner notice
are issued against the petitioner till date;
vi) The Notification dated 25.8.1993 issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India
is applicable only to the applicant who intends to travel abroad and not to an applicant who wants to
travel back to India. Hence, the petitioner is not required to obtain written permission from the
jurisdictional Magistrate for renewal of his passport.
6. Learned Additional Solicitor General for respondents No.1 to 3 submits that 3rd respondent had
written to the CBI for furnishing latest status of the criminal case pending against the petitioner to
which the CBI informed that the jurisdictional Magistrate at Hyderabad had issued a NBW against
the petitioner and it was requested not to renew the passport. He submits that, since a criminal case
is pending against the Petitioner, he cannot be issued with passport as stipulated u/s 6(2)(f) of the
Passport Act. However, the said request can be considered subject to the condition that the written
permission is granted by the Court concerned allowing the applicant to travel abroad which is
provided under the Notification bearing No.GSR 570(E) dated 25.8.1993 issued by the Ministry
External Affairs, Government of India. In support of his submission, he places reliance upon the
decisions of this Court in WP No.57756/2015 (DD 14.6.2015) and WP No.40164/2018 (DD
19.9.2018).
7. He also submits that the petitioner cannot insist for renewal of his passport to travel to India and
he can obtain an Emergency Certificate to travel to India. Hence, he submits that the request of the
petitioner for renewal of passport cannot be considered.
8. Learned counsel for the CBI reiterating the submission made by the learned ASG submitted that
the charge sheet is filed against the petitioner and others in 20087 for the offences punishable under
Sections 120B read with 420, 419, 467, 468 and 471 of IPC in CC No.83/2008. He further submitted
that NBW has been issued against the petitioner since he did not appear before the Court personally
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182402486/ 4
Srimati Naseema Khanum W/O M Ismail vs The Union Of India on 18 January, 2023
or through an Advocate and he is not entitled for renewal of his passport.
9. I have considered the submissions made by the parties and also the writ petition papers.
10. As per Section 6 of the Passport Act, 1967, the Passport Authority shall refuse to make an
endorsement for visiting any country under Clause (b) or (c) of Sub-Section 2 of Section 6 of the said
Act on any or more of the grounds mentioned in Section 6 of the Act, which reads thus:
"6. Refusal of passports, travel documents, etc.--
(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to
make an endorsement for visiting any country under clause (b) or clause (c) of
sub-section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no
other ground, namely:--
(a) that the applicant may, or is likely to, engage in such country in activities
prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India;
(b) that the presence of the applicant in such country may, or is likely to, be
detrimental to the security of India;
(c) that the presence of the applicant in such country may, or is likely to, prejudice
the friendly relations of India with that or any other country;
(d) that in the opinion of the Central Government the presence of the applicant in
such country is not in the public interest.
(2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the passport authority shall refuse to
issue a passport or travel document for visiting any foreign country under clause (c)
of sub-section (2) of section 5 on any one or more of the following grounds, and on no
other ground, namely:--
(a) that the applicant is not a citizen of India;
(b) that the applicant may, or is likely to, engage outside India in activities prejudicial
to the sovereignty and integrity of India;
(c) that the departure of the applicant from India may, or is likely to, be detrimental
to the security of India;
(d) that the presence of the applicant outside India may, or is likely to, prejudice the
friendly relations of India with any foreign country;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182402486/ 5
Srimati Naseema Khanum W/O M Ismail vs The Union Of India on 18 January, 2023
(e) that the applicant has, at any time during the period of five years immediately
preceding the date of his applicant, been convicted by a court in India for any offence
involving moral turpitude and sentenced in respect thereof to imprisonment for not
less than two years;
(f) that proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by the
applicant are pending before a criminal court in India;
(g) that a warrant or summons for the appearance, or a warrant for the arrest, of the
applicant has been issued by a court under any law for the time being in force or that
an order prohibiting the departure from India of the applicant has been made by any
such court;
- 10 -
(h) that the applicant has been repatriated and has not reimbursed the expenditure incurred in
connection with such repatriation;
(i) that in the opinion of the Central Government the issue of a passport or travel document to the
applicant will not be in the public interest."
11. A reading of Section 6(2)(f) of the Passport Act indicates that, the passport authority shall refuse
to issue a passport or travel document for visiting any foreign country, if a criminal proceeding is
pending against the applicant in India . However, the said provision does not provide for refusing to
issue a passport for a person who intends to travel back to India . Hence, reading of this provision
clearly indicates that it is applicable only for issuing a fresh passport and not for renewal of passport
and this view is fortified by the decision of the Delhi High Court rendered in the case of Ashok
Khanna -vs- Central Bureau of Investigation (supra). Delhi High Court while interpreting Section 6
of the Passport Act, 1967 has held that the Passport Authority can refuse to issue passport or an
endorsement for visiting any country but nowhere in the provision it is mentioned that even for
renewal of passport, the Authority can refuse to renew the passport. It was further held that for
renewal of passport, an applicant has to submit Form EA(P)-2 which reads as under:
FORM EA(P)-2 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

8. Two specimen signatures or T.I. required for services at (c) within the space given below:
Thus, in Form EA (P-2), there is no such condition or requirement to take written
permission from the Court.
12. The submission of the learned ASG that, written permission of the jurisdictional
Magistrate is required for renewal of the passport as provided in the Notification
bearing No.G.S.R 570 (E) dated 25.8.1993 issued by the Ministry External Affairs,
Government of India is also not acceptable. The said Notification is applicable to an
applicant requesting for issuing passport so as to travel abroad. It is not the case of
the Petitioner that he intends to travel abroad. Petitioner is requesting for renewal of
passport which he has submitted in Form EA (P)-2 and in the said Form there is no
requirement for obtaining permission from the jurisdictional magistrate before
whom a criminal case is pending to travel abroad. The said notification applies to an
applicant who intends to travel abroad against whom a criminal case is pending. The
decisions of this court relied upon by the Learned ASG are not applicable to the facts
of this case.
13. In the instant case, petitioner is seeking for renewal for his passport, therefore,
said request cannot be rejected by taking shelter under Section 6(2)(f) of the Act and
Notification bearing No.G.S.R 570 (E) dated 25.8.1993 issued by the Ministry
External Affairs, Government of India.
- 14 -
14. The submission of the learned ASG that the petitioner can obtain Emergency Certificate to travel
to India cannot be accepted for the reason that part-II to the Schedule-II of the Passport Rules that
provides for issuing Emergency Certificate is not applicable to the petitioner. It only applies to
classes of persons listed in the said Schedule. Petitioner does not fall in any of the classes of persons
listed in the said schedule. It is also a fact, that the petitioner's passport has not been refused and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182402486/ 8
Srimati Naseema Khanum W/O M Ismail vs The Union Of India on 18 January, 2023
also not impounded or revoked. Hence, the Rules providing for obtaining Emergency Certificate is
not applicable to the petitioner's case.
15. The Apex Court in the case of Satwant Singh Sawhney supra, has held that under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India, no person can be deprived of his right to travel except according to procedure
established by law. Hence, Petitioner's right to travel cannot be curtailed on the pretext that a
criminal case is pending against him by refusing to renew his passport.
16. The Apex Court in the case Suresh Nanda -vs- CBI supra has held that despite criminal case filed
against the petitioner therein he was entitled to hold the passport since the passport had not been
impounded in accordance with law. Hence, merely because a criminal case is pending against the
Petitioner, he cannot be disqualified from holding a passport, when admittedly his passport has not
been impounded under Section 10(3) of the Passport Act.
- 15 -
17. The Respondents have not produced any document to establish that the Petitioner was served
with summons issued by the Jurisdictional Magistrate or having been issued with any notices by the
Authorities informing him about the pendency of criminal case against him. Hence, the Petitioner
cannot be held guilty of suppressing the fact that he did not disclose the pendency of criminal case at
the time of renewal of his passport in 2010.
18. The offences alleged against the Petitioner are not punishable with death or life imprisonment.
Petitioner has filed an affidavit stating that he may put on terms for renewal of his passport. In his
affidavit, he has stated that he would enter appearance in C.C.No.1503/2019 (RCNo.2(E)/2005
pending before the Hon'ble XXI Additional Chief Metropolitan, Magistrate, Hyderabad subject to
Respondents 1 to 3 renewing his passport.
19. For the aforesaid discussion , I am of the view that the Petitioner is entitled for renewal of his
passport for a limited period subject to certain terms and conditions. Accordingly, I pass the
following:
ORDER
i) Writ Petition is allowed.
ii) Respondents 1 to 3 keeping in view the observations made in this order are hereby
directed to renew the Petitioner's passport bearing No. No.J2032048 for a period of
nine months from the date
- 16 -
of renewal subject to the condition that petitioner furnishes bank guarantee for a sum of
Rs.5,00,000/-.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182402486/ 9
Srimati Naseema Khanum W/O M Ismail vs The Union Of India on 18 January, 2023
iii) Petitioner is hereby directed to enter appearance in C.C.No.1503/2019 (RCNo.2(E)/2005
pending before the Hon'ble XXI Additional Chief Metropolitan, Magistrate, Hyderabad within six
months from the date of renewal of his passport failing which the Respondents 1 to 3 are at liberty to
cancel the renewal of passport of the Petitioner and also encash the bank guarantee furnished by the
Petitioner."
4. As can be seen from the aforesaid order passed by this Court, mere pendency of a criminal case,
particularly which has been stayed by this Court will not come in the way of a person seeking
renewal of a passport especially when the same has not been impounded by the passport authorities.
Under these circumstances, in the light of the judgment of the co-
ordinate bench of this Court in the case of Mr.Krishna Chiranjeevi Rao Palukuri Venkata supra
coupled with the interim order of stay passed by this Court in Criminal Petition No.101576/2021,
staying further proceedings against the petitioner in C.C.No.50/2021, I am of the opinion that the
petitioner would be entitled to renewal of passport in her favour and necessary directions in this
regard are to be issued. As
- 17 -
stated supra, since mere pendency of a criminal case (which has been stayed) is not a ground for the
respondents to refuse renewal of passport and consequently, the impugned endorsement refusing to
renew passport only on the ground that a criminal case is pending is clearly illegal, arbitrary and
deserves to be quashed. In the result, I pass the following:
ORDER i. The petition is allowed. The communication at Annexure-D dated
22.10.2021 is hereby set aside.
ii. The respondents are directed to renew passport of the petitioner in terms of the
application-Annexure-B dated 23.09.2021 subject to the same terms and conditions
imposed by this Court in Mr.Krishna Chiranjeevi Rao Palukuri Venkata V/s The
Union of India and others - in W.P.No.9141/2020.
