JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(CAV)
(M.V. Muralidaran, Acting CJ)
This writ appeal is directed against the order dated 17.8.2022 passed by the learned Single Judge in
W.P.(C) No.681 of 2019, whereby the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition, which was
filed to quash the order dated 16.1.2019 passed by the Director General, CRPF refusing to consider
the representations dated 4.10.2018 and 13.11.2018 submitted by the appellant against the entries of
grading "good" in his Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR) for the period from 1.4.2017 to
31.3.2018.
2. Brief facts which led to the filing of the writ appeal are as follows:
The appellant joined the CRPF on 1.12.1994 as Assistant Commandant and he has
always been graded "outstanding" during his command of units. While he was posted
as Commandant (IRLA3998), GC, CRPF, Langjing, Imphal, he had submitted his
APAR for the year ending 2017-2018 on 5.4.2018 to the Reporting Officer, DIGP, GC,
Langing. The said self appraisal was accepted by the Reporting Officer. However, the
Reviewing Authority in Part IV of the APAR downgraded the numerical WA No. 100
of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) Page |3 grading given by the Reporting Officer
without giving any cogent reason and the same was communicated to the appellant
vide letter dated 16.8.2018. The said letter along with the copy of APAR was served
on the appellant on 28.8.2018 to make a representation against the entry in the
APAR. According to the appellant, by virtue of the downgrading of numerical grading
by the Reviewing Authority, the overall grade of the appellant has been reduced from
"very good" to "good" without giving the factual reason. The only reason given by the
Reviewing Authority for disagreement with the Reporting Officer is that the grading
of the officer is over assessed.
2.1. The appellant requested extension of time for submission of the representation
against the grading/remarks recorded in APAR through letter dated 10.9.2018 and
26.9.2018. On 4.10.2018, the appellant has submitted his representation against the
grading/remarks and the same was not considered as time barred. Again on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176543342/ 2
Shri Munna Kumar Singh vs The Union Of India on 4 July, 2023
13.11.2018, the appellant submitted another representation against the
grading/remarks and the same was also not considered as time barred by issuance of
the order dated 16.1.2019. Aggrieved by the order dated 16.1.2019, thereby refusing to
consider the representation, the appellant has filed the writ petition.
2.2. By the impugned order dated 17.8.2022, the learned Single Judge dismissed the
writ petition holding that there is no illegality in refusing to consider the
representations submitted by the appellant and in issuing WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:-
WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) Page |4 the order dated 16.1.2019. The learned Single Judge
also held that the Reviewing Authority had recorded in writing the reasons for
downgrading the assessment given by the Reporting Officer in the APAR of the
appellant in the year 2017-2018 and the authorities have not violated any provisions
of the relevant guidelines of the Standing Order and have acted well within the power
and jurisdiction. Challenging the said findings of the learned Single Judge, the
appellant has filed the writ appeal.
3. Assailing the order of the learned Single Judge, the learned senior counsel for the
appellant submitted that the comments on pen picture written by the Reviewing
Authority have been construed as reasons and justifications for downgradation by the
learned Single Judge and the said comments are mere comments on the pen picture
and are not justification for downgradation of individual attributes. The learned
Single Judge accepted the general comment given by the Reviewing Authority against
the downgradation.
4. Mr. M. Devananda, the learned senior counsel for the appellant would submit that
the learned Single Judge has overlooked the provision contained in the Standing
Order of the CRPF that displeasure is not a penalty and cannot be considered for
denial of promotion. In the present case, acceptance of the displeasure by the learned
Single Judge as a valid ground for downgradation has the effect of denying
promotion to the appellant and this also goes against the current position of law.
WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) Page |5
5. The learned senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that no such notice or intimation
was given prior to the preparation of the APAR. The respondents could not exhibit if such notice or
intimation had in fact been given. However, the learned Single Judge accepted the contention of the
respondents that the same was communicated verbally without any proof.
6. According to the learned senior counsel for the appellant, the learned Single Judge overlooked
that only one line has been recorded in the impugned APAR for the downgradation. The learned
Single Judge failed to consider that on top of providing cogent reasons for downgrading the APAR,
the Reviewing Authority must also exhibit why the Reporting Officer had awarded inflated grading
and why the grading is not commensurate. The only thing mentioned with regard to the aforesaid in
the APAR is "Quoting of displeasure and grading of officers "very good", I do not agree in totality.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176543342/ 3
Shri Munna Kumar Singh vs The Union Of India on 4 July, 2023
The grading of the officer is over assessed. Has been over assessed in all attributes brought out in
numerical assessment. Performance has not been commensurate to grading". However, no
justification for recording the same has been provided by the Reviewing Authority.
7. The learned senior counsel for the appellant then submitted that the learned Single Judge failed
to appreciate and follow the judgment rendered by a Co-ordinate Bench, which is in gross violation
of the law laid WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) Page |6 down by the Apex Court
in the case of Dasharath Rupsingh Rathod v. State of Maharastra, (2014) 9 SCC 129.
8. The learned senior counsel for the appellant next submitted that the learned Single Judge failed
to appreciate that the Reviewing Authority has exceeded his power with respect to his duties for
reviewing of the APAR of the appellant without giving cogent reasons for downgrading in writing.
The learned Single Judge also failed to appreciate that the Reviewing Authority had taken into
consideration the displeasure issued by the higher authorities against the appellant, which is not at
all related or relevant to the period of consideration of the appellant's APAR and downgraded the
grading of the appellant without any justification. He would submit that in all the years since
2007-2008, the appellant had been graded either as "outstanding" or "very good" and that
downgrading his grade as "good" in the APAR for the period 2017-2018 is unacceptable. Arguing so,
the learned counsel for the appellant prays for setting aside the order of the learned Single Judge
and allow the writ petition.
9. Per contra, Mr. Kh. Samarjit, the learned DSGI appearing for the respondents submitted that the
entries in the APAR of the appellant were communicated to him on 16.8.2018 with an instruction
that any representation against the grading in the APAR should be submitted within a period of 15
days from the date of receipt of the APAR. Though the appellant received the APAR on 28.8.2018,
he has failed to submit the WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) Page |7
representation within 15 days and he has submitted his representation only on 4.10.2018 and
thereafter another representation on 13.11.2018 after a lapse of more than 35 days. Since the
representations of the appellant are time barred, the respondent authorities rightly rejected the
same vide order dated 16.1.2019 taking into consideration the provisions of Standing Order
No.4/2015.
10. Insofar as the argument of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that without giving any
reason, the Reviewing Authority downgraded the appellant is concerned, the learned DSGI
submitted that sufficient reasons have been given by the Reviewing Authority for downgrading the
assessment of the appellant's performance. In fact, the appellant has deliberately suppressed his
own acts of indiscipline, violation of orders and misbehavior for which the appellant had been
awarded displeasure and punishment of stoppage of increments after conducting an enquiry. Since
the displeasure relates to the period from 1.4.2017 to 31.3.2018 and the appellant did not challenge
the same and accepted the commission and omission of the misconduct, the Reviewing Authority
was right in downgrading the assessment of the appellant's performance.
11. The learned DSGI argued that if the appellant was not satisfied with the final grading in the
APAR, he ought to have submitted his representation within the prescribed period of 15 days and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176543342/ 4
Shri Munna Kumar Singh vs The Union Of India on 4 July, 2023
having failed to do so, he cannot blame the respondent authorities for his lapse. Having WA No. 100
of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) Page |8 considered all these aspects in proper perspective,
the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition. Since the order of the learned Single Judge is
well considered one, there is no need to interfere with the same and, thus, prayed for dismissal of
the writ appeal.
12. We have considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
13. The following facts are not in dispute - The appellant joined the CRPF on 1.12.1994 as Assistant
Commandant and he has been graded outstanding during his command of units. While he was
posted at Langjing CRPF, on 5.4.2018, the appellant has submitted his APAR for the year ending
2017-2018 to the Reporting Officer i.e. DIGP, GC, Langjing, Imphal and the said self appraisal was
accepted by the Reporting Officer, however, the Reviewing Authority of the APAR downgraded the
numerical grading given by the Reporting Officer and the overall grading of the appellant has been
reduced from "very good" to "good". The reason given by the Reviewing Authority for disagreement
with the Reporting Officer and downgrading of the grades given by him is stated as under:
"Quoting of displeasure and grading officer very good. I do not agree in totality. The
grading of the officer is over assessed. In attributes brought out in numerical
assessment performance has not been commensurate to grading."
WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) Page |9
14. The grading of "good" assessed by the Reviewing Authority in the APAR was communicated to
the appellant under letter dated 16.8.2018 of the Special DG, NEZ, CRPF with a direction to submit
a representation against the entry in the APAR if so desired. It is admitted by the appellant that the
said letter dated 16.8.2018 was received by him on 28.8.2018.
15. It appears that on 10.9.2018, the appellant submitted a letter to the DG, CRPF, Dte. Genl, CRPF,
New Delhi, requesting to grant 15 days more time for submission of his representation against the
APAR grading for the year 2017-2018. The said letter dated 10.9.2018 of the appellant reads thus:
"Grading of APAR for the year 2017-2018 has been communicated to me on
28/08/2018 through DIG GC Imphal vide Spl. DG, NEZ, Guwahati letterNo.A.XII-
2/2018-NEZ-PS dated 16/08/2018 (copy enclosed for ready reference.
Since Reviewing/Accepting authority has graded me as "Good", I intent to represent
against grading of Reviewing/Accepting authority. To submit proper justification and
specific factual observations against grading of Reviewing/Accepting authority, I
need 15 days more in addition to given time limit for submission of my
representation against grading of Review/Accepting authority.
It is, therefore, requested to kind grand me 15 days more time for submission of my
representation against APAR WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a

16. Again on 26.9.2018, the appellant sent another letter dated 26.9.2018 to the authority requesting
to grant him 15 days further time to submit his representation against the APAR grading. The said
representation dated 26.9.2018 reads thus:
"In continuation to my application dated 10/09/2018 in connection with time
extension for submission of representation against APAR for the year 2017-2018.
Due to heavy work load (i.e. completion of PIS data and verification of character,
caste certificate & education certificate) and pressure for booking e-lekha upto 50%
by 20.09.2018, I am not able to submit my representation within extended time limit.
Since Reviewing Authority/Accepting authority has granted me as "Good", I intent to
represent against grading of Reviewing/Accepting authority. To submit proper
justification and specific factual observations against grading of Reviewing/Accepting
authority, I need 15 days more in addition to given time limit and further extension of
15 days for submission of my representation against grading of Review/Accepting
authority.
It is, therefore, requested to kind grand me 15 days more time for submission of my
representation against APAR grading for the year 2017-2018 for which I shall every
be grateful to you."

17. It is not in dispute that those two request letters of the appellant dated 10.09.2018 and 26.9.2018
have not been received by the authority concerned. The factum of receipt of the said representations
has been stated in the Signal dated 3.10.2018 issued by the Digcent (CR &Vig) and the same is
quoted hereunder:
"SIGNAL To : Digcent GC IMP Info : Cespol NEZ/Polcent MN From : Digcent
(CR&Vig) Dte No.R.XIII-48/2018-DA-13(APAR) Dated 03/10/2018 U/V (.)
Regarding permission for submission of representation against the remarks/grading

accordingly."
WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 12
18. The adverse remarks recorded were communicated to the appellant through letter dated
16.8.2018 calling upon the appellant to submit his representation within 15 days. The said letter
along with the copy of APAR was served on the appellant on 28.8.2018 and the 15 days period starts
from 28.8.2018.
19. As stated supra, on 10.9.2018, the appellant submitted a letter requesting to give another 15 days
time for submission of the representation. Again on 26.09.2018, he has submitted a letter
requesting to extend the time by a further period of 15 days enabling him to submit the
representation. Finally, on 4.10.2018, the petitioner submitted his representation against the
remarks made in the APAR, followed by another representation on 13.11.2018. The representations
of the appellant were rejected on the ground that the appellant had submitted the representations
beyond the time stipulated.
20. Technically speaking, if we take the service of the letter dated 16.8.2018 along with copy of the
APAR on the appellant on 28.8.2018, the 15 days time granted to the appellant for submission of his
representation expire on 12.09.2018. Since the appellant was busy with his work, on 10.09.2018, the
appellant submitted a letter seeking to extend the time period for another 15 days. If we take the 15
days time from 12.09.2018 i.e. on the expiry of the original 15 days time, the extended 15 days time
expires on 27.09.2018. Stating that he was busy with official work, the WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:-
WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 13 appellant had submitted another request letter dated 26.9.2018
to further grant 15 days time to submit his representation. If we take the 15 days time from
27.09.2018, the extended 15 days time expires on 12.10.2018. As admitted, the appellant has
submitted his representation against the grading/remarks of the Reviewing Authority on 4.10.2018.
On a perusal of the representation dated 4.10.2018, it is seen that in the very opening paragraph
itself the appellant referred to his two request letters dated 10.9.2018 and 26.9.2018 for extension of
time for making the representation against the grading given in APAR by the Reviewing Authority.
Thus, from the above, it is clear that the representation of the appellant dated 4.10.2018 is well
within the period after the last extended period of 15 days. However, without seeing the reality, on
29.10.2018, the representation dated 4.10.2018 was rejected by the respondent authority on the
ground that the same is time barred. On 13.11.2018, the appellant has submitted another
representation against the grading recorded in the APAR and by the order dated 16.1.2019, the said
representation dated 13.11.2018 was also rejected on the ground that there is no provision to
consider representation against grading recorded in the APAR after expiry of scheduled time.
21. The appellant had time till 12.10.2018 for submission of his representation after the extended
period of time based on the request submitted by him. In the order rejecting the representation of
the appellant passed by the DIG (CR &Vig) dated 29.10.2018, the said authority has not WA No. 100
of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 14 gone into the merits of the grading awarded by
the Reviewing Authority and the authority simply rejected the representation on the ground of
delay.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176543342/ 7
Shri Munna Kumar Singh vs The Union Of India on 4 July, 2023
22. As stated supra, the representation dated 4.10.2018 was rejected basically on the ground that the
same has been submitted after the prescribed period. The conclusion arrived at by the DIG (CR
&Vig) that the representation of the appellant dated 4.10.2018 is after 35 days of the date of receipt
of the letter dated 16.8.2018 cannot be appreciated. The learned Single Judge has also erred in
affirming the view taken by the respondent authority qua the delay aspect. Since the rejection of the
first representation of the appellant dated 4.10.2018 itself is wrong, the rejection of the appellant's
second representation dated 13.11.2018 is also liable to be interfered with. In view of the above, we
are of the view that the representation dated 4.10.2018 is well within the prescribed time after
taking into account the two extension request letters submitted by the appellant. Therefore, the
findings of the respondent authority as well as the learned Single Judge qua the representation of
the appellant is time barred is liable to be interfered with.
23. The appellant has questioned the grading of "good" entered by the Reviewing Authority in the
APAR for the period from 1.4.2017 to 31.3.2018 by contending that though the Reporting Officer
accepted the self-appraisal report of the appellant and recorded his assessment in numerical figures
with regard to assessment of work output, personal WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of
2019) P a g e | 15 attributes and functional competency and gave a grading "very good", the
Reviewing Authority without any reason downgraded the assessment as "good" which is below the
benchmark of "very good".
24. The appellant also contended that the Reviewing Authority has used the displeasure issued by
him only for a case related to 2016 which does not form part of the assessment period as a ground
for reducing the overall numerical grading to below the benchmark which has an effect of making
the officer ineligible for promotion and financial upgradation in NFFU/OGAS.
25. Taking us through paragraph 3.11(i) of the Standing Order, the learned counsel for the appellant
submitted that the displeasure is not a penalty enlisted in Rule 11 of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 and,
therefore, it cannot be considered for denial of promotion and financial upgradation in
NFFU/OGAS. However, in complete defiance of the Standing Order No.4/2015, the Reviewing
Authority has used the displeasure to downgrade the numerical grading to make the appellant
ineligible for promotion despite being otherwise eligible. Therefore, the action of the Reviewing
Authority downgrading the numerical grading is erroneous in law.
26. Countering the argument, the learned Additional Solicitor General argued that only based on the
performance and the other related documents, the Reviewing Authority downgraded the numerical
grading and for the deliberate suppression of his own acts of indiscipline, violation WA No. 100 of
2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 16 of orders and misbehavior, the petitioner was
awarded displeasure and punishment of stoppage of increments.
27. It is pertinent to note that having been dissatisfied with the grading/remarks recorded in the
APAR, the appellant has submitted a representation dated 4.10.2018 and, as stated supra, the same
has been not considered by the respondent authority, as according to the respondent authority the
same is time barred. Followed by the representation dated 4.10.2018 and its rejection, on
13.11.2018, the appellant has submitted another representation. The same was also rejected on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176543342/ 8
Shri Munna Kumar Singh vs The Union Of India on 4 July, 2023
16.1.2019 by holding as under:
"Please refer to your representation dated 13/11/2018 against the remarks/grading
recorded in your APAR for the period from 01/04/2017 to 31.03.2018.
Your representation dated 13/11/2018 has been examined in Dte/ It is observed that
APAR for the period from 01/04/2017 to 31/03/2018 was communicated to you by
SDC, NEZ vide letter No.A.XII-2/2018-NEZ-PSdated 16/08/2018 and the same was
received by you on 28/08/2018. As per para 6 and 13(iv) of the S/O.04/2015, the
representation against the grading in APAR for the period from 01/04/2017 to
31/03/2018 should have been submitted by your within 15 days from the date of
receipt of the APAR, whereas you have submitted your representation on 04/10/2018
i.e. after 35 days instead of the stipulated time of 15 days. Accordingly, your earlier
representation dated 04/10.2018 has not been considered WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:-
WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 17 by the Competent Authority being time barred.
You have not brought out any new facts in your representation dated 13/11/2018.
3. Therefore, it is intimated that, there is no provision to consider representation
against grading/remarks recorded in APAR after expiry of schedule time."
28. As stated supra, the Reviewing Authority has used the displeasure issued as a ground for
reducing the overall numerical grading to below the benchmark which has an effect of making the
appellant ineligible for promotion. According to the appellant, the issue on which the displeasure
has been issued relates to the previous period i.e. the period before the reporting period and,
therefore, it becomes infructuous in view of Para 3.11 (iii) of the Standing Order No.4/2015 and
using the said displeasure for denying promotion is in violation of the Standing Order. We are of the
view that this aspect has not been properly dealt with by the Reviewing Authority while issuing the
impugned order dated 16.1.2019.
29. As rightly argued by the learned counsel for the appellant, the system of APAR has two principal
objectives, namely (i) improve the performance of subordinate in his present job; and, (ii) assess the
potentialities of the subordinate and prepare him through appropriate feedback and guidance for
future possible opportunities in service. The basic philosophy underlying APAR is that both the
superiors and his subordinates should be necessarily aware of the ultimate goal of the WA No. 100
of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 18 organization, which can be achieved through the
joint efforts of both of them.
30. The learned counsel for the appellant drew our attention to Para 5 of the APAR under the head
of pen-picture of the Officer reported by the Reporting Officer, which reads thus:
"Adhikari apne saunpe gaye dayitvon ko pura karne kaa prayas karte hain.
Prashashnik karyon kia anybhav hai. Reportadheen Awadhi ke dauran adhikari ka
karya evam vyahar bahoot achchha raha."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176543342/ 9
Shri Munna Kumar Singh vs The Union Of India on 4 July, 2023
31. However, in Para 6 of the APAR the Reviewing Authority stated as under:
"Behaviour of officer is not commensurate to his rank and seniority. He is belligerent
and arrogant in his general behavior. Despite repeated warning from seniors in the
past has not brought about change in his behavior towards subordinates. Needs to
bring about perceptible change in his behavior to control his temper. Has a tendency
to loose talk. Not fit for independent command."
32. In the instant case, nothing is on record to show that any advisory/warning/displeasure/penalty
with regard to the duties performed by the appellant and/or behavior for the period of assessment
has been issued by the Initiating Officer and, in fact, the records reveal that the WA No. 100 of 2022
(Ref:- WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 19 Initiating Officer has always praised the work of the
appellant and assessed him as "very good".
33. Primarily, the impugned rejection order dated 16.1.2019 was issued on the ground that the
representation against the grading in APAR was submitted belatedly, i.e., after the expiry of
schedule time. As stated supra, the first representation of the appellant is well within time and
hence that the respondent authority ought not to have rejected the representation dated 4.10.2018.
Resultantly, the order dated 16.1.2019 thereby rejecting the representation of the appellant dated
13.11.2018 will go. Since the impugned order dated 16.1.2019 does not deal with the merits of the
grading and it only deals with the time period for submission of the representation and the said time
limit has been clarified by us in the preceding paragraphs to the effect that the representation of the
appellant dated 4.10.2018 is well with the prescribed time limit, we are of the view that in order to
consider the claim of the appellant afresh qua the order/letter dated 16.8.2018 issued by the Spl.
DG, NEZ, Guwahati, the matter is liable to be remanded to the authority concerned.
34. In the result, the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge dated 17.8.2022 passed in
W.P.(C) No.681 of 2019 is set aside and the writ appeal is allowed. The matter is remitted to the
authority concerned for considering the claim of the appellant afresh qua the order/letter dated
16.8.2018 issued by the Spl. DG, NEZ, Guwahati. While considering the WA No. 100 of 2022 (Ref:-
WP(C) No. 681 of 2019) P a g e | 20 claim of the appellant, the authority concerned is required to
look into the representations of the appellant dated 4.10.2018 and 13.11.2018 respectively and pass
orders on merits and in accordance with law after affording a reasonable opportunity to the
appellant. The aforesaid exercise is directed to be completed within a period of three months from
the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. No costs.
