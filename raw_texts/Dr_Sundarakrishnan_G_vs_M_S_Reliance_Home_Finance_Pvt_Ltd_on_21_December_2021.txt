For Petitioners : Mr.S. Kamalakannan
[in all Crl.O.Ps.]
For Respondents : Mr.K.J.Parthasarathy
[In all Crl.O.Ps.]
COMMON O R D E R
These three petitions have been filed to quash the proceedings initiated under Section 138 of the the
Negotiable Instruments Act.
2. The case of the complainant is that the Respondents/Petitioners herein availed loan under the
scheme `Housing Loan` under Agreement No.RHHLCHE000009671. The 1st Accused / 1st
Petitioner herein is borrower; 2nd Accused / 2nd Petitioner herein is co-appplicant and the 3rd
Accused is company. The Accused promised to repay the loan amount as stipulated in the
agreement. The 3rd Accused had arranged Auto Debit/ECS with their banker, monthly instalment of
Rs.2,41,056/-. The same was dishonoured on 05.07.2016, 05.10.2016 and 09.03.2017 respectively,
when the cheque was deposited for ECS https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526
& 21288 of 2017 with the banker with endorsement of Miscellaneous and insufficient funds. After
complying the statutory notice, three private complaints have been filed under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act.
3. The quash petitions are filed mainly on the ground that the Petitioners / accused have obtained
housing loan of Rs.2,00,95,000/- on 15.07.2011 from the Respondent by entering into a loan
agreeement for purchase of the property situated at Plot 7, Balaji Nagar, 21st Street, Velacherry,
Chennai. The said amount was payable with monthly rests (EMI) of Rs.2,22,130/- and with an EMI
of Rs.2,41,056/- with interest revision payable in 180 equated monthly instalments. The petitioners
also executed a mortgage in favour of the Respondent over the property and the Petitioners also
regularly remitting the monthly EMI rests for the said Loan Account until 2014.
4. When the matter stood thus, it has come to the notice of the petitioners that the property was
acquired by the Government prior to their purchase for the purpoe of MRTS usage. They have
challenged the 4(1) notification of the State Government under the Land Acquisition Act before this
Court in W.P.No.6406 of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of
2017 2014 wherein the respondent sought the withdrawal of the compensation award as a secured
creditor in lieu of the loan amount challenging the right of the petitioners to claim the award. Hence,
it is the contention as the compensation received by the respondent, the complaint is not
maintainable.
5. Learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners submitted that as the property was acquired and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107519095/ 2
Dr. Sundarakrishnan G vs M/S. Reliance Home Finance Pvt. Ltd on 21 December, 2021
the compensation was paid to the Secured Creditor, there cannot be criminal prosecution u/s. 138 of
the N.I. Act. Though the Petitioners have raised objections for withdrawal of the compensation,
since the Respondent sought to discharge of entire loan outstanding in the Section 138 N.I.Act
proceedings in CC No.3769 of 2015 and the same came to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The
Respondent claimed compensation with respect to said property secured in November 2018 by
releasing the title deed and other original documents pertaining to the property. Hence it is his
contention that as the compensation has been paid, there is no legally enforceable debt. It is his
further contention that pursuant to the notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act,
any transaction after the notifiction is void ab initio. The Collector ought to have made reference to
the concerned court under Section 18 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 &
21288 of 2017 of the L.A. Act. However, the 1st and 2nd petitioners permitted to withdraral of
compensation by the Respondent in good faith without objections. Whereas the Respondent did not
seek further enhancement of the compensation as contemplated under Section 18 of L.A. Act within
the period of six months from the date of Collector's Award. Therefore, it is his contention that once
the amount has been discharged, there cannot be any prosecution and the secured assets already
repossesed and amount has been realised no offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments
Act is attracted.
6. In support of his contention he relied upon the following judgements:
1. N. Rajangan vs. Centurian Bank Ltd., [2001-1-L.W.(Crl) 831]
2. Rajkumar Sharma vs. Shriram Finance Co. Ltd., [2014 (143) AIC 682]
3. Prakash Finacne vs. R. Babu [2018-2-L.W.(Crl) 419]
4. Sudha Beevi vs. State of Kerala [2004 (21) AIC 336]
7. It is his further contention that if there had been a valid mortgage, the compensation amount
received by the Respondent is a security substituted in the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 place of the original mortgage property as contempated
under Section 73 of Transfer of Property Act. It is further contention that even the right of the
Respondent exist under Section 73 of the T.P. Act, the enhancement of compensation not been
claimed by the Respondent, it is not open to the Respondent to claim insufficient amount due under
the mortgage. Hence, submitted that the cheque in question is not enforceable. In support of his
contention he also relied upon the Honourable Apex Court judgment in Krishna Prasad and ors. vs.
Gauri Kumari Devi [AIR 1962 SC 1464] and Sundaram Finance Ltd., vs. State of Kerala and Ors.
[AIR 1966 SC 1178]. Therefore, submitted that entire proceedings has to be quashed.
8. Learned counsel appearing for the Respondent submitted that the plea sale and mortage void
after issuance of 4(1) Notification is unsustainable. The sale after Section 4(1) notification is at the
risk of the purchaser and only after under Section 6 declaration the land vest with the State. He has
also contended that the purchaser after 4(1) notification would not be entitled to challenge the
acquisition, however, he would be entitled to compensation or enhanced compensation as lawful
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107519095/ 3
Dr. Sundarakrishnan G vs M/S. Reliance Home Finance Pvt. Ltd on 21 December, 2021
owner. Hence the sale and mortgage are valid and binding. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 It is his further contention that under Section 73(2) of the
Transfer of Property Act, the mortgagee shall be entitled to claim payment of the mortgage money in
whole or in part out of the amount due to the mortgager as compensation. The right/remedy to the
mortgage is statutroy and the Petitioners cannot raise any objection to the same. Hence it is the
contention that as against the sanctioned loan amount of Rs.2,00,95,000/- the compensation
received is only Rs.56,14,840/-. Since there is a shortfall and it has to necessarily be
discharged/collected only from the borrowers/Petitioners. Therefore, it is his contention that the
debt and liabilitty of the Petitioners/Accused does not get discharged on receipt of the compensation
amount and the shortfall of the amount the mortgagee is entitled to proceed for recovery against the
borrowers. Therefore, he submitted that there exist a legally enforceable debt as there is a shortfall
and the debt had not been dischrged fully rom the compensation amount.
9. Learned counsel further submitted that the proceedings under Section 138 of N.I. Act is a penal
provision, at this stage the same cannot be quashed. The alleged plea of legally enforceable debt or
not though is untenable and unsustainable in the above case, it at all to be considered can only be a
defence https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 before the trial
court. Hence opposed the quashing of the proceedings.
10. In support of his contention he has also relied upon the following judgments:
1. M.M.T.C. Ltd., & Another vs. M/s. Medchi Chemicals & Pharma Pvt. Ltd., [(2002) 1
SCC 234]
2. Sampelly Satyanarayanan Rao vs. Indian Renewable Energy and Development
Agency Ltd., [(2016) 10 SCC 458]
3. Sripati Singh (since deceased) vs. The State of Jharkhand [2021 SCC Online SC
1002]
4. M/s.Synergy Credit Corporation Limited vs. M/s.Midland Industries Limited &
Others [2006 Crl.L.J.3267]
5. Krishna Prasad and others vs. Gaurikumari Devi [AIR 1962 SC 1464]
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017
11. Heard both side arguments and materials perused. The borrowal of the loan of Rs.2,00,95,000/-
is not in dispute. Similarly, prior to the Notification under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the
property has been mortgaged in favour of the Respondent is also not in dispute. The fact remains
that the property has been acquired, acquisition also put in challenge in a writ petition, which is also
not disputed. The Respondent being a secured creditor was paid a compensation amount of
Rs.56,14,840/-. Much emphasis have been made by the learned counsel for the Petitioner that as the
acquired property Compensation has already been paid and cheque issued towards the such loan is
not enforceable and there is no legal encroceable debt. Much reliance has been placed in the

Dr. Sundarakrishnan G vs M/S. Reliance Home Finance Pvt. Ltd on 21 December, 2021
Judgment of the Kerala High Court in Sudha Beevi vs. State of Kerala [2004 Crl.L.J. 3418] wherein
it is held that once the financier/owner under hire purchase agreement exercised the option of
seizure of the vehicle, the post dated cheques obtained from the hirer cannot be presented for
encashment after the seizure. The owner has to take recourse to other legal remedies for recovery of
the balance amount. If and when the vehicle is sold subsequently, the owner can recover the balance
amount after adjusting the sale proceeds of the vehicle.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017
12. Similar view also taken by the Chattisgarh High Court at Bilaspur in Rajkumar Sharma vs.
Shriram Fianance and Co.Ltd., [MANU/CG/0171/2014 = 2014 (143) AIC 682].
13. In Shiv Kumar and Anr vs. Union of India and Ors [(2019) 10 SCC 229] the Honourable Apex
Court relying upon the previous judgment of the Supreme Court in M. Venkatesh & Ores vs.
Commissioner, Bangalore Development Authority etc., [(2015 17 SCC 1] in which it is held that after
the notification under Section 4(1) is published in the gazette, any encumbrance created by the
owner does not bind the Government and the purchaser does not acquire any title to the property.
Further he cannot question proceedings of taking possession.In the above judgment it is also held
that after notification, acquisition cannot be challenged by the purchaser.
14. This Court also in Prakash Finance vs. R. Babu [2018-2-L.W.(Crl.) 419] has held that once the
vehicle is repossessed there cannot be any prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act. Similar views also taken by Madurai Bench of this Court in N. Rajangan v.
Centurian Bank Ltd., [2010-1- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288
of 2017 LW (Crl) 831].
15. The Apex Court in Krishna Prasad and Others vs. Gouri Kumari Devi [AIR 1964 SC 1464] has
held that the provision under section 24(5) of the Land Acquisition Act is some what similar to the
provision of section 73(2) of the Transfer of Property Act which provides, inter alia that where the
mortgaged property is acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, or any other enactment for the time
being in force providing for the compulsory acquisition of immoveable property, the mortgagee shall
be entitled to claim payment of the mortgage-money, in whole or in part, out of the amount due to
the mortgagor as compensation. In a sense, the compensation amount payable to the respondent
may prima facie, be treated to be like a security substituted in the place of the original' mortgaged
property under section 73(2) of the Transfer of Property Act. However that may be, the terms of the
decree require that the appellants must first seek their remedy from the said compensation amount
before they can proceed against the non- mortgaged property of the respondent. The relevant
directions in the decree do not justify the appellants' contention that because the mortgaged
property has vested in the State, they are entitled to execute the personal decree without taking
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 recourse to the remedy
available to them under section 24(5) of the Act. The Apex Court in the above judgment makes it
very clear that for the remaining amount mortgage is entitled to proceed against the mortgager.

Dr. Sundarakrishnan G vs M/S. Reliance Home Finance Pvt. Ltd on 21 December, 2021
16. In Sundaram Finance Ltd., vs. State of Kerala and Ors. [AIR 1966 SC 1178] the Apex Court has
held that the intention of the appellants in obbtaining the hire-purchase and the allied agreement
was to secure the return of loans advanced to their customers, and no real sale of the vehicle was
intended by the customer to the appellants. The transactions were merely financing transactions.
17. As per the dictum of the Apex Court in the Hire Purchase Agreement the ownership retained
such agreement is only to intend to secure the loan not intend to sale of vehicle and such contracts
made were merely a financial transaction. Whereas in the given case it is the admitted case that
there was a mortgage executed between the parties. Though it is contended that the petitioner that
such mortgage itself is not void, this Court cannot go into the issue at present. Whether the
mortgage is affected after notification u/s 4(1) or u/s. 6 Declaration is not an issue before this Court.
It is admitted case of both sides that there was mortgage in favour of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 Respondent, after the
acquisition, the Respondent has obtained the compensation of Rs.56,14,840/- as indicated above.
18. Sub-clause 2 Section 73 of the Transfer of Property Act makes it very clear that where the
mortgaged property or any part thereof or any interest therein is acquired under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894); or any other enactment for the time being in force providing for
the compulsory acquisition of immovable property, the mortgagee shall be entitled to claim payment
of the mortgage-money, in whole or in part, out of the amount due to the mortgagor as
compensation.
19. A careful perusal of the above provision makes it clear that the above merely enacts the principle
of substituted security, that is to say , not taking for the purpose of the security entitled not only to
proceed against the mortgage property but anything that is substituted for it. The mortgagee
certainly recover for remaining amount also other then the compensation amount. Therefore,
merely because compensation withdrawn and challenge has not made to refer the matter to the
Land Acquisition Tribunal, it cannot be said that the entire proceeing has
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 been discharged.
20. Be that as it may. The main contention of the learned counsel for the Respondent is that as the
compensation amount has been received which is lesser than the advance originally made to the
tune of Rs.2 Crores, such receipt of lesser amount itself amounts to discharge of entire mortgage
amount. Therefore, whether the receipt of the entire compensation towards the part of the loan will
amount to clear the entire mortgage loan cannot be gone into at this stage. The Negotiable
Instruments Act itself complete code. The special provision with regard to the issuance of the
cheque, issuance of the cheque is not in dispute. Therefore, while exercising the power under section
482 Cr.P.C. Court cannot go into the issue as to legally enforceable debt, etc., In this regard the
Honourable Apex Court in Rajeshbhai Muljibhai Patel and others vs. State of Gujarat and Another
[(2020) 3 SCC 794] has held as follows:
“22. The High Court, in our view, erred in quashing the criminal case in
C.C.No.367/2016 filed by appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai under Section 138 of N.I.
Act. As pointed out earlier, Yogeshbhai has admitted the issuance of cheques. When
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107519095/ 6
Dr. Sundarakrishnan G vs M/S. Reliance Home Finance Pvt. Ltd on 21 December, 2021
once the issuance of cheque is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 admitted/established, the presumption
would arise under Section 139 of the N.I. Act in favour of the holder of cheque that is
the complainant-appellant No.3. The nature of presumptions under Section139 of the
N.I. Act and Section 118(a) of the Indian Evidence Act are rebuttable. Yogeshbhai has
of course, raised the defence that there is no illegally enforceable debt and he issued
the cheques to help appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai for purchase of lands. The burden
lies upon the accused to rebut the presumption by adducing evidence. The High
Court did not keep in view that until the accused discharges his burden, the
presumption under Section 139 of N.I. Act will continue to remain. It is for
Yogeshbhai to adduce evidence to rebut the statutory presumption. When disputed
questions of facts are involved which need to be adjudicated after the parties adduce
evidence, the complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act ought not to have been
quashed by the High Court by taking recourse to Section 482 Cr.P.C. Though, the
Court has the power to quash the criminal complaint filed under Section 138 of the
N.I. Act on the legal issues like limitation, etc. Criminal complaint filed under Section
138 of the N.I. Act against Yogeshbhai ought not have been quashed merely on the
ground that there are inter se dispute between appellant No.3 and respondent No.2.
Without https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017
keeping in view the statutory presumption raised under Section 139 of the N.I. Act,
the High Court, in our view, committed a serious error in quashing the criminal
complaint in C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act.”
21. In Sripati Singh vs. The State of Jharkhand [2021 SCC Online SC 1002] the Apex Court in Para
23 has held as follows:
“23. These aspects would primafacie indicate that there was a transaction between
the parties towards which a legally recoverable debt was claimed by the appellant and
the cheque issued by the respondent No.2 was presented. On such cheque being
dishonoured, cause of action had arisen for issuing a notice and presenting the
criminal complaint under Section 138 of N.I. Act on the payment not being made.
The further defence as to whether the loan had been discharged as agreed by
respondent No.2 and in that circumstance the cheque which had been issued as
security had not remained live for payment subsequent thereto etc. at best can be a
defence for the respondent No.2 to be put forth and to be established in the trial. In
any event, it was not a case for the Court to either refuse to take cognizance or to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017
discharge the respondent No.2 in the manner it has been done by the High Court.
Therefore, though a criminal complaint under Section 420 IPC was not sustainable in
the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the complaint under section 138 of
the N.I Act was maintainable and all contentions and the defence were to be
considered during the course of the trial.”

22. In M.M.T.C. Ltd. & Another vs. M/s.Medchi Chemicals & Pharma (P) Ltd., [(2002) 1 SCC 234]
the Honourable Apex Court has held that the High Court while exercising jurisdiction under section
482 Cr.P.C. cannot examine merit of the complaint and also held that the burden of proving that
there was no existing debt or liability was on the respondents. They have to discharge in the trial.
23. In Sampelly Satyanarayanan Rao vs. Indian Renewable Energy and Development Agency
Limited [(2016) 10 SCC 458] the Honourable Apex Court has held that Whether the cheques were
given as security or not, or whether there was outstanding liability or not is a question of fact which
could have been determined only by the trial court after recording evidence of the parties. In our
opinion, the High Court should not have expressed its view on the disputed
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017 questions of fact in a
petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to come to a conclusion that
the offence is not made out.
24. Considering the above substantive provision of Transfer of Property Act as the mortgage has
already executed, though its validity is questioned before this Court, this Court cannot make a
roving enquiry. Therefore, this Court cannot go into the merits whether there is legally enforceable
debt or not, it has to be discharged only by the accused before the trial Court. In such a view of the
matter, the petitions filed to quash the proceedings in CC.No.4615 of 2016, CC.No.342 of 2017 and
C.C.No.4438 of 2017 are liable to be dismissed.
25. Accordingly all the three Criminal Original Petitions are dismissed. Consequently connected
M.Ps are closed.
26. At this stage, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner seeks the indulgence of this court
for dispensation of the personal appearance of the petitioners in all three cases, as they are senior
citizens. Accordingly, the personal appearance of the petitioners/Accused before the trial Court in
the above cases is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.16445,19526 & 21288 of 2017
