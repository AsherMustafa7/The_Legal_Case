Smt Shalini And Another vs State Of Up And 3 Others on 30 April, 2025
3. It is contended that the impugned FIR has been lodged totally on false allegations just to harass
the petitioners. The petitioners are major and have married with each other out of their own free
will and consent and living happily as married couple. The High School certificates as well as joint
affidavit of both the petitioners are also brought on record. As such it is contended that no offence
under the aforesaid Sections is made out against the petitioners. The entire criminal case lodged
against the petitioner is nothing but an abuse of the process of the law.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners has further contended that in view of the aforesaid facts and
circumstances, the impugned FIR is liable to be quashed. Learned counsel for the petitioners, in
support of his submissions, has placed reliance on the judgment in Kavita Chandrakant Lakhani vs.
State of Maharashtra & Anr reported in AIR 2018 SC 2099 as well as the judgement and order dated
5.12.2022 passed by a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 17046 of
2022 (Smt. Juli Kumari and another vs. State of UP and 2 others).
5. Learned A.G.A., on the instructions, states that till date the police report has not been submitted
in the present matter. He has submitted that once the victim, who is major, has herself admitted
that she has already solemnized marriage with the petitioner, he has no objection, if the matter is
decided on merit.
6. Heard rival submissions, perused the record and respectfully considered the judgments cited at
Bar.
7. Hon'ble Supreme Court's in Kavita Chandrakant Lakhani vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr (Supra)
has held that to constitute an offence under Section 366 IPC, it is necessary for the prosecution to
prove that the accused induced the complainant woman or compelled by force to go from any place,
that such inducement was by deceitful means, that such abduction took place with the intent that
the complainant may be seduced to illicit intercourse and/or that the accused knew it to be likely
that the complainant may be seduced to illicit intercourse as a result of her abduction. Mere
abduction does not bring an accused under the ambit of this penal section. So far as charge under
Section 366 IPC is concerned, mere finding that a woman was abducted is not enough, it must
further be proved that the accused abducted the woman with the intent that she may be compelled,
or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled to marry any person or in order that she may be
forced or seduced to illicit intercourse or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to
illicit intercourse. Unless the prosecution proves that the abduction is for the purposes mentioned in
Section 366 IPC, the Court cannot hold the accused guilty and punish him under Section 366 IPC.
8. In Smt. Juli Kumari and another vs. State of UP and 2 others (Supra), the Coordinate Bench, in
identical circumstances, has allowed the petition and quashed the FIR. For ready reference, the said
judgment is quoted as under:
"Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned AGA.
Present writ petition has been preferred for quashing the FIR dated 25.10.2022 being
Case Crime No.0475 of 2022 under Section 366 IPC, P.S. Saurikh, Distt. Kannauj and

for a direction to respondents not to arrest the petitioners pursuant to aforesaid FIR.
Placing reliance on the Aadhar Card of the victim girl showing her date of birth as
1.1.2004, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioner
no.1 is a major girl aged about more than 18 years on the date of incident.
The present petition has been filed with the declaration, jointly by both the
petitioners no.1 & 2 that the petitioner no.1 had left her paternal home out of her own
sweet will and being a major girl, she is free to take her choice to perform marriage
with the petitioner no.2.
The present petition, however, has been filed on the assertion that no offence under
Section 366 IPC is made out as the petitioner no.1 is a major girl. The entire criminal
case lodged by the respondent no.3 is nothing but an abuse of the process of the law.
Learned counsel for the petitioners has further contended that in view of the
aforesaid facts and circumstances, the impugned FIR is liable to be quashed in view
of the Supreme Court's judgment in Kavita Chandrakant Lakhani vs. State of
Maharashtra & Anr reported in AIR 2018 SC 2099, wherein it was held that to
constitute an offence under Section 366 IPC, it is necessary for the prosecution to
prove that the accused induced the complainant woman or compelled by force to go
from any place, that such inducement was by deceitful means, that such abduction
took place with the intent that the complainant may be seduced to illicit intercourse
and/or that the accused knew it to be likely that the complainant may be seduced to
illicit intercourse as a result of her abduction. Mere abduction does not bring an
accused under the ambit of this penal section. So far as charge under Section 366 IPC
is concerned, mere finding that a woman was abducted is not enough, it must further
be proved that the accused abducted the woman with the intent that she may be
compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled to marry any person
or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse or knowing it to be
likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. Unless the prosecution
proves that the abduction is for the purposes mentioned in Section 366 IPC, the
Court cannot hold the accused guilty and punish him under Section 366 IPC.
As regards the age of the victim girl, as indicated in the Aadhar Card appended as
Annexure No.2 to the writ petition, no dispute has been raised by learned AGA. It is,
thus, clear that both the petitioners are major. The fact that the present writ petition
has been filed with the declaration by the victim girl and that she is living voluntarily
in the company of the petitioner no.2, is supported with the signature of the victim
girl on the Vakalatnama. Once the age of the victim girl is not in dispute, the
petitioners no.1 & 2 cannot be made accused for committing offence under Section
366 IPC as victim had left her home in order to live with the petitioner no.2.

Smt Shalini And Another vs State Of Up And 3 Others on 30 April, 2025
We make it clear that the question in the present petition is not about the validity of
marriage of two individuals i.e. petitioners no.1 & 2. Rather, the issue is about the life
and liberty of two individuals in choosing a partner or their right to freedom of choice
as to with whom they would like to live.
In view of the above discussion, we are of the considered view that from the first
information report no offence under Section 366 IPC is made out, inasmuch as, both
the petitioners are major and the petitioner no.1 has come up with the categorical
stand that she had left her home with the petitioner no.2 willingly and is living with
him as a married woman.
In view of the above, the writ petition succeeds and is allowed. The FIR dated
25.10.2022 being Case Crime No.0475 of 2022 under Section 366 IPC, P.S. Saurikh,
Distt. Kannauj as well as all consequential proceedings are hereby quashed.
We, however, clarify that while deciding the present petition, we have not looked into
the validity of marriage of the petitioners."
9. Considering the facts and circumstances, we find that once the age of the victim girl is not in
dispute and she herself states that she has married with the petitioner out of her own free will, then
the petitioner cannot be made accused for committing offence under the aforesaid Section as victim
had left her home in order to live with the petitioner.
10. In view of the above discussion, we are of the considered view that from the first information
report no offence under the aforesaid Section is made out, inasmuch as the victim has come up with
the categorical stand that she had left her home with the petitioner willingly and is living with him
as a married woman.
11. In view of the above, the writ petition succeeds and is allowed. Consequently, the First
Information Report dated 15.04.2025 registered as Case Crime No.47 of 2025, under Section 87 of
B.N.S., P.S. - Merapur, District- Farrukhabad as well as all consequential proceedings are hereby
quashed.
12. We further clarify that the observations made qua the marriage is only for disposal of instant
matter and would have no bearing qua their respective rights and the same is to be pressed before
the competent court/ authority.
