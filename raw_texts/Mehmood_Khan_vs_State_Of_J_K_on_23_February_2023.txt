JUDGMENT
1. By the medium of the instant criminal appeal, appellant/convict seeks quashment of the judgment
of conviction dated 22.05.2015 and order of sentence dated 27.05.2015 rendered by the Court of Ld.
Principal Sessions Judge Rajouri (for brevity, â€žthe trial Court(cid:129)) in Criminal challan titled State of
J&K vs. Mehmood Khan, whereby, the appellant has been convicted for commission of offences
punishable under Sections 307 & 201 RPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for
three (03) years and fine of Rs. 25,000/- under Section 307 RPC and rigorous imprisonment for one
(01) year and fine of Rs. 2000 under Section 201 RPC.
2. Aggrieved of and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment of conviction, appellant/convict has
questioned it(cid:129)s legality, propriety and correctness on the grounds, that the learned trial Court has
not appreciated the evidence in it(cid:129)s right perspective and has ignored the material irregularities and
improvements made by the witnesses during their depositions before the trial Court.
3. Allegations against appellant/convict as emerge out from the prosecution case are, that on
17.06.2004 a telephonic message was received at Police Station Darhal from Darhal Hospital to the
effect that one Yasmeen Akhter has been admitted in the Hospital in an injured condition, on
receiving the said information, a report was entered inRoznamchawhereby police recorded the
statement of said Yasmeen Akhter who stated that she was married with Mehmood Ahmed
(appellant herein) and for the last 4/5 years he had divorced her, out of their wedlock one child was
born who is in her custody, "that on 17.06.2004 at 9/9.30 pm she alongwith her mother and child

Mehmood, she opened the door and the appellant fired on her which hit on her chest, she fell down
and blood started oozing out, on this her mother cried and shut the door, thereafter some persons
came and she was taken to hospital at Darhal."
4. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that during the pendency of the instant appeal,
compromise has been arrived between the appellant and his wife namely Yasmeen Akhter
(complainant) and now they are residing together a happy married life and the pendency of the
instant appeal is coming in the way of their matrimonial life.
5. Pursuant to the order of this Court dated 20.10.2022, the Registrar Judicial has recorded the
statements of the appellant and Yasmeen Akhter (complainant) on oath, the same are placed on
record and read as under:-
Statement of Mehmood Khan (appellant); Age : 51 years; S/o Sikander Hussain; R/o
ShahdharaSharief, Tehsil Thanamandi, District Rajouri, on oath today i.e.
20.10.2022 :
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all disputes and issues with complainant -
Yasmeen Akhter. A compromise deed dated 01.07.2022, duly attested on 01.07.2022
before Notary, Jammu, has also been executed between us in this regard. In view of
our compromise, I pray before the Hon(cid:129)ble Court to set aside the judgment / order of
conviction and sentence dated 27.05.2015 passed by the learned Principal Sessions
Judge Rajouri in case file no.70/ Challan titled "State v/s Mehmood Khan" for
offence u/s 307/201/120-B RPC and 7/27 of Arms Act and compound the offences in
the interest of justice.
Statement of Yasmeen Akhter (complainant); Age : 43 years; W/o Mehmood Khan; R/o
ShahdharaSharief, Tehsil Thanamandi, District Rajouri, on oath today i.e. 20.10.2022 Stated, that I
have amicably resolved all disputes and issues with my husband namely - Mehmood Khan. A
compromise deed dated 01.07.2022, duly attested on 01.07.2022 before Notary, Jammu, has also
been executed between us in this regard. In view of our compromise, I pray before the Hon(cid:129)ble
Court to set aside the judgment / order of conviction and sentence dated 27.05.2015 passed by the
learned Principal Sessions Judge Rajouri in case file no.70/ Challan titled "State v/s Mehmood
Khan" for offence u/s 307/201/120-B RPC and 7/27 of Arms Act and compound the offences in the
interest of justice.
6. From the bare perusal of the statements placed on record, it is evident that parties have entered
into a compromise, whereby,the appellant and the complainant-Yasmeen Akhter have settled their
disputes amicably as they want to live peacefully without involving themselves in further litigation.
7. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record of the case. Hon(cid:129)ble Supreme
Court of India in a case law titled Ramgopalvs. The State of Madhya Pradesh (Criminal Appeal No.
1489 of 2012) decided on 29 September 2021, while deciding two Criminal Appeals bearing Nos.
1488 and 1489 of 2012 wherein the convictions were rendered by the trial Court and upheld by High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21920772/ 2

court of Madhya Pradesh, and while observing that the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the
Constitution of India & High Court under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure have powers to
compound non-compoundable offences and set aside the conviction, in paras 19, 20, 21 held as
under:-
19.We thus sumup and hold that as opposed to Section 320 Cr.P.C. where the Court is
squarely guided by the compromise between the parties in respect of offences
'compoundable' within the statutory framework, the extra- ordinary power enjoined
upon a High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. or vested in this Court under Article
142 of the Constitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds of Section 320
Cr.P.C. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude ought to be
exercised carefully in the context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind:
(i) Nature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society;
(ii) Seriousness of the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise between the accused and
the victim; & (iv) Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of the purported
offence and/or other relevant considerations.
20. Having appraised the afore-stated parameters and weighing upon the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the two appeals beforeus, we are inclined to invoke powers under Article 142 and
quash the criminal proceedings and consequently set aside the conviction in both the appeals. We
say so for the reasons that: Firstly, the occurrence(s) involved in these appeals can be categorized as
purely personal or having overtones of criminal proceedings of private nature;
Secondly, the nature of injuries incurred, for which the Appellants have been convicted, do not
appear to exhibit their mental depravity or commission of an offence of such a serious nature that
quashing of which would override public interest; Thirdly, given the nature of the offence and
injuries, it is immaterial that the trial against the Appellants had been concluded or their appeal(s)
against conviction stand dismissed; Fourthly, the parties on their own volition, without any coercion
or compulsion, willingly and voluntarily have buried their differences and wish to accord a quietus
to their dispute(s); Fifthly, the occurrence(s) in both the cases took place way back in the years 2000
and 1995, respectively. There is nothing on record to evince that either before or after the purported
compromise, any untoward incident transpired between the parties;
Sixthly, since the Appellants and the complainant(s) are residents of the same village(s) and/or
work in close vicinity, the quashing of criminal proceedings will advance peace, harmony, and
fellowship amongst the parties who have decided to forget and forgive any illwill and have no
vengeance against each other; and Seventhly, the cause of administration of criminal justice system
would remain uneffected on acceptance of the amicable settlement between the parties and/or
resultant acquittal of the Appellants; more so looking at their present age.
21. Consequently, and for the reasons stated above, read with the settlement dated 13th September
2006, we find it appropriate to invoke our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and quash
the criminal proceedings in the aforesaid case. As a sequel thereto, all offences emanating out of the

Mehmood Khan vs State Of J & K on 23 February, 2023
FIR leading to Criminal Appeal No. 1489 of 2012 stand annulled, and the judgment and orders
passed by the trial court, appellate court and the High Court are set aside. Resultantly, the
Appellants shall be deemed to have been acquitted of the charged offences for all intents and
purposes.
08. In Kailash Chand v. State of Rajasthan, 2018(4) R.C.R (Criminal) 292, Hon'ble Supreme Court
while compounding the offences u/ss 307/326 IPC and setting aside the orders of conviction and
sentence passed by the courts below held as under:-
"[7]. Upon perusal of the record, it appears that the incident has occurred almost 30
years ago. Since the complainant/s and the appellant-accused belong to the same
family and are living in the same house, they have buried their animosity and settled
their disputes amicably in writing under an agreement letter dated 28.07.2017, copy
of which is already placed on the file. The injured victims are brother and
sister-in-law of the appellant. It is also stated in the aforesaid application for
compromise/ compounding of offence that there is no untoward incident has ever
taken place after the date of incident. [8]. Though the offences under sections 307
and 326 of the IPC are non-compoundable, having regard to the fact that the incident
in the present case did not have an impact on the society in general, and having
regard to the fact that the dispute between the parties has been settled amicably and
there is no likelihood of the repetition of such incident, we allow the application for
compromise/compounding of offence and set aside the orders of conviction and
sentence passed by the courts below against the appellant by exercising our
jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The appellant is ordered to
be acquitted of the charges levelled against him. Since the appellant is confined in
jail, he is ordered to be released from custody forthwith if not required in any other
case."
09. Ratios of the judgments of "Ramgopal" and "Kailash Chand" Cases (supra) lay down an
invariable principle of law that the Supreme Court and the High Courts have powers enjoined under
Article 142 of the Constitution of India and Section 482 of Cr.P.C respectively to compound
non-compoundable offences beyond the metes and bounds of Section 320 Cr.P.C and set aside
orders of conviction and sentence imposed by the courts below,where the parties have buried their
animosity and settled their disputes amicably and there is no likelihood of repetition of such
incident. Ratio of the judgments (supra) squarely apply to the facts of the case in hand.Adverting to
the facts of the instant case,an application has been filed by the victim/complainant Yasmeen
Akhter stating therein that she had made a false complaint to the Police, which was founded on false
assertiondenying what she has earlier alleged in the FIR and in the charge-sheet filed against the
appellant. She has further stated that after giving the statement she came to know and realize that
the appellant who is her husband was not involved in the incident, as such, prays for compounding
of the offences under Sections 307 and 201 RPC.Keeping in mind the fact that the parties i.e.,
appellant and victim-Yasmeen Akhter are related to each other as husband and wife, having left
entire life ahead of them and belong to same family and living in same house and have buried their
animosity and settled their dispute amicably in terms of compromise deed dated 01.07.2022 duly

attested by notary Jammu, there is no untoward incident has ever taken place after the date of
incident of 17.06.2004 (more than 18 years), and there is no likelihood of repetition of such
incident, I allow the instant criminal appeal/application for compounding of offence u/ss 307/201
RPC and while exercising powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C, the FIR leading to instant criminal
appeal stand annulled whereby the judgment and orders of conviction dated 22.05.2015/27.05.2015
rendered by the Court of learned Sessions Judge Rajouri are set aside. Resultantly, the appellant
shall be deemed to have been acquitted of the charged offences u/ss 307/201 RPC and also
discharged from the fine components specified in the impugned judgment for all intents and
purpose.
