2. The petitioner has filed the present petition, thereby challenging the order dated 02.12.2002,
whereby the Chief Law Officer rejected the petition of the petitioner preferred against the order of
dismissal dated 18.06.2002 and also for quashing the order dated 18.06.2002 issued by the
Commandant, by virtue of which, the Commandant has awarded the punishment of dismissal from
service to the petitioner with effect from 15.06.2002 and also for quashing para (a) of order dated
20.06.2002 issued by the Commandant, 123 Bn BSF, whereby the absence of the petitioner from the
service with effect from 07.09.2000 to 11.01.2001 (127 days) was treated as dies non and
simultaneously the petitioner has sought the directions to the respondents to consider the case of
the petitioner for reinstatement and to allow him to perform his duties on the post of constable.
3. It is stated that during the leave period as mentioned above, the mother of the petitioner became
serious and the petitioner being the only son was looking after his ailing mother. The respondents
issued a show cause notice dated 05.12.2000 to the petitioner, which was dispatched on 20.12.2000
and received by him on 29.12.2000. After the receipt of the notice, the petitioner replied the same
and also sent a telegram that the petitioner would join on 15.01.2001. In reply to the show cause
notice on 29.12.2000, it was stated by the petitioner that his mother was suffering from cancer and
the petitioner being the only son was looking after his seriously ailing mother. As absence of the
petitioner was not wilful, so the petitioner also requested them for extension of leave. It is further
stated that prior to that also the petitioner had sent the medical certificate of his mother, whereby it
was certified that the mother of the petitioner was suffering from serious disease and the Doctor had
mentioned that the period of absence of the petitioner with effect from 19.09.2000 was necessary
for the restoration of health of the mother of the petitioner. The reply to the show cause notice as
well as medical certificate was received by the respondents on 12.01.2001, whereas the telegram was
received on 09.01.2001 that the petitioner would join the Unit on 15.01.2001. Despite that, the
respondent No. 5 without following the provisions of Border Security Force Act, 1968 (for short "the
BSF Act") and the Border Security Rules, 1969 made thereunder (for short "the BSF Rules") and
without affording any opportunity of hearing, vide ex parte order dated 11.01.2001 dismissed the
petitioner with effect from 11.01.2001 and also treated the period of absence of the petitioner from
07.09.2001 to 11.01.2001 as dies non.
4. The petitioner filed the petition before the Higher Authorities and the respondent No. 2 vide
order dated 23.10.2001 set aside the order of dismissal dated 11.01.2001 and in compliance to order
dated 23.10.2001, the petitioner rejoined the Unit on 12.11.2001. Even after joining the Unit, the
petitioner submitted all the medical documents of his mother and also the certificate from the
President Nedubathoor Grama Panchayat wherein it was stated that the mother of the petitioner
was ill and he was the only earning member. The petitioner further claims to have submitted the
certificate issued by the Medical Officer dated 14.03.2001 thereby certifying that the mother of the
petitioner was undergoing treatment and her treatment continued for short period for complete
restoration of the health. Despite that, the Commandant on 08.06.2002 framed a charge sheet
against the petitioner under section 19(b) of the BSF Act on the allegations that the petitioner
overstayed the leave without any sufficient cause. It is further stated that the respondents neither
conducted any proceedings in presence of the petitioner nor afforded him an opportunity to cross
examine any witness and further that the petitioner was not having the knowledge in respect of any
proceedings conducted by the respondents. Thereafter, the Commandant-respondent No. 5 vide

P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
order dated 18.06.2002 awarded the punishment of dismissal from service to the petitioner and
thereafter, vide order dated 20.06.2002, the period of absence of the petitioner with effect from
07.09.2000 to 11.01.2001 was treated as dies non and the absence from the date of dismissal till his
reinstatement was also treated as dies non. The petitioner filed an appeal against the order
impugned, with respondent No. 2, but the Chief Law Officer vide order dated 02.12.2002 dismissed
the petition of the petitioner being devoid of any merit without giving any cogent reason and without
affording opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.
5. The petitioner has assailed both the orders on the ground that the respondents had not prepared
any offence report as required under Rule 43 of the BSF Rules and the respondents neither called
the petitioner nor prepared the record of evidence as required under Rule 48 of the BSF Rules. The
petitioner has further urged that the respondents without following the mandate of the BSF Act and
Rules framed thereunder have held the petitioner guilty and dismissed him from service. The
petitioner has also alleged that the respondents have passed the non-speaking order and have not
considered that because of circumstances beyond the control of the petitioner, the petitioner could
not immediately join after the expiry of sanctioned leave, as his mother was ill.
6. The respondents have filed the response, stating therein that the petitioner was sanctioned leave
with effect from 14.08.2000 to 06.09.2000, but after the expiry of leave, the petitioner neither
reported for duty nor applied for any extension of leave. Two call letters were issued to the petitioner
vide letters dated 19.09.2000 and 25.09.2000, but the petitioner did not respond to the same. Due
to the continuous absence of the petitioner, the Court of Inquiry was ordered under section 62 of the
BSF Act. An apprehension roll was also issued and addressed to the Superintendent of Police,
District Kollam (Kerala) vide letter dated 09.11.2000 and when the petitioner did not report, a show
cause notice dated 05.12.2000 was issued to him, thereby tentatively proposing to terminate his
service by way of removal and was given chance to reply before 05.01.2001 but the petitioner did not
report for duty. The Competent Authority therefore, dismissed the petitioner with effect from
11.01.2001 under section 11(2) of the BSF Act read with Rule 177 of the BSF Rules.
7. The respondents have given the details of earlier unauthorized absence of the petitioner on five
occasions. The petitioner, however, was reinstated with a direction to take a disciplinary action
afresh for overstaying leave by 127 days i.e. with effect from 07.09.2001without sufficient cause.
8. The petitioner reported for duty in the Unit on 12.11.2001. When the petitioner reported in the
Unit, he was heard by respondent No. 5 on the offence report on 14.01.2002. During the hearing to
the petitioner under Rule 45 of the BSF Rules, an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses was
granted to the petitioner but the petitioner did not opt to cross-examine the witnsesses. The record
of evidence was ordered vide order dated 14.01.2002. During the preparation of record of evidence,
three prosecution witnesses were examined and the petitioner was given an opportunity to
cross-examine all the prosecution witnesses. Further, the petitioner was also provided an
opportunity to produc e any witness/document in his defence, but he declined to produce any
witness/document before the Recording Officer. During the preparation of record of evidence, the
petitioner was allowed to make a statement, which right he availed and made a statement. After
going through the record of enquiry, the Commandant decided to go for a Summary Security Force
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190503851/ 3
P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
Court (SSFC) trial of the petitioner as prima facie case was made out against the petitioner. The copy
of the charge-sheet and record of evidence was provided to the petitioner vide communication dated
08.06.2002 prior to the commencement of trial on 15.06.2002. During the trial, the petitioner
cross-examined the first and the third prosecution witness and after the trial of the petitioner was
over, the petitioner was called upon for his defence and the petitioner made a statement. After
considering entire facts, evidence and circumstances of the case, the SSFC found him guilty and
dismissed him from service. The petitioner thereafter submitted a statutory petition against the
conviction by the SSFC. After the detailed consideration and careful scrutiny of all facts and
circumstances of the case, the Director General BSF rejected the petition being devoid of merit and
dismissal order dated 02.12.2002 was communicated to the petitioner. The respondents have stated
that the show cause notice could not be dispatched immediately due to Post and Telegraph (P&T)
strike and was sent through registered letter on 20.12.2000. Since the petitioner neither reported on
duty before 05.01.2001 nor any communication was received from him till 05.01.2001, therefore,
the competent authority dismissed the petitioner from service with effect from 11.01.2001 in terms
of section 11(2) of the BSF Act read with Rule 177 of the BSF Rules. The respondents have admitted
that the telegram was received on 09.01.2001 and an unsigned letter was received on 12.01.2001
forwarding a photo copy of medical certificate issued by Dr. N. K. Chandra Babu in respect of
mother of the petitioner stating that she was suffering from diabetes mellitus and hypertension,
whereas the petitioner had intimated that his mother was suffering from serious cancer disease
which itself is a contradictory and false statement. The disease of the mother of the petitioner did
not warrant the requirement of an attendant since it was a common ailment of every elderly person
which requires continuous medication.
9. The respondents have denied that the receipt of any other medical certificate/document in
respect of the mother of the petitioner. The respondents have admitted that the earlier order of
dismissal was cancelled as there were some shortcomings. The respondents have denied that there is
any provision for personal hearing, while examining the petition preferred against the order of
dismissal. It is also averred by the respondents that during the preparation of record of evidence and
trial by the SSFC, the BSF Act and the Rules framed thereunder were strictly followed. The
petitioner had pleaded not guilty before the SSFC and his trial was conducted as per the rule, where
the delinquent employee pleads „not guilty(cid:128) of the charge. The petitioner did not answer, when the
Court questioned the petitioner in respect of the charge and remained silent but still, the Court in
the interest of justice, SSFC recorded the plea of „not guilty(cid:128) as per the provisions of BSF Rules
142(1) and proceeded ahead with the trial as if the petitioner had pleaded not guilty of charge.
10. The petitioner was also afforded opportunity to produce defence witnesses and thereafter only
the Court arrived at a finding and finally awarded sentence. During the trial, the petitioner was
provided with a friend of the accused, namely, Sh. Bharat Chand AC(T) on the request of the
petitioner. In nutshell, the stand of the respondents is that all the provisions have been followed
during preparation of record of evidence and during the course of trial.
11. Ms. Surinder Kour, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner has vehemently argued
that the respondents had not followed the provisions as contained in the BSF Act and the Rules
made thereunder, while preparing record of offence and during the course of trial by the SSFC. She
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190503851/ 4
P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
laid much stress that unreasoned order has been passed by the SSFC despite the fact that the
petitioner had submitted the medical record in respect of ailment of his mother and had also sent
the telegram as well as the letter demonstrating his willingness to join the Unit on 15.01.2001 but
the respondents dismissed the petitioner initially 11.01.2001 ignoring the fact that though the show
cause notice was dated 02.12.2000 but the same was sent to the petitioner on 20.12.2000 and
received by him on 29.12.2000. Without granting reasonable time, the respondents had dismissed
the petitioner earlier and committed the mistake which the respondents realised later and
subsequently, the order of dismissal was cancelled. She further submitted that the absence of the
petitioner was not wilful but due to circumstances beyond his control.
12. On the contrary, Mr. Vishal Sharma, learned DSGI appearing for the respondents has
vehemently argued that the petitioner is a habitual offender as earlier also he had overstayed the
sanctioned leave number of times. He further stated that so as the present case is concerned,
contradictory reasons were shown by the petitioner for remaining absent. In reply to the show cause
notice, it was stated by the petitioner that his mother was suffering from serious cancer disease
whereas in the medical certificate annexed with the application, it was stated that the mother of the
petitioner was suffering from diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which clearly demonstrates the
falsity of the cause projected by the petitioner for his absence. Mr. Sharma has also produced the
record of SSFC proceedings.
13. Heard and perused the record.
14. This is evident from the record that the petitioner was sanctioned fifteen days(cid:128) leave with effect
from 14.08.2000 to 06.09.2000 and the petitioner did not join at the Battalion Headquarter on the
expiry of above mentioned leave. This is admitted in the reply by the respondents that Show Cause
Notice dated 05.12.2000 could be sent only on 20.12.2000 as there was Post and Telegraph (P&T)
strike. The petitioner though has admitted that he received the notice 29.12.2000, but annexure-"C"
placed on record by the petitioner himself demonstrates that it was received by him on 27.12.2000.
By virtue of notice dated 05.12.2000 (exhibit -R-5) annexed with the record of the respondents, the
petitioner was asked to submit his defence against the proposed action of termination of his service
by way of removal. Simultaneously, it was stated that if no reply was received by 05.01.2001, it shall
be presumed that the petitioner has no defence to put forward against the proposed action. The date
of show cause notice is 05.12.2000 and the petitioner was asked to reply by 05.01.2001 but as
mentioned above, the notice could be sent only on 20.12.2000 and received by the petitioner on
27.12.2000 as admitted by him in his reply dated nil. The respondents have admitted that the
telegram was received from the petitioner on 09.01.2001 and an unsigned letter was received on
12.01.2001 along with the medical certificate issued by Dr. N. K. Chander Babu. Though the
petitioner was dismissed from the service earlier as well vide order dated 11.01.2001 but the same
was cancelled vide order dated 23.10.2001. The order dated 23.10.2001 provided for fresh
disciplinary action after the reinstatement of the petitioner.
15. After the petitioner joined on 12.11.2001, the offence report was prepared under Rule 43 of the
BSF Rules and he was heard on charge by respondent No. 5 on 14.01.2002. After examining three
witnesses and documentary evidence on 14.01.2002, the respondent No. 5 directed the preparation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190503851/ 5
P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
of record of evidence by Sh. C. P. Trivedi, Deputy Commandant. During the hearing of charge, the
petitioner did not opt to cross examine the witnesses as is evident from order dated 14.01.2002. This
Court does not find any violation of Rules 43 and 45 of the BSF Rules. Sh. C. P. Trivedi, Deputy
Commandant thereafter prepared the record of evidence ordered by respondent No. 5 in presence of
the petitioner. During preparation of record of evidence, three witnesses, namely, Sub/Head Clerk
M. N. Shenoy, PW-2 Constable Ashraf Ali and PW-3 Constable, S. M. Bhagat were examined by the
Recording Officer on 15.02.2002 and the petitioner cross examined PW-1 Sh. M. N. Shenoy and
PW-3, Constable S. M. Bhagat but the petitioner did not cross- examine PW-2 Ashraf Ali. The
petitioner in acknowledgment of the recording of the statements of the witness, signed the
statements as well. Thereafter, in compliance of Rule 48(3) of the BSF Rules, the petitioner was
cautioned and after caution, the petitioner made a statement duly signed by him on 16.02.2002.
Thereafter, the petitioner was also granted opportunity to produce the evidence in his defence but
the petitioner declined to produce any witness in defence. The Recording Officer thereafter on
16.02.2002 issued the certificate in compliance to Rule 48(8) of the BSF Rules. This Court finds that
there is no violation of Rule 48 as the record of evidence has been prepared by C. P. Trivedi, Deputy
Commandant in accordance with Rule 48 of the BSF Rules.
16. After the record of evidence was prepared and submitted before the respondent No. 5, the
respondent No. 5 vide order dated 08.06.2002 ordered for trial of the petitioner by Summary
Security Force Court SSFC) on 12.06.2002 and the petitioner was also asked to intimate name of
one person from 123 Bn. BSF to act as a friend of the accused during the trial by 09.06.2002. In
response to order dated 08.06.2002, the petitioner opted Sh. Bharat Chand AC(T) to represent him
during SSFC trial. The proceedings of SSFC were held on 15.06.2002 by Sh. G. S. Sharma,
Commandant, 123 Bn. BSF and Sh. Shakti Singh, AC 123 Bn. BSF and SI (Cipher) C. S. Rawat, 123
Bn. BSF attended the trial. Sh. G. S. Sharma, Commandant 123 Bn. BSF, himself acted as
interpreter. Sh. Bharat Chand AC(T), 123 Bn. BSF acted as a friend of the accused and the trial
commenced at 1900 hours. The petitioner was brought and Sh. G. S. Sharma was duly affirmed and
also affirmed as an interpreter. Sh. Sunil Kumar was affirmed as short hand writer and all the
witnesses were directed to withdraw from the Court and the charge sheet was read over and
explained to the petitioner.
17. The record further depicts that the proceedings in respect of the plea of guilty were conducted
and the record of evidence was read over and explained to the petitioner but the petitioner did not
respond and remained silent and the silence of the petitioner was recorded as „not guilty(cid:128) by the
SSFC in terms of Rule 142(1) of the BSF Rules. After recording the plea of not guilty, statements of
witnesses, three in number were recorded. The petitioner was given an opportunity to
cross-examine the witnesses and like during the record of preparation of evidence, the petitioner
crossed examined only PW-1 Head Clerk M. N. Shenoy and PW-3 S. M. Bhagat during trial also. The
petitioner did not opt to cross-examine PW-2 Ashraf Ali. After the conclusion of the prosecution
evidence, the petitioner was asked as to whether he wanted to call any witness in defence, which the
petitioner declined. However, the petitioner made his statement and stated that because of the
sickness of his mother, he could not join the duty on time. He admitted the receipt of two warning
letters and the show cause notice. He further submitted that he sent a telegram that he shall join the
duty on 16.11.2000. He further stated that his mother was suffering from Breast Cancer and she was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190503851/ 6
P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
operated upon. It is further stated by him that she was also suffering from hypertension therefore,
he produced the certificate. He further wanted to produce the certificate about the disease of the
cancer but he did not have the certificate at that time. He admitted that he had committed a mistake
and sought minimum punishment as he was the only son of his family totally dependent upon him.
After recording the statement of the defence of the petitioner, the SSFC recorded as under:"
"I am of the opinion on the evidence before me that the accused No. 942540866
constable P. K. Sunil of 123 Bn. BSF is guilty of the charge."
18. Thereafter, the SSFC took note of the past conduct of the petitioner and the previous
punishment, decoration or reward and sentenced the petitioner with „dismissal from service(cid:128).
19. It was contended by the petitioner that a non-speaking order has been passed by the SSFC. In
this context, it would be appropriate to note the relevant part of Rule 149 of the BSF Rules, which
read as under:
"149. Finding-(1) The finding on every charge upon which the accused is arraigned
shall be recorded and except as mentioned in these rules shall be recorded simply as
a finding of "Guilty" or of "Not Guilty".
(2)..................
(3)..................
(4)..................
(5).................."
20. A perusal of this Rule would reveal that the finding on every charge is required to be recorded
simply as a finding of guilty or of not guilty. The reasons are not at all required for returning such
finding. In this context, it would be appropriate to take note of the judgment of the Hon(cid:128)ble
Supreme Court in Union of India and another v Dinesh Kumar, 2010(3) SCC 161, wherein it has
been observed as under:
"12. On this backdrop, it is clear that the provisions for the SSFC and the appellate
authority are para materia, more particularly in case of Rule 149 and Section 117(2) of
the Act, with the provisions which were considered in both the above authorities.
Therefore, there cannot be any escape from the conclusion that as held by the
Constitution Bench, the reasons would not be required to be given by the SSFC under
Rule 149 or by the appellate authority under Section 117(2) of the Act. This position is
all the more obtained in case of SSFC, particularly, as the Legislature has chosen not
to amend Rule 149, though it has specifically amended Rule 99 w.e.f. 9.7.2003. It was
pointed out that inspite of this, some other view was taken by the Delhi High Court in
the decision in Nirmal Lakra Vs. Union of India & Ors. [2003 DLT(102) 415].
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190503851/ 7
P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
However, it need not detain us, since Rule 149 did not fall for consideration in that
case. Even otherwise, we would be bound by law declared by the Constitution Bench
in the decision in S.N. Mukherjee Vs. Union of India (cited supra)."
(emphasis added)
21. In view of this, this Court does not find that recording of reasons for returning a finding of guilty,
was at all the requirement of law. Though it was vehemently argued by the learned Senior Counsel
for the petitioner that the petitioner had informed the respondents through telegram as also through
the reply that his mother was ill, but equally true is that in the reply, it was stated by the petitioner
that his mother was suffering from cancer disease whereas in the medical certificate annexed with
the reply to the show cause notice, it was mentioned that she was suffering from diabetes mellitus
and hypertension.
22. During recording of his statement by the SSFC, the petitioner admitted that he wanted to
produce the certificate of disease of cancer but he did not have it. Thus there is nothing on record to
demonstrate that the mother of the petitioner was suffering from cancer. The documents annexed as
Annexure- „H and J(cid:128) were never produced during the course of proceedings before the SSFC and
even the certificate of Doctor annexed as annexure J demonstrates that the mother of the petitioner
was suffering from hypertension.
23. The SSFC has returned a finding after forming an opinion on the basis of evidence that the
petitioner was guilty. This Court, while examining the validity of proceedings conducted by the
SSFC, cannot appreciate the evidence and come to the conclusion other than the one formed by the
SSFC on the similar set of facts.
24. In Union of India and others v P. Gunasekaran, (2015) 2 SCC 610, the Apex Court has explained
the scope of judicial review and interference in disciplinary matters and it has been held as under:
The High Court can only examine as to whether:
"a. the enquiry is held by a competent authority; b. the enquiry is held according to
the procedure prescribed in that behalf;
c. there is violation of the principles of natural justice in conductng the proceedings;
d. the authorities have disabled themselves from reaching a fair conclusion by some
consideration extraneous to be evidence and merits of the case;
e. the authorities have allowed themselves to be influenced by irrelevant or
extraneous considerations; f. the conclusion, on the very face of it, is so wholly
arbitrary and capricious that no reasonable person could ever have arrived at such
conclusion;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190503851/ 8
P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
g. the disciplinary authority had erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence which
influenced the finding; h. the disciplinary authority had erroneously admitted
admissible evidence which influenced the finding; i. the finding of fact is based on no
evidence, Under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India, the High Court shall
not;
(i) Re-appreciate the evidence;
(ii) Interfere with the conclusions in the enquiry, in case the same has been
conducted in accordance with law;
(iii) go into the adequacy of the evidence;
(iv) go into the reliability of the evidence;
(v) interfere, if there be some legal evidence on which findings can be based.
(vi) Correct the error of fact however grave it may appear to be;
(vii) go into the proportionality of punishment unless it shocks its conscience."
25. In its latest pronouncement, in Union of India and others v Subrata Nath, 2022 SCC Online
1617, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India after taking note of its earlier judgments in the case of P.
Gunasekaran(supra) and Union of India v Ex. Constable Ram Karan (2022) 1 SCC 373, has held as
under:
"22. To sum up the legal position, being fact finding authorities, both the Disciplinary
Authority and the Appellate Authority are vested with the exclusive power to examine
the evidence forming part of the inquiry report. On finding the evidence to be
adequate and reliable during the departmental inquiry, the Disciplinary Authority
has the discretion to impose appropriate punishment on the delinquent employee
keeping in mind the gravity of the misconduct. However, in exercise of powers of
judicial review, the High Court or for that matter, the Tribunal cannot ordinarily
reappreciate the evidence to arrive at its own conclusion in respect of the penalty
imposed unless and until the punishment imposed is so disproportionate to the
offence that it would shock the conscience of the High Court/Tribunal or is found to
be flawed for other reasons, as enumerated in P. Gunasekaran (supra). If the
punishment imposed on the delinquent employee is such that shocks the conscience
of the High Court or the Tribunal, then the Disciplinary/Appellate Authority may be
called upon to re-consider the penalty imposed. Only in exceptional circumstances,
which need to be mentioned, should the High Court/Tribunal decide to impose
appropriate punishment by itself, on offering cogent reasons therefor."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190503851/ 9
P. K. Sunil vs Union Of India Through Home on 30 December, 2023
26. This Court also finds that the order dated 02.12.2002 was passed by the respondent No. 2 after
perusing the relevant record of the proceedings and no reasons in fact were required to be furnished
for rejecting the statutory petition of the petitioner in terms of section 177 of the BSF Act.
27. This Court has also examined the proportionality of the punishment vis a vis act of misconduct
of the petitioner and after perusing the record, this Court finds that the punishment awarded to the
petitioner is not shockingly disproportionate to act of misconduct on the part of the petitioner,
which may warrant interference by this court.
28. In view of all what has been said and discussed above, the instant writ petition has no merit and
