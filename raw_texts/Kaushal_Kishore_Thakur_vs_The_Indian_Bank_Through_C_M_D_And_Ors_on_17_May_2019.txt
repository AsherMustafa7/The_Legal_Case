whereby the Respondent-Bank has sanctioned only 67% of full
pension to the petitioner and the request for grant of encashment of

2/21
privileged leave has been declined. Petitioner prays for full
pension and leave encashment and also to allow commutation of
pension and all arrears with due interest.
3. The present case has a chequered history. The
petitioner joined as Probationary Officer in the Respondent- Bank
on 01.06.1977. After discharging his duties sincerely he became
Senior Management Grade Scale-V Officer in the year 2007. In the
year 2009 he became Circle Head of the State of Bihar and
Jharkhand. On charges of irregularities and allegation of
commission, the petitioner was placed under suspension on
19.10.2009
for irregularities relating to the period 12.09.2006 to 13.10.2009, during which period he functioned
as Assistant General Manager/ Branch Manager and Assistant General Manager/ Circle Head, Patna
of the Bank. A charge-sheet through letter dated 02.08.2010 containing altogether 19 charges was
issued for imputations of misconduct and after a departmental proceeding having been conducted,
the punishment of compulsory retirement was passed on 31.10.2011 in terms of Regulation 4(h) of
the Indian Bank Officer Employees' (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations, 1976 (hereinafter referred
to as the Discipline and Appeal Regulations, 1976). The petitioner being aggrieved moved in appeal
before the appellate authority, which was rejected vide Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt.
17-05-2019 order dated 26.03.2012. Against the said rejection order the petitioner moved this Court
in CWJC No. 4148 of 2013, which was decided on 20.01.2014. After quashing of the order of the
appellate authority, the matter was remanded back to the appellate authority to decide the issue
after taking into consideration certain aspects which were not considered by the appellate authority.
However, in the said order passed by this Court no infirmity was found in the disciplinary
proceeding so conducted.
4. It has been informed by the petitioner that again the appellate authority has rejected his appeal
on 02.06.2014, which has again been challenged in CWJC No. 12365 of 2014, which is still pending
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197983695/ 2
Kaushal Kishore Thakur vs The Indian Bank Through C. M. D. And Ors on 17 May, 2019
adjudication before this Court. However, after the order of compulsory retirement when retiral dues
were not paid the petitioner moved this Court in CWJC No. 15264 of 2015 for payment of his retiral
dues. During pendency of the writ application all other dues were paid except leave encashment and
forfeiture of 1/3rd of his pension by the Bank under Regulation 33 of the Indian Bank (Employees)
Pension Regulations, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the Pension Regulations, 1995). This Court
after a detailed consideration under order dated 02.02.2016 held that leave encashment could not
be forfeited and the power of the Bank to withhold 1/3rd pension of a delinquent cannot be Patna
High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 doubted or curtailed but visiting a person with
civil consequences has to be in accordance with law i.e. the loss has to be quantified and provided to
the delinquent along with memo of charges so as to give him an effective and meaningful
opportunity of hearing. Hence, forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension was struck down and the petitioner
was found entitled to full pension and leave encashment. Against the said order the Bank moved in
appeal being LPA No. 580 of 2016 and the Division Bench by order dated 28.10.2016 dismissed the
appeal. The Bank then moved the Apex Court in SLA (C) No. 620 of 2017 and the Apex Court by
order dated 27.02.2017 remanded the matter for a fresh hearing observing that all the contentions
of the petitioner would be duly considered by the Bank. After remand, order of forfeiting 1/3rd of
the pension and withholding leave encashment was passed by the Executive Director of the Bank
dated 24.05.2017, which is under challenge in the present writ application. However, the petitioner
does not pray for payment of leave encashment as the claim has now been acceded to by the Bank
and leave encashment has been deposited in the account of the petitioner on 21.01.2019 during
pendency of the present application but without interest. Hence, interest on leave encashment is
also claimed by the petitioner. Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that for the unusual and deliberate delay of 8 years as
per Regulation 46 of the Pension Regulations 1995 and in view of the settled law in the case of S.K.
Dua Vs. State of Haryana and others since reported in (2008) 3 SCC 44 and in the case of Alok
Shankar Pandey Vs. Union of India and others since reported in (2007) 3 SCC 545 stating therein
that the petitioner is entitled to interest on such unusual delay of 8 years and interest is not a
penalty or punishment but is a normal accretion on capital.
6. He further submits that the order of punishment of compulsory retirement for certain
irregularities and allegations of commission was passed under Regulation 4(h) of the Regulations,
1976 which deals with disciplinary action against its employees and the punishment order of
forfeiting 1/3rd of the pension has been passed under Regulation 33 of the Pension Regulations
1995 which deals with pension of the employees of the Bank and are two distinct and separate
Regulations. He submits that even after remand from the Apex Court the impugned order of
forfeiting 1/3rd of the pension of the petitioner under Regulation 33(1) by way of penalty is
unfounded in law as after remand although the petitioner was given a personal hearing on
20.04.2017 as contained in Annexure 8 series wherein in none of the queries the Patna High Court
CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 amount of loss has been quantified and the reply given by the
petitioner in the personal hearing was that in all the said accounts either those accounts were closed
or there was sufficient landed property by way of equitable mortgage. In the impugned order there is
a reference of financial loss of Rs. 4.39 crores in the account of Krishna Fabicons Pvt. Ltd. and a
probable loss of Rs. 14.36 crores due to non-adherence of rules and regulations and lapses by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197983695/ 3
Kaushal Kishore Thakur vs The Indian Bank Through C. M. D. And Ors on 17 May, 2019
petitioner. He submits that the order of forfeiture of 1/3rd of the pension of the petitioner is a
reiterance of the earlier order as the forfeiture is by way of penalty and visiting a person with civil
consequences has to be in accordance with law either explicit or implied. The loss of Rs. 4.39 crores,
which is stated to be crystallized in the impugned order, was not made available, no documents with
regard to the same was supplied to the petitioner at the time of personal hearing after remand from
the Apex Court for arriving at a conclusion of a quantified loss. The details/ materials regarding the
same ought to have been provided to the petitioner along with memo of charges so as to give him an
effective and meaningful opportunity of hearing. The forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension amount is
erroneous and against the law as no show cause notice has been issued nor any reply was asked and
on allegation of misconduct and non-observance of Bank's guidelines, Patna High Court CWJC
No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 rules and regulations, the petitioner had already been inflicted with
the punishment of compulsory retirement under the disciplinary regulations of the Bank. A further
punishment by way of penalty of forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension without any show cause and in the
garb of personal hearing without any imputation of the said charge on the basis of which such
forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension has been done is not sustainable as the Bank has reiterated the same
and similar order of forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension passed earlier before remand from the Apex Court
without any memo of charge and without any opportunity of hearing as to how the Bank had
suffered a financial loss of Rs. 4.39 crores. He submits that Regulation 33 although being a
discretionary clause, cannot be invoked arbitrarily but has to be exercised judiciously and relies on
the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Mangi Lal Vs. State of M.P. since reported in (2004) 2
SCC 447, paragraph 10 whereof is extracted hereinbelow :
"10. Even if a statute is silent and there are no positive words in the Act or the Rules
made thereunder, there could be nothing wrong in spelling out the need to hear the
parties whose rights and interest are likely to be affected by the orders that may be
passed, and making it a requirement to follow a fair procedure before taking a
decision, unless the statute provides otherwise. The principles of natural justice must
be read into unoccupied interstices of Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt.
17-05-2019 the statute, unless there is a clear mandate to the contrary. No form or
procedure should ever be permitted to exclude the presentation of a litigant's defence
or stand. Even in the absence of a provision in procedural laws, power inheres in
every tribunal/court of a judicial or quasi- judicial character, to adopt modalities
necessary to achieve requirements of natural justice and fair play to ensure better and
proper discharge of their duties. Procedure is mainly grounded on the principles of
natural justice irrespective of the extent of its application by express provision in that
regard in a given situation. It has always been a cherished principle. Where the
statute is silent about the observance of the principles of natural justice, such
statutory silence is taken to imply compliance with the principles of natural justice
where substantial rights of parties are considerably affected. The application of
natural justice becomes presumptive, unless found excluded by express words of
statute or necessary intendment. (See Swadeshi Cotton Mills v. Union of India) Its
aim is to secure justice or to prevent miscarriage of justice. Principles of natural
justice do not supplant the law, but supplement it. These rules operate only in areas
not covered by any law validly made. They are a means to an end and not an end in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197983695/ 4
Kaushal Kishore Thakur vs The Indian Bank Through C. M. D. And Ors on 17 May, 2019
themselves. The principles of natural justice have many facets. Two of them are:
notice of the case to be met, and opportunity to explain."
Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019
7. He submits that a penalty has been imposed on the petitioner under Regulation 33 by withholding
of 1/3rd of pension. The discretionary power ought not to have been exercised arbitrarily but
judiciously and fair play requires an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner in view of the judgment
in the case of A.N. Puniwala Vs. Bank of India and others since reported in 2007 SCC Online Gujarat
367, Paragraphs 8 and 9 which are as follows :
"8. At the outset it is required to be noted that disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the
respective petitioners under the provisions of the Bank of India Officers Employees' (Discipline and
Appeal) Regulation, 1976. The order of penalty of compulsory retirement from the bank's services
was imposed upon the respective petitioners as provided under Regulation 4(f) of the Discipline and
Appeal Rules. The order of compulsory retirement has not been challenged by any of the petitioners.
Considering Regulation 33 of the Bank of India (Employees') Pension Regulation, 1995, the
respondents have passed an order and/or have taken the action of withholding of 25% of the
pension. It is required to be noted at this stage that penalty of compulsory retirement is imposed
under the Discipline and Appeal Rules while action of withholding of 25% of the pension is taken
under the provisions of the Pension Regulation; 1995.
Thus, both the actions i.e. imposing the penalty of compulsory retirement and Patna High Court
CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 withholdng of 25% of the pension are under different Rules
and Regulations. One is under Discipline and Appeal Rules and another is under Pension
Regulations, 1995. Under the circumstances, the contention of the learned advocate appearing for
the respondent bank that the action of the respondent bank in withholding of 25% of the pension is
part of discipline proceedings and is not severable and while imposing the penalty of compulsory
retirement at every stage, opportunity has been afforded and therefore no further opportunity is
required to be given while withholding 25% of the pension cannot be accepted. At this stage, some of
the averments in the affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of the respondent bank are also required to be
considered. In paragraph 14 of the affidavit- in-reply, it is submitted that "respondents state that
disciplinary proceedings were initiated under the provisions of Bank of India Officer Employees'
(Discipline and Appeal) Regulations and disciplinary action proceeding under the provisions of the
said regulations has no reason/point whatsoever to refer in any manner whatsoever in respect of
payment of pension as competent authority to sanction pension and payment of pension is different
under the Bank of India (Employees') Pension Regulations, 1995.
Even dealing with the contention on behalf of the petitioners that the appellate authority before
whom the order of compulsory retirement was challenged has also opined and/or observed that the
petitioners be paid full pension, it is submitted by the respondents in affidavit-in-reply that it is not
incumbent upon the competent authority under the Pension Rules to accept anyone or all Patna
High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 recommendations made by the appellate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197983695/ 5
Kaushal Kishore Thakur vs The Indian Bank Through C. M. D. And Ors on 17 May, 2019
authority. Thus, even according to the respondents in affidavit-in-reply, the competent authority
under the Pension Rules is different than the disciplinary authority and the appellate authority. Now
so far as the contention on behalf of the respondents that as under Regulation 33 of the Pension
Regulations, notice and/or hearing is not provided and therefore, opportunity, of hearing is not
required to be given is concerned, it is required to be noted that Regulation 33 of the Pension Rules
provides that an employee compulsorily retired from service as a penalty may be granted pension at
a rate not less than two thirds and not more than full pension admissible to him on the date of his
compulsory retirement, even otherwise, they were entitled to such pension on superannuation on
that date. The Regulation 33 reads as under:--
"33. Compulsory Retirement Pension.
(1) An employee compulsorily retired from service as a penalty on or after 1st day of
November, 1993 in terms of Discipline and Appeal Regulations or settlement by the
authority higher than the authority competent to impose such penalty may be
granted pension at a rate not less than two thirds and not more than full pension
admissible to him on the date of his compulsory retirement if otherwise he was
entitled to such pension or superannuation on that date.
(2) Whenever in the case of a bank employee the Competent Authority passes an
order (whether original, appellate or in exercise of power of review) awarding a
pension less than the full Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019
compensation pension admissible under these regulations, the Board of Directors
shall be consulted before such-order is passed. (3) A pension granted or awarded
under sub-
regulation (1) or as the case may be, under sub- regulation (2), shall not be less than the amount of
rupees three hundred and seventy five per mensem."
9. Now, considering Regulation 33, it gives authority to the competent authority to withhold pension
upto 25% and thus, discretion is vested with the authority to pay pension at a rate not less than two
thirds and not more than full pension meaning thereby, the authority can withhold the pension upto
25%. Thus, in an appropriate case, the authority can withhold pension upto 5%, in an appropriate
case upto 10%, in an appropriate case upto 20% and maximum upto 25%. When the discretion is
given to the authority, in that case: if the opportunity of being heard is given to the concerned
employee, in that case, the concerned employee can satisfy the authority that in a given case order of
withholding of the pension of 25% is not warranted and that only 5% of the pension may be withheld
and/or less than 25% of the pension may be withheld.
There is another reason also why in such a situation hearing is required to be given. When the
discretion is given see that such discretion is not exercised arbitrarily and is exercised judiciously,
the fair play requires that an opportunity of hearing is required to be given.

8. He submits that the mode and manner of deduction/ forfeiture of pension of a compulsorily
retired employee has to be specifically mentioned about actual loss suffered, a show cause Patna
High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 notice ought to have been issued with particulars
of that loss in order to enable the delinquent to meet the same as held in the case of UCO Bank and
Ors. Vs. Anju Mathur since reported in 2013 SCC Online P&H 5014, paragraph 22 and 23, extracts
of which is reproduced hereinbelow :
"22. After considering these arguments, we find that argument of the learned counsel
for the respondent has to prevail. We have gone through charge-sheet as well as
enquiry report. No doubt, in the charge-sheet as many as 24 accounts are mentioned
where the respondent had given loans or other financial accommodation either
beyond her powers or without obtaining proper securities. That would show that
certain accounts were overdrawn. Even the operation of these accounts was not
satisfactory. However, whether the appellant-Bank ultimately suffered loss and what
was the actual loss is not reflected. No doubt, the irregularities committed by the
respondent may have exposed the Bank to such losses. However, that is entirely
different from loss having been actually suffered by the bank. Even if some accounts
became bad and the Bank had to file suits for recovery concerning those accounts
against the defaulting parties, that would not automatically lead to the conclusion
that the loss/damage has been suffered. It is possible that Bank is able to recover full
money in those proceedings. Whether that happened in fact or not and whether loss
is actually suffered or not is not discernible from either the charge-sheet or the
enquiry report.
Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019
23. It is for this reason that it was incumbent upon the appellant-Bank to mention
specifically about the actual loss having been suffered, if it suffered, in the show cause
notice itself with particulars of that loss in order to enable the respondent to meet the
same. That has not been done even in the final order. Though the figure of Rs. 4
crores is given, in the final order, even that is not substantiated by giving particulars
thereof. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the show cause notice or the final
orders passed, forfeiting the gratuity, do not meet the legal requirements and have to
be set aside."
9. Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank, however,
submits that as per Clause 3 of the Indian Bank Officer Employees Conduct Regulations, 1976 the
officer/ employee of the Bank must maintain devotion of duty and in performance of his duty he
must maintain absolute integrity and his conduct must not be one which is unbecoming of an
officer/ employee. Due to serious omissions and commissions committed by the petitioner for the
period 12.09.2006 to 13.10.2009, charge-sheet was submitted and as many as 19 charges were
levelled against the petitioner. Hence, a major penalty of compulsory retirement was imposed under
Rule 4(h) of the Discipline and Appeal Regulations 1976. He further submits that in the earlier
round of litigation in CWJC No. 4148 of 2013 this Court did not find any infirmity in the disciplinary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197983695/ 7
Kaushal Kishore Thakur vs The Indian Bank Through C. M. D. And Ors on 17 May, 2019
Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 proceeding. Since on remand from the Apex
Court the Executive Director of the Bank vide its order dated 24.05.2017 has quantified the probable
loss of Rs. 14.36 crores and Rs. 4.39 crores had already crystallized, which is a serious misconduct
on the part of the petitioner, hence, 67% of full pension admissible to him was sanctioned. He
submits that Pension Regulations, 1995 does not postulate that every employee is entitled to
pensionary benefit. Chapter II of the Pension Regulations, 1995 provides application and eligibility
and Chapter IV deals with qualifying service and an employee who has rendered a minimum of 10
years of service and fulfills other conditions only can qualify for pension in terms of Regulation 14 of
the Pension Regulations, 1995. He submits that as per Regulation 33 if an employee has
compulsorily retired from service as a penalty, the expression 'if otherwise' has overriding effect and
since the petitioner was made to compulsorily retire by way of penalty on account of his omissions
and commissions and the loss having been crystallized at Rs. 4.39 crores the petitioner is not
entitled to full pension. It is submitted that if an employee, who has been compulsorily retired by
way of penalty, would be given a blanket 100% pension then Regulation 33 of Pension Regulations,
1995 would become redundant. He further submits that under the said Regulation 33 no notice
about quantified loss Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 prior to deduction of
pension is required to be given to the delinquent/ petitioner as provision of pension regulation is
silent on notice. In this connection, he relies in the case of Chairman- cum-Managing Director, UCO
Bank Vs. P.C. Kakkar since reported in (2003) 4 SCC 364, in the case of Disciplinary
Authority-cum-Regional Manager Vs. Nikunj Bihari Patnayak since reported in (1996) 9 SCC 61, in
the case of State Bank of India Vs. Bela Bagchi since reported in (2005) 7 SCC 435 and in the case of
Baliram Prasad Singh Vs. G.M. (H.R.), Bank of India since reported in 2019(1) PLJR 331 that the
Bank employees are required to exercise higher standard of honesty and integrity and when the
delinquent employee acted without authority forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension under Regulation 33 of
the Pension Regulations, 1995 is just and proper.
10. Heard the parties. The issue at hand is whether in pursuance to the order of compulsory
retirement passed against the petitioner by way of penalty, 1/3rd of pension can be forfeited without
a notice regarding charges of quantified loss and without opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.
After remand by the Apex Court for a fresh hearing, the petitioner was given a personal hearing by
the competent authority on 20.04.2017, which is Annexure-8 series to the writ application. The
personal hearing Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 was by way of
questionnaire wherein the questions asked was; to make submissions on the aspects of pension and
leave encashment; some accounts financed in which the petitioner was charge-sheeted were NPA
and suits filed, whether extant guidelines were followed or not; what was the recovery in the
accounts. To which the petitioner replied that most of the accounts were already recovered and
closed or were backed by sufficient landed property by way of equitable mortgage. No notice with
regard to probable loss on Rs. 14.36 crores or crystallized loss of Rs. 4.39 crores was ever made
known to the petitioner. No show cause was issued with particulars of that loss in order to enable
the petitioner to meet the same. It is worthwhile to mention that an order of compulsory retirement
was passed under Discipline and Appeal Regulations, 1976, which is not the subject-matter in the
present writ application. Forfeiture of 1/3rd of the pension and leave encashment under the Pension
Regulation, 1995 by way of penalty after remand is merely a reiterance of the earlier order as the
forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension and leave encashment is by way of penalty and visiting a person with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197983695/ 8
Kaushal Kishore Thakur vs The Indian Bank Through C. M. D. And Ors on 17 May, 2019
civil consequences has to be in accordance with law. No memo of charges of either the probable loss
of Rs. 14.36 crores or the quantified loss of Rs. 4.39 crores was ever served on the petitioner so that
he could rebut those Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 charges and as held in
the case of A.N. Puniwala (supra) the petitioner was not even given an opportunity of hearing as to
whether the quantified loss forfeiting 1/3rd of the pension is justified as Regulation 33 of the
Pension Regulation, 1995 speaks of imposition of penalty of compulsory retirement which could not
be less than 2/3rd and not more than full pension i.e. there was a variable between 1/3rd of pension
to full pension and not a blanket order of forfeiture of 1/3rd of pension. Such opportunity for
rebuttal and the loss sustained by the Bank was not given to the petitioner. Although, the discretion
is given to the Bank but such discretion is not to be exercised arbitrarily but judiciously and fair play
requires that an opportunity of hearing was required to be given to the petitioner of the loss
sustained by the Bank due to certain acts of omission and commission by the petitioner. The same
view has been held in the case of Anju Mathur (supra) wherein it has been held that actual loss and
the ultimate loss suffered by the Bank has not been reflected for the irregularities committed by the
petitioner. The penalty of compulsory retirement under Discipline and Appeal Regulations, 1976
had already been passed. Even if some accounts turned bad/ NPA and Bank has to file suits for
recovery concerning those accounts against the defaulting parties that would not automatically lead
to the Patna High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 conclusion that loss/ damage has
been suffered. It is possible that the Bank is able to recover full money in those proceedings. Neither
the departmental proceeding conducted against the petitioner quantified any loss nor while
forfeiting 1/3rd of the pension and leave encashment any charge quantifying the loss in a particular
account was served on the petitioner so that he could rebut the charges.
11. It is relevant to mention here that during personal hearing by the competent authority on
20.04.2017 the petitioner had specifically submitted that almost all account have been closed and
further remaining accounts sufficient landed property by way of equitable mortgage/ FDs were
present. Thereafter without quantifying the loss by way of show cause or an opportunity of hearing
or memo of charges having been served on the petitioner, the impugned order of forfeiting 1/3rd of
the pension and leave encashment has been passed, although, during pendency of the writ
application leave encashment has been sanctioned and deposited in the account of the petitioner on
21.01.2019. The contention of the counsel for the Bank that under Regulation 33 of the Pension
Regulations, 1995, no notice about quantified loss prior to deduction of pension is required to be
given to the delinquent as provision of Pension Regulation is silent on notice, Patna High Court
CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 in view of the judgment in the case of Mangi Lal (supra) it has
been held that the principles of natural justice irrespective of express provision in that regard in a
given situation, such statutory silence is taken to imply compliance with the principles of natural
justice where substantial rights of the parties are considerable affected. Its aim is to secure justice or
to prevent miscarriage of justice. Principles of natural justice do not supplant the law, but
supplement it. These rules operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made. They are a
means to an end and not an end in themselves. These two cardinal principles of natural justice is
notice of the charges to be met, and opportunity to explain. Unfortunately, compliance of both these
facets are found absent before passing the impugned order dated 24.05.2017.

12. So far as the contention of the petitioner for interest on leave encashment, that the order of
compulsory retirement, which has been passed on 31.10.2011 and upheld by the appellate authority
on 26.03.2012, which was again rejected on appeal by the appellate authority on remand by this
Court on 02.06.2014 and the petitioner is ventilating his grievance for leave encashment for the last
eight years after the order of compulsory retirement, which was ultimately paid on 21.01.2019
during pendency of the present writ application, the petitioner is entitled to interest on leave Patna
High Court CWJC No.869 of 2018 dt. 17-05-2019 encashment, in my opinion, since there is no
specific rule providing for interest on leave encashment and on certain charges of omission and
commission the petitioner was compulsorily retired from service and all through the Bank was
pursuing the matter right up to the Apex Court. Hence, in the facts and circumstances, the petitioner
is not entitled to interest on leave encashment. However, the impugned order dated 24.05.2017,
passed by Respondent No. 2, as contained in Annexure-9 sanctioning only 67% of full pension to the
petitioner is quashed as the same has been passed without adhering to the principles of natural
justice, no memo of charges have been served quantifying the loss to the petitioner nor an
opportunity of hearing has been given to the petitioner.
13. Accordingly, in view of the discussions made hereinabove, this writ application is allowed to the
extent that the petitioner is entitled to full pension and also commuted value of pension, which
would be paid to the petitioner along with arrears within a period of six weeks from the date of
receipt/ production of a copy of this order by the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3.
14. No order as to costs.
