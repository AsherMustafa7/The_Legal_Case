Md. Imtyaj @ Md. Sonu @ Md. Imteyaz @ Sonu ... vs The State Of Bihar on 16 March, 2016
instituted under Sections 25(1-AA)/25(1-B)(a)/25 Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.15472 of 2015
dt.16-03-2016 (1-C)/26(1)(2) (3)/35 of The Arms Act, 1959 and 17/20 of The Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act, 1967.
This is the second attempt by the petitioners for bail in the aforesaid case as earlier such prayer was
rejected by order dated 24.09.2014 passed in Cr. Misc. No. 30782 of 2014. However, the Court
below was directed to expedite the trial and conclude the same within six months. The same not
having been done, the present application has been preferred by the petitioners renewing their
prayer for bail.
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the intervening circumstances after such rejection
is that seven prosecution witnesses have been examined but none have named the petitioners and
after 01.05.2015 there has been no progress in the trial till date. He submits that petitioner no. 2 is
old and only because of the fact that guilt may be there of his son, he has been implicated solely
because he was also living with him.
Learned A.P.P. submits that the Court having once rejected the prayer on merit and seven
prosecution witnesses having been examined, the remaining four may be directed to be examined
and the trial finally concluded.
The Court had earlier called for a report from the Court below as to the reason why the order dated
24.09.2014 passed in Cr. Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.15472 of 2015 dt.16-03-2016 Misc. No.
30782 of 2014 had not been complied with. Pursuant to the same, the Court below has submitted a
report dated 12.01.2016 in which it has been stated that upon transfer of the previous Presiding
Judge, the case was transferred in his Court and put up before him on 08.01.2016 and the next date
was fixed for 06.02.2016 for evidence.
Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for
the parties, the Court finds no ground to take a fresh view.
Accordingly, the prayer for bail stands rejected. However, the Court below is directed to ensure that
the trial is concluded latest by 30th June, 2016 and compliance report submitted to the Court.
The Superintendent of Police, Munger is also directed to ensure that the remaining prosecution
witnesses are produced before the Trial Court without delay.
Learned Sessions Judge, Munger is directed to ensure that the case is allotted to a Court which is not
vacant and it proceeds in order to ensure that the trial itself is concluded by the time fixed by the
Court.
Registry shall communicate the order to the learned Sessions Judge, Munger and the concerned
Trial Court as well as Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.15472 of 2015 dt.16-03-2016 the
Superintendent of Police, Munger through Fax also latest by tomorrow.
