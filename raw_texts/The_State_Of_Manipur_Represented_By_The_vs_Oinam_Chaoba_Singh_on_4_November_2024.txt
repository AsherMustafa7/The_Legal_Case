JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
Justice Siddharth Mridul, C J:
[1] The present writ appeal has been instituted on behalf of the State of Manipur
represented by the Commissioner (MAHUD) assailing the correctness of the
impugned judgment and order dated 05.09.2022 rendered by the learned single
Judge in W.P. (C) No. 253 of 2021 [Oinam Chaoba Singh and others Vs. State of
Manipur and others]; whereby it was directed as follows:
"(1) The writ petition is allowed.
(2) Paragraph (i) of the impugned order dated 7.11.2017, particularly, the word "with
effect from 1.4.2017" is quashed W.A. No. 30 of 2024 Page 2 (3) The respondents are
directed to make cash payment and arrears, if any to the petitioners with effect from
1.1.2010 as prescribed under the Manipur Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2010. (4) The
said exercise is directed to be completed within a period of four weeks from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order [2] The brief facts as are necessary for the
determination of the present writ appeal are elaborated herein below:
(i) The respondents herein; the original writ petitioners; are serving officers of
different Municipal Councils in the State of Manipur and asseverate that their service
conditions and salary are governed by the Rules adopted by the State Government for
the employees of the Municipal Corporations from time to time, which includes pay
revision Rules issued from time to time.
(ii) The respondents relying on the provision of Section 46 of the Municipality Act,
1994, instituted the subject writ petition seeking a writ of certiorari to quash
paragraph No. (i) of the order issued by the Governor of Manipur, dated 07.11.2017 in
relation to grant of revised pay structure under the Manipur Services (Revised Pay)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95029365/ 2
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Oinam Chaoba Singh on 4 November, 2024
Rules, 2010, in respect of the employees and pensioners of all the 27 (twenty seven)
Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) of Manipur.
(iii) The writ petitioners further sought a direction to the official respondents to pay
revised salary to the respondents by W.A. No. 30 of 2024 Page 3 calculating revised
pay in cash with effect from 01.01.2010, as prescribed by the said Rules.
[3] In order to appreciate the issue that arises for consideration in this proceeding , it would be
appropriate to extract the provision of Section 46 of the Manipur Municipality Act, 1994, which
reads as follows:
"46. Disciplinary action against employees of Nagar Panchayat and Council and
condition of their service, etc. - (1) An employee of a Nagar panchayat or a Council
who is aggrieved by an order of the Chairperson in a disciplinary proceeding against
him shall have right to appea to the Nagar Panchayat or the Council within thirty
days from the date of service of such order on him.
(2) An employee who is aggrieved by an order of the Nagar Panchayat or the Council
may prefer an appeal to the State Government against such an order within sixty days
from the date of service of such order. Provided that no appeal against an order other
than an order for removal or dismissal shall lie to the State Government.
(3) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the disciplinary action, conditions of the
service and qualification in respect of the employees of a Nagar Panchayat or a
Council shall be the same as applicable to the employees of the State Government,
from time to time."
[4] A perusal of the provision of Sub-section (3) of Section 46 of the Manipur Municipality Act,
1994, extracted hereinabove would clearly and unequivocally stipulate that subject to other
provisions of the said Act, inter alia conditions of services in respect of the employees of a Nagar
Panchayat or a Council; as the original writ petitioners admittedly are; were to be the same as
applicable to the employees of the State Government, from time to time. [5] In this behalf, there is
no quarrel with the position that employees of the State Government as well as other employees of
the different Municipal Councils serving as Executive Officers are the beneficiaries of revision of
their pay scales with effect from 1st January, 2006.
W.A. No. 30 of 2024 Page 4
[6] In this behalf, it would also be apposite to observe that Gauhati High
Court, Imphal Bench, vide its order dated 19.05.2009, allowed a writ petition filed by one Mani
Singh and six others, serving as Executive Officers of different Municipal Councils of the State of
Manipur, directing therein that the effective date of revision of pay scale of the petitioners therein as
Executive Officers, will be the same; i.e., w.e.f. 01.01.1996; as applicable to all the other employees of
different Municipal Councils and also the employees of the Government of Manipur.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Oinam Chaoba Singh on 4 November, 2024
This order was challenged by way of SLP before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the said SLP
instituted on behalf of the State of Manipur was dismissed. [7] The learned Single Judge having
heard the opposing stand taken by the parties, agreed with the original writ petitioners, inasmuch
as, that the latter were similarly situated as the Executive Officers of different Municipal Councils of
the State of Manipur and also the employees of the Government of Manipur; and were consequently
entitled to revision of pay scale under ROP 2010 with effect from 01.01.2006 with cash payment
from 01.04.2010.
[8] The writ petition was accordingly allowed issuing directions as extracted (supra).
[9] The State of Manipur has assailed the correctness of the impugned judgment and order
primarily on the assertion that the Executive Officers of the Municipal Council are of different cadre
and belong to Manipur Municipal Services (MMAS), duly recruited through MPSC.
[10] We find ourselves completely unable to accept the above contention for the reason that Section
46 of the said Act, in clear and unequivocal terms, W.A. No. 30 of 2024 Page 5 stipulates that
conditions of service in respect of employees of a Municipal Council shall be the same as applicable
to the employees of the State Government from time to time. In other words, the said provision
precludes the State Government from discriminating between one set of employees of the Municipal
Corporation from another set of employees of the same Corporation on the basis of their belonging
to different cadres.
[11] Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Manipur,
would then invite our attention to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Amarjeet Singh and
others vs. Devi Ratan and others, reported as (2010) 1 SCC 417 and in particular para 28 of the
report, to urge that since the original petitioners had not challenged the office Memorandum dated
07.07.2010 as well as the ROP dated 05.05.2010 not been challenged, they were disentitled from
challenging the consequential order dated 07.11.2017 impugned in the said writ petition.
[12] In our considered view, the submission made on behalf of the appellants cannot be accepted
since the facts and circumstances of the decision in Amarjeet Singh (Supra) were entirely different
and dealt with seniority premised on two different DPCs conducted under different Rules on
different criterion, where it was held that seniority which is consequential to the promotion could
not be challenged without challenging the promotion.
[13] The ratio has no application to the facts and circumstances of the present case inasmuch as the
present respondents are admittedly employees of the same Municipal Corporation and cannot be
artificially separated into distinct categories as has been done.
W.A. No. 30 of 2024 Page 6
[14] It is also incumbent upon us to observe that the Office Memorandum
dated 07.07.2010 as well as the ROP dated 05.05.2010 pressed into service by the State of Manipur
are merely executive instructions and there can be no quarrel with the legal position that an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95029365/ 4
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Oinam Chaoba Singh on 4 November, 2024
executive fiat cannot override express provisions of the Act.
[15] In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the view that the present appeal is devoid of merit
and the same is accordingly dismissed.
