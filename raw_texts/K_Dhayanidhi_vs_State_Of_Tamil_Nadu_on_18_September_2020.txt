(1)On the consent given by either side, the main writ petition was taken up for final hearing.

The decree was passed in favour of the petitioner and four others and the petitioner became the

http://www.judis.nic.in (4)Heard Mr.B.Nagarajan, learned counsel for the petitioner and
Mr.T.M.Pappiah, learned Special Government Pleader accepting notice on behalf of the
respondents.
(5)The issue involved in the present writ petition is squarely covered by the Division Bench
Judgment in S.Sarvothaman V. The Sub Registrar at Oulgaret, Pondicherry in WA.No.336 of 2019
dated 07.02.2019. The relevant portions in the judgment are extracted hereunder:-
''13. As pointed out by us earlier, we need to first address the legal issue, which arises
for consideration as to whether at all the law of limitation as prescribed under
Section 23 of the Act would apply to a court decree.
14. This question is no longer res integra and this Court has consistently held that the
law of limitation will not apply when a court decree is presented for registration.
Earliest of the decisions, which has been followed consistently by a Division Bench of
this Court is in the case of A.K. Gnanasankar Vs Joint Sub Registrar, Cuddalore
[reported in 2007 (2) TCJ 68].
In the said decision, this Court held that the limitation http://www.judis.nic.in prescribed for
presenting a document does not apply to a decree, as it is a permanent record of the court and to
register the same, no limitation is prescribed.
15. This decision was followed by one of us (TSSJ) in W.P.No.9352 of 2015 dated 31.3.2015
[B.Vijayan Vs. District Registrar & another]. Subsequently, a similar view had been taken by this
Court in W.P.No.8247 of 2016 dated 07.3.2016 [G.Mudiyarasan & another Vs. Inspector General of
Registration], which once again relied upon the decision in the case of A.K.Gnanasankar. Further, in
the case of Arun Kumar Vs. Inspector General of Registration [W.P.No.16569 of 2016 dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107967723/ 2
K.Dhayanidhi vs State Of Tamil Nadu on 18 September, 2020
06.6.2016], this Court directed registration of a judgment and decree passed by the Principal
District Munsif Court, Salem by condoning the delay on an application filed by the person
presenting the document and in that decision, this Court referred to the decision in the case of
Rasammal Vs. Pauline Edwin & others [reported in 2011 (2) MLJ 57] wherein the Court considered
the scope of Section 25 of the Act.
16.Again, in the case of P.A.Duraisamy Vs. Registrar, Registration Department, Coimbatore &
another [W.P.No.2824 of 2013 dated 26.10.2016], an http://www.judis.nic.in identical view had
been taken following the decision in the case of A.K.Gnanasankar. A similar view was taken in the
case of Lakshmi Vs. Sub Registrar, Valapady, Salem District [reported in 2017 (1) LW 721] wherein
it was pointed out that the Proviso to Section 23 of the Act states that a copy of the decree may be
presented within four months from the date, on which, the decree or order was made or where it is
appealable,within four months from the day, on which, it becomes final, that the limitation
prescribed under Section 23 of the Act should be read with in consonance with Section 25 of the Act
and that since they were only directory in nature, the check slip issued by the respondent therein
was held to be bad in law.
17. In the case of A1362 Meenakshi Cooperative Building Society Ltd. Vs. District Registrar & Others
[WP (MD) No.5108 of 2018 dated 12.4.2018], this Court followed the decision in the case of A.K.
Gnanasankar and directed registration of the court decree. In yet another decision in the case of
Dr.Sulochana Vs. Inspector General of Registration [reported in 2017 (2) CWC 489], this Court held
that registration is only a part of procedural law and that though the Statute is fiscal, the doctrine of
purposive http://www.judis.nic.in and reasonable interpretation has application. This Court took
note of the decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of Anjinamma Vs. Puttahariyappa
[reported in AIR 2003 Karnataka 24].
18. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shreenath Vs. Rajesh [reported in 1998 (4) SCC 543],
held that in interpreting any procedural law, when more than one interpretation is possible, the one,
which curtails the procedure without eluding justice, is to be adopted, that the procedural law is
always subservient to and is in aid of justice and that any interpretation, which eludes or frustrates
the recipient of justice, is not to be followed.
19.A Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Padala Satyanarayana Murthy Vs.
Padala Gangamma [reported in AIR 1959 AP 626] answered a reference as to whether Section 77 of
the Indian Registration Act bars a suit on the basis of an unregistered Will, when the Sub Registrar
refused to admit it for registration. It was held that Section 17 of the Act enumerates the documents,
which require registration and the effect of failure to observe it is stated in Section 47 and that under
Section 18(c) of the Act, the registration of a Will is purely optional and http://www.judis.nic.in that
being so, the Full Bench expressed that they did not think that the consequences contemplated by
Section 49 would flow from not having recourse to Section 77 of the Act. It was further held that a
party cannot be compelled to get document registered if such an obligation is not cast by the
provisions of the Registration Act, that the necessity for registration arises only in regard to
document set out in Section 17, that no penalty can attach to the omission to get a document
registered when it is excepted by Section 17 and that therefore, the Full Bench felt that Section 77
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107967723/ 3
K.Dhayanidhi vs State Of Tamil Nadu on 18 September, 2020
can have relation only to instrument falling within the ambit of Section 17.
20.The decision in the case of Padala Satyanarayana Murthy was followed by the Allahabad High
Court in the decision in the case of Rama Pati Tiwari Vs. District Registrar, Allahabad [reported in
AIR 2009 Allahabad 102].
21.By applying the decision in the case of Padala Satyanarayana Murthy to the facts of the case, the
only conclusion that could be arrived at is that a court decree is not compulsorily registerable and
that the option lies with the party. In such circumstances, the law laid down by this Court clearly
states that the http://www.judis.nic.in limitation prescribed under the Act would not stand
attracted..'' (6)The above judgment will squarely apply to the facts of the present case.
This Court in no uncertain terms has held that the law of limitation prescribed under Section 23 and
25 of the Act will not apply to a Court decree, since it is not compulsory registrable.
(7)In view of the settled position of law, this Court has no hesitation to interfere with the impugned
Refusal Check Slip issued by the 3rd respondent and accordingly the same is quashed. The 3rd
respondent is directed to register the final decree submitted by the petitioner, if it is otherwise in
order.
(8)This writ petition is accordingly allowed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous
petition is closed.
