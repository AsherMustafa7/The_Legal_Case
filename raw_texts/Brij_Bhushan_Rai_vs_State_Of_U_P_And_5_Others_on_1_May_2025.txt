Hon'ble Donadi Ramesh,J.
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. The present writ petition has been filed against the order dated 14.11.2017 passed by the
respondent no.3- Joint Director of Education, Varanasi Region, Varanasi whereby name of the
petitioner for regularisation in service as Assistant Teacher has been rejected on the ground that he
has not received salary from March, 1999 to 2000 and October, 2004 to January, 2016.
3. Submission is that the petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher (LT grade) in Gramodya
Inter College, Gaura, Badshahpur, District- Jaunpur on short-term vacancy vide appointment letter
dated 04.09.1997. In pursuance of the appointment letter, he joined on 06.09.1997. The
appointment letter of the petitioner as Assistant Teacher (LT Grade) was also approved by the
District Inspector of Schools on 12.09.1997.
4. On 22.03.2016, the State Government issued a gazette notification known as Uttar Pradesh
Secondary Education Selection Board (Amendment) Act, 2016. As per newly added Section 33-G, it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46527715/ 1
Brij Bhushan Rai vs State Of U.P. And 5 Others on 1 May, 2025
was indicated that if any person is appointed as Assistant Teacher (LT Grade) on short-term vacancy
on or after 07.08.1993 but not later than 25.01.1999 against the short-term vacancy in consonance
with Paragraph-2 of the Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Selection Board (Removal of
Difficulties) (Second) Order, 1981, such vacancy would be converted into substantial vacancy.
Consequent thereto, name of the teacher would be recommended qua appointment on substantive
vacancy as per the seniority provided that the teacher is found eligible under sub-section (1) of
Section 33-G of the Amended Act, 2016.
5. Subsequent to the appointment of petitioner as Assistant Teacher (LT Grade) on short-term
vacancy, neither any person was appointed on the substantive vacancy nor any such process for
selection of such vacancy initiated. Hence, the Principal of the institution recommended the name of
the petitioner to the District Inspector of Schools, Jaunpur on 03.10.2016 stating therein that
keeping in view Section 33-G of the Amended Act, 2016, services of the petitioner as Assistant
Teacher (LT Grade) may be regularised. The records pertaining to the petitioner along with
recommendation was also sent to the District Inspector of Schools for consideration.
6. Upon receipt of the recommendation letter dated 03.10.2016 sent along with records by the
Principal of the Institution, District Inspector of Schools, Jaunpur sent the same to the third
respondent- Joint Director of Education, Varanasi Region, Varanasi. When, respondent no.3 did not
pass any order on the recommendation made by the Principal of the Institution, the petitioner
approached this Court by way of filing the Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.57753 of 2016 which was
disposed of on 07.12.2016 directing the third respondent to pass appropriate order on the
representation made by the petitioner. The petitioner again moved an application along with the
copy of order of this Court dated 07.12.2016 requesting therein that as per the Gazette Notification
dated 22.03.2016, his services as Assistant Teacher may be regularised.
7. Notwithstanding the fact that the government has earlier issued notification dated 22.03.2016
and also the order passed by this Court dated 07.12.2016 for consideration of the petitioner's claim,
the third respondent rejected the claim of the petitioner for regularisation of his service as Assistant
Teacher solely on the ground that he did not receive salary from March, 1999 to 2000 and from
October, 2004 to January, 2016. The impugned order passed by the first respondent is apparently
contrary to the Gazette Notification dated 22.03.2016 as issued by the State Government for
regularisation of the Assistant Teachers who were appointed on or after 07.08.1993 but not later
than 25.01.1999 against the short-term vacancy in accordance with paragraph no.2 of the Uttar
Pradesh Secondary Education Selection Board (Removal of Difficulties) (Second) Order, 1981,
8. Thereafter, the petitioner came up before this Court by filing Special Appeal No. 1640 of 2008
which upon consideration of the matter was allowed on 20.01.2016, granting all consequential
benefits together with the continuance of service from the date of his initial appointment i.e.
12.09.1997. When the respondent did not pay salary in compliance of the order dated 20.01.2016
passed in Special Appeal No. 1640 of 2008, the petitioner filed contempt petition no. 5826 of 2016.
Upon receipt of the notice, the Director of Education, UP, Lucknow released the salary to the
petitioner from March, 1999 to 2000 but salary of the petitioner from October, 2004 to January,
2016 was withheld by the respondent merely on the ground of 'no work no pay' vide it's letter dated

Brij Bhushan Rai vs State Of U.P. And 5 Others on 1 May, 2025
01.01.2018.
9. Further, on perusal of letter dated 01.01.2018, it transpires that the respondents have treated the
petitioner in continuous service from the date of appointment till the date of superannuation in view
of the order dated 20.01.2016 passed by this Court passed in the aforesaid special appeal. Since the
petitioner was treated to be continued in service as Assistant Teacher from his initial appointment
12.09.1997 till the date of retirement, therefore, the DIOS, Jaunpur wrote a letter to the third
respondent requesting therein that services of the petitioner should be regularised as Assistant
Teacher keeping in view the Section 33-G of UP Secondary Education Act, 1982 inasmuch as the
DIOS as well as Director of Education, UP, Lucknow treated the petitioner had continued in service
from 12.09.1997 till the date of order dated 20.01.2016 passed in aforesaid special appeal.
10. Considering the submissions and also on perusal of the order passed in Special Appeal No.1640
of 2008 as also provisions of Section 33-G of UP Secondary Education Act, 1982, it is crystal clear
that the petitioner has rendered his services as Assistant Teacher in the institution and he has been
paid salary upon filing of the contempt petition before this Court and his services were treated to be
regularised in view of the order dated 20.01.2016 passed in aforesaid special appeal, therefore, the
impugned order is contrary to the provisions as contained in Section 33-G of UP Secondary
Education Act, 1982. Hence, it is liable to be quashed.
11. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed quashing the impugned order dated 14.11.2017 passed by
the respondent no.3- Joint Director of Education, Varanasi Region, Varanasi with the direction
upon the respondents more specifically respondent no.3 to regularise the service of the petitioner as
Assistant Teacher in Gramodya Inter College, Gaura, Badshahpur, District- Jaunpur according to
the recommendation dated 07.10.2016 made by the District Inspector of Schools, Jaunpur.
