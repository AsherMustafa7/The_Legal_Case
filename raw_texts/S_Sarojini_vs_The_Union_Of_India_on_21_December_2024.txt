COMMON ORDER
Since all the four Writ Petitions relate to the same subject matter a common judgment is being
pronounced and the facts of each Writ Petition is being narrated herein below separately. A. Facts of
the case:-
i) W.P.No.38435 of 2024:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm )
2.This Writ Petition is filed seeking the issue of writ of ceritiorari to call for the records relating to
the letter issued by the 5th respondent in Na.Ka.No.14/2023-IDPL/Kangeyampalayam dated
01.11.2023 under Section 7 (1) of the Petroleum and Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User
in Land) Act, 1962 (herein after referred as Act) and to acquire the same.
3.It is the case of the petitioner that under a registered sale deed dated 18.03.1998, petitioner has
purchased 2 acres of land in survey No.8/2 of Kangeyampalayam Village, Coimbatore. In the year
1999, the fifth respondent had issued a notice informing the petitioner that an extent of 36 square
meters in survey No.8/2 would be utilized for the purpose of laying a petroleum pipeline for the
Cochin, Coimbatore and Karur Petroleum Pipeline project. Notice under Section 10 of the Act was
issued and in the very same notice the competent authority had informed the petitioner that the
quantified compensation would be a sum of Rs.223 per sq.m. The power was being exercised by the
first respondent under the Act as it has the power to acquire a right of user in land. This right was to
be exercised in the following manner:-
a)a notification under Section 3 (1) of the Act was to be
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm )
published in the Government gazette declaring the intention to acquire the right of
user with a brief description of the land in question.
b)land owners are to file their objections under Section 5 within a period of 21 days
from the date of the 3 (1) notification.
Such objections are to be considered by the competent authority.
c)A declaration under Section (6) of the Act through a notification in the official gazette that the
right of user is to be acquired and after such declaration the land vests with the Government.
d)Under Section 10 (1) and 10 (4) of the Act 10% of the market value of the land has to be paid as
compensation in addition to that damages caused to the trees, standing crops, severance of land or
the earning of the land owner is also to be compensated.

S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
4.In the aforesaid acquisition of the right of user the notification under Section 6 (1) was issued on
16.06.1999. Though the notification had described only an extent of 36sq.mtrs in survey No.8/2,
however the respondents started using a larger extent of land over and above notified extent. The
petitioner had therefore approached this Court by filing W.P.No.1138 of 2000 seeking a mandamus
forbearing the respondents from interfering with his peaceful possession and enjoyment of the land
comprised in survey No.8/2, Kangeyampalayam village, Palladam Taluk,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) Coimbatore, except to
the extent of 36 sqmts which have already been notified.
5.The respondents in their counter admitted that they were in need for additional 1007 sqmts in
excess of the notified extent of 36 sqmts on account of the realignment of the route. The Writ
Petition was allowed by an order dated 08.06.2000 wherein this Court had issued a mandamus
forbearing the respondents from disturbing the petitioner’s possession of the land in question to an
extent of 36 sqmts. Taking into account the submission made by the respondents in their counter it
was also observed that in the event of the respondents requiring the additional extent of property
then the respondents have to take steps to notify the extent so required following the provisions of
the Act. It was also left open to the petitioner to seek compensation for the damages caused to the
standing crops. On such application being made the respondents were directed to dispose of the
same expeditiously.
6.In compliance with the orders of this Court, the respondent had issued a fresh notification dated
22.07.2000 under Section 3 (1) of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025
08:36:30 pm ) Act to acquire additional 1971 sqmts (19.71 ares) in survey No.8/2,
Kangayampalayam village. The petitioner had submitted her objections and she was called for an
enquiry. Thereafter the objections were rejected and a declaration under Section (6) of the Act was
published vide notification dated 23.09.2000. This was followed by a notice under Section 10 of the
Act dated 21.04.2001 wherein the extent of land was mentioned as 10.07ares that is 10769 sqft
which was contrary to the extent mentioned in the notification under Section 6 (1) of the Act dated
23.09.2000. A sum of Rs.18,433/- was mentioned as compensation. Challenging the notice dated
13.02.2001 in and by which the competent authority had informed the petitioner that 10% of the
market value of the land would be paid as compensation, the petitioner had filed W.P.No.8044 of
2001 to quash the same. The notice was also challenged on account of the fact that in the impugned
notice the respondent had mentioned that the land had been sub divided as 8/2B and extent of
10.07 ares alone was to be acquired. The respondents have exceeded their power in as much as once
the declaration under Section 6 (1) of the Act had been notified, the competent authority does not
have the power to change the extent of the land. Ultimately, the Writ Petition came to be disposed of
on 06.02.2003 on the ground that the petitioner has not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) challenged the gazette notification under Section (6)
dated 23.09.2000. The petitioner would further add that she was not paid for the land acquired for
the right of user.
7.While so, the fifth respondent, BPCL had issued the impugned letter informing the petitioner that
the respondents proposed to put another petroleum pipeline in the land where right of user was
acquired in the year 2000. The pipeline which is proposed to be laid was for the Irugur -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185703369/ 6
S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
Devangonthi pipeline project. On further enquiry the petitioner came to learn that the second
respondent had granted an authorization in favour of the fourth respondent vide order dated
26.02.2014 to lay the pipeline between these two places to transport the petroleum. The petitioner
being aggrieved by this notification has approached this Court and the said notification has been
challenged for the following reasons.
a)once a pipeline is laid, thereafter it is permissible to enter only for the reasons set out in Section 8
of the Act which are:- i. maintenance, ii. examination, iii. repair works, iv. altering, v. removing
pipeline and vi.or for doing such other act as necessary for the utilization of the pipeline or for
making of any inspection or measurement for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) aforesaid properties.
b)these acts can be performed by the person authorized by the central government, state
government or the corporation after giving due notice to the occupier of the land under which the
pipeline is laid.
c)The impugned notice has been issued by the fifth respondent who is not the competent authority
to issue notice under Section 7(1) (i) of the Act.
d)Once the provisions of Section 7 have been invoked it cannot be invoked once again. In the instant
case, Section 7 had been invoked in April 2001 itself and the pipeline had been laid. Therefore, the
fifth respondent cannot once again invoke the provisions of Section 7 of the Act.
e)The competent authority is not a judicial officer or a legally trained mind and therefore her
appointment and the subsequent actions initiated by her cannot stand legal scrutiny.
f)Without prejudice to the above, as per G.O.M.S.No.54 dated 14.02.2020, the fourth respondent
has to pay 20% of the market value of the land to the land owners if they go in for a second pipeline.
In order to arrive at the market value of the land, the competent authority has to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) carryout the
established exercise and pass award with reason and in the instant case, no such procedure has been
adopted. Therefore, for these reasons, the petitioner has moved the above Writ Petition.
8.W.P.No.36551 of 2024 is filed to quash the impugned publication of the fifth respondent issued in
the Tamil daily “Daily Thanthi (Dhina Thanthi)” dated 24.11.2024 under Section 7 (1) of the Act.
Petitioners are the owners of agricultural lands as set out below:-

9.Their lands were also originally acquired for the right of user in respect of the pipeline project
called Petronet Cochin-Coimbatore-Karur, which was later acquired by the Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Limited (herein after referred as BPCL). After having laid the first pipeline the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) impugned paper
publication has been issued for laying the second pipeline in the very same property where right of
user had been acquired by the respondents. Aggrieved over the same, the petitioners are before this
Court. The petitioners herein have challenged the said notification on the ground that the
notification under Section 3 (1) and 6 (1) of the Act have not been issued and straight away the
Section 7 (1) notification has been issued.
10.By not issuing the notifications under Section 3 (1) and 6 (1) of the Act, the land owners have
been denied right of hearing under Section 5 of the Act. This denial violates the principles of Audi
Alteram Partem. The petitioners have not been put on notice earlier about the extension of the
pipeline from Irugur to Devangonthi. The petitioners would further plead that the publication
infringes right to property under Article 300 A of the Constitution of India which mandates that a
person can be deprived of his property only through authority of law.
iii)W.P.No.35662 of 2024:-
11.W.P.No.35662 of 2024 is filed to quash the impugned notice of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) the
fifth respondent made in Na.Ka.No.14/2023-IDPL/Irugur dated 01.11.2023 under
Section 7 (1) of the Petroleum and Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User in
Land) Act, 1962.
12.It is the contention of the petitioner that he is the owner of the agricultural lands
bearing S.No.712/2D, Irugur Village, Sulur Taluk, Coimbatore District. In the year
1999, a pipeline project named “Petronet Cochin-Coimbatore-Karur by acquiring the
right of user in extensive agricultural lands across Irugur village, Sulur Taluk,
Coimbatore District, had been conceived. During the implementation of the Petronet
CCK Project, several assurances were given to the affected landowners such as
compensation, alternative arrangements etc., However, those promises were never
fulfilled. Then, BPCL had issued a notice in Na.Ka.No.14/2023-IDPL/Irugur dated
01.11.2023, intending to lay another pipeline through petitioner's agricultural lands.
Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner is before this Court.
iv)W.P.No.39481 of 2024:-
13.W.P.No.39481 of 2024 is filed to quash the impugned order of

S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
14.It is the contention of the petitioner that he is the owner of the agricultural lands
bearing S.Nos.194/1, 193, 195/2 & 277/2B in Kodangipalayam & Kadabadi Village,
Tiruppur & Coimbatore District.
It is submitted that in the year 1999, the Petronet Cochin-Coimbatore- Karur Project was
implemented by Petronet India Limited, later acquired by BPCL. By not issuing the notifications
under Section 3 (1) and 6 (1) of the Act, the land owners have been denied right of hearing under
Section 5 of the Act. The petitioners have not been put on notice earlier about the expansion from
Irugur to Devangonthi. The petitioners would further plead that the publication infringes right to
property under Article 300 A of the Constitution of India which mandates that a person can be
deprived of his property only through authority of law. B. Counter of the respondents”:-
15.A counter affidavit has been filed by the fourth respondent,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) BPCL
in W.P.No.36551 of 2024 wherein it has been stated as follows:-
The fourth respondent would counter the allegations contained in the affidavit filed
in support of the Writ Petition by contending that the transportation of petroleum
products through pipelines have proved to be the safest, most cost effective,
environmental friendly and an efficient mean. The pipelines connect the refineries to
meet the fuel needs of the various states in the country. The Mumbai refinery feeds
the demand of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar
Pradesh through the Mumbai – Manmad – Bijvasan pipeline spanning a total of 1332
kms and the Bina-kota pipeline runs through the states of Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan. Cochin refinery is one such refinery. The Government had decided to run
a pipeline from the Cochin to Karur through Coimbatore. These pipelines were laid to
meet the needs of petroleum for the people in Tamil Nadu. The total length of the
pipeline was 293 kilometers of which 155 passes through Kerala and 138 through
Tamil Nadu. The respondent had followed the procedure contemplated under the Act
for laying the aforesaid pipeline. The respondents had also permitted the petitioners
to continue their agricultural activities after the initial pipeline installation and for 22
years the petitioners have been carrying on their agricultural activities except for
planting deep rooted https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025
08:36:30 pm ) trees. The pipeline has been effectively operational for over 22 years
and there has been no adverse effect from the same. The original project was
implemented by the Petronet India Limited. Petronet India Limited subsequently
became the unsubsidiary of BPCL and ultimately merged with the BPCL and the right
of user of the lands automatically stood transfer to the fourth respondent.
16.The fourth respondent would submit that in order to augment the transportation
of petroleum products from the Cochi refinery and extending it to other regions and
the state of Karnataka the Irugur-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185703369/ 9
S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
Devanagothi project hereinafter referred to as “IDPL project” was conceived by the BPCL. This
project is intrinsically linked to the Cochin-Coimbatore-Karur pipeline. IDPL project contemplates
the execution of a pipeline running to an extent of 352 kms spanning districts in Tamil Nadu and
two districts in Karnataka for the transportation of MS, HSD, Kerosene and Aviation fuel. The
project runs from Irugur (Tamil Nadu) Depot of BPCL.
17.The fourth respondent would further submit for the installation of the IDPL project is in the very
same parcel of land in respect of which the right of user has been acquired as being used and not an
inch of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) additional land
is being acquired. Compensation for the same was being offered to the petitioner at 20% of the land
value plus damages to any standing crop which is specific to the state of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, the
implementation of the second pipeline does not involve the acquisition of any additional land. The
right of user having already been acquired and compensation paid, the petitioners cannot object to
the laying of the second pipeline. The fourth respondent has already paid compensation not only for
the right of user but also compensation for standing crop and they would once again pay for the
damages that would be caused to the crops when the second pipeline is being laid. It is the further
contention of the 4th respondent that there is no necessity to go through the entire exercise since it
is the very same lands that are sought to be utilized for the instalment of the second pipeline.
Therefore it is their contention that a notice under Section 7 (1) of the Act would suffice and would
serve as an official intimation to the petitioners regarding commencement of the pipeline activity for
IDPL project so as to enable the BPCL to enter upon the land. It is the further contention that the
Central Government had vested the right of user on BPCL for the Cochin-Coimbatore-Karur pipeline
project. Therefore, there is no necessity to initiate a separate acquisition proceeding for right of user
as there is no change in the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30
pm ) property.
18.It is further submitted that though BPCL does not acquire ownership of the land, however since
they have acquired the right to use the land for the purpose of laying the pipeline for transportation
of petroleum products, there is no necessity for BPCL to acquire fresh right of user for laying
pipelines in the very same lands. The respondents have countered the allegations that the
petitioners fundamental right to property under Article 300 (A) of the Constitution of India have
stood violated by contending that having already accepted the vesting of rights of user with Petronet
CCK as early as in the year 1999 itself and having accepted the compensation granted the petitioners
cannot contend that their right have been violated. The fourth respondent would reiterate that both
the 1999 project as well as the impugned project are intrinsically interconnected and therefore once
the right of user has been acquired additional pipelines can be laid. Therefore, they sought for a
dismissal of the Writ Petition in W.P. No.36551 of 2024.
19.Counter affidavit of the fourth respondent has been filed along with an application for vacating
the stay granted wherein they have reiterated the contentions stated in the counter affidavit to
W.P.No.36551 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) of
2024. The respondent would contend that though the competent authority had issued a notice on
30.11.2024, calling upon the petitioner submit the details required for compensation distribution
and the ownership details and the same has not been responded to by the petitioner. The

been determined after the issue of notice to the petitioner on 31.01.2024. The petitioner had failed
to appear in person for the enquiry on 05.02.2024. Once again a notice was issued to the petitioner
on 16.02.2024 for enquiry on 19.02.2024 for which also there was no response. Finally, the
competent authority by communication dated 27.05.2024, had informed the petitioner that he may
appear on 31.05.2024 and collect compensation as determined after producing the necessary bank
account details. Despite all these notices, the petitioners refused to receive the compensation and
therefore the same remain in deposit with the competent authority. They would further contend that
the petitioners have chosen to approach this Court when the pipeline work is nearing completion by
challenging the notice dated 01.11.2023. The fourth respondent would state that more than 100kms
of the pipeline have already been laid and the completion of IDPL project is essential to meet the
fuel needs of the States of Tamilnadu and Karnataka https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded
on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) with future expansion to other parts of Tamil Nadu. In fact the
Government of Tamil Nadu had advised the project proponent namely BPCL to align the pipelines
alongside the state of National Highways which was accepted by BPCL. The fourth respondent BPCL
has ensured the minimum intrusion into day to day activities of the land owners. Therefore, they
sought for the dismissal of the Writ Petition.
20.Before proceeding to discuss the issue on hand, it would be appropriate to touch upon the
statement and objects of the Act and extract the provisions of Sections 3, 6, 7 and 10. This Act came
to be enacted in the year 1962. The statement of objects and reasons would read as follows:-
As a result of the implementation of plans for the development of petroleum
resources in the country, it is anticipated that in the next few years there will be a
substantial increase in the production of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
products by the public sector oilfields and refineries in India. It has therefore become
necessary to lay petroleum pipelines in the country to serve as an efficient and cheap
means of transportation and distribution of petroleum and petroleum products.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm )
Although land can be acquired outright for laying such pipelines under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894, the procedure for such acquisition is long-drawn and costly.
Since the petroleum pipelines will be laid underground outright acquisition of land is
not necessary. Therefore, in the case of these pipelines it is considered sufficient to
acquire the mere right of user in the land for laying and maintaining the pipelines.
The Bill seeks to achieve the above purpose.
Section 3.Publication of notification for acquisition:-
Whenever it appears to the Central Government that it is necessary in the public
interest that for the transport of petroleum or any mineral from one locality to
another locality, pipelines may be laid by that Government or by any State
Government or a corporation and that for the purpose of laying such pipelines, it is
necessary to acquire the right of user in any land under which such pipelines may be

S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
laid, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare its intention to acquire the
right of user therein.
2) Every notification under sub-section (1) shall give a brief description of the land.
3) The competent authority shall cause the substance of the notification to be
published at such places and in such manner as may be prescribed.
Section 6.Declaration of acquisition of right of user- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded
on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm )
1.Where no objections under sub-section (1) of section 5 have been made to the competent authority
within the period specified therein or where the competent authority has disallowed the objections
under sub-section (2) of that section, that authority shall, as soon as may be either make a report in
respect of the land described in the notification under sub-section (1) of section 3, or make different
reports in respect of different parcels of such land, to the Central Government containing his
recommendations on the objections, together with the record of the proceedings held by him, for the
decision of that Government and upon receipt of such report the Central Government shall if
satisfied that such land is required for laying any pipeline for the transport of petroleum or any
mineral, declare, by notification in the Official Gazette, that the right of user in the land for laying
the pipelines should be acquired. and different declarations may be made from time to time in
respect of different parcels of the land described in the notification issued under sub- section (1) of
section 3, irrespective of whether one report or different reports have been made by the competent
authority under this section.
(2) On the publication of the declaration under sub-section (1), the right of user in the land specified
therein shall vest absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances.
(3) Where in respect of any land, a notification has been issued under sub-section (1) of section 3
but no https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) declaration in
respect of any parcel of land covered by that notification has been published under this section
within a period of one year from the date of that notification, that notification shall cease to have
effect on the expiration of that period (3A) No declaration in respect of any land covered by a
notification issued under sub-section (1) of section 3, published after the commencement of the
Petroleum Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User in Land) Amendment Act, 1977, shall be made
after the expiry of three years from the date of such publication.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), the Central Government may, on such
terms and conditions as it may think fit to impose, direct by order in writing, that the right of user in
the land for laying the pipelines shall, instead of vesting in the Central Government vest, either on
the date of publication of the declaration or, on such other date as may be specified in the direction,
in the State Government or the corporation proposing to lay the pipelines and thereupon the right of
such user in the land shall, subject to the terms and conditions so imposed, vest in that State
Government or corporation, as the case may be, free from all encumbrances.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm )
10. Compensation.—(1) Where in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 4, section 7 or
section 8 by any person, any damage, loss or injury is sustained by any person interested in the land
under which the pipeline is proposed to be, or is being, or has been laid, the Central Government,
the State Government or the corporation , as the case may be , shall be liable to pay compensation to
such person for such damage, loss or injury , the amount of which shall be determined by the
competent authority in the first instance. (2) If the amount of compensation determined by the
competent authority under sub-section (1) is not acceptable to either of the parties, the amount of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185703369/ 13
S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
(4) Where the right of user of any land has vested in the Central Government, the
State Government or the corporation , the Central Government, the State
Government or the corporation , as the case may be, shall, in addition to the
compensation, if any, payable under sub-section (1), be liable to pay to the owner and
to any other person whose right of enjoyment in that land has been affected in any
manner whatsoever by reason of such vesting, compensation calculated at ten per
cent. of the market value of that land on the date of the notification under sub-section
(1) of section 3. (5) The market value of the land on the said date shall be determined
by the competent authority and if the value so determined by that authority is not
acceptable to either of the parties, it shall, on application by either of the parties to
the District Judge referred to in sub-section (2), be determined by that District
Judge. (6) The decision of the District Judge under sub-section (2) or sub-section (5)
shall be final.
21.Section 3 (1) contemplates the issue of notification first in the official gazette of the Central
Government or the State Government or a Corporation declaring their intention to acquire right of
user on lands for the purpose of transportation of petroleum or mineral from one locality to another
locality through pipelines. Section 5 contemplates objections being filed by the persons interested in
the land and its consideration by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025
08:36:30 pm ) the authorities. Once the objections are made and rejected by the authority shall
submit a report of recommendation in the objections received with a record of the proceedings for
the decision of the Government. Thereafter, once the Government is satisfied that the land is
required a notification under Section 6 (1) shall be published and thereafter as per the provision of
Section 6 (2) the land would vest in the Government. Once the right of user is vested with the
Government, then Section 7 provides that the persons authorised can enter the land for the purpose
of laying the pipeline.
22.When the matter was being argued, this Court had directed the respondents to submit details
showing the measurement of the pipelines and as to whether the second pipeline would exceeded
the extent for which right of user has been acquired. A sketch was provided to this Court showing
the extent of Right of User (herein after referred as ROU) and measurement of the pipelines. A
perusal of the same would clearly indicate that the second pipeline is also well within the land in
respect of which ROU has already been acquired. It is also brought to the notice of the Court by the
learned counsel for the respondent that the Tamil Nadu https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) Government has passed a G.O. for payment of 20% as
damages for the loss caused while laying a pipeline. The respondents have produced a copy of the
environmental impact notification dated 14.09.2024 with reference to Irugur – Devangonthi
pipeline. In paragraph No.1.1.2 of the report it has been stated as follows:-
The proposed IDPL's cross country pipeline originates from Irugur, Coimbatore district of Tamil
Nadu, which is a despatch Terminal and the pipeline route passes through the space between
existing Kochi-Coimbatore- Bangalore pipeline corridor of Petronet and Coimbatore- Salem BG
track along the catchment of Noyal River while proceeding towards Bangalore. The proposed
pipeline ends at Devangonthi BPCL's receipt terminal at Bengaluru. The length of the pipeline is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185703369/ 14
S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
expected to be about 355 km 16” Dia API 5L grade cross country pipeline for the movement of
MS/SKO/HSD/ATF. The details of the pipeline crossings are briefly described below.
23.The report also refers to the need and justification for the laying of the pipeline as the
consumption of the petroleum products in India is on a steady rise and therefore, the Government
had decided to proceed https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm
) with the laying of the second pipeline to extend the facility right upto Devangonthi in Karnataka.
Further on a perusal of the notice issued under Section 7 (1) of the Act dated 01.11.2023, there is a
reference to Section 3 (1) notices bearing No.386 dated 06.02.1999, 2156 dated 27.07.1999 and 1633
dated 21.07.2000. Likewise it also refers to Section 6 (1) notifications bearing No.1825 dated
16.06.1999, No.3178 dated 04.11.1999 and No.2084 dated 18.09.2000. Therefore, it appears that a 3
(1) notification had been issued on 19.08.2004 followed by a 6 (1) on 26.03.2003. Thereafter,
compensation has also been worked out. The reference would also show that the petitioner in
W.P.No.36551 of 2024 has sent a letter dated 08.04.2024 claiming compensation for the crops
planted by him as well.
C.Submission:-
24.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.No.36551 of 2024 and
W.P.No.35662 of 2024 would at the outset submit that the impugned publication
under Section 7 (1) of the Act is contrary to the provisions of the Act as the said notice
has not been preceded by the notices under Section 3 (1) and 6 (1) notifications. The
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) learned
counsel would submit that the project of the year 1999 and the project of the year
2000 are two distinct projects. He would invite the attention of this Court to the
notification of the 1999 Act, wherein it has been stated that the purpose for which the
ROU land was acquired was for laying a pipeline from the refinery of the BPCL Kochi,
Kerala, Karur in the State of Tamil Nadu and the pipeline was to be laid by the
Petronet CCK project, whereas, the Section 6 (1) of the year 2014 is for laying a
pipeline from Irugur to Devangonthi. He would further emphasise that a mere
perusal of the notification would clearly prove that it is a different project since it
contemplates a parallel pipeline. Therefore, it is his contention that the authorities
ought to have initiated proceedings from the beginning for acquiring the ROU. He
would further submit that the respondents have themselves admitted that it is a
parallel pipeline. In the counter affidavit filed by them the said statement has been
admitted in paragraph No.3 (d, f and g). He would further submit that in both
notifications respondents have clearly stated that it was only “a pipeline” that was
being laid whereas now by virtue of the impugned notification, it is a second pipeline
that is sought to be laid. He would submit that the respondents are trying to
circumvent procedure and deprive the petitioners of their livelihood and
compensation.

S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
25.Mr.D.Muthukumar, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of writ petitioner in W.P.No.38435
of 2024 would submit that in the case of the petitioner, originally the respondents had sought to
acquire only an extent of 36 sqmts which was challenged in the proceedings in W.P.No.1138 of
2000. This Writ Petition was filed for issue of writ of mandamus to restrain the respondents their
men representatives etc., from disturbing the petitioner's peaceful possession of the land in
S.No.8/2, Kangeyampalayam Village, Coimbatore, except the extent of 36 sqmts. The petitioner
therein had stated that though notification was issued for acquiring 36sqmts however, an additional
extent of 1007 sqmts was acquired from the petitioner's land on account of re-alignment. The said
lands were acquired without following due process of law and therefore, the petitioner had come
forward with the Writ Petition. This Court by the said order dated 08.06.2000 had allowed the Writ
Petition and the respondent were restrainted from acquiring 36 sqmts except by due process of law.
The learned Judge had also observed that it would be open to the respondents to notify the extent of
property that they propose to acquire in the said survey number. He would submit that thereafter
fresh notification was issued and larger extent was acquired. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) He would also support the arguments of the learned
counsel for the petitioner in W.P.No.36551 of 2024 and W.P.No.35662 of 2024 by contending that
the two projects are totally different and not intrinsically linked as contended in the counter filed by
the respondent. He would place reliance on a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in
1997 2 Supreme Court Cases 42 Ichchapur Industrial Cooperative Society Ltd., Vs. Competent
Authority, Oil & Natural Gas Commission and Another , at paragraph No.2 where the issue involved
in the case had been encapsulated and paragraph Nos.7, 12, 14 and 15, where the provisions of the
Act has been extracted. He would submit that therefore impliedly it has to be taken that, only when
the second pipeline is sought to be laid in additional land over and above to the lands in respect of
which right to user has been acquired, then in such cases it should be treated as a fresh acquisition.
Therefore, if a second pipeline is to be laid in the very same extent which has already been acquired
it would not amount to a fresh acquisition.
26.The learned counsel would rely upon the judgments reported in (2016) 9 Supreme Court Cases
791 Laljibhai Kadvabhai Savaliya and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025
08:36:30 pm ) Others Vs. State of Gujarat and Others, was pressed into service to contend that a
competent authority should be a person with a judicial background and should be a judicial officer
not lower than the rank of a Subordinate Judge. Both counsels would submit that twenty years back,
the earlier acquisition had come to an end and the pipeline have been installed. The present project
is a totally different project and not linked to the earlier project. The counsels would therefore, seek
to have the Writ Petition allowed and the impugned order setaside.
27.Per contra, the learned Assistant Solicitor General would submit that the respondents had
acquired a ROU for laying pipelines in the land so acquired. He would further draw the attention of
the Court to the provisions under the Act where the pipeline that is contemplated is not in the
singular but in the plural namely it talks about pipelines. He would submit that a reading of Sections
3, 4 and 5 would clearly demonstrate the above as the emphasis is on the word such “pipelines”. He
would submit that Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ichchapur Industrial Cooperative Society
Ltd., Vs. Competent Authority, Oil & Natural Gas Commission and Another had clearly understood
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) above fact and had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185703369/ 16
S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
permitted the laying of the additional pipeline. Though in that case, it was for carrying water he
would submit that the said judgment has been relied upon in division bench of Punjab and Haryana
High Court in the judgment reported in 2010 (1) ILR Punjab and Haryana 868 Surat Singh and
others Vs. Union of India and others and by division bench of Andhra Pradesh namely 2021 SCC
Online AP 3442 Banavath Sudhakar Naik Vs. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. He would
therefore submit that having acquired right to lay the pipelines as per the notification under Section
3 (1) followed by 6 (1) and 7 (1) it does not lie in the mouth of the petitioner to now contend that the
respondents cannot lay another pipeline.
28.Mr.Krishna Srinivasan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 4th and 5th respondents would
add to the aforesaid arguments and submit that even after laying of the additional pipeline there
would still be land available within the area which has been already acquired for ROU. The sketch
produced would substantiate the above argument. He would further argue that the laying of the
second pipeline is not a new project and is one that is linked with the earlier project. In both these
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) cases petroleum is
sought to be taken from Cochin refinery of the fourth respondent through Coimbatore right upto
Karnataka. The project report that has been filed in the additional typed set of papers has also been
referred to by the learned Senior Counsel. He would submit that since it forms part of the earlier
notification and that as no additional lands are sought to be acquired the Section 7 (1) notice cannot
be called into question. That apart, he would submit that the petitioner has received compensation
for the entire extent that is now been acquired for ROU. The petitioners are further entitled to 20%
of the land cost as damages in case of any damage to the crops. Therefore, he would also seek for the
dismissal of the Writ Petitions.
Discussions:-
29.From the reading of Section 3 (1) it appears that the notification under Section 3 (1) is a
declaration of intent to acquire a ROU of any land for the purpose of laying pipelines. The plural is
used. Section 4 deals with the power to enter survey etc. Likewise the declaration under Section 6 (1)
also talks about pipelines. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 1997 2 Supreme Court Cases 42 Ichchapur
Industrial Cooperative Society Ltd., Vs. Competent Authority, Oil & Natural Gas Commission
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm ) and Another, was
dealing with an issue as to whether water is a mineral within the meaning of mines Act, while
considering objections since the respondent ONGC had decided to lay a second pipeline along side
the earlier pipeline for taking water. After hearing the extensive argument, it observed that the
question being canvassed before them was whether a new pipeline carrying another commodity
could be laid without a fresh notification under Section 3 followed by a declaration under Section 6.
Paragraph No.15 of the said judgment state as follows:-
15.A perusal of the above would indicate that if the right of user of the land has vested
in the Government for laying pipelines for transporting petroleum, it shall be lawful
to lay pipelines for transporting minerals. It also provides that where the right of user
of a land has vested in the Government for laying pipelines for transporting any
mineral, it would be lawful to lay pipelines for transporting petroleum or any other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185703369/ 17
S.Sarojini vs The Union Of India on 21 December, 2024
mineral including the mineral for the transportation of which the right of user had
already vested. The two rights, namely, the right to lay pipeline for petroleum and the
right to lay pipeline for minerals have been linked together. If one is acquired, the
other also becomes available.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 07/04/2025 08:36:30 pm )
30.The above judgement would clearly indicate that when a second pipeline is permitted to carry
another product the laying of the pipeline for transporting the very same product cannot be given a
different treatment. The division bench of the Punjab and Haryana HighCourt have followed the
judgment in Ichchapur Industrial Cooperative Society Ltd., Vs. Competent Authority, Oil & Natural
Gas Commission and Another, and held that the ROU that vests with the Corporation they could lay
another pipeline as stated earlier. The sketch which has now been submitted by the respondents
which forms part of this order clearly shows that both the pipelines come still within the lands which
have been in respect of which ROU has been acquired. Therefore, the Writ Petitions stands
dismissed.
31.Accordingly, the Writ Petitions are dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions
are closed. No costs.
