petitioners herein.
3. The petitioner filed the instant application for the
following reliefs :-
"1(i) To quash the order of
punishment issued vide Memo no. 2355 dated
7.6.2010
(at Annexure-12) by the I.G. Prision Bihar, Patna whereby and wherein the petitioner departmental
proceeding has been imposed with punishment.
(ii) To set aside the order of the secretary Home department Bihar, Patna issued vide Memo no.
4224 dated 10.10.11 whereby the appeal of the petitioner against the aforementioned punishment
was rejected (Annexure-12/1)."
4. The case of the petitioner in brief is that having been appointed as Jail Warden on 11.10.1991,
while posted at Sub-Jail, Barh on 18.3.2000 the petitioner was placed under suspension on the
allegations of carelessness and failure to perform his duties responsibly on account of eight
prisoners having escaped from the main gate of the Sub-Jail, Barh at 8 a.m. on 18.3.2000. A
departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner and he was served with a charge-sheet
on 16.11.2004. The petitioner submitted his reply and a report with respect to preliminary enquiry
conducted by the Director, Administration, Home Jail Department and former Jail Patna High
Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 Superintendent, Beur was submitted to the I.G.,
Prison. The I.G., Prison expressed his dissatisfaction to the report and ordered conducting a fresh
enquiry appointing the Jail Superintendent, Beur as the Conducting Officer.
5. As directed, the petitioner appeared before the new Conducting Officer and requested him to
make available certain documents, all of which were not provided to him. The petitioner submitted
his reply denying the charges and also mentioning therein that he had not been provided with
crucial documents in preparing his defence.
6. In the enquiry report submitted by the Conducting Officer, the charges against the petitioner were
found to be proved. Enclosing a copy of the enquiry report, the petitioner was issued with a second
show-cause notice asking him to submit his reply within 15 days.
7. It is the case of the petitioner that he once again requested the Joint Secretary-cum-Director,
Home Jail Department through the Superintendent, Mandal Jail, Sasaram to provide certain
documents, however the petitioner was not provided the same.

Kapildeo Prasad vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
8. By order dated 7.6.2010, the petitioner was inflicted with the following punishments i.e. (i)
demoted on the Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 initial/lower pay of
Warder with the further stipulation that during this period the annual increment shall be withheld
for 3 years with cumulative effect; (ii) after 3 years the annual increment shall be given for the rest
service period for the initial pay; (iii) no promotion will be granted for 5 years; and (iv) No amount
except the subsistence allowance shall be paid for the period of suspension, however this period
shall be counted for the purpose of pension.
9. The petitioner by his letter dated 24.7.2010 once again made a request before the respondents for
providing the documents to enable him to file an appeal before the Appellate Authority. Once again
he was not provided with the documents. The petitioner filed his appeal which was rejected by the
Appellate Authority on 10.10.2011. It is against the order of punishment dated 7.6.2010 and the
order dated 10.10.2011 of the Appellate Authority rejecting his appeal that the instant application
has been filed.
10. It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the documents repeatedly asked for by
the petitioner for filing his reply to the charge-sheet as also the second show-cause notice were
absolutely essential to enable him to file an effective reply. The respondents not having made Patna
High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 the same available the same is a serious lapse in
the departmental proceedings. It is further submitted that on submission of the enquiry report, the
respondent- I.G., Prison, Bihar by his order dated 31.7.2009 rejected the same and ordered another
enquiry to be conducted appointing the Superintendent of Adarsh Central Jail, Beur, Patna as the
Conducting Officer and the Assistant Superintendent of Sub- Jail, Barh as the Presenting Officer.
Learned counsel submits that the said order which gives no reason for rejection of the enquiry
report and commencing a fresh enquiry is not sustainable. It is further submitted in reference to the
charge- sheet and the subsequent enquiry report that neither the same provided the list of witnesses
who would be examined in proving the charges against the petitioner nor in course of enquiry was
any witness examined. It is thus submitted that for these as also other reasons, the order of
punishment as also the order rejecting the appeal of the petitioner are not sustainable and as such,
the writ application be allowed.
11. Learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his submissions has placed reliance on the
judgments in the cases of Ganpati Singh vs. Board of Directors and Appellate Authority & Ors.; 2013
(3) PLJR 258, Kanailal Bera vs. Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 Union of
India & Ors.; (2007) 11 SCC 517 & Union of India vs. K.D. Pandey & Anr.; (2002) 10 SCC 471.
12. In response, it is submitted by learned counsel appearing for the respondents that all the
relevant and available documents were supplied to the petitioner. At every stage of the proceeding
adequate opportunity was given to him to defend himself. The petitioner was informed by the
Conducting Officer that it was not possible to supply all the documents as desired by him. In
addition the petitioner was also given adequate opportunity to present his case in person before the
Conducting Officer. In the enquiry report, the Conducting Officer found the petitioner to be
responsible for dereliction of duty and as such he was served with a second show-cause notice along
with a copy of the enquiry report to which the petitioner filed his reply. After considering his reply,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118487965/ 3
Kapildeo Prasad vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
the order of punishment was passed. All the points raised by the petitioner were considered properly
by the Appellate Authority who not finding any merit in the same rejected the appeal. It is submitted
that there is no merit in the instant application filed by the petitioner and as such the writ
application be dismissed.
13. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for the respondents. Perused the
material on Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 record.
14. The facts in brief are that the incidence of escape of eight prisoners having taken place from
Sub-Jail, Barh on 18.3.2000 at 8 a.m., the petitioner who was then posted as Jail Warden at the
Barh Sub-Jail was placed under suspension and was proceeded against in a departmental
proceeding on the allegation of carelessness and failure to perform his duties responsibly. The
petitioner filed his reply to the show-cause notice on which the Conducting Officer submitted his
enquiry report, however the I.G., Prison came out with a cryptic order dated 31.7.2009
(Annexure-4) stating that the enquiry report not being satisfactory another enquiry was ordered
appointing Sri Om Prakash Gupta, Superintendent of Adarsh Central Jail, Beur, Patna as the
Conducting Officer and Sri Sanjay Kumar, Assistant Jailer, Barh, Sub-Jail as the Presenting Officer.
15. It may be mentioned here that once the enquiry had proceeded and in the same enquiry report
had been submitted, even if the disciplinary authority was not inclined to accept the enquiry report,
they were required to provide a copy of the same to the petitioner along with an order recording the
reasons for their disagreement with the contents thereof. In the opinion of the Court they could not
have brushed aside the Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 enquiry report,
not providing a copy of the same to the petitioner and directing a fresh enquiry appointing another
Conducting Officer and Presenting Officer.
16. It further transpires from various communications brought by the petitioner as annexures to the
writ application that even thereafter before submitting his reply to the charge- sheet, the petitioner
asked for certain documents to be provided to enable him to file an effective reply. These were the
evidence with the charge-sheet i.e. a copy of the joint inspection report of the Director,
Administration and Sri Balmohan Naik, Superintendent of Adarsh Central Jail, Beur, the register of
the visitors on 18.3.2000 together with the applications filed for meeting the prisoners, the duty
register with respect to deputation of Home Guards and BMP Guards on 18.3.2000, the gate register
on 18.3.2000, the duty register of the Jail Warder Cadre for 18.3.2000, the report of the Jailer, the
statement of different persons recorded in context of the escape of the prisoners as also the register
at the prison gate meant for frisking of the prisoners. It further transpires that he was provided with
one of the documents with a further assurance by the Conducting Officer by his memo dated
8.9.2009 that the remaining documents will be provided to him as soon as the Patna High Court
CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 same are available. The petitioner proceeded to file his reply
without the documents having been supplied to him and even in his reply dated 22.10.2009 raised
the point of non-supply of the documents.
17. Reference may be made to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Uttar
Pradesh & Ors. vs. Saroj Kumar Sinha; (2010) 2 SCC 772 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118487965/ 4
Kapildeo Prasad vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
at paragraph nos. 28, 30, 34 and 39 as follows :-
"28. An inquiry officer acting in a quasi- judicial authority is in the position of an
independent adjudicator. He is not supposed to be a representative of the
department/disciplinary authority/Government. His function is to examine the
evidence presented by the Department, even in the absence of the delinquent official
to see as to whether the unrebutted evidence is sufficient to hold that the charges are
proved. In the present case the aforesaid procedure has not been observed. Since no
oral evidence has been examined the documents have not been proved, and could not
have been taken into consideration to conclude that the charges have been proved
against the respondents.
........... ......... ......... ......... .........
30.When a departmental enquiry is conducted against the government servant it
cannot be treated as a casual exercise. The Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012
dt.13-10-2025 enquiry proceedings also cannot be conducted with a closed mind. The
inquiry officer has to be wholly unbiased. The rules of natural justice are required to
be observed to ensure not only that justice is done but is manifestly seen to be done.
The object of rules of natural justice is to ensure that a government servant is treated
fairly in proceedings which may culminate in imposition of punishment including
dismissal/removal from service.
........... ......... ......... ......... .........
34. This Court in Kashinath Dikshita v. Union of India [(1986) 3 SCC 229 : 1986 SCC
(L&S) 502 : (1986) 1 ATC 176], had clearly stated the rationale for the rule requiring
supply of copies of the documents, sought to be relied upon by the authorities to
prove the charges levelled against a government servant. In that case the enquiry
proceedings had been challenged on the ground that non-supply of the statements of
the witnesses and copies of the documents had resulted in the breach of rules of
natural justice. The appellant therein had requested for supply of the copies of the
documents as well as the statements of the witnesses at the preliminary enquiry. The
request made by the appellant was in terms turned down by the disciplinary
authority. ........... ......... ......... ......... .........
39. The proposition of law that a government employee facing a departmental
enquiry is entitled to all the relevant statements, documents and other materials to
enable him to Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025 have a
reasonable opportunity to defend himself in the departmental enquiry against the
charges is too well established to need any further reiteration. Nevertheless given the
facts of this case we may re-emphasise the law as stated by this Court in State of
Punjab v. Bhagat Ram [(1975) 1 SCC 155 : 1975 SCC (L&S) 18] : (SCC p. 156, paras
6-8) "6. The State contended that the respondent was not entitled to get copies of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118487965/ 5
Kapildeo Prasad vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
statements. The reasoning of the State was that the respondent was given the
opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and during the cross-examination the
respondent would have the opportunity of confronting the witnesses with the
statements. It is contended that the synopsis was adequate to acquaint the
respondent with the gist of the evidence.
7. The meaning of a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action
proposed to be taken is that the government servant is afforded a reasonable
opportunity to defend himself against charges on which inquiry is held. The
government servant should be given an opportunity to deny his guilt and establish his
innocence. He can do so when he is told what the charges against him are. He can do
so by cross-examining the witnesses produced against him. The object of supplying
statements is that the government Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012
dt.13-10-2025 servant will be able to refer to the previous statements of the witnesses
proposed to be examined against the government servant.
Unless the statements are given to the government servant he will not be able to have
an effective and useful cross- examination.
8. It is unjust and unfair to deny the government servant copies of statements of
witnesses examined during investigation and produced at the inquiry in support of
the charges levelled against the government servant. A synopsis does not satisfy the
requirements of giving the government servant a reasonable opportunity of showing
cause against the action proposed to be taken."
18. On perusal of the enquiry report in the instant case it transpires that the same does not deal with
the documents asked for by the petitioner not having been supplied to him nor does the Conducting
Officer states in his report as to how those documents are irrelevant for the proceedings. In absence
of the documents having been supplied to the petitioner as also the Conducting Officer not having
dealt with in his report as to why the documents were not being supplied or as to why the same were
irrelevant, in the opinion of the Court, the departmental proceedings stands vitiated by severe
procedural irregularities.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14083 of 2012 dt.13-10-2025
19. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case as discussed herein above, the order impugned
dated 7.6.2010 passed by the I.G., Prison, Bihar, Patna imposing punishment on the petitioner as
also the order dated 10.10.2011 passed by the Secretary, Home Department, Bihar, Patna rejecting
the appeal filed by the petitioner, both being unsustainable are hereby set aside.
20. The writ application is allowed with all consequential benefits which shall be paid to the
petitioners within a period of 3 months.
