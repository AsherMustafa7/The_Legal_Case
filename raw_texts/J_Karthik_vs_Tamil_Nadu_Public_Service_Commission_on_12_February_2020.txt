ORDER
The matter is taken up through web hearing.
This Writ Petition has been filed to issue a Writ of Declaration to declare that the action of the
respondent not including the name of the petitioner for the original certificate verification list issued
by the respondent dated 12.02.2020 as arbitrary, illegal and in violation of natural justice and
consequently direct the respondent to permit the petitioner to participate in both the counseling for
the post included in the Combined Civil Services Examination-4, Group-IV examinations issued by
the respondent in Notification No.19/2019 dated 14.06.2019.
2. The petitioner is a B.Sc Graduate and has applied for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
consideration of his appointment in Group-IV Service in response to the notification No.19/2019
issued by the respondent Commission for recruitment to the Combined Civil Services Examination
(Group-IV). The petitioner belongs to Backward Community category.
3. The petitioner in furtherance of the notification, appeared in the written examination held on
01.09.2019 and the result of the written examination was published on 12.11.2019. According to the
petitioner he has secured 252 marks out of 300 and was placed under BC-OM communal category
and he was also eligible for PSTM quota . The petitioner has secured over all rank of 5110 and
communal rank 2397 for all the posts included in the notification and for the typist post, his over all
rank is 688 and communal rank is 337.
4. The Commission published two separate lists for provisionally admitted candidates for the
certificate verification, dated 30.11.2019. The respondent Commission has also issued
communication on 03.12.2019 directing the candidates to upload all the original certificates in the
website through e-seva centres recognised by the Government. The time for
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ uploading all the certificates was fixed between 05.12.2019 and
18.12.2019. In pursuance of the directives, the petitioner approached a local e-seva centre and
uploaded all the certificates on 13.12.2019 before the stipulated date. According to the petitioner
that he has also been issued with the acknowledgement receipt for uploading all the certificates.
5. Thereafter, the petitioner found that his registration number was missing when the final
certificate verification was originally scheduled to take place on 12.02.2020 and the candidates were
asked to be present for the verification. The petitioner, thereafter, approached the Commission
Office and was informed that e-seva centre through which he had uploaded all the certificate, has
uploaded his PSTM certificate twice as against the slot for community certificate. In the absence of

J.Karthik vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 12 February, 2020
the community certificate supporting the claim of the petitioner, he was not allowed to participate in
the final stage of selection, namely certificate verification and counselling. Since it was a minor error
happened beyond the control of the petitioner, despite his eligibility and performance, he was
denied a valuable opportunity to get appointed in Government service. Therefore, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ petitioner is before this Court.
6. When the matter is taken up for hearing it transpired that the petitioner was called for certificate
verification vide communication dated 12.10.2020 and he participated in the Certificate Verification
and subsequently, vide proceedings dated 04.11.2020, the petitioner was also declared of have been
provisionally selected for appointment to the post of typist in Hindu Religious and Charitable
Endowment Department. According to the proceedings, the provisional appointment was also on
the basis of the participation of the petitioner in the counselling held on 04.11.2020 and the
provisional selection is subject to the outcome of this writ petition.
7. On behalf of the respondent, Mr.Balamuralikrishnan, learned standing counsel stoutly opposed
this petition stating that the notification clearly instructed the candidates to be extremely careful
and follow the instructions scrupulously. It is not the fault of the Commission to deny participation
of the petitioner earlier. As far as the Commission is concerned, they did not receive the community
certificate supporting the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ claim of the petitioner of his communal
status. Therefore, the Commission cannot be faulted with in not allowing the petitioner to
participate in the further stage of the selection.
8. No doubt, the Commission cannot be faulted with for not inviting the petitioner for participation
in the selection. In any event, in view of the subsequent development as set out above, the entire
controversy as to whether the petitioner or the e-seva centre is to be blamed should be set at rest, as
the petitioner has been eventually selected and appointed on the bais of his merit and performance.
9. When the petitioner has earned his appointment through his performance, nothing further is left
open for adjudication, as that would not serve any purpose other than keeping the appointment of
the petitioner in the air of uncertainty. In fact, this Court has allowed several writ petitions recently
under similar circumstances and ultimately, the writ petitioners therein were provisionally selected
and appointed. In many of those cases, this Court has passed interim orders, pending disposal of the
writ petitions directing the Commission to permit them to participate in all the stages of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ selection. One of the recent writ petitions is W.P.No.5726/2020
dated 11.12.2020 and this Court had held ultimately as follows:
13. In any case, this Court has intervened and passed interim orders and on the basis
of which, the petitioner was allowed to participate in the counseling provisionally and
ultimately the petitioner has been favoured with the provisional appointment order
also. When the petitioner is found to be fully eligible for appointment and being
appointed also as Junior Assistant, this Court is of the view that, in all fairness, the
issue must rest at that.

14. This Court is not inclined to fathom out as to who is to be blamed in the
contention between petitioner and the respondent Commission for non availability of
the certificate in question at the crucial time. According to this Court, such blame
game is of no consequence, in view of the subsequent development wherein the
petitioner has been issued a provisional appointment order.
15. In the above circumstances, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ considered
view of this Court is that the petitioner should be allowed to enjoy the fruition of the
appointment without any strings attached to her appointment. This is particularly so,
that the petitioner being a Destitute Widow, has earned her appointment in her own
right.
16. Therefore, it is hereby declared that the appointment of the petitioner dated
28.11.2020, as Junior Assistant, Public Health and Preventive Department, is not to
be construed as provisional appointment on account of pending of this writ petition.
The Commission is directed to issue necessary clarification in this regard
expeditiously.
10. In view of the above, it is hereby declared that the appointment of the petitioner
dated 04.11.2020 as Typist in Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment
Department, is not to be construed as provisional appointment on account of the
pending of this writ petition. The Commission is directed to issue necessary
clarification in this regard expeditiously.

11. With the above observation, this Writ Petition stands allowed. No costs. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petition is closed.
