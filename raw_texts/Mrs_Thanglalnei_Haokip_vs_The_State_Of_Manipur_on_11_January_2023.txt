Mrs. Thanglalnei Haokip vs The State Of Manipur on 11 January, 2023
[1] By order dated 30.08.2022 of the Special Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, Mangkholien Haokip was subjected to detention in exercise of power under
Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic W.P. (Cril.) No. 31 of 2022
Page 1 Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. His wife filed the present writ
petition assailing the said order and seeking a writ of habeas corpus to set her
husband at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Athouba
Khaidem, learned Government Advocate, appearing for respondent Nos. 1 & 2; and
Mr. S. Kaminikumar, learned CGC, appearing for respondent No. 3.
[3] The primary ground of challenge urged by Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel, is that there is
inordinate delay on the part of the State in dealing with the representation submitted by the
petitioner's husband against his detention. The detenu submitted 3 (three) representations in all.
His first representation is dated 24.09.2022, whereby he sought revocation/cancellation of the
detention order dated 30.08.2022. By way of his second representation dated 04.10.2022, he sought
a particular document which found mention in the detention order and the grounds of detention, so
as to enable him to make an effective and purposeful representation to the authorities concerned.
Having received the said document, he then submitted representation dated 24.10.2022, reiterating
his request to revoke the detention order dated 30.08.2022.
[4] The Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, filed an affidavit-in-opposition.
Therein, he stated that the first representation dated 24.09.2022 submitted by the detenu was not
found in the records of the Home Department and, as such, no action was taken upon the same. He
admitted receipt of the second representation dated 04.10.2022 and stated that the document
sought by the detenu was furnished to him. As regards the third representation dated 24.10.2022,
he stated that the same was forwarded to the Director General W.P. (Cril.) No. 31 of 2022 Page 2 of
Police, Manipur, for para-wise comments, under letter dated 02.11.2022, but no comments were
received till date.
[5] The file of the detaining authority was produced by Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned Government
Advocate. Perusal thereof reflects that the file has been maintained in a most casual and careless
manner and no documents are available with regard to how the representation dated 24.10.2022
was dealt with. However, the Note-file therein discloses that a decision was taken on 02.11.2022 to
request the Police Department to furnish para-wise comments upon the representation submitted
by the detenu. Thereafter, no action seems to have been taken by the Home Department to follow up
with the Police Department and, in turn, the Police Department seems to have forgotten the matter
altogether. [6] In effect, the representation submitted by the detenu as long back as on 24.10.2022
has not even been disposed of till date. In this regard, reference may be made to the observations of
a Constitution Bench, in K.M. Abdulla Kunhi vs. Union of India [(1991) 1 SCC 476], that it is beyond
the pale of controversy that the Constitutional right to make a representation under Article 22 (5),
by necessary implication, guarantees the Constitutional right to proper consideration of the
representation and, secondly, the obligation of the Government to afford to the detenu an
opportunity to make a representation and to consider such representation is distinct from the

Mrs. Thanglalnei Haokip vs The State Of Manipur on 11 January, 2023
Government's obligation to refer the case of the detenu along with the representation to the
Advisory Board. It was pointed out that the obligation of the Government to consider the
representation is different from the obligation of the Board.
W.P. (Cril.) No. 31 of 2022 Page 3
[7] Reiterating this principle in Smt. Gracy vs. State of Kerala & Anr.
[(1991) 2 SCC 1], the Supreme Court observed that the representation of a detenu against the order
of his detention has to be considered and decided by the detaining authority and the requirement of
its separate consideration by the Advisory Board would be an additional requirement implied by
Clauses 4 & 5 of Article 22. The Supreme Court affirmed that the aforesaid dual obligation of
consideration of the detenu's representation by the Advisory Board and, independently, by the
detaining authority, flows from Article 22 (5) even when the representation is addressed only to the
Advisory Board and not to the detaining authority. This principle was again reiterated in Moosa
Husein Sanghar vs State of Gujarat & Ors. [(1993) 1 SC 511].
[8] It is equally well settled that delay in consideration and disposal of the representation made by a
detenu against his detention would be fatal to its very validity and continuance. In Rajammal vs.
State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme Court observed that if delay is caused in
consideration of the detenu's representation owing to indifference or any other lapse, such delay
would adversely affect further detention of the prisoner. According to the Supreme Court, it is for
the authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation and it is not
enough to say that the delay is very short, as even longer delay can as well be explained and so, the
test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned. Be it
noted that the unexplained delay in that case was a mere 5 days. [9] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem
Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur [AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside
an W.P. (Cril.) No. 31 of 2022 Page 4 order of detention on the ground that there was unexplained
delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by the detenu. [10] More
recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and others [(Criminal
Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the Supreme Court
held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government denied the detenu a
valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the delay by the State Government in
disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and guarantees granted
to a detenu. [11] Though it is laudable that the Government of Manipur is waging a 'war on drugs'
and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug manufacture, trafficking and
marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its responsibility to ensure that the
procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the Constitutional and statutory
rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite this Court stating to this effect
time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to compliance with the
prescribed norms.
[12] The failure of the State authorities in disposing of the detenu's representation till date indicates
their dismal and utterly casual approach in discharging their functions keeping Constitutional
objectives in mind. The same would also be fatal to the validity and continuance of the impugned

detention order. [13] The order of detention dated 30.08.2022 issued by the Special Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based
thereon shall also stand set aside. The detenu, W.P. (Cril.) No. 31 of 2022 Page 5 Mangkholien
Haokip, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, shall be set at liberty forthwith
unless his continued incarceration is validly required in connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 31 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
A copy of this order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information
and necessary further action in the context of educating the detaining authorities and the police
authorities in the State of Manipur as to what are the procedural and temporal norms that they need
to adhere to while exercising power and jurisdiction under preventive detention laws.
