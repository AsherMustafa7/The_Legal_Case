COMMON JUDGMENT
(Delivered by The Hon'ble Chief Justice) Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it has been
pointed out by the appellants that in view of the Full Bench decision in the case of Government of
Tamil Nadu and Others vs. R.Kaliyamoorthy, reported in 2019 (6) CTC 705, all these appeals are
covered by the said decision, hence, they deserve to be disposed of accordingly.
2. Learned counsel for the respondents tried to draw a distinction by citing the decision of the Apex
Court in the case of Prem Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh and Others, reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516
contending that the said judgment had been delivered __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
W.A.Nos.149 to 156 and 212 of 2020 approximately three months prior to the Full Bench judgment
and the same has not been taken into consideration, hence, the ratio of the judgment of the Supreme
Court should be, accordingly, applied for the disposal of these appeals.
3. Having considered the submissions raised, we find that the judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of Prem Singh (supra) was delivered on the facts of that case, whereas, in the present matter,
the relevant Government Orders promulgating the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 have been
specifically considered, whereafter the Full Bench has answered the question referred to it, which, in
our opinion, squarely governs the field of law involved herein. The same being a Full Bench decision
is binding on us.
4.In view of what has been stated above, there is no reason for us to take a different view by applying
the law laid down in the case of Prem Singh (supra).
Accordingly, all these writ appeals are disposed of in terms of paragraph 46 of the Full Bench
judgment referred above and shall be __________ http://www.judis.nic.in W.A.Nos.149 to 156
and 212 of 2020 applicable as per the respective categories involved in each of these appeals. No
costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
