JUDGMENT
Tashi Rabstan - Judge
1. This Letters Patent Appeal is directed against the judgment dated 19.03.2021 passed by the
learned Single Judge in OWP No.01/2013, whereby the learned Single Judge while allowing the
petition, held that the writ petitioner is entitled to compensation of rupees ten lacs as minimum
compensation for the death of her husband.
2. The facts, as gathered from the writ file, are that the husband of writ petitioner, namely, Kartar
Chand died of electrocution by high intensity electric line on 25.07.2011 at Bajalata, Jammu, when
he was working as a Mason on the roof of the house of one Puran Chand son of Mangal Das.
Accordingly, FIR No.212/2011 was registered at Police Station, Nagrota under Section 304-A RPC
against the concerned officials of Power Development Department. Writ petitioner filed OWP
No.01/2013 seeking compensation from the writ respondents-appellants herein on account of
negligence on the part of writ respondents.

3. The learned Single Judge while allowing the writ petition vide judgment dated 19.03.2021 held
that the writ petitioner is entitled to rupees ten lacs as minimum compensation. Feeling aggrieved,
the appellants-writ respondents have filed the instant appeal.
4. Heard learned counsel appearing for the parties, considered their rival contentions and also
perused the appeal file. Record of writ petition was also called from the Registry.
5. The stand of appellants-writ respondents is that when the writ petitioner filed OWP No.01/2013
seeking compensation on account of death of her husband due to electrocution, at the relevant time
Government Order No.328- PDD of 2011 dated 24.11.2011 was in force, whereby an ex-gratia relief
of rupees three lacs had been allowed in case of death of a civilian due to electrocution. The stand of
appellants-writ respondents is that even if any consideration was required under the policy, the writ
petitioner was required to be allowed rupees three lacs in terms of order dated 24.11.2011 (supra).
However, the learned Single Judge allowed rupees ten lacs as minimum compensation in favour of
writ petitioner while relying upon Government Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019, whereby
an ex-gratia relief of rupees ten lacs has been allowed in case of death of a civilian due to
electrocution due to the negligence of the Power Development Department. The further stand of
appellants-writ respondents is that since the order dated 24.10.2019 (supra) does not have
retrospective effect and the incident-in- question was of July, 2011; as such the learned Single Judge
was wrong in allowing rupees ten lacs as minimum compensation in favour of writ petitioner.
6. The husband of writ petitioner is stated to be died on 25.07.2011 due to electrocution and the writ
respondents in their objections have not disputed the same. Further, in paragraph-9 of the writ
petition, the writ petitioner has specifically averred that after the death of her husband she
approached the respondents through the medium of representations/requests for grant of adequate
compensation, but the writ respondents had failed to do the needful. One such representation is also
annexed with the writ petition, addressed to the Commissioner-cum-Secretary to Government,
Power Development Department; Development Commissioner (Power) and Chief Engineer, Power
Development Department. The writ respondents while making reply to this paragraph have not
rebutted the same in any manner; meaning thereby the writ respondents have admitted the contents
of the paragraphs but despite that they did nothing, which shows their lackluster approach and
indifferent attitude in dealing with such cases involving compassion, which raises a serious question
mark on their functioning.
7. As regards the stand of appellants-writ respondents that even if any consideration was required
under the policy the writ petitioner was required to be allowed rupees three lacs in terms of order
dated 24.11.2011 (supra), we deem it proper to reproduce hereunder the relevant portion of
paragraph-i (Factual Matrix) of the objections filed by the writ respondents to the writ petition:
"It is relevant to mention here that in terms of policy envisaged by the Government
for grant of ex-gratia relief to departmental and non-departmental persons who are
killed/grievously incapacitated due to electric related accidents are governed under
Government Order No.328-PDD of 2011 read with Government Order No.454-F of
2019 dated 24.10.2019 subject to the explicit condition that the accident is not

attributable to them but to the lapses, attributable to the Power Department, as
verified by the Director, TT&C."
8. In the objections the writ respondents have themselves averred that the persons who are killed
due to electric related accidents are governed under Government Order No.328-PDD of 2011 read
with Government Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019, i.e., Government Order No.328-PDD of
2011 cannot be read in isolation after issuance of Government Order No.454-F of 2019 on the same
subject; meaning thereby the writ petitioner though was entitled to get ex-gratia relief of rupees
three lacks before issuance of order dated 24.10.2019, but once the writ respondents failed to pay
her the said compensation for such a long period and, in the meantime, the Government issued
another order enhancing the ex gratia relief, the learned Single Judge was justified in allowing
rupees ten lacs as minimum compensation in terms of order dated 24.10.2019 as the judgment came
to be delivered on 19.03.2021, i.e., much after the issuance of Government order dated 24.10.2019.
Further, although the writ petition came to be filed in January, 2013, but the writ respondents filed
objections to the writ petition on 12.12.2019, i.e., after the issuance of order dated 24.10.2019
(supra) and that is why the writ respondents while filing objections to the writ petition had averred
that such accidents are governed under Government Order No.328-PDD of 2011 read with
Government Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019, i.e., in their own wording while allowing
ex-gratia relief in such like matters order dated 24.10.2019 cannot be ignored. The fault, therefore,
lies on the part of writ respondents who took seven years to file objections to the writ petition when
the Government Order dated 24.10.2019 (supra) had already been issued. Further, order dated
24.10.2019 is a beneficial order issued by the Government in larger public interest with an objective
to provide dignified/sufficient monetary support to the families of such victims so as to save them
from living a destitute life.
9. Further, in paragraph-D of the grounds of instant appeal, the appellants have also questioned
allowing of 6% interest by the learned Single Judge on the ground that though the writ petition was
filed in the year 2013 but the same had remained pending consideration before the Court for about
eight years; meaning thereby the appellants have attributed the delay in deciding the writ petition
on the part of the Court itself.
10. It is to be seen here that the writ petition came to be filed on 1st January, 2013. Notice of the writ
petition came to be issued on 2nd January, 2013; relevant portion of the order is reproduced
hereunder:
Issue Notice.
Ms Shekhar accepts notice for respondents. Response to Writ Petition within four
weeks. List in February, 2013.
11. Thus, when the notice was issued on 02.01.2013, on the very said date Mrs Seema Shekhar, the
then AAG, waived notice on behalf of writ respondents. She was directed to file objections to the writ
petition within four weeks and the matter was directed to be listed in February, 2013. Thereafter,
the matter was listed on 22.02.2013, 21.08.2014, 08.09.2014 and 13.03.2015 but the writ

Union Territory Of J&K And Another vs Kamlo Devi on 28 March, 2023
respondents failed to file objections to the writ petition. Again, when the matter was listed on
16.04.2015, last and final opportunity was granted to the writ respondents for filing objections,
failing which the right to file objections was to be closed. Thereafter, the matter was listed on
14.08.2019 and then on 15.10.2019 when the learned counsel for respondents sought one more
opportunity for filing objections, which was granted subject to payment of rupees ten thousand as
costs. After that the matter was listed on 04.12.2019 and once again the writ respondents failed to
file objections. Again the matter was listed on 28.12.2019 when it was stated that the objections had
been filed on 12.12.2019 and the costs have been paid; meaning thereby the writ respondents took
almost seven years in filing objections to the writ petition. On 02.01.2013 it was directed by the
learned Single Judge to file objections within four weeks (04), but the writ respondents took three
hundred and fifty six weeks (356 weeks) in filing objections to the writ petition, least bothering that
the writ petitioner had been hankering from pillar to post for getting compensation on account of
death of her husband due to electrocution due to the negligence of Power Development Department.
Now in paragraph-D of the grounds of instant appeal the writ respondents have shamefully
attributed the delay of eight years in deciding the writ petition on the part of the Writ Court. It the
writ respondents had filed the objections within the time allowed, the writ petition might have been
decided much before issuance of Government Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019 enhancing
the ex-gratia relief from rupees three lacs to rupees ten lacs. Therefore, at this stage it does not lie in
the mouth of writ respondents to claim that the learned Single Judge ought to have allowed
compensation in terms of Government Order No.328- PDD of 2011 dated 24.11.2011 instead of
Government Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019. Therefore, this appeal is nothing but sheer
wastage of court time and public money by those running the affairs of the UT.
12. Viewed thus, while upholding the judgment of learned Single Judge, we do not find any merit in
the appeal and the same is, accordingly, dismissed along with connected CM.
