proprietor of M/s Anjali Motors, was awarded two Government contracts for vehicle repair and
maintenance; one pertaining to the period commencing from 25.05.1999 to 29.06.2000 and the
other related to the period from 30.06.2000 to 29.06.2001.
(4) Dispute arose regarding payment of the aforesaid work order between the parties. The
respondent had agitated this dispute in Writ Petition No. 1505 (M/B) of 2003 : M/s Anjali Motors
Vs. State of U.P. and others, wherein a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court, vide order dated
08.01.2007, having regard to claims and counter-claims of the two parties, referred the dispute
subsisting between the parties to an arbitrator for settlement of the accounts. The learned Sole
Arbitrator framed inasmuch as five issues and awarded Rs.50,69,642/- in favour of the respondent
vide award dated 22.01.2008.
(5) Aggrieved by the award dated 22.01.2008, the appellants had filed Original Suit No. 78 of 2008
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act, 1996'),
which was dismissed by the District Judge, Lucknow vide order dated 18.09.2012. Not satisfied with
the order dated 18.09.2012, appellants preferred First Appeal From Order No. 1208 of 2012 : State
of U.P. and another Vs. Smt. Anjali Gupta and a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court, vide order
18.03.2013, while allowing the FAFO, set-aside the aforesaid award and remitted back the matter to
the learned Arbitrator on same terms and conditions as settled by the earlier order dated
08.01.2007 with direction to make an award regarding all the subsisting disputes between the
parties for settlement of accounts.
(6) Against the aforesaid order dated 18.03.2013, the respondent had filed Special Leave to Appeal
(Civil) No. 16154 of 2013, which was dismissed by the Apex Court on 26.02.2014. Thereafter, the
Sole Arbitrator, accepted the claim of the respondent and rejected the counter-claim of the
appellants vide award dated 02.08.2018, against which the appellants had filed Arbitration Case No.
79 of 2021 under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 before the Commercial Court No.1, Lucknow, which
was dismissed vide order dated 14.02.2024. It is this order dated 14.02.2024, which has been
challenged in the present appeal.
(7) A close examination of the present appeal would reveal that this appeal has been filed by the
appellants with a delay of about 141 days from the date of the impugned judgment and 129 days as
per the affidavit of condonation of delay. The reasons for delay has been mentioned in paragarphs 2
to 7 of the affidavit accompanying the application for condonation of delay, which reads as under :-
"2. That as regards the facts and circumstances under which the instant Arbitration
Appeal could not be filed earlier, it is relevant to submit here that the copy of the
Judgment and order dated 14.02.2024 passed by the learned Commercial Court No.
1, Lucknow in Arbitration Petition No. 79 of 2021-State of U.P. and another Versus
Anjali Gupta was received on 04.03.2024.
3. That immediately after receiving the copy of the Judgment and Order dated
14.02.2024 the matter was referred to the Department of Law and Justice, who
advised to receive legal opinion of the learned Chief Standing Counsel. Accordingly,

State Of U.P. Thru. Secy. Estate Deptt. ... vs Smt. Anjali Gupta on 30 May, 2025
the Appellant No. 2 vide his letter dated 2.03.2024 referred to the learned Chief
Standing Counsel, High Court, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow, who vide letter No.499
dated 09.05.2024 recorded his opinion.
4. That thereafter the State Government referred the matter to the Department of
Law and Justice, who vide Government Order dated 11.06.2024 granted permission
for the First Appeal against the Judgment and order dated 14.02.2024 passed by the
learned Commercial Court No. 1, Lucknow in Arbitration Petition No. 79 of
2021-State of U.P. and another Versus Anjali Gupta.
5. That thereafter the learned Chief Standing Counsel assigned the matter to one of
the learned Standing Counsel, on 09.07.2024, who on being contacted by the
pairokar drafted the first appeal in part and advised the pairokar to make available
legible copies of the pleadings before the Commercial Court No. 1, Lucknow. The
learned Standing wrote a letter No. 10250/Civil dated 15.07.2024 to the Assistant
State Estate Officer, U.P. Government Rajya Sampatti Anubhag-3 for making
available the copies of the Memo of Arbitration Petition No. 79 of 2021,
reply/objection filed by the Claimant-respondent Smt. Anjali Gupta and also the
delay explanation regarding delay occurred in filing of the First Appeal.
6. That the Assistant State Estate Officer, U.P. Government vide letter dated
19.07.2024 made available delay explanation and the other required record.
7. That thereafter in two sittings respectively on 25.07.2024 and 05.08.2024 the
memo of First Appeal, Application for condonation of delay with affidavit, application
for interim relief, Affidavit of service and dates and events were drafted and now the
First appeal is being filing without any further delay after completing it in all
respect."
(8) Before proceeding further, we deem it apt to discuss the law of limitation holding the ground for
filing an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 read with Section 13 of the Act, 2015. Section 37 of
the Act, 1996 deals with general provision for filing appeal, which inter alia provides as under : -
"(1) [Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,
an appeal] shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the Court
authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the
order, namely: -
[(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8;
(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9;
(c) Setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159555455/ 3
State Of U.P. Thru. Secy. Estate Deptt. ... vs Smt. Anjali Gupta on 30 May, 2025
(2) Appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the arbitral tribunal--
(a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 16; or
(b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17.
(3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but
nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the Supreme
Court."
(9) Apparently, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 does not provide any specific limitation
for filing such appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 as it provides
for filing an objection/application against the Arbitral Award as per section 34 (3) of the said Act.
However, Section 43 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides that the Limitation Act,
1963 ('hereinafter referred to as 'Limitation Act') shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to
proceedings in Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Consolidated Engineering
Enterprises v. Irrigation Department: (2008) 7 SCC 169] held that where the Limitation Act
prescribes a period of limitation for appeals or applications to any Court and the special Act does not
prescribe any period of limitation, then the limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act will be
applicable along with Sections 4 to 24 thereof, unless they are expressly excluded by the special Act.
Thus, by necessary implication, the period for preferring an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996
would be as per Article 116 or Article 117 of the Schedule provided for in the Limitation Act. Suffice
to say, that Articles 116 and 117 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period
of 90 days for filing an appeal from any other Court to a High Court and a period of 30 days for
filing an intra appeal before the High Court, i.e., order passed by a Single Bench to the Division
Bench, provided the law provides for such an appeal before the Division Bench. Having quoted and
mentioned Article 116 and 117 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act, applicable ordinarily for the
aforesaid nature of appeals, it goes without saying that in case of any delay in preferring any such
appeals, Section 5 of the Limitation Act provides for extension of the prescribed limitation period,
provided the applicant satisfies the Court that there was a 'sufficient cause' for such delay.
(10) However, with the promulgation of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as
'Commercial Courts Act'), a new regime of limitation for filing of the appeals under Section 37 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 came to force. Section 13 of the Commercial Court Act inter
alia states :-
"Section 13: Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.
(1) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the
level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a
period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order.
(1A) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the
level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159555455/ 4
State Of U.P. Thru. Secy. Estate Deptt. ... vs Smt. Anjali Gupta on 30 May, 2025
Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate
Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the
judgment or order:
Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division
or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).] (2) Notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a
High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or
Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act."
(11) Thus, the limitation for preferring of an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 in view of the Commercial Court Act, is sixty days only and, of course, the
provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would apply for condonation of delay. However, there is
a caveat, inasmuch as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd.:
(2020) 2 SCC 111, while adjudicating the similar issue of limitation for filing of an appeal under
Section 37 of the Act, 1996, has engrafted a limitation period of 120 days from the date of passing of
the order and held that any further delay beyond 120 days cannot be allowed, which in a way ruled
out the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act in preferring an appeal under Section 37 of the
Act, 1996. Hon'ble Supreme Court while noting that since as per Section 34 of the Act, 1996,
application has to be filed within a maximum period of 120 days, which also included a grace period
of 30 days and nothing more, therefore, an appeal filed from the same should also be covered by the
same ratio, has observed in the following words:
"Ordinarily, we would have applied the said judgment to this case as well. However,
we find that the impugned Division Bench judgment dated 10.04.2013 has dismissed
the appeal filed by the Union of India on the ground of delay. The delay was found to
be 142 days in filing the appeal and 103 days in refiling the appeal. One of the
important points made by the Division Bench is that, apart from the fact that there is
no sufficient cause made out in the grounds of delay, since a Section 34 application
has to be filed within a maximum period of 120 days including the grace period of 30
days, an appeal filed from the self-same proceeding under Section 37 should be
covered by the same drill. Given the fact that an appellate proceeding is a
continuation of the original proceeding, as has been held in Lachmeshwar Prasad
Shukul and Others vs. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri and Others, AIR 1941 Federal Court 5,
and repeatedly followed by our judgments, we feel that any delay beyond 120 days in
the filing of an appeal under Section 37 from an application being either dismissed or
allowed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 should not be
allowed as it will defeat the overall statutory purpose of arbitration proceedings being
decided with utmost despatch."
In this view of the matter, since even the original appeal was filed with a delay period of 142 days, we
are not inclined to entertain these Special Leave Petitions on the facts of this particular case."

State Of U.P. Thru. Secy. Estate Deptt. ... vs Smt. Anjali Gupta on 30 May, 2025
(12) Thus, the Hon'ble Supreme Court declined to condone the delay of 142 days in filing of appeal
in Varindera Construction Ltd. (supra) by holding that a maximum period of 120 days is available to
a party filing an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and to the
same effect is another judgment of the Apex Court in M/s N. V. International v. the State of Assam
and Ors. : (2020) 2 SCC 109, wherein also the Apex Court reiterated the position as stated in
Virendra Constructions Ltd. (supra) and declined to condone a delay of 189 days from the 90 days in
filing an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996. The Apex Court in the said judgment also placed
emphasis upon the main object of the Act, i.e., speedy disposal of arbitral disputes and held that any
delay beyond 120 days cannot be condoned.
(13) In both these decisions, the earlier judgment i.e. Consolidated Engineering Enterprises (Supra)
could not be noted.
(14) Law laid down in both the cases i.e Varindera Construction Ltd. (supra) and M/s N.V.
International (supra) came up for consideration before a three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in
Government of Maharashtra Vs M/s Borse Brothers Engineers & Contractors Pvt. Ltd. : 2021 SCC
OnLine SC 233, wherein the Apex Court noted the conflicting position vis-a-vis Consolidated
Engineering Ltd (supra) and taking into consideration the provisions of Commercial Courts Act,
2015 and decision Consolidated Engineering Ltd. (supra) held that if the specified value of the
subject matter is INR 3,00,000.00 or more, then an appeal under Section 37 of the Act must be filed
within 60 days from the date of the order as per Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act.
However, in those rare cases, where the specified value is for a sum less than INR 3,00,000.00 then
the appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 would be governed by Articles 116 and 117 of the
Schedule of the Limitation Act, as the case may be. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case has
held that Section 37 of the Act, 1996 when read with Section 43 of the Act, 1996 and Section 29(2) of
the Limitation Act, makes it clear that Section 5 of the Limitation Act will apply to the appeals filed
under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 and in holding the said applicability, the Apex Court noted with
affirmative that Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act does not contain any provision akin
to section 34(3) of the Act, 1996 and merely provides for a limitation period of 60 days from the date
of the judgment or order appealed against, without going into whether delay beyond this period can
or cannot be condoned. However, the Apex Court also noted that condonation of delay, although
allowed, cannot be seen in complete isolation of the main objective of the Act, i.e. speedy disposal of
disputes. In the light of the same, the Apex Court observed that the expression 'sufficient cause'
under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not elastic enough to cover long delay and merely because
sufficient cause has been made out, there is no right to have such delay condoned. The Apex Court
further held that only short delay can be condoned by way of an exception and not by the way of
rule, and that too, only when the party acted in a bona fide manner and not negligently. Thus, the
Apex Court has inter alia held in Government of Maharashtra Vs M/s Borse Brothers Engineers &
Contractors Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) as follows :-
"61. Given the aforesaid and the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved both
under the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act, for appeals filed
under section 37 of the Arbitration Act that are governed by Articles 116 and 117 of
the Limitation Act or section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, a delay beyond 90

State Of U.P. Thru. Secy. Estate Deptt. ... vs Smt. Anjali Gupta on 30 May, 2025
days, 30 days or 60 days, respectively, is to be condoned by way of exception and not
by way of rule. In a fit case in which a party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in
a negligent manner, a short delay beyond such period can, in the discretion of the
court, be condoned, always bearing in mind that the other side of the picture is that
the opposite party may have acquired both in equity and justice, what may now be
lost by the first party's inaction, negligence or laches."
(15) Now, we consider to the application filed by the appellants seeking condonation of delay in
filing of the present appeal under Section 37 of Act, 1996.
(16) Keeping in mind the aforesaid, on perusal of the condonation of delay application and
supporting affidavit filed by the appellants, this Court finds that "sufficient cause" has not been
made out by the appellants to condone the delay of 141 days in filing the appeal.
(17) Dealing with the identical situation, recently, this Court has dismissed Appeal Under Section 37
of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 Defective No. 9 of 2025 : The Project Director, Uphsdp,
Lucknow And Ors. Vs. Commercial Court No. 1 Lucknow Thru Its Presiding Officer and Ors. vide
judgment and order dated 07.05.2025, on the ground of limitation.
(18) In view of the aforesaid, application for condonation of delay is hereby rejected. Consequently,
the present appeal is also dismissed.
