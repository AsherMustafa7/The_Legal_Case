N.Prasad vs Harithalakshmi on 20 July, 2020
This petition has been filed to quash the proceedings initiated under the Domestic Violence Act in
D.V.C.No.186 of 2017 on the file of the Mahila Court, Allikulam, Chennai.
2. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is the husband of
the respondent herein and they got married on 27.11.2011 under the Hindu rites and customs. Due
to their wed lock, they gave birth to a female child on 17.11.2012. Thereafter unfortunately, there was
a misunderstanding between the petitioner and the respondent and as such, the respondent left the
matrimonial home and went to her parents home in the month of July, 2014. Thereafter, in the year
2015, the petitioner filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in O.P.No.3110 of 2015 on the file of
the III Additional Family Court, Chennai. The respondent also appeared in the divorce proceedings
and filed her counter on 22.08.2016. In fact, she also filed a petition in O.P.No.3796 of 2016 for
restitution of conjugal rights. He further submitted that the respondent lived along with the
petitioner only about 100 days and thereafter she left the matrimonial home and stayed at her
parents house.
http://www.judis.nic.in 2.1. The learned counsel further submitted that in the counter filed in the
divorce petition as well as the petition for restitution of conjugal rights, there is absolutely no
allegations as against the family members, and now the respondent filed this present complaint
under Domestic Violence Act. Therefore, it is nothing but counter complaint to escape from the legal
proceedings filed by the petitioner herein. She also impleaded other family members under
Domestic Violence Act, and they were no way connected in this case and also no relief sought for
against them, under the Domestic Violence Act. Therefore it is nothing but clear abuse of process of
law and only to harass the petitioner and his family members, the respondent instituted this case.
2.2. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner also submitted that the present complaint was
filed on 11.05.2017 before the Protection Officer under the Domestic Violence Act, after three years
from the date on which the respondent left from the matrimonial home. In fact, she left the
matrimonial home in the month of July, 2014 and thereafter she lodged this present complaint that
too after filing the petition for restitution of conjugal rights. Hence the present complaint is barred
by limitation, since it was filed after three years from the date on which, the respondent left the
matrimonial http://www.judis.nic.in home. The domestic violence complaint has been filed after
the lapse of one year 10 months. Therefore it is barred by limitation and the learned Magistrate
ought not to have been taken cognizance under the Domestic Violence Act. Therefore, he prayed for
quashment of this proceeding.
3. Heard Mr.P.K.Rajagobal, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner. Though notice served to
the respondent, no one is appeared on behalf of her.
4. This petition has been filed to quash the proceeding initiated by the respondent herein in
D.V.C.No.186 of 2017 for the relief under Sections 18 to 22 of the Domestic Violence Act. The
petitioner is arrayed as first respondent in the complaint lodged by the respondent herein.
Admittedly, the petitioner got married the respondent on 27.11.2011 at Dharmaprakash Thirumana
Mandapam, No.10, Raja Annamalai Salai, Purasaiwalkam, Chennai-84, under the Hindu rites and
customs. It was an arranged marriage. Due to their wed lock, they gave birth to a female child on

N.Prasad vs Harithalakshmi on 20 July, 2020
17.11.2012. Thereafter there was a misunderstanding between them as such, the respondent left the
matrimonial home in the month of July, 2014.
http://www.judis.nic.in
5. Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and
other grounds in O.P.No.3110 of 2015 and the same is pending on the file of the III Additional
Family Court, Chennai. After receipt of the notice, the respondent appeared before the said Court
and filed counter on 22.08.2016 in O.P.No.3110 of 2015. Thereafter, the respondent also filed a
petition for restitution of conjugal rights in O.P.No.3796 of 2016 on 28.09.2016 and the same also
pending for trial on the file of the III Additional Family Court, Chennai. After filing the petition for
restitution of conjugal rights, in the year 2017, viz., on 11.05.2017, the respondent lodged the present
complaint before the Protection Officer under the Domestic Violence Act in D.V.C.No.186 of 2017.
Therefore, after the period of three years from the date on which, the respondent left from the
matrimonial home, the present complaint has been filed.
6. In this regard, it is relevant to cite the order dated 04.04.2019 passed by this Court in
Crl.O.P.No.11087 of 2017, in the case of V.Nagarajan and ors Vs. B.P.Thangaveni, which reads as
follows:-
"6. In this regard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners relied upon the
judgment reported in 2012 Crl.L.J.309 in the case http://www.judis.nic.in of Inderjit
Singh Grewal Vs. Sate of Punjab & Anr., which reads as follows:-
"24. Submissions made by Shri Ranjit Kumar on the issue of limitation, in view of the
provisions of Section 468 Code of Criminal Procedure, that the complaint could be
filed only within a period of one year from the date of the incident seem to be
preponderous in view of the provisions of Sections 28 and 32 of the Act 2005 read
with Rule 15(6) of The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules, 2006
which make the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure applicable and stand
fortified by the judgments of this Court in Japani Sahoo v. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty
AIR 2007 SC 2762; and Noida Entrepreneurs Association v. Noida and Ors. (2011) 6
SCC 508.
25. In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that permitting the
Magistrate to proceed further with the complaint under the provisions of the Act
2005 is not compatible and in consonance with the decree of divorce which still
subsists and thus, the process amounts to abuse of the process of the court.
Undoubtedly, for quashing a complaint, the court has to take its contents on its face
value and in case the same discloses an offence, the court generally does not
http://www.judis.nic.in interfere with the same. However, in the backdrop of the
factual matrix of this case, permitting the court to proceed with the complaint would
be travesty of justice. Thus, interest of justice warrants quashing of the same."

N.Prasad vs Harithalakshmi on 20 July, 2020
The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that under Sections 28 and 32 of the Act 2005 r/w Rule
15(6) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules, 2006 which make the provisions of
the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable. Accordingly, the respondent ought to have been lodged
complaint within a period of one year from the date of incident.
7. In the light of the above discussion, this Court is of the considered opinion that the complaint
lodged by the respondent under the Domestic Violence Act cannot be sustained as against the
petitioner. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition allowed and the entire proceeding in
D.V.C.No.186 of 2017 on the file of the Mahila Court (Magisterial Level), Allikulam, Chennai, is
hereby quashed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
