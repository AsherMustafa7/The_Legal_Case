petitions were heard together and are being disposed of by this common order.
4. The first petitioner in W.P.(C) No.623 of 2022 is stated to be a Headman of Lanthungching
Village, Kangchup Geljang Sub-Division, Kangpokpi District, Manipur and according to him, he

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 3
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
1990. WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 Page |6 Accordingly, the
schedule boundary land of Langthungching and Rangailong were demarcated in Hill
Misc. Case No.2/SDC/KCP of 1992 and Hill Misc. Case No.3/SDC/KCP of 1992 dated
19.8.1992. After conducting election to the Village Authority, both villages became a
full-fledged hill house tax paying villages under KangchupGeljang Sub-Division,
Kangpokpi District, Manipur recorded in Touzi Book of Record as Village Nos.93 and
129 respectively maintained by the competent authority.
5.1. The villagers are Scheduled Tribe forest dwellers, who depend on the forest land
for bona fide livelihood needs and they did their cultivation in the existing Langol
Housing Complex area and above the hill for livelihood. The village history reveal
that the two villages are now more than 50 years old andthe villagers in the two
villages have also participated in the election to 51-Saitu Assembly Constituency and
are enjoying NREGS, IAY, Ration Card under NFSA. Anganwadi Centre, Community
Hall and Government Primary School have also been constructed under Kangpokpi.
5.2. Since the petitioners are all forest dwelling Scheduled Tribals, they primarily
reside in the village of forest WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022
Page |7 area and they comes under the provisions of the Schedule Tribe and Other
Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Right) Act, 2006 [for short, "the
Act of 2006"] and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers
(Recognition of Forest Rights), Rules, 2008 (for short, "the Rules of 2008").
Thus, the villagers have forest right as laid down in Section 4(1) of the Act of 2006.
5.3. Before the enactment of the Act of 2006, the question of conferring titleship to the villagers was
started by the Government of Manipur to issue patta for the villagers. In this connection, the
Conservator of Forest, vide letter dated 16.7.1975, addressed to the Secretary (Forest) requested to
allow the settlement and the Sub-Divisional Officer, Sadar Hills, West Kangpokpi addressed a letter
dated 25.7.1980 to the Chief Conservator of Forest requesting for issuance of no objection certificate
to allow the settlement and, by another letter dated 22.2.1986, the Under Secretary, Government of
Manipur written to the Chief Conservator of Forest requested for grant of patta and not to evict
them, as they are living for nearly 20 years. The Under Secretary (Forest), Government of Manipur,
vide letter dated 16.4.1990, addressed to the Principal WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of
2022 Page |8 Chief Conservator of Forest requested for demarcation of C. Phailen village.
5.4. In the follow up action, the Assistant Conservator of Forest, by the letter dated 30.5.2000
written to the Range Officer, Sadar West regarding demarcation between the Langol Reserve Forest
and Langol Ramgailong and Langthungching Villages and requested to cause a detailed enquiry and
submit a report. On 13.2.2006, the Sub-Deputy Collector (Headquarters), Kangpokpi, Sadar Hill
had submitted hill house tax in respect of Langthungching and Ramgailong villages to the District
Forest Officer, Central Forest Division, Government of Manipur. On 11.8.2010, the Deputy Secretary
(Forest & Environment), Government of Manipur addressed a communication to the Chief
Conservator of Forest requesting for necessary verification to issue allotment order by excluding
from the purview of plan of eviction. While so, the Forest Department, from time to time, issued
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 4
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
eviction notices to the villagers to vacate from the encroached land in the Langol Reserve Forest.
5.5. Challenging the eviction notices, the father of the first petitioner in W.P.(C) No.623 of 2022 and
the other villagers WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 Page |9 have filed writ
petitions before the Guwahati High Court and while disposing of the writ petitions, the Guwahati
High Court directed the respondents therein not to evict the petitioners from their village. On
25.7.2022, the Divisional Forest Officer, Central Forest Division, Manipur had issued a show cause
notice of eviction to the second petitioner in W.P.(C) No.623 of 2022.
5.6. The Government of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change made sincere
efforts to recognize the traditional right of the tribal population on the forest land. The Inspector
General of Forest, Government of India addressed a communication to all the Chief Secretary of the
State and Union Territories for regularization of the rights of the tribal on the forest land and
stepping up of process for conversion of forest villages into revenue villages and also requested not
to resort to eviction of forest dwellers, including tribal other than ineligible encroachers of forest
land till complete survey is done for identification of such people and their traditional rights on
forest land.
5.7. In pursuance of the letter dated 9.5.2019 of the Additional Chief Secretary (TA & Hills), the
Deputy Commissioner, Kangpokpi, vide letter dated 17.5.2019, WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C)
No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 10 intimated the Additional Chief Secretary (TA & Hills), Government of
Manipur that the process for determining of forest right claim in respect of Lanthungching and
Ramgailong Villages have been initiated by forming Forest Right Committees. On 29.8.2019, the
Deputy Commissioner submitted details of claims of the two villages to the Additional Chief
Secretary (TA & Hills).
5.8. While joint verification process was going on, the Divisional Forest Officer has sent a
communication dated 22.7.2019 to the Chairman, Langthungching Village Authority and requested
to submit copies of (i) recognition of Village Authority by the Government; (ii) Village
Authority/Grama Sabha meeting resolution constituting Forest Right Committee with lit of
attendance; (iii) Copies of claims in prescribed format with all required documents. After
completion of the joint verification, a final report was prepared, which was approved by the Grama
Sabha and forwarded to the Chairperson, Sub- Divisional Level Committee and on 11.2.2020, the
Sub- Divisional Level Committee convened a meeting and approved 67 claims in respect of
Rangailong village and 91 claim in respect of Langthungching village. The Minutes of Meeting of
Sub-Divisional Level Committee along with 158 claim forms, WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No.
624 of 2022 P a g e | 11 consolidated report, resolution passed by the respective Grama Sabha,
proceedings of the joint verification team were forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner, Kangpokpi
District. However, the Deputy Commissioner did not convene the meeting of the District Level
Committee to consider the resolution and findings submitted by the Sub-Divisional Level
Committee. The petitioners have also submitted reminders on 22.9.2021 requesting again to
convene meeting of the District Level Committee so as to consider the claim of the villagers as per
the rules. Despite the petitioners personally approached the Deputy Commissioner, no action has
been taken till date. 5.9. According to the petitioners, in similarly situated case, being W.P.(C)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 5
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
No.457 of 2022, the petitioners claimed status of the Act of 2006 and the said writ petition was
disposed of by this Court on 27.6.2022 directing the respondents to consider the representation of
the petitioner within a period of two months from the date of receipt of copy of the order. Therefore,
the petitioners seek similar relief and direction on the respondents not to initiate any eviction
process until their claim is considered and settled. Hence, these writ petitions. WP(C) No. 623 of
2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 12
6. In W.P.(C) No.623 of 2022, the first respondent/Union of India filed affidavit-in-opposition
stating that the petitioners have not sought any relief against the first respondent and the
representation dated 22.9.2021 was addressed to the State respondent and the show cause notice
dated 25.7.2022 has not been issued by the first respondent. As per the Act of 2006 and the rules
made thereunder, the administrations of the State Governments/UTs are responsible for
implementation of various provisions of the Act. It is stated that Section 6 of the Act of 2006 lays
down the authorities and procedure for vesting of forest rights. Grama Sabha shall receive and verify
the claims through the Forest Rights Committee and after passing a resolution forward the same to
the Sub-Divisional Level Committee and the District Level Committee to consider and finally
approve the records of forest rights prepared by the Sub-Divisional Level Committee. No petition
shall be preferred directly to the District Level Committee against the resolution of the Grama
Sabha. Section 6(7) of the Act of 2006 empowers the State Government to constitute a State Level
Monitoring Committee to monitor the process of recognition and vesting of forests rights and to
submit to the nodal agency such reports and returns as may be WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C)
No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 13 called for by the agency. Since there is no prayer made against the first
respondent, the first respondent prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
7. Respondents 3, 5 and 6 filed affidavit-in- opposition stating that some of the officials, without
their jurisdiction, had tried to include Langol Reserved Forest under Senapati District while
recognising villages illegally and on 8.2.1988, the Deputy Commissioner of Senapati District
recognized a group of encroachers at Laithungching area of Langol Reserved Forest as C. Phailen
without jurisdiction. C. Phailen village as described by the boundary schedule is located inside the
boundaries of Langol Reserved Forest and also C. Phailen village was made by encroachment in
Langol Reserved Forest and the Deputy Commissioner of Senapati had not taken any approval from
the Central Government. Laithungching and Ramgailong were part of the then C. Phailen village
immediately before the recognition of C. Phailen by the Deputy Commissioner, Senapati was
cancelled and made null and void by the Revenue Department in the year 2000. The boundary
schedule as reflected in the order of recognition of the then C. Phailen village covers the area
presently occupied by Lanthungching and Ramgailong villages. Lanthungching and WP(C) No. 623
of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 14 Ramgailong were constituted by encroachers within
the Langol Reserved Forest and these localities fall within the jurisdiction of the present Imphal
West District. This is due to the fact that Langol Hill range or the Langol Reserved Forest was
transferred to the Imphal (Central) District in the year 1984. The Act of 2006 was not enacted for
regularization of encroahcers, but to recognize and vests forest rights to those forest dwelling
Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers to whom historical injustices were mated out
due to declaration of a Reserved Forest or Protected Forest etc. in their ancestral land. 7.1. It is
stated that the petitioners are not primary residents in Langol Reserved Forest land and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 6
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
petitioners and other villagers are encroachers as identified by the Committee. No settlements were
present in the area where Lanthungching and Ramgailong stand at present. The petitioners and
their villagers have encroached upon Langol Reserved Forest land much later after the declaration
of Langol Hill Range as Reserved Forest. Langol Hill Range has never been included in the District
Map of the then Senapati District or the present Kangpokpi District. The petitioners/encroachers
while trying to manipulate the Government records in their favour went to pay hill house tax and the
officials have also WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 15 accepted to
receive in connivance not considering the fact that Langol Hill Range is within the boundary of
Imphal (Central) District during that time. Langol Reserved Forest area presently occupied by the
villagers of Lanthungching and Ramgailong are not within the jurisdiction of Deputy Commissioner,
Kangpokpi, as Langol Hill Range was transferred to the erstwhile Imphal Central District (now
Imphal West) in the year 1984. The Forest Rights Committee formed in respect of Ramgailong and
Lanthungching cannot be valid, as they are formed by a group of encroachers and the Village
Authorities, which are not recognized by competent authorities.
7.2. It is stated that the District headquarters of Imphal West is barely at an aerial distance of 2 km
from the area occupied by Lanthungching and Ramgailong. However, the District headquarters of
Kangpokpi District is about 45 km from Langol Reserved Forest. Again, Langol Reserved Forest falls
under the jurisdiction of Divisional Forest Officer, Central Forest Division and, as such, all matters
relating to recognition and vesting of forest rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 in respect of
Langol Reserved Forest is being taken care of by the Central Forest Division, Government of
Manipur. The submission of relevant documents to the Sub-Divisional Level WP(C) No. 623 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 16 Committee made by the Grama Sabha after verification in
the field by Forest Rights Committee is as per the provisions of Rule 11(5) of the Forest Rights Rules,
2007. However, the members of Grama Sabha or the Forest Rights Committee are all encroachers
within Longol Reserved Forest and not primary residents at the time of declaration of Langol Hill
Range into a Reserved Forest. The petitioners have came from elsewhere and have resided in the
area because of its proximity to Imphal City. There are huge numbers of encroachments in Longol
Reserved Forest today and the number is increasing gradually. New constructions in the name and
religion such as Churches have also been constructed. This is against the direction of the Apex Court
in its order dated 29.9.2009 passed in SLP No.8519 of 2006. During Covid-19 times, two new
Churches were constructed in Ramgailong village. Since Reserved Forest are public properties,
construction of Churches in Ramgailong village is against the decision of the Apex Court. Hence,
prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
8. Mr. Phungyo Zingkhei, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners and
other villagers are Scheduled Tribe forest dwellers, who depend on the forest land for their
livelihood and they primarily resides in the village of WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of
2022 P a g e | 17 forest area as defined under Section 2(c), 2(p), 3 1(a) of the Act of 2006 and Rule
2(1)(b) of the Rules of 20008. Even before enactment of the Act of 2006, the question of conferring
title to the villagers was started by the Government of Manipur to issue patta for the villagers of
Lanthungching and Ramgailong villages.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 7
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
9. Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that when the Forest Department issued
eviction notices to the villagers to vacate them from the encroached land in Langol Reserve Forest,
the first petitioner's father and other villagers have filed writ petitions before the Guwahati High
Court and those writ petitions were disposed of by directing the official respondents not to evict the
villagers from the encroached area. The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change,
Government of India has also made an efforts to recognize the traditional right of the tribal
population on the forest land and by letter dated 3.2.2004 requested all the Chief Secretary of the
States/UTs to draw up a time bound programme for converting forest villages into revenue villages
so as to enable the people living in the villages can enjoy the fruits of development. In fact, on
7.11.2005, the Inspector General of Forest requested the Chief Secretary/Administrator of all the
States/UTs not to resort WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 18 to evict
forest dwellers, including tribals other than ineligible encroachers of forest land till complete survey
of identification/verification of such people is done and their traditional rights on forest land.
10. Drawing the attention of this Court to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Wild Life
First and others v. Union of India and other, W.P.(C) No.109 of 2008, decided on 28.2.2019, the
learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the Apex Court ordered to put on hold the
eviction of forest dwellers till all details which are to be provided by the State Governments in terms
of category wise are furnished. Pursuant to the order of the Apex Court, on 9.5.2019, the Additional
Chief Secretary (TA & Hills), Government of Manipur sent a letter to the Deputy Commissioner,
Kangpokpi/Imphal West/Imphal East Districts to initiate the process of verification claim through
Grama Sabha for determining the nature and the extent of individual and community forest rights of
Forest Dwelling Schedule Tribe and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers by receiving claims and
preparing map delineating the area of each recommended claim and the same was directed to
completed so as to enable them to an affidavit before the Apex Court. WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and
WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 19
11. The learned counsel further submitted that in compliance of the letter dated 9.5.2019, the Deputy
Commissioner, Kangpokpi intimated to the Additional Chief Secretary (TA & Hills) that process for
determining of forest right claim in respect of Lanthungching and Ramgailong villages have been
initiated by forming Forest Right Committees. On 26.8.2019, the petitioners have submitted an
information regarding the progress of the Forest Right Claim of the villagers to the Deputy
Commissioner, Kangpokpi and, on 29.8.2019, the Deputy Commissioner, Kangpokpi had also
submitted details of the claims made by the two villages to the Additional Chief Secretary (TA &
Hills).
12. The learned counsel next submitted that while the process for joint verification was going on, in
contradiction to the provisions of the Act of 2006 and the Rules framed thereunder, on 22.7.2019,
the Divisional Forest Officer, Central Forest Division addressed a communication to the Chairman
of Langthungching Village Authority requesting to submit certain documents. However, the
petitioners have sent a reply to the Divisional Forest Officer stating that the joint verification
process was going on satisfactorily and as soon as verification is completed, the Grama Sabha will
submit the final report with WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 20
required documents. On 16.12.2019, the process of joint verification of forest right claim was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 8
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
completed and after completion of joint verification, the Forest Right Committee prepared a final
report which was approved by the then Grama Sabha and forwarded the same to the Chairperson,
Sub- Divisional Level Committee altogether 158 claims along with final verification report,
consolidation claim report, maps, resolution passed by the Grama Sabha and proceedings of the
Inspection team.
13. The learned counsel then submitted that on 11.12.2020, the Sub-Divisional Level Committee
convened a meeting and approved 91 claims in respect of Langthungching village and 67 claims in
respect of Ramgailong village and the Minutes of Meeting of the Sub-Divisional Level Committee
along with other documents were forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner, Kangpokpi as per Rule
6(j) of the Rules of 2008 on 5.1.2021 by the Sub-Divisional Level Committee. However, the Deputy
Commissioner, Kangpokpi has not convened any meeting of the District Level Committee to
consider the resolution and the findings of the Sub- Divisional Level Committee and the same is
pending for the past 2 years. In this regard, on 22.9.2021, the petitioners requested the Deputy
WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 21 Commissioner of Kangpokpi to
convene the meeting so as to consider the claim of the villagers as per the rules.The petitioners are
also personally appeared before the Deputy Commissioner and requested to convene District Level
Committee meeting. Despite the receipt of the petitioners' written request dated 22.9.2021, no
action has been taken till date. Thus, a prayer has been made to direct the Deputy
Commissioner/Chairperson, District Level Committee, Kangpokpi to consider and dispose of the
claims forwarded by the Sub Divisional Officer, Kangpokpi dated 5.1.2021 and also direction on the
respondents to consider and dispose of the representation of the petitioners dated 22.9.2021.
14. Refuting the submissions made by learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned
Advocate-General appearing for the respondent State, inter alia, submitted that Langthungching
and Ramgailong villages as described by the boundary schedule is located inside the boundariesof
Langol Reserved Forest and that C.Phailen village was made by encroachment in Longol Reserved
Forest and the forest area claimed by the petitioners is within Langol Reserved Forest and also
Langol Reserved Forest is within the jurisdiction of Imphal West District since 1984. In fact, the
recognition of C. Phailen WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 22 village by
the then Deputy Commissioner, Senapati as a village within Langol Reserved Forest was cancelled
by the Government of Manipur in the year 2000 and that the villages in the name of Lanthungching
and Ramgailong recognized again by the Deputy Commissioner, Senapati in the year 2003 within
the same boundary of erstwhile C. Phailenvillage is without jurisdiction and in fact, he has no
authority as per the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 to recognize the two villages which are
within the boundary of Langol Reserved Forest and has failed to consider that the area was already
transferred to the erstwhile Imphal Central District.
15. Mr. Lenin Hijam, the learned Advocate-General further submitted that as Lanthungching and
Ramgailing fall within the boundary of Langol Reserved Forest which is also proved by the fact that
the petitioners have applied for forest rights under the Forest Rights Act, they should have made the
said submissions to the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal West District. The District headquarters of
Imphal West is barely at an aerial distance of 2 km from the area occupied by Langthunchign and
Ramgailong. However, the District headquarters of Kangpokpi District is about 45 km from Langol
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 9
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
Reserved Forest and since Langol Reserved Forest falls under WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C)
No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 23 the jurisdiction of Divisional Forest Officer, Central Forest Division, all
matters relating to the recognition and vesting of forest rights under the Forest Rights Act in respect
of Langol Reserved Forest is being taken care of by Central Forest Division, Government of
Manipur.
16. The learned Advocate-General urged that the members of the Grama Sabha or the Forest Rights
Committee are all encroachers within the Langol Reserved Forest and not the primary residents at
the time declaration of Langol Hill Range into a Reserved Forest. According to the learned
Advocate-General none of the petitioners were present in Lgangol Reserved Forest area where they
called Lanthungching and Ramgailong during the time of declaration of the Reserved Forest in the
year 1938.
17. Drawing the attention of this Court to the order dated 24.9.2011 passed in Writ Appeal
No.25(K)/2010 (Naga United/Invi Village and others v. The State of Nagaland and others), the
learned Advocate-General submitted that in the said order, the Kohima Bench of Guwahati High
Court gave Statement of Objects and Reasons for enacting the Forest Dwellers Act and that the
statute was enacted to do away with WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 24
the historical injustice subjected to the different forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other
Traditional Forest Dwellers by the State Government in manners such as not recognizing the
ancestral rights of the forest dwellers over forest land during the time of notification of forest area
into a Reserved Forest, Protected Forest, National Park, Sanctuary or alike. After such notifications,
the forest dwellers both from the Scheduled Tribes community and Traditional Forest Dwellers
continued to possess their ancestral forest land. However, they are subjected to evictions or their
peaceful possession are often disturbed under the existing laws such as the Indian Forest Act, 1927
and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
18. The learned Advocate-General then submitted that for a claim of forest right to be made under
the Act, an individual/community need to be (i) belonging to a Schedule Tribe/Tribe Community as
listed by the State Government; (ii) should have primarily resided in the forest area and (iii) should
be dependent on the forest or forest land for bona fide livelihood needs. Since the petitioners and
their villagers are not primary residents in Langol Reserved Forest and they are encroachers, they
are not entitled the forest rights under the Act of 2006. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the
writ petitions. WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 25
19. This Court also heard the submission of the learned Central Government Standing Counsel, who
submitted that since the petitioners have not prayed any relief against the Union of India and
primarily the relief sought in these writ petitions is against the respondent State/Forest
Department, the writ petitions are liable to be dismissed.
20. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
21. The grievance of the petitioners is that they are Scheduled Tribe Forest Dwellers and are settled
for more than 50 years within Langol Reserved Forest and their rights are also recognised and vest
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 10
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
under the Act of 2006. The claim of the petitioners was already approved by the Sub-Divisional
Level Committee in its meeting held on 11.12.2020 and forwarded to the Deputy
Commissioner/Chairperson, District Level Committee, Kangpokpi on 5.1.2021. However, the same
has not been considered by the Deputy Commissioner of Kakgpokpi. While so, the authorities of the
respondent State are trying to evict them from the forest land by issuing show cause notice. It is also
the grievance of the petitioners that in similar situation when the Divisional Forest Officer, Thoubal
WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 26 Forest Division, Manipur issued
show cause notices for eviction, the same has been challenged in W.P.(C) No.457 of 2022 and this
Court by the order dated 27.6.2022 entertained the writ petition and directed the respondents
therein to consider and dispose of the representation of the petitioners therein within two months
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and pending consideration of the representation, this
Court directed the respondents therein not to initiate any eviction process against the petitioners
and other similarly situated persons numbering 441 without the leave of the Court. Highlighting the
aforesaid order dated 27.6.2022, the petitioners prayed for a direction on the respondent State to
consider the representation of the petitioners and dispose of the same.
22. On the other hand, it is the case of the respondent State that Langol Reserved Forest has been in
existence since 1938 and at the time of declaring Langol Hills as Reserved Forest, Manipur was an
independent princely sovereign State. In spite of Langol Reserved Forest being in the middle or
central portion of the valley, which is more appropriately included in Imphal (Central District) was
taken to be a part of the then Senapati District while some officials were trying to recognize the
localities constituted by encroachers within Langol WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of
2022 P a g e | 27 Reserved Forest and the first of such kind of recognition of village being C.Phailen
village whose recognition was eventually cancelled by the competent authorities of the Government
of Manipur on the ground of illegality. The Langol Reserved Forest or Langol Hill Range has never
been mentioned to be a part of the erstwhile Senapati District. In the year 1988, the then Deputy
Commissioner of Senapati District recognized a group of encroachers at the Lanthungching and
Ramgailong of Langol Reserved Forest as C.Phailen without jurisdiction. The Deputy
Commissioner, Senapati did not have jurisdiction on two grounds, namely Lanthungching and
Ramgailong were outside the jurisdiction of Senapati District as Langol Hill Range was within
Imphal District (now Imphal West) District and secondly, the forest land recognized as C.Phailen
during the time was within Lgngol Reserved Forest protected under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and
Forest Conservation Act, 1980.
23. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act,
2006 was enacted by the Parliament in the year 2006 and came into force on 31.12.2007 and the
Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e
| 28 Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights), Rules, 2007 made thereunder came into force
on 1.1.2008.
24. Section 4(5) of the Act of 2006 provides - Save as otherwise provided, no member of a forest
dwelling Scheduled Tribe or other Traditional Forest Dweller shall be evicted or removed from
forest land under his occupation till the recognition and verification procedure is complete. Section
6 of the Act lays down the authorities and procedure for vesting of forest rights. As per the said
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 11
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
provision, Grama Sabha shall receive, consolidate and verify the claims through the Forest Rights
Committee and after passing a resolution forward the same to Sub Divisional Level Committee,
which should examine the resolution passed by the Grama Sabha and prepare the record of Forest
Rights and the same should be considered and approved by the District Level Committee. Section
6(7) empowers the State Government to constitute a State Level Committee to monitor the process
of recognition and vesting of forest rights and to submit to the nodal agency, which is the authority
authorised by the Central Government.
25. The recognition of Lanthungching and Ramgailong villages of Langol Reserved Forest as
C.Phailen WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 29 and the jurisdiction in
which those areas lie are disputed by the respondent State. The respondent State contended that the
boundary schedule as reflected in the order of recognition of the then C.Phailen village covers the
area presently occupied by the so called Lanthungching and Ramgailong villages. On the other hand,
the petitioners submit that Langthungching and Ramgailong villages are a full-fledged hill house tax
pay villages under Kangchup Geljang Sub Division, Kangpokpi District and the villagers of the said
two villages are Scheduled Tribe Forest Dwellers who depend on the forest land for bona fide
livelihood and they primarily resides in the said villages of forest area. The records reveal that
almost all the tribal villages nearby Langol Reserved Forest namely Pantilong, Nagaching, Aenon,
Tharon, Tarung, Guigailong, Ramgailong, Lanthungching and Khundi (Lainingkhun) villages were
established since the ancient days and were also recognised by the British and they have been paying
hill house tax to the State Government for the use of land forest under Hill Areas (Hill House Tax)
Act, 1966.
26. The respondents contended that the petitioners and their villagers are encroachers and the
petitioners or their forefathers were not residing in the area when Langol Reserved Forest came into
force in the year 1938. No settlement were WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g
e | 30 present in the area where Langthungching and Ramgailong villages stand at present. The
respondents also contended that the members of Grama Sabha or the Forest Rights Committee are
all encroachers within Langol Reserved Forest and not primary residents at the time of declaration
of Langol Hill Range into a Reserved Forest.
27. Whether the petitioners and their villagers are eligible to occupy the forest land in question and
whether they are encroachers of the forest land are to be decided by the respondent authorities as
per the revenue documents. The respondent State contended that the Deputy Commissioner,
Senapati has not obtained any approval from the Central Government before recognising a group of
encroachments in C. Phailen. The aforesaid point cannot be decided by this Court exercising writ
jurisdiction.
28. As could be seen from the records, earlier when the villagers of Langthungching and Rangailong
approached the Guwahati High Court by way of writ petitions, the Guwahati High Court directed not
to evict the petitioners therein from the land. In one of the writ petitions, being W.P.(C) No.847 of
2004, WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 31 decided on 29.11.2004, the
Guwahati High Court ordered as under:

Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
"Petitioners claim that they have been residing in their village C. Phailen @ Laimanai
for the last more than 30 years and they have also been paying hill house tax
regularly. However, the petitioners' apprehension is that the respondents are likely to
evict them as the respondents have done in respect of neighbouring village.
I have perused the documents and considered the matter. There is still dispute about
the question if the village of the petitioners' lies within the Langol Reserve Forest
area or not. In this connection, the petitioners are to approach the appropriate
competent authority for adjudications of the dispute. It has also been brought to my
notice that this court also made a direction in that regard in Civil Rule No.1292/94 on
10.3.2000.
Having regard to all the relevant consideration, this writ petition is disposed of with
the direction that the petitioners are not be evicted from their village without due
process of law.
WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 32 In the facts and
circumstances of the case, the petitioners are also directed to approach the concerned
competent authority for settlement of the said dispute mentioned above within a
reasonable time."
29. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that the petitioners are seeking direction on the seventh
respondent/Deputy Commissioner to consider and dispose of the claims forwarded by the
Sub-Divisional Level Committee. The respondents disputed the very convening of the meeting by
the Sub-Divisional Level Committee and its onward submission of the claims to the Deputy
Commissioner/Chairperson, District Level Committee, Kangpokpi. It is the case of the respondents
that the Grama Sabha and the Forest Rights Committee were formed by a group of encroachers and
that the Sub-Divisional Level Committee, without following proper procedure such as collating and
reconciliation of Government records, have proposed forest rights to all the individual claimants
flatly and that there has not been application of mind to sort the eligible and ineligibles.
30. The primary contention of the respondent State is that the petitioners and their fellow villagers
are not the original WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 33 settlers in
Langol Reserved Forest area and, as such, they do not belong to the category of the Forest Dwelling
Scheduled Tribes, which is mandatory requirement to be eligible to avail forest rights under the
Forest Rights Act, 2006.
31. This Court is of the view that it is for the concerned authority to decide whether the petitioners
and their villagers belong to the category of the Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes and are eligible to
avail forest rights and the Court cannot decide the same exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
32. One of the conditions for exercising power under Article 226 for issuance of a mandamus is that
the Court must come to the conclusion that the aggrieved person has a legal right, which entitles
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 13
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
him to any of the rights and that such right has been infringed. In order to obtain a writ or order in
the nature of mandamus, the petitioner has to satisfy that he has a legal right to the performance of
a legal duty by the party against whom the mandamus is sought and such right must be subsisting
on the date of the petition.
33. Writ of mandamus cannot be issued merely for the sake of asking. One must establish the right
first and then he WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 34 must seek for the
prayer to enforce the said right. Since the rights of the petitioners in the forest land in question is in
dispute, the mandamus as sought for by the petitioners cannot be granted. As stated supra, it is for
the respondent authorities to consider the claim of the petitioners as per law.
34. Since disputed questions are involved in these writ petitions, exercising writ jurisdiction, such
disputed questions cannot be decided. Though the petitioners pray for a direction on the Deputy
Commissioner/Chairperson, District Level Committee, Kangpokpi to consider and dispose of the
claims forwarded by the Sub-Divisional Level Committee, Kangpokpi, the same cannot be
considered and/or granted by this Court in these writ petitions for the reason that the right of the
petitioners in occupying the forest land in question has been disputed by the respondent State. As
stated supra, it is for the respondent authorities to decide and act in accordance with law and the
Court cannot interfere in it.
35. All privileges and rights to be recognized and vested under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 shall be
only in favour of Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes and not the encroachers. Moreover, the claim of
the villagers are to be considered by the WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e |
35 authorities in accordance with law and the High Court cannot issue any positive direction to
consider the claim of the petitioners/villagers of the two villages in question.
36. The learned Advocate-General also contended that settlement of rights under the Act of 2006 if
allowed to be taken up to identify, eligible and ineligible claimants, should be taken up by the Sub-
Divisional Committee headed by the Sub Divisional Officer, Lamphel and the District Level
Committee, Imphal West District, as the whole of Langol Reserved Forest was transferred to the
Imphal (Central) District in the year 1984. Admittedly, the aforesaid submission has not been
disputed by the petitioners.
37. Apart from the argument aforesaid, the learned Advocate-General has also raised the following
queries in these matters:
(a) How can two small points in the middle of large expanded agricultural fields and
settlement areas of Imphal West District be a part of Kangpokpi District.
(b) How can a group of encroachers as confirmed by the Committee of Officers
WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 36 form the Forest
Rights Committee under the Act of 2006 as the same shall be illegal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 14
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
(c) How will the Sub-Divisional Level Committee and the District Legal Committee of
Kangpokpi implement the Forest Rights Act, 2006 in an area which is under the
territorial jurisdiction of Imphal West District.
38. According to the learned Advocate-General, the initiation of determining the
forest rights at Lanthungching and Ramgailong shall not be tenable on the ground
that Langol Reserved Forest area presently occupied by the aforesaid two villages are
not within the jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner, Kangpokpi, as Langol Hill
Range was transferred to the erstwhile Imphal Central District (now Imphal West).
Again, the Forest Rights Committee formed in respect of Lanthungching and
Ramgailong cannot be valid, as they are formed by a group of encroachers and the
Village Authorities of these two villages and the same has not been recognized by the
competent authorities. The said arguments of the learned WP(C) No. 623 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 37 Advocate-General has not been controverted
by the petitioners.
Moreover, such dispute cannot be decided in the present writ petitions, which are filed for issuance
of a mandamus to direct the seventh respondent/Deputy Commissioner to consider and dispose of
the claim of the petitioners/villagers in a time bound manner. Anyhow, as stated supra, it is for the
concerned authority of the respondent State to decide the aforesaid questions of fact.
39. It is well settled that normally the High Court does not adjudicate highly disputed questions of
fact in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In these writ petitions, this Court
had not proceeded to adjudicate such highly disputed questions of facts involved.
40. It is trite that the High Court is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India merely because in considering the petitioner's right to relief
questions of fact may fall to be determined. In a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India, the High Court has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and law. Exercise of the
jurisdiction is, it is true, discretionary, but the discretion must be exercised on sound WP(C) No. 623
of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 38 judicial principles. When a writ petition raises
questions of fact of a complex nature, which may for their determination require oral evidence to be
taken, and on that account the High Court is of the view that the dispute may not appropriately be
tried in a writ petition, the High Court may decline to try a writ petition. Rejection of a writ petition
will normally be justified, where the High Court is of the view that the petition is frivolous or
because of the nature of the claim made, dispute sought to be agitated, or that the petition against
the party against whom relief is claimed is not maintainable or that the dispute raised thereby is
such that it would be inappropriate to try it in the writ jurisdiction or for analogous reasons.
41. The order dated 27.6.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.457 of 2022 relied upon by the petitioners in
support of their case is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the instant writ petitions. On
a perusal of the order, it is seen that the learned Advocate-General, during the course of arguments,
submitted that the writ petition may be disposed of by issuing innocuous direction to the concerned
authorities of the Government to consider the representation dated 16.6.2022 submitted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150965685/ 15
Shri H. Aleng vs The Union Of India on 10 January, 2023
petitioners and dispose of the same by issuing speaking order within a period of two months and
pending WP(C) No. 623 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 624 of 2022 P a g e | 39 consideration of the
representation, no eviction process will be initiated against the petitioners. Here, in the instant writ
petitions, the learned Advocate-General strongly opposes the prayer made by the petitioners. As
stated supra, since disputed questions of fact involved in the present writ petitions, a direction on
the respondent authorities to consider the representations of the petitioners dated 22.9.2021 cannot
be granted.
42. For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the view that there is no merit in the writ petitions.
Accordingly, the writ petitions are dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
