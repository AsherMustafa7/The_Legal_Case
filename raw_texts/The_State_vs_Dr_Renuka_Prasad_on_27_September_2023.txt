JUDGMENT
This is an appeal by the State against acquittal judgment passed by V Addl. Dist. & Sessions Judge,
Dakshina Kannada, Sitting at Puttur (for short 'trial court'), in Sessions Case No. 152/2011.
Respondents 1 to 7 faced trial for the offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 109, 302 r/w 34
IPC.
2. A.S. Ramakrishna, the father of PW8-Vallish was killed in the incident that occurred at about 7.45
PM on 28.04.2011. The deceased Ramakrishna and PW8 were going for a walk everyday evening
around 7.00 PM. On 28.04.2011, they went for a walk as usual and while returning home, as they
came near Krishna Ayur Theraphy Clinic at about 7.45 PM, two persons suddenly came in front of
them and inflicted severe blows to Ramakrishna with weapons. He sunk to ground. As PW8
hollered, a few passers by came there. The assailants fled that place. PW8 made a call to his house.
Thereafter Ramakrishna was shifted to KVG Hospital where he succumbed to injuries around 8.40
PM. At 11.55 PM, PW8 made a report of the incident to the Police as per Ex.P.23. Registration of FIR
in Crime No. 66/2011 was followed by investigation which led to chargesheeting all the respondents.
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
3. PW1 to 87 were the witnesses examined by the prosecution. Ex.P.1 to 119 were the documents and
MOs 1 to 58 were the material objects relied on by the prosecution for establishing its case. The trial
court found that the evidence placed by the prosecution would not lead to convict the accused and
hence acquitted them of all the offences by the judgment impugned in this appeal.
4. The following are the main reasons recorded by the trial court for acquitting the accused.
• Except PW30 and PW73 to 87, the rest of the prosecution witnesses have turned hostile;
• In Ex.P.23, the first information report given by PW8, there is nothing indicating conspiracy
among the accused. • In Ex.P.23, PW8 has stated that two persons emerged from bushy plants near
Krishna Ayurveda Theraphy and assaulted his father, but he denied to have given further statement
as per Ex.P.25, P.25(a) and P.25(b). In Ex.P.25 or in the oral evidence of PW8 it is not forthcoming
that accused Nos.5 and 6 or other accused were shown to him. In the examination in chief itself, NC:
2023:KHC:35288-DB PW8 clearly stated that he was not able to identify the accused. Even when he
was taken to Mangaluru District Prison he was not able to identify the accused. • PW87 has stated in
the cross examination that in the test identification parade conducted by the Tahasildar, Puttur,
none of the witnesses identified the accused persons. • PW1 and 9 are the eyewitnesses according to
the prosecution. But these two witnesses have not supported the prosecution case and failed to
identify accused nos.5 and 6 in the Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 3
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
• The motive for the incident was shown to be distribution of the family properties including the
educational institutions between the first accused and PW4; accused no.1 suspected involvement of
the deceased in more share being given to PW4. But the prosecution has failed to establish the
motive. PW4 also turned hostile and the other witnesses examined for proving the motive also did
not support.
• PW23 and 24 were the persons said to have been contacted by accused no.4 for causing death of
the deceased. They were offered 'supari' but they refused.
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB When PW23 and 24 were examined in the Court for proving this aspect
they did not support the prosecution. • The prosecution has failed to prove the conspiracy among
the accused. Though the prosecution produced the call detail records (CDR) of the accused as per
Exs.P.102 to 111, they were not supported by the certificate as required u/s 65-B of the Evidence Act.
• In para 13 of the evidence of PW87, it is stated that on 11.05.2011, on the basis of further voluntary
statement of accused no.3, PW87 came to know that accused no.3 had hidden in the farm namely,
Amar Jyoti Farms, belonging to accused no.1 the clothes worn by accused 5 and 6 at the time of
assaulting Ramakrishna and also the number plate containing Kannada numericals which was fixed
to the motorcycle and these items were seized by her in the presence of PW40 and 41. But this
aspect has not been proved.
• MO 12 to 15 were not identified by the witnesses PW1 and 9 and when they were subjected to cross
examination, the Public Prosecutor gave suggestions about the colour of the clothes worn by accused
5 and 6 NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB without showing the clothes marked MO 12 to 15. But the colours
mentioned by Public Prosecutor differed from the actual colour of the clothes. Moreover, clothes
were not seized at the instance of accused no. 5 and 6 in accordance with Section 27 of the Indian
Evidence Act. Even the Investigating Officer admitted the colour difference.
• In Ex.P.23 it is written that two persons came by holding sword like weapons. In the examination
in chief PW8 deposed that two persons assaulted his father with swords. But in Ex.P.25 it is
mentioned that Ramakrishna was assaulted by choppers. Sword and chopper are different types of
weapons and thereby the prosecution is not sure which weapon was employed for causing death of
Ramakrishna. Therefore, using of MO 10 and 11 becomes doubtful.
• Seizure of MO 1 to 9 is supported by the witnesses to the panchanama drawn in that connection,
but witnesses for seizure of MO 10 to 58 have turned hostile. The witnesses have merely admitted
their signatures to the panchanamas or the mahazars but they do not establish NC:
2023:KHC:35288-DB the contents. The evidence of the official witnesses in regard to seizure of MO
10 to 58 has no support from the independent witnesses and even the seizures are not as per Sec. 27
of the Evidence Act.
• PW84 was not legally authorized to conduct investigation and the raid conducted by him on
08.05.2011 in the house of accused no.5 and 6 and recovery of 'supari money' of Rs.8,50,000/- from
the house of accused no.5 and Rs.2,00,000/- from the house of accused no.6 has no legal sanctity.
The search conducted by PW84 appears to be suspicious because he was working in Income Tax
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 4
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
Department and he received credible information about ill gotten money or possessing assets
disproportionate to known source of income of accused nos. 5 and 6 and for this reason raid was
conducted.
• PW87 the Investigating Officer has admitted in the cross examination that no written order
authorizing her to investigate had been given to her by Inspector General of Police and therefore she
was also not authorized to investigate. For this reason investigations conducted by PW 84 and 87
cannot be approved and accepted.
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB • In the complaint there is no allegation against the accused that they had
threatened PW5 Dr. Leeladhar or his family members and a case for the offences u/s 506 or 307 of
IPC had also not been registered. Seizure of six pieces of 'Moksh Agarbatti Cover' from the house of
PW5 appears to be redundant, unnecessary and misleading, moreso PW5 has denied production of
the Agarbatti cover pieces and panchanama drawn as per Ex.P.69. • The prosecution has utterly
failed to connect the accused persons to the murder of Ramakrishna.
5. Assailing the findings of the trial court, Sri B.N. Jagadish, the Additional State Public Prosecutor
assisted by Smt. Rashmi Jadhav, the High Court Government Pleader argued on behalf of the State.
Sri R.B.Deshpande, learned counsel argued on behalf of respondents 1, 2 and 7. Sri P.B. Umesh,
learned counsel argued for respondents 3 and 6. Sri Dinesh Kumar K. Rao, learned counsel argued
on behalf of respondent No.5 and Sri H.V. Harish, learned counsel argued on behalf of respondent
No.6.
- 10 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
6. Sri B.N. Jagadish began his argument with a comment that the trial court has utterly failed in
appreciating and analysing the evidence placed before it by applying the yardstick of probabilities to
the intrinsic value in evidence and the animus of the witnesses. No attempt to separate the grain
from chaff was made by the trial court and this has resulted in miscarriage of justice. Elaborating
the argument, he submitted that though most of the witnesses appear to have not supported the
prosecution, in reality it is not so; proper appreciation of evidence would lead to a conclusion that
they have spoken to the extent they knew about the incident. And of course some of the witnesses
have fully turned hostile and it must be borne in mind that all of them were either related to accused
no.1 or working in the institutions under his management. The trial Court has failed to notice the
reason for those witnesses turning hostile.
6.1 PW8, 30 and 73 to 87 have clearly stated about the involvement of the accused in the homicidal
death of A.S. Ramakrishna. Evidence of PW4 is also helpful. Though PW8 stated in the Court that he
could not identify the accused, it should not have been a reason for treating him hostile. His
- 11 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 5
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB evidence clearly discloses as to how his father was brutally assaulted to
death. Actually PW1 and 9 saw the assailants running away. To this extent an inference can be
drawn from their evidence even though they did not identify the assailants in the Court. Merely for
the reason that they were treated hostile, their evidence in entirety should not have been discarded.
6.2 Because of non identification of the accused by PW1, 8 and 9, the circumstances connecting the
accused with the crime should have been properly appreciated by the trial Court. PW4 might have
denied the enemity between him and accused no.1, but his evidence clearly discloses that the
educational institutions founded by his father were divided between him and accused no.1 and, on a
few occasions accused no.1 had scolded A.S. Ramakrishna in front of all. The totality of the
circumstances indicates that accused no.1 strongly believed that Ramakrishna was responsible for a
major share being given to PW4 during partition and part of the money decided to be given to him
remaining unpaid. Therefore, accused no.1 hatched a conspiracy with accused 2 to 4 and 7 and then
engaged accused no.5 and 6 who were 'supari killers'.
- 12 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB 6.3 As far as conspiracy is concerned, there is ample evidence. Accused
nos. 5 and 6 were lodged in the farm house of wife of accused no.1 and they were being supplied food
there. In order to conceal the identity of the vehicle being used for supplying food to accused nos. 5
and 6, the number plate of the vehicle was changed. The fake number plate was recovered by the
Police during investigation. All the circumstances clearly provide proof for conspiracy. In this regard
he submitted that direct evidence for conspiracy is not always available and inferences from the
other proved facts must be drawn. Prosecution has been able to provide proof of this nature.
6.4 The blood group of Ramakrishna was 'O+ve'. The same blood group was detected in the clothes
worn by accused 5 and 6 and also on the weapons. This part of the evidence has not been
discredited. This is another circumstance which the trial Court has ignored.
6.5 The reason for most of the witnesses turning hostile becomes writ large from the evidence of
PW5. He might have turned hostile but recovery of cut pieces of the wrapper of
- 13 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB 'Moksh Agarbatti' packet provides hint to the fact that PW5 was under a
threat. The name of the son of PW5 is Moksh. By sending cut pieces of wrapper, PW5 was indirectly
threatened that he would be put in danger. Moreover he still continued to work in the college under
the management of accused no.1. The trial court has failed to notice this important aspect being the
reason for PW5 turning hostile.
6.6 There are no lapses in the investigation. Merely for the reason that charge sheet was filed by the
Assistant Superintendent of Police, it is not possible to state that she was not authorized to hold
investigation. She was a superior police officer having jurisdiction over the area where the offence
was committed. Section 36 of Cr.P.C. clearly states that a superior police officer can exercise the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 6
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
powers of a station house officer within the area of his jurisdiction. The trial court has gone wrong in
giving an adverse finding in relation to the investigation.
6.7 It is a settled principle of law that conviction can be recorded based on the evidence given by
official witnesses. For many reasons independent witnesses turn hostile. It is wrong
- 14 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB to disbelieve the testimonies of the police officers if the investigation
appears to have been conducted impartially. In the case on hand none of the police personnel has
been discredited in the cross examination, the defence has utterly failed to demonstrate that the
investigating officers were hostile to the accused from inception. Their evidence is very much
believable and the trial court could have recorded conviction based on their evidence. Therefore, the
judgment impugned in this appeal cannot be sustained at all. It has to be reversed and the accused
are to be convicted for the offences charged against them.
7. Sri R.B. Deshpande argued that there is no error in the judgment of the trial court. Though
prosecution examined 87 witnesses, all the independent witnesses did not support the prosecution
case. The only eyewitness is PW8, not PW1 and 9. But PW8 did not identify the accused in the Court
or during test identification parade. For this reason circumstances play an important role. Motive
assumes importance when circumstances are considered. Projected motive is enemity that accused
no.1 had towards Ramakrishna as the latter was found to be the person responsible for accused no.1
getting
- 15 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB lesser share in the division of management of the educational institutions
founded by his father and still Rs.12 crore remaining unpaid. PW4 is the main witness to establish
motive. He has not supported. Even the wife of the deceased Ramakrishna has not supported.
Therefore motive has not been proved.
7.1. The other circumstances such as recovery of the weapons and clothes, and accused 5 and 6 being
sheltered by accused no.1 in his farm house have not been established. Though 'O+ve' blood stains
were detected on the clothes said to have been worn by accused 5 and 6, the prosecution failed to
prove that those clothes belonged to accused 5 and 6 and the recovery mahazar drawn in that
connection has also not been established. The blood samples of accused 5 and 6 were not collected
and therefore merely for the reason that 'O' group blood was detected on the clothes and the
weapons, it is impossible to come to the conclusion that the act was committed by accused 5 and 6
pursuant to conspiracy between accused no.1 and other accused.
7.2. He argued further that the police witnesses are always interested to see that the case
investigated by them should end
- 16 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 7
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB in conviction of the accused; and this being settled principle, evidence
given by police witnesses is not safe to be relied upon.
7.3. His last point of argument was that since this is an appeal against acquittal judgment, the
presumption of innocence of the accused is doubly strengthened and it is not proper to reverse the
acquittal judgment unless the findings given by the trial court appear to be perverse. The impugned
judgment does not disclose perversity in appreciation of evidence and hence appeal deserves to be
dismissed.
8. Sri Dinesh Kumar K. Rao argued that there is no evidence indicating that there were differences
between accused no.1 and PW4. It appears that accused no.5 was fixed in the instant case because he
was found to be an accused in the other cases. The police made use of this kind of a situation to
falsely implicate him. Accused no. 7 is also falsely implicated showing him a member of conspiracy
just because he applied for certified copies of the documents on behalf of some of the accused. This
shows a major lapse in the investigation which cannot be ignored. He also pointed out that certain
amounts of
- 17 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB money said to have been seized under the mahazars were not packed and
therefore the seizure becomes doubtful. 8.1. It is shown that accused no.2 tried to commit suicide,
but it was doubtful because he might have been assaulted severely by the police and to cover it up,
suicide theory was built up. It has come in the evidence that accused no.2 went to police station on
01.05.2011 and 02.05.2011 but he was not arrested. Everything started from 09.05.2011 and till then
there is no explanation as to what happened. Therefore there are many doubtful circumstances in
the investigation itself. Accused No.5 was innocent and his implication was groundless. In this view
there are no valid grounds to allow the appeal.
9. Sri Umesh argued that accused no.3 was arrested on the basis of voluntary statements of accused
5 and 6. It is not proved that accused 3 and 4 were working under accused no.1. There is no cogent
proof for seizure of money from the custody of accused 3 and 4 on 08.05.2011 and 01.07.2011.
Similarly, recovery of clothes is also not supported by independent witnesses. Prosecution has not
proved that cut pieces of 'Moksh Agarbatti wrapper' were recovered from the residential
- 18 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB house of accused no.1. Accused no.3 was in custody from 08.05.2011. No
effort was made to recover incriminating articles from his custody. The investigating officer has
clearly admitted that there was difference in colours of the clothes. Even with regard to call details,
the prosecution did not obtain certificate as required under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act.
Therefore, the trial court came to conclusion not to place reliance on the testimonies of the police
officers. Now in the appeal against acquittal judgment it is not safe to place reliance on their
testimonies in order to reverse the judgment. Hence, appeal deserves to be dismissed.

10. This is an appeal against acquittal judgment. We are conscious of the fact that the acquittal
judgment cannot be so easily reversed unless it appears that the trial court has grossly erred in
appreciating the evidence. The approach of the trial court must appear to be very casual. In the case
of Chandrappa and Others Vs. State of Karnataka [(2007) 4 SCC 415], the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has set out the following general principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing
with an appeal against order of acquittal:
- 19 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB "(1) An appellate court has full power to review,
reappreciate and consider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.
(2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition
on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach
its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law.
(3) Various expressions, such as, "substantial and compelling reasons", "good and
sufficient grounds", "very strong circumstances", "distorted conclusions", "glaring
mistakes", etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an
appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of "flourishes of
language" to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal
than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own
conclusion. (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of
acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused.
Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of
criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty
by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of
his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court. (5) If two
reasonable views are possible on the basis of evidence on record and one favourable to the accused
has been taken by the trial court, it ought not to be disturbed by the appellate court."
11. As we find that the entire evidence needs to be reappreciated, we may briefly refer to what each
accused has deposed. Before referring to the evidence of each witness, the

12. Firstly, it is necessary to refer to the evidence given by PW8 who is the son of Ramakrishna. His
evidence in examination in chief is that he and his father were going for a walk everyday evening
around 7'o clock and on 28.04.2011, they went to Chennakeshava temple and from there to the
market passing through Ambetadka road. They were returning home in the same road. Around 7.45
p.m. as they came near Krishna Ayurvedic Theraphy Clinic on Ambetadka road, two persons
suddenly came in their front and gave blows to his father with swords on the head, face and chest.
His father fell down and again they assaulted his father with machetes. As he screamed loudly, some
persons came there and the assailants ran away from that place with the weapons. He made a call
from his father's mobile phone to some people. Then his father was shifted to KVG Medical Hospital
where he died around 8.40 P.M. He then went to Police Station and made a report of the incident as
per Ex.P.23. He also deposed that on 29.04.2011 in between 6.30 and 7.30 A.M. the Police came to
the place of occurrence and drew up a panchanama or the mahazar as per Ex.P.24 in the presence of
Ramachandra Bhat (PW30) and Umesh (not examined). The police seized his father's broken

The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
- 22 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB spectacles and mobile phone at that time and also collected the blood
stained soil and sample soil. He identified the broken spectacles at MO6, mobile phone at MO7 and
the blood stained soil and sample soil as per MO8 and 9 respectively.
13. He stated that on 18.05.2011 the Police recorded his further statement and at that time he came
to know from the Police that five persons had been arrested and that accused 5 and 6 were the
persons who had assaulted his father on 28.04.2011. Because he stated in the examination in chief
that he could not identify accused 5 and 6 and stated further that he did not know the actual reason
for the incident, he was treated hostile by the public prosecutor and cross examined. In the cross
examination he admitted that Ex.P.23 was in his hand writing but refuted the suggestions that he
actually saw accused 5 and 6 at the time of attack on his father and, fearing the accused he stated
that he could not identify them. When his attention was drawn to his further statement dated
18.05.2011 that the accused namely, Sharan Alias Rohidas Alias Rohit and Shankar Alias
Bhavanishankar Alias Manoj were the persons who assaulted his father, he made it clear that he
came to know about the names of the assailants from the
- 23 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Police and, he denied to have given statements before the Police as per
Ex.P.25, P.25(a), 25(b) relating to motive behind the incident.
14. PW1 and PW9 were the persons who according to prosecution saw accused no.5 and 6 when they
were running away after assaulting Ramakrishna. PW1-Karunakara Gowda. M, was working as
Assistant Manager in the office of the K.F.D.C. of Aivarnadu Division. The prosecution examined
him to prove that when he was in the house of PW9, both of them heard shoutings near Krishna
Ayuvedic Theraphy Clinic and saw two persons wearing black pants and grey colour shirts running
away and then leaving that place by riding a motorcycle. Thereafter they went near Krishna
Ayurvedic Theraphy Clinic and saw one person having fallen down sustaining bleeding injuries and
a weeping boy standing by the side of the injured. The prosecution also wanted to prove from him
that he asked that boy about the injured and at that time the boy told that the injured was his father
by name Ramakrishna A.S. working as Administrator at K.V.G. Medical College and that two
persons suddenly came and assaulted his father and ran away towards the roadside bushes. Since
PW1 did not depose so, he
- 24 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB was treated hostile by the public prosecutor. PW1 has not supported the
prosecution case.
15. The evidence of PW9-Shivaraja. N, shows that PW1 had come to his house on 28.04.2011 and
when they were discussing some official matter he heard somebody screaming near Krishna
Ayurvedic Theraphy Clinic and both of them came out of the house. He saw somebody going at a

distance and asked PW1 to see that person and then he went near the place from where the scream
was coming. At that place he saw one person having fallen down in the pool of blood sustaining
injuries on his head and other parts of the body. He saw one person, i.e., PW8, who was none other
than the son of the injured. He came to know that the injured was A.S. Ramakrishna who was
working as an Administrator of K.V.G. Medical College. He asked PW8 to make a telephone call to
his relatives and then he himself informed the Police and also made a call to secure ambulance.
Before the arrival of ambulance, a vehicle came and carried the injured to the hospital.

NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
16. His further deposition is that 10 to 15 days after the incident he came to know that 4 or 5 persons
had been arrested by the police and came to know further from police that Bhavanishankara and
Sharan were two of the accused. Because he stated that he did not come to know that the other
accused got Ramakrishna killed by Bhavanishankara and Sharan and that he did not know about
existence of some differences between accused no.1 and PW4-K.V.Chidananda, he was treated
hostile to this extent. It was suggested to him that he saw two persons going on the road when he
and PW1 came out of the house, and to this suggestion his answer was that he saw only one person
and then asked PW1 to go and see that person. He denied to have given a statement as per
Ex.P.26(a) to the effect that he would identify those persons if shown to him. He also denied that he
made a statement before the police as per Ex.P.27 that he was aware of instigation made by accused
no. 7-Nagesh Kumar to accused no.1 to get Ramakrishna killed by engaging supari killers.
17. PW2, 3 and 10 are the witnesses to the inquest drawn as per Ex.P.3. The prosecution has also
made an attempt to elicit
- 26 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB from them the reason behind killing Ramakrishna. Inquest panchanama
is not disputed.
18. PW2-Raviprakash is the younger brother of the deceased. His evidence in examination in chief
shows that he came to know the attack on his brother when he received a call in between 7.45 and
8.00 p.m. on 28.04.2011 and immediately he rushed to K.V.G. Medical College Hospital where he
saw the dead body of his brother. He has stated about the inquest conducted on the dead body on
29.04.2011. He noticed 25 injuries on the dead body. He stated about the police seizing his brother's
torn blood stained clothes, a belt, a pair of Reebok shoes and socks, and packing them in white cloth.
He identified all these items marked MO3 to 5. On 18.05.2011 he came to know about the arrest of
five accused who were involved in murder of his brother and in particular about the arrest of
accused 5 and 6 who had inflicted injuries to his brother at 7.45 p.m. on 28.04.2011. He also
deposed that accused no.1 who was working as General Secretary of K.V.G. Educational Institutions
conspired with his employees namely Manoj Rai, Nagesh and Vamana and got killed Ramakrishna
by engaging accused 5 and 6. His evidence in chief discloses that

The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
- 27 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB he had come to know from his brother that the latter had differences with
accused no.1 but stated further that he did not know the reason for differences. He also came to
know that accused no.7 had instigated accused no.1. Though he stated that the police took his
statement on 18.05.2011, he was treated hostile and cross examined because he did not give
evidence regarding some of the aspects in accordance with the statement recorded by the police
during investigation. The portions of the statement marked as per Ex.P.4 and Ex.P.4(a) and
Ex.P.4(b) were denied to have been given by him. These portions related to accused no.1 putting
threat to the deceased on certain occasions in the background of certain differences of opinions that
he had against Ramakrishna.
19. Ramakrishna was the nephew of PW3. He went to hospital as soon as he came to know about
attack on Ramakrishna. He participated during inquest held on 29.04.2011 and saw injuries on the
dead body. He has stated about police seizing the blood stained clothes, the shoes, the socks and the
belt as per MOs 3 to 5 belonging to the deceased and produced by Dr. Suguna Gowda. He identified
his signature on the inquest panchanama drawn as per Ex.P.3.
- 28 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB When he read the newspaper, he came to know that somebody had killed
Ramakrishna, but did not reveal their names. For this reason and also for the reason that he denied
his knowledge about adverse impression accused no.1 had against the deceased, he was treated
hostile and cross examined by the public prosecutor. He denied the suggestions given to him about
the conspiracy amongst accused no.1 to 4 and 7, and the threat given by accused no.1 to
Ramakrishna on several occasions regarding the management of the Medical College, and portion of
statements marked as per Ex.P.5 and P.5(a) said to have been given by him.
20. PW10 is the wife of Ramakrishna. She went to hospital as soon as she came to know from the
telephonic call of her son about the attack on her husband and saw the dead body. She stated about
inquest conducted on 29.04.2011 and the seizure of her husband's clothes, shoes, socks and belt. She
identified these items at MOs.3 to 5. She stated that she gave further statement before the police
about what she came to know from the police that Sharan and Bhavanishankar had killed her
husband. She has stated about the division effected by the founder of the educational institutions,
namely,
- 29 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Venkatramana Gowda, of the management of the educational institutions
between his two sons, but as she took ignorance about the reason for her husband resigning from
the educational institutions, she was treated hostile by the public prosecutor and cross examined.
During cross examination she denied to have given statements as per Ex.P.28 and 28(a) about her
husband being insulted by accused no.1 during inspection time and threat given to him by accused
no.1 and also about the involvement of accused no.1 with the aid of accused 2 to 4 in getting her

husband killed through accused 5 and 6.
21. Besides PW2, PWs4, 5, 6, 7, 10 to 13 and 21 are some more witnesses examined by the
prosecution to prove motive for the incident. Almost all these witnesses turned hostile. But from the
evidence of PW4-K.V. Chidananada, the brother of accused no.1, it can be made out that after
coming to know of the incident when his son, i.e., PW7-K.S. Akshay received a telephone call, he
went to hospital and saw PW8 there and came to know from him as to how the incident occurred.
He has also stated that management of the educational institutions had been divided between him
and accused no.1, that the
- 30 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB deceased was working as an Administrator in the Medical College and
that he came to know through media about involvement of accused no.1 and accused no.2-Manoj
Rai in the killing of Ramakrishna. Because he turned hostile to the prosecution case about the
motive, he was subjected to cross examination by the Public Prosecutor. He was suggested that
accused no.1 did not like intervention of deceased in the division of the management of the
institutions and for that reason, accused no.1 had threatened and insulted the deceased once. He
was further suggested that he had written letter to his father complaining against the first accused
and that he produced that letter before the police during investigation. Besides denying this
suggestion, he denied to have handed over the letter shown to him by the Public Prosecutor. He did
not accept the signature on the letter but stated that the signature found on the letter would
resemble his signature. That apart, he clearly admitted one suggestion that in the month of March,
2011 there had taken place exchange of words in the campus of the College between him and
accused no.1 regarding mess of the college in the presence of Dr. Kaverappa, K.R.Gangadhar,
Venkatramana Gowda Paddambailu, Dr.
- 31 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Hemanath, the Warden of K.V.G. Hostel-Leeladhar and the staff and
students of the College, but he stated that it was not a heated exchange of words or a quarrel. The
evidence given by PWs. 54, 55 and 56 is referred in paragraph no.27 as their evidence has relevancy
for proving the circumstance of conspiracy.
22. PW16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 54, 55, 56, 61, 63 and 64 are the witnesses for establishing conspiracy.
None of them supported. Through PW16, the prosecution wanted to establish that accused no.2
asked him to bring a number plate of a vehicle written in Kannada and on his request he met an
artist who had a shop by name 'Seema Arts' and got written a number plate containing the
registration number 'KA-21-J- 3141' to be fixed on the rear side of the motorbike. The prosecution

Amar Jyoti Farms and had also seen accused no.2 and accused no.4 in that farm house. The

room of his house called 'Amarashree' and thereafter the police seized the said mobile phone which
contained sim no. '9448515151' based on his disclosure in the voluntary statement.
54. PW47, 52 and 53 were to prove Ex.P.53 in connection with seizing cash of Rs.1,23,000/-
produced by accused no.4 after making a disclosure in his voluntary statement. But except admitting
their signatures they did not support.
55. Ex.P.54 is the mahazar drawn in the shed situate in front of the farm house belonging to accused
no.1. According to

The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB prosecution, it was the place shown by accused no.1 where he held
discussion with accused nos.2 to 4 for killing Ramakrishna. PW48 and 49 are the witnesses to prove
this panchanama but they did not support.
56. PW65 and PW66 are the witnesses examined for proving the panchanama as per Ex.P.69 which
was drawn in connection with seizure of cut pieces of Moksh Agarbatti wrapper produced by PW5.
But they did not speak in favour of the prosecution.
57. PW67 is a witness to panchanama Ex.P.70 which was drawn in the farm house of accused no.1
for seizing cut pieces of Moksh Agarbatti wrapper. According to prosecution, these were the
remaining pieces of Agarbatti wrapper kept in the farm house and they were shown by accused no.3
to the police. But PW67 failed to prove this aspect.
58. There are certain other circumstances to which PW18 to 20, 22, 23, 24, 69 to 71 are the
witnesses, but they have not supported.
59. One circumstance figured out during investigation was that PW18 owned a motorcycle bearing
reg. no. KA-19-AB-76. Whenever she used to visit her grandmother's house, she was
- 47 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB parking the motorcycle in the house of accused no.5 because there was no
road to grandmother's house. Accused no.5 used to take the motorbike as he was her relative, and
during her one such visit in the month of April, 2011, accused no.5 told her that in the second week
of April he would use her motorcycle for four days. Accordingly, he took the motorbike and then
brought it back. Again two days after, the 5th accused took the motorbike and when she asked him
as to where he had gone, he told her that he had been to Puttur and Sullia on 27.04.2011 and
28.04.2011 on some work. She completely denied this circumstance sought to be established from
her and the statement as per Ex.P.37 recorded by the police.
60. PW19 was present with PW7 when the latter received phone call about attack on Ramakrishna
near Sri Krishna Ayurvedic Theraphy Clinic and thereafter, he, PW7 and S.H. Sultan Mohiddin
(CW24, not examined) went to that place and saw Ramakrishna having fallen down sustaining
serious injuries and also PW8-Vallish at that place. They enquired PW8 about the incident. But
PW19 denied this circumstance and the statement given by him before the police during the
investigation as per Ex.P.38.
- 48 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
61. PW20 was a student of III Year Engineering at K.V.G. Engineering College, he knew PW4 and
deceased Ramakrishna and had seen the first accused. His evidence is that one day in the year 2011,
he had been to the house of his friend Deepika and while returning home, he saw Ramakrishna in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 21
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
pool of blood. He stopped his scooter and enquired PW8-Vallish who was there and came to know
that somebody had assaulted Ramakrishna. Immediately he made a call to PW7 and informed about
it. Then a pick up vehicle came and took the injured to the hospital. Since he did not fully support
the prosecution, he was treated hostile and cross examined to elicit from him that PW8 told him
that PW1 and PW9 had seen two persons going in front of their house. He did not admit the
suggestion and denied the statement as per Ex.P.39.
62. PW22 is a photographer and knew the deceased. If his evidence is seen, actually he does not
establish any circumstance, but the prosecution wanted to prove that he came to know about the
incident and about the involvement of all the accused in the commission of crime which took place
in the background of enmity that accused no.1 had against the
- 49 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB deceased. He does not admit the statement said to have been recorded as
per Ex.P.41.
63. PW69 was a newspaper distributor at Madikeri besides being a taxi driver. Through him the
prosecution sought to prove that on 06.05.2011 at 6.30 p.m. accused no. 7 came to taxi stand and
engaged him for going to Mangaluru on the next day morning at 7'o clock and that on 07.05.2011, he
picked up accused no.7 from his house and came to Hassan. Accused no.7 alighted from the car at
K.R. Puram Extension, Hassan, came back after half an hour and then proceeded towards
Mangaluru. On the way when the car was stopped at Kalladka at 2.30 p.m. two to three people came
in a pick up jeep and talked with accused no.7. But PW69 has not established this incidental
circumstance and he denied to have given statement as per Ex.P.72.
64. PW70 was working as a salesman in K.V.G. Nandini Milk Parlour belonging to K.V.G.
Educational Institutions. The prosecution wanted to prove from him that he was working as
watchman in the house of the first accused situated at Mangala Devi Nagar, Madikeri. On
06.05.2011, accused no.2 telephoned
- 50 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB to his mobile at 4.00 p.m. and told that the mobile telephone of accused
no. 7 was switched off and asked him to convey to accused no. 7 to make a call to him, and
accordingly he went to the house of accused no. 7 and told him to contact accused no.2. But this
witness denied all these circumstances and the statement as per Ex.P.73.
65. PW71 is the wife of first accused and Director of Academy of Liberal Education, Sullia. She has
stated that accused no.2 was working as an attender in the institutions, but did not know accused
no.3. The purpose of examining PW71 was to prove through her that she issued letters about the
employment of accused nos.2 to 4. Those letters are Ex.P.74 to P.76. Though she admitted the
signatures, she denied to have issued them and stated further that the police obtained her signatures
on blank papers in the police station. It is quite obvious that she being the wife of accused no.1
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 22
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
cannot be expected to support.
66. PW73 was the PWD Engineer who prepared the sketch of the scene of occurrence as per Ex.P.81.
He noted in the sketch that at a distance of 20 feet from the place of occurrence there
- 51 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB was a streetlight pole, at a distance of 15 feet there was an electric pole
and at 50 feet distance, KFDC quarters were there.
67. PW75 was the Regional Transport Officer who inspected Hero Honda Splendor motorcycle with
reg. no. KA-21-J-3141 and Mahindra pick up vehicle reg. no. KA-21-D-8888, took pencil prints of
chassis nos. of those two vehicles and issued their 'B' extracts. Ex.P.89 is the vehicle condition report
and Ex.P.90 and 91 are the 'B' extract copies.
68. PW74 was the doctor who conducted postmortem examination and PW77 was a forensic expert
who gave serology report examining the blood stains.
69. PW76, 78 to 87 are the police officers and personnel who have spoken about the role played by
each one of them during investigation.
Analysis of Evidence:
70. Ramakrishna met homicidal death; there is no dispute about it and therefore this aspect does
not require discussion. As most of the witnesses turned hostile and a few of them partially
supported, the evidence as regards investigation part is to be examined. Sri R.B. Deshpande has
argued that the
- 52 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB investigators are interested witnesses and it is not safe to rely upon their
evidence. This argument cannot be accepted. There is no rule as such that no reliance can be placed
on the evidence given by the police officers. If the investigation appears to have been done honestly,
truthfully and impartially, there is no bar for relying on the evidence given by the investigating
officers and other police personnel. It is true that the police sometimes, in a zeal to give foolproof
touch to their investigation go out of track, like by taking further statements of the witnesses in
regard to the investigation made by them. Further statement, which is nothing but a statement
under section 161 of Cr.P.C, is to be taken when a witness wants to give some additional information
or state something which he had omitted earlier. In many a case it is found that the investigating
officer feeds the information collected by him during investigation from other sources to the
witnesses and obtain further statements from them to that effect. If the witnesses take ignorance to
or deny to have made such further statements, they can not be treated hostile. This is what has
happened in this case, especially in regard to PW-8 and PW-9.

The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
- 53 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB When the prominent witness turn hostile, evidence with regard to
investigation must be scrutinized keenly and carefully.
71. As to the value or importance to be attached to the investigation part, we may usefully refer to
some rulings of the Supreme Court. In State Govt. of NCT of Delhi Vs. Sunil & Other [2001 SCC
(Crime) 248] it is held:
"21. We feel that it is an archaic notion that actions of the police officer should be
approached with initial distrust. We are aware that such a notion was lavishly
entertained during the British period and policemen also knew about it. Its hangover
persisted during post-independent years but it is time now to start placing at least
initial trust on the actions and the documents made by the police. At any rate, the
court cannot start with the presumption that the police records are untrustworthy. As
a proposition of law the presumption should be the other way around. The official
acts of the police have been regularly performed is a wise principle of presumption
and recognized even by the legislature. Hence when a police officer gives evidence in
court that a certain article was recovered by him on the strength of the statement
made by the accused it is open to the court to believe the version to be correct if it is
not otherwise shown to be unreliable. It is for the accused, through
cross-examination of witnesses or through any other materials, to show that the
evidence of the police officer is either unreliable or at least unsafe to be acted upon in
a particular case. If the court has any good reason to suspect the truthfulness of such
records of the police the court
- 54 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB could certainly take into account the fact that no other
independent person was present at the time of recovery. But is not a legally
approvable procedure to presume the police action as unreliable to start with, nor to
jettison such action merely for the reason that police did not collect signatures of
independent persons in the documents made contemporaneous with such actions."
(emphasis supplied) In Rizwan Khan Vs. State of Chattisgarh [(2020) 9 SCC 627] it is held:
"11.2. Having gone through the entire evidence on record and the findings recorded
by the courts below, we are of the opinion that in the present case the prosecution has
been successful in proving the case against the accused by examining the witnesses
PW3, PW4, PW5, PW7 and PW8. It is true that all the aforesaid witnesses are police
officials and two independent witnesses who were panchanama witnesses had turned
hostile. However, all the aforesaid police witnesses are found to be reliable and
trustworthy. All of them have been thoroughly cross examined by the defence. There
is no allegation of any enmity between the police witnesses and the accused. No such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 24
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
defence has been taken in the statement under Section 313 CrPC. There is no law that
the evidence of police officials, unless supported by independent evidence, is to be
discarded and/ or unworthy of acceptance."
(emphasis supplied)
72. PW80 registered FIR as per Ex.P.98 after receiving report made by PW8 as per Ex.P.23. PW83,
Pw84 and PW87 are the
- 55 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB investigators. The evidence of other police personnel does not require
discussion as they carried out instructions given to them by the investigators and these aspects are
not disputable. PW83 conducted inquest in between '0' and 3.45 hours on 29.04.2011, seized the
blood stained clothes, a leather belt and, a pair of shoes and socks of the deceased at that time. He
obtained the statements of PW2, PW3, PW10 and PW26. Ex.P.3 is the inquest panchanama. And on
29.04.2011 in between 6.30 AM and 7.30 AM, he conducted spot panchanama as per Ex.P.24,
recorded the statements of PW1, PW2 and PW9. On the directions of his superior officer, he handed
over investigation to PW-87. After handing over investigation, he recorded statements of some more
witnesses and seized a few items on the instructions of PW-87. A few of his further actions need to
be referred to here. First one is, PW-5 produced before him cut pieces of 'Moksh' agarbatti packet
wrapper that had been sent to him by post. He seized those pieces under a panchanama-Ex.P.69 in
the presence of PW-65 and PW-66 and obtained the statement of PW-5. Cut pieces of wrapper are
marked as MO.39.
- 56 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
73. Most important aspect is seizure of MO-40. In this regard PW-83 has deposed that PW-4
himself came to police station on 08.05.2011 and handed over a Xerox letter containing 14 pages. He
seized it under panchanama or mahazar as per Ex.P.45. He obtained statements of PW-51 on
20.05.2011 and of PW-12 and PW-13 on 17.06.2011. Another aspect spoken to by him is that accused
no. 7 appeared before him on 13.06.2011 having obtained anticipatory bail. He obtained his
voluntary statement and released him on bail. When his attention was drawn to the portions of the
statements denied to have been given by the witnesses whom he had interrogated, he asserted that,
Ex.P.26 and P.26(a) were the statements of PW9; Ex.P.1 was the statement of PW1; Ex.P.17 and
P.17(a) were the statements of PW5; Ex.P.19 and P.19(a) were the statements of PW-6; Ex.P.29 was
the statement of PW-11; Ex.P.30 was the statement of PW-12; Ex.P.31 was the statement of PW-13,
Ex.P-56 was the statement of PW51 and Ex.P.3(a) and P.3(b) were the statements of PW-26.
74. PW-83 has not been discredited in the cross-examination at all. General denial suggestions were
given to him, and he refuted them. He has an explanation for not examining PW-2,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 25
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
- 57 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB PW-8 and PW-10 at the time of inquest, the reason is that they were in a
state of sorrow being the nearest relatives of the deceased. Though he admitted that he did not try to
ascertain the names of the enemies of the deceased during his investigation, this answer does not
affect his testimony. There are no reasons as to why his testimony is to be discarded.
75. PW-84 was working as police inspector at DCIB of Dakshina Kannada district. He was stationed
at Mangaluru. His evidence shows that he received a credible information that accused no.5-Sharan
had kept 'supari money' in his house at Akasha Bhavana, Mangaluru. He passed on this information
to his higher officer. On the oral instructions of his higher officer, he secured the panchas, i.e.,
PW-33 to PW-35, went to the house of accused no.5 at 3.45 pm on 08.05.2011, found accused no.5
being inside the house, and questioned him about supari money. It is his further evidence in this
regard that accused no.5 had received the money of Rs.11 lakhs from accused no.1 through accused
nos.2, 3 and 4. He told at that time that out of Rs.11 lakhs, Rs.50,000/- had been expended, gave Rs.
2 lakhs to accused no. 6 and had kept the remaining money of Rs.8,50,000/- in the almirah in his
house. Then the
- 58 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB almirah was opened in the presence of panchas. PW-84 has stated that
he saw bundles of currency notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- denominations. He seized totally a sum
of Rs.8,50,000/- produced by accused no.5. He also searched the person of accused no.5 and seized
two mobile phones from him. Accused No. 6 was also present in the house of accused no.5, and
when he was searched, PW-84 found accused no. 6 having Rs.2 lakhs being his share in the supari
amount and a mobile phone. Ex.P.47 is the panchanama drawn by PW-84 in connection with
seizure of supari money from the possession of accused nos.5 and 6 in the presence of PW-33 to
PW-35.
76. PW-84 has also given evidence that on the information given by accused nos.5 and 6 that
accused no.3 would be coming to Mangaluru bus stand, he went to bus stand at about 6.30 p.m. on
08.05.2011 with PW-34 and PW-35 and on accused no.3 being identified by accused no.5 at the bus
stand, he was caught and enquired. He told at that time that he was working as supervisor in the
farm house of accused no.1. He also told that in the bag which he was carrying, he had kept an
amount of Rs.2 lakhs, which he had kept with himself after making payment of supari money to
accused nos.5 and 6. He
- 59 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB said that accused no.1 had given supari amount for causing the death of
Ramakrishna. Accused no.3 had also a mobile phone with him. PW-84 seized an amount of Rs.2
lakhs and the mobile phone under mahazar drawn as per Ex.P.48 in the presence of PW-34, PW-35
and PW-78, who was an ASI. M.Os. 17 to 27 are the bundles of currency notes, M.O.27 and 28 are
the mobile phones seized from accused no.5; M.Os. 30 and 31 are the bundles of currency notes and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 26
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
M.O.32 is the mobile phone seized from accused no. 6. M.Os. 34 to 36 are the bundles of currency
notes and M.O.38 is the mobile phone recovered from accused no.3. PW-84 identified all these
material objects. He has stated that he gave a report of recoveries made by him to his higher officer
as per Ex.P.101.
77. Cross-examination of PW-84 does not impel to reject his testimony in examination-in-chief. One
point argued by the counsel for accused, and also observed by the trial court that the seizure of cash
and mobile phones made by PW-84 was not in accordance with Sec. 27 of the Evidence Act and
therefore, the seizures can not be acted upon. This argument does not stand. It is not necessary that
seizure of incriminating articles must always be preceded by a disclosure made by an accused
- 60 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB by giving voluntary or confession statement. Sec. 102 empowers the
police officer to recover and seize incriminating materials, and in fact PW-84 has answered in the
cross- examination that he acted under Sec. 102 of Cr.P.C. He also stated that before searching the
accused, he and his staff subjected themselves to search and this would remove the doubt in his
investigation.
78. It is not the case of the defence that PW-84 planted money with accused nos.3, 5 and 6 and
thereby it was a camouflaged search. He has testified the presence of PW-34 to PW-36 during the
search conducted by him, and his evidence in this regard has not been impeached. He might not
have been appointed in writing as an investigating officer, but he acted on the instructions of his
superior officer, which is permitted. Looked from any angle, we do not find any reason to reject the
evidence given by PW-84. Therefore hostility of panch witnesses hardly makes any impact.
79. PW-87 completed the investigation and filed charge sheet. In regard to investigation conducted
by PW-87, it was argued on behalf of the accused that she was not authorized to
- 61 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB investigate. This argument is not acceptable for, she was working as
Assistant Superintendent of Police, and Sullia was under her jurisdiction. Being a superior police
officer, she could exercise powers of a station house officer as envisaged in Sec. 36 of Cr.P.C.
Moreover her evidence shows that she was appointed as an investigating officer by her superior
officer.
80. Her evidence in chief shows extensive investigation made by her. On 09.05.2011, accused 3, 5
and 6 were brought before her by PW-84 arresting them and he also produced the 'supari money'
and mobile handsets seized by him and the mahazars Ex.P.47 and Ex.P.48 on which she put her
signature. Then accused nos.3, 5 and 6 gave their voluntary statements. Based on their voluntary
statements, she came to know the involvement of accused no.2 and on the very same day i.e.,
09.05.2011, she went to staff quarters of K.V.G. Dental College, took accused no.2 to her custody and
brought him to police station where he was arrested. As accused no.2 disclosed in his voluntary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 27
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
statement that he would show the place where he had kept his share in the supari amount given by
accused no.1, she was able to seize an amount of Rs.2,58,000/-. She has stated that accused no.2
himself led
- 62 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB her and the panchas PW-31 and PW-36 to room no. 4 in the first floor of
the staff quarters and removed a plastic cover containing bundles of currency notes of Rs.1,000/-
and Rs.500/- denominations. He told at that time that he had received Rs.2,60,000/- to his share,
and had spent Rs.2,000/-. She also seized two mobile phones. Ex.P.46 is the mahazar drawn at that
time in the presence of panchas, she identified the currency notes-M.O.41 to M.O.44, the plastic
cover-M.O.45 and two mobile phones-M.O.46 and M.O.47. Ex.P.112 is the portion of voluntary
statement of accused no.2 that led to disclosure.
81. She then ordered for tracing accused no.1. He was found at Madikeri. After he was produced
before her, she questioned him and obtained his voluntary statement. He disclosed before her the
differences between him and PW4. He also disclosed at that time that instigation by Ramakrishna
was the reason for differences between him and PW4.
82. As accused no. 3 had disclosed in his statement that he would show the place where the weapons
used for killing Ramakrishna and the motorcycle used by accused 5 and 6 had
- 63 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB been kept, she secured the panchas i.e., PW-37 and PW-38 and went to
'Amar Jyoti Farms' as led by accused no.3. She also took accused nos.5 and 6 with her. Accused no.3
took her and the panchas to room no. 3 situate on the western side of I floor of the farm house and
removed a polythene bag which was kept below an iron cot. He opened the bag and produced two
machetes which were wrapped with old newspaper. At that time accused no.3 told that accused
nos.5 and 6 handed over the machetes to him after the incident was over. Then accused no.3
brought PW-87 and the panchas to a shed where a motorcycle had been parked and said that it was
the motorcycle used by accused nos.5 and 6. She seized the motorcycle bearing reg. no.
KA-21-J-3141 along with petrol tank cover containing blood stains. She drew up a mahazar in this
regard as per Ex.P.49 in the presence of panchas. M.O.s.10 and 11 are the machetes, M.O.16 is black
colour petrol tank cover, M.O.48 is the polythene bag with old newspaper (Udayavani) and M.O.49
is the motorcycle. She identified all these material objects during trial. Ex.P.113 is the portion of
voluntary statement of accused no.3 which led to recovery of all these incriminating material
objects. Since
- 64 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB accused no.3 also disclosed in Ex.P.113 that he would show the place
where he had hidden the blood stained clothes of accused nos.5 and 6 and the number plate of the
motorcycle written in Kannada numericals, on 11.05.2011, PW-87 secured the panchas PW-40 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 28
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
PW41 and came to Amar Jyoti Farm house with accused nos.3, 5 and 6. Accused no. 3 took all of
them to a place where a water pump had been installed to a stream flowing in the middle of arecanut
garden. There he showed a plastic cover pack containing a blood stained white colour shirt with a
label "PEENUTS" and a light brown colour pants with small sticker "COMET CASUAL". These
clothes belonged to accused no.5 and he identified them at the spot. There was another pair of
clothes containing blood stains, a shirt containing the label "SUN VALLEY" and a black shaded
jeans pants that belonged to accused no.6 who identified at that time. The plastic cover also
contained a number plate written in Kannada numerical. The number written was KA-21-J-3141.
She seized all these items under a panchanama Ex.P.50. M.Os. 12 to 15 are the clothes of accused
nos.5 and 6 and M.Os. 51 and 52 are the number plate and plastic cover.
- 65 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
83. The evidence given by PW-87 discloses further that she came to know that in order to threaten
PW.5-Leeladhar who was friendly with Ramakrishna, accused nos.3 and 4 had sent cuttings of
'Moksh' agarbatti (incent sticks) cover to PW5, because the name of son of PW-5 is Moksh. Accused
no.3 disclosed that he would show the place where he had kept the remaining pieces of the agarbatti
cover, and accordingly on 14.05.2011, PW-87 could recover and seize those cuttings at the instance
of accused no.3. Those cuttings were kept in a plastic cover under a steel almirah in room no. 2 in
the first floor of Amar Jyoti Farm. PW-61 and PW-67 were the panchas who were present at that
time. Ex.P.70 is the mahazar drawn in that regard and M.O.53 is the plastic cover with wrapper
pieces. Ex.P.114 is portion of voluntary statement of accused no. 3 that led to discovery. Her
evidence also discloses accused no.1 being taken to police custody on 26.05.2011, his giving a
voluntary statement that he would show the place where he held discussions with accused nos. 2, 3
and 4 in regard to their plan. One such place was at K.V.G. International Public School. PW-42 and
PW-43 were the panchas to panchanama drawn as per Ex.P.51. PW-87 has
- 66 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB deposed that during that time accused no.1 produced before her xerox
copies of minutes of the meeting and memorandum of understanding in connection with division of
his family properties. These xerox copies are collectively marked as M.O.54.
84. After the arrest of accused no. 4 on 01.07.2011, his voluntary statement was recorded on
02.0.2011 by PW-87. Her evidence in this regard is that, as he disclosed that he had kept his share of
the supari money in his house and would produce the same, he took her, the panchas, PW-47 and
PW-52 and the other police staff to his house situate at a place called 'Sanuru padavu' of Karingala
village, Bantwala Taluk. PW-87 secured another pancha PW-53 from that village. Thereafter
accused no. 4 took entire team to a bed room of his house. On the eastern side of the bed room,
there were one box and some clothes. He removed a plastic cover containing cloth covers from
which he removed currency notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.1,000/- denominations. He produced total
amount of Rs.1,23,000/- before PW-87. She seized them under a mahazar-Ex.P.53. The currency

notes seized from accused
- 67 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB no.4 was marked M.O.57. Ex.P.116 is the portion of voluntary statement
of accused no.4 that led to seizure M.O.57.
85. The rest of the evidence of PW-87 shows further steps and action taken by her and affirmation of
statements given by witnesses examined by her. Needless to say that they are all the statements
denied to have been given by the witnesses. If her cross examination is read, overall impression that
can be gathered is that she has not been discredited. Major part of cross examination lies in the form
of suggestions which were all denied by her. However, some answers given by her need to be
referred to here as learned counsel for accused commented upon them.
86. She admitted that the Tahasildar of Puttur Taluk held test identification parade and the accused
were not identified by the witnesses. This answer does not go against prosecution; we will deal this
aspect later. She admitted one suggestion that when she interrogated the family members of the
deceased, none of them revealed that there existed differences between the deceased and accused
no.1. This answer does not affect her testimony because she refuted another suggestion that
- 68 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB accused no.1 was not responsible for the death of the deceased. She could
deny this suggestion so firmly only because her investigation revealed involvement of accused no.1.
When she was further questioned whether her investigation revealed that the deceased had enemity
with anybody else, her answer was that she did not come to know of it, that means her investigation
only revealed the hatred that accused no.1 had towards Ramakrishna or in other words, nobody
other than accused no.1 hated Ramakrishna.
87. In regard to money seized by her, the suggestion given was that the police department would
generally seize the money during elections. This suggestion was denied by PW-87, and the defence
further failed to give a suggestion as to which was the election scheduled to be held at that time.
88. According to learned counsel for accused, the clothes seized at the instance of accused no.3 were
not the clothes of accused nos.5 and 6 because PW-87 admitted the difference in colours of the
clothes. It is true that PW-87 has answered like that, but what she meant saying was that the clothes
of accused no.5 and accused no.6 were not of same colour. No
- 69 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB inference can be drawn that the seized clothes were not the clothes worn
by accused nos.5 and 6 at the time of committing crime. It is not the case of defence that all the
incriminating articles were planted to show a camouflaged recovery. It is not demonstrated that
PW-87 was enemical towards all the accused and had a particular reason for falsely implicating
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 30
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
them. We do not find any good reason to reject her evidence as tainted with interestedness.
89. The evidence given by PW-79 shows that on 09.05.2011 he arrested accused no.1 at Madikeri on
the instructions of PW- 87 who had by that time come to know about involvement of accused no.1.
This arrest is not disputed. But what learned counsel for accused no.2 argued was that accused no.2
was summoned to police station on 01.05.2011. Accused no.2 went to police station on 01.05.2011,
but he was not arrested, he was asked to go home. If his involvement was really there, he would have
been arrested on 01.05.2011 itself. There was no progress in investigation till 08.05.2011 and
everything was created on 08.05.2011 and 09.05.2011.
- 70 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
90. In this regard, it may be stated that though major part of investigation appears to have
commenced from 08.05.2011, there are no materials to hold against probity in investigation. If
accused no.2 was not arrested on 01.05.2011, that means as on that day, materials collected by the
investigator might be insufficient to arrest accused no.2. It has come in evidence of PW-79 that
accused no.2 tried to commit suicide in the toilet of the police station. It was on 02.05.2011. The
suggestion was that police put force on him to admit the guilt. This remained just in a suggestion.
Evidence of PW-87 shows the involvement of accused no.2.
91. As it becomes clear that the evidence given by investigating officers is believable, it is to be
examined whether the trial court has rightly appreciated the evidence of PW1, 8 and 9. PW8 was
partly treated hostile as he did not identify accused 5 and 6 in the court. It is true that his evidence
shows that he was not aware of differences between the first accused and his father and the reason
for murder of his father. He also did not identify accused nos.5 and 6. But it is a fact that he was an
eyewitness to the incident. He was very much present when two persons attacked his father and
inflicted such kind of
- 71 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB injuries as resulted in death later on. Whatever he has stated as to how
his father was attacked at about 7.45 p.m. on 28.04.2011 cannot be disbelieved and the defence also
does not dispute his presence at the time of occurrence. But according to prosecution, he saw the
faces of accused 5 and 6 and also the weapons that they had brought. He was treated hostile because
he stated in the examination in chief that he could not identify the assailants and the weapons. It is
true that in Ex.P.23, the report given by PW8 to the police for registration of FIR, he stated that he
was able to see the faces of the assailants as there was sufficient light and that he would identify
them as also the weapons which they had brought. The spot mahazar Ex.P.24 shows that there was a
streetlight pole at 20 feet distance from the place of incident and there was possibility of PW8 being
able to see the faces of the assailants. He also did not identify accused 5 and 6 in the jail. It appears
that he did not identify them during test identification parade. But in the cross examination by the
public prosecutor his clear answer was that he came to know about involvement of accused nos.5
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 31
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
and 6 and also the reason for the killing of his father when the police informed him.
- 72 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Ex.P.25(a) and 25(b) are the statements which he denied to have given
before the police during investigation.
92. If PW-8 did not identify accused nos.5 and 6 and also the weapons in the court during trial, it is
not possible to hold that his evidence becomes unreliable. He was a boy of 15 years at the time of
incident; when his father was suddenly attacked and inflicted injuries, was it possible for him to
keenly observe the faces of the assailants and the weapons in that state of fright even though there
was streetlight. Chances of PW8 being able or unable to see the assailants was 50:50. If for this
reason he answered in the cross examination that he came to know from the police that accused 5
and 6 were the persons who attacked his father and about the reason for the incident, nothing
importance can be given to it and in all probability the police must have informed him. This could be
the reason for his being not able to identify accused no.5 and 6 during test identification parade and
also in the court during trial. In our opinion it was his honest and natural answer. It is true that in
Ex.P.23 it is written that he had seen the assailants and would identify them. We have to state in this
regard that the station house writer might have instructed him to write like that. We
- 73 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB have to draw inference like this. Because PW-8 was a student of High
School; his age was 15 years at that time. He could not have drafted the complaint without the
assistance of station house writer. This was quite natural. Therefore as we have observed above, this
was a folly of that police. If the investigating officer informed him about accused 5 and 6, and the
motive for the incident and to that effect, his further statement was obtained by the investigating
officer, his answer in the cross examination that he came to know of all these aspects from the police
is to be accepted. It was not at all necessary for the police to have obtained his further statements in
that manner. Therefore partial hostility is not a factor to be considered seriously.
93. The trial court has given a finding that Ex.P.23 does not contain any information about
conspiracy. This is an erroneous finding of the trial court. Ex.P.23 was the report given by PW8
based on which FIR was registered. Motive was unravelled during investigation, PW8 did not have
any information about the motive when he went to police station on 28.04.2011. Mentioning
nothing about motive in Ex.P.23 should not have influenced the trial court to disbelieve the
testimony of PW8
- 74 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB regarding motive. The evidence of PW8 only shows that he was an
eyewitness to the incident, nothing more. Even it is not the case of the defence that he was not an
eyewitness. If he did not speak with regard to further statement, no inference can be drawn that he
is a hostile witness. In our opinion, he has spoken clearly what he knew and denied what he did not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 32
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
know.
94. The trial court has observed that the complaint (Ex.P.23) does not contain any allegation against
the accused regarding threat given to PW5 and his family members. This is yet another wrong
finding. If the threat that had been given to PW5 came to surface during investigation, how was it
possible that PW-8 should have mentioned about it in Ex.P.23.
95. PW1 and PW9 are not the eyewitnesses to the incident. The prosecution papers reveal that when
they were inside the house, they heard a shriek which made them to come out of the house and see
two persons running away. PW1 turned hostile completely, however from the evidence of PW9, it
can be clearly inferred that PW1 was also very much present and went to the place of incident
hearing the shouting voice. Evidence of PW73, the PWD Engineer who prepared the sketch
- 75 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB of scene of occurrence as per Ex.P.81 shows that KFDC quarters in which
PW9 was living is situate at a distance of 50 feet from the place of incident. The distance being short,
PW1 and PW9 could hear the shouting voice. PW9 has clearly stated in the examination in chief that
when he was in the quarters with PW1 on 28.04.2011, both of them heard a shout near Krishna
Ayurvedic Theraphy Clinic and they came out of the house. He asked PW1 to see who was going
there and he went to the place of incident where he saw one person having fallen down in a pool of
blood sustaining injuries. One person was standing near the injured and he said that he was the son
of the injured person and also revealed the name of the injured as Ramakrishna, who was still alive
at that time. That person was PW8 and he told PW9 that two persons came to that place and
severely assaulted his father with weapons. Because PW9 stated about only one person and failed to
identify accused nos.5 and 6, he was treated hostile partly and subjected to cross examination.
96. If the entire evidence of PW9 is read, two inferences can be drawn, firstly that PW1 gave false
evidence before the court by turning hostile. It is a fact that PW9 testifies the presence
- 76 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB of PW1 at that time with him. Secondly, both PW1 and PW9 could not
have seen the faces of accused nos.5 and 6. PW-9 asserts to have seen only one person. This was the
reason why he denied to have given statements as per Ex.P.26 and 26(a) about two persons. He
could not have seen the faces of the assailants. And if he did not testify as regards the investigation
part found in the further statement which he denied to have given as per Ex.P.26, 26(a) and P.27, no
adverse inference can be drawn against PW9. It was not necessary for the investigating officer to
obtain his further statement as per Ex.P.27 regarding the investigation.
97. As PW8 did not identify the accused nos.5 and 6, it is to be examined whether the circumstances
which the prosecution has brought out would connect all the accused in commission of crime. The
important circumstances to be proved are (i) motive, (ii) seizure of incriminating materials, and (iii)
FSL report. The circumstance of motive takes into its hold the preparations made by the accused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 33
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
and other attending circumstances.
- 77 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
98. We digress for a moment to deal with the nature of evidence to be placed before the court
whenever the prosecution has to prove the circumstances to establish its case. In this context, a
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of M.G. Agarwal Vs. State of Maharashtra (AIR 1963 SC
200), may be relied on. The following is the observation in para no.18.
"18. There is another point of law which must be considered before dealing with the
evidence in this case. The prosecution case against accused No.1 rests on
circumstantial evidence. The main charge of conspiracy under section 120-B is
sought to be established by the alleged conduct of the conspirators and so far as
accused No.1 is concerned, that rests on circumstantial evidence alone. It is a
well-established rule in criminal jurisprudence that circumstantial evidence can be
reasonably made the basis of an accused persons' conviction if it is of such a
character that it is wholly inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and is
consistent only with his guilt. If, the circumstances proved in the case are consistent
either with the innocence of the accused or with his guilt, then the accused is entitled
to the benefit of doubt. There is no doubt or dispute about this position. But in
applying this principle, it is necessary to distinguish between facts which may be
called primary or basic on the one hand and inference of facts to be drawn from them
on the other. In regard to the proof of basic or primary facts, the Courts has to judge
the evidence in the ordinary way, and in the appreciation of evidence in respect of
- 78 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB the proof of these basic or primary facts there is no scope
for the application of the doctrine of benefit of doubt. The Court considers the
evidence and decides whether that evidence proves a particular fact or not. When it is
held that a certain fact is proved, the question arises whether that fact leads to the
inference of guilt of the accused person or not, and in dealing with this aspect of the
problem, the doctrine of benefit of doubt would apply and an inference of guilt can be
drawn only if the proved fact is wholly inconsistent with the innocence of the accused
and is consistent only with his guilt. It is in the light of this legal position that the
evidence in the present case has to be appreciated."
(emphasis supplied) That means while appreciating evidence, it is not necessary that every
circumstance is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Primary or basic evidence suffices and it
must be proved in the ordinary way. We are compelled to make an observation here. While dealing
with appeals either against acquittal or conviction judgements, we have seen some trial court judges
referring to evidence of each witness and giving a finding whether prosecution case is proved
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 34
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
beyond reasonable doubt or not through that witness. This, we opine, a wrong method of
appreciation of evidence. Only after collation and analysis of entire evidence, i.e., both oral and
documentary, it must be examined whether overall inference leads to proof
- 79 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB beyond reasonable doubt. If primary evidence in regard to one
circumstance is not established, there is a break in chain of circumstances. Therefore what has to be
examined now is whether the prosecution has provided basic proof with regard to every
circumstance.
99. Harking back, the first circumstance to be examined is motive. The prosecution has come up
with a case that management of a number of educational institutions founded by the father of
accused no.1 and PW4 were partitioned between them and the deceased played a vital role in PW4
getting a major share. Also a decision was taken that the engineering college which fell to the share
of accused no.1 should be shifted to another place and accused no.1 should be given Rs.25 crore.
Rs.12 crore had been paid to accused no.1 and in regard to payment of the balance, accused no.1
suspected that deceased was an obstacle and he was giving wrong advice to PW4.
100. In paragraph no. 21 we have referred to the witnesses who were examined to establish the
motive. The testimony of PW2 gives some inkling to the motive; he has stated that his
- 80 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB brother i.e., Ramakrishna himself had told him about differences
between him and accused no.1. Furthermore, there is no better witness than PW4 who can speak
about the motive. Though other witnesses mentioned above have turned hostile, and PW4 too has
turned hostile to some extent, it is possible to draw certain inferences about the motive and the
reason for PW4 not supporting the prosecution case. PW4 does not deny the partition between him
and accused no.1, he also does not deny the decision taken to shift the engineering college and Rs.25
crore to be given to accused no.1 for developing the engineering college at another place. But he
denied certain facts such as differences between him and PW4, the dissatisfaction that accused no.1
carried as he did not get the management of the medical college in the partition, the deceased being
responsible for loosing the medical college to his share and accused no.1 subjecting the deceased to
insultation and humiliation in front of the staff of the institutions. It is also the case of the
prosecution that PW4 had written a letter to his father complaining against accused no.1. He denied
all the suggestions given to him in this regard and also the statement made before the police as per
Ex.P.15(b).
- 81 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB When xerox copy of the letter purportedly handed over by him to the
police was confronted, he denied that and when he was asked to identify the signature on that letter,
instead of admitting or denying it, his answer was that the signature on the xerox copy resembled
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 35
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
his signature. MO40 is the letter which according to prosecution PW4 handed over to the
investigating officer during investigation. In this context we refer to evidence of PW-83, the police
inspector who seized MO-40.
101. PW-83 has stated that PW-4 came to police station and handed over xerox copy of a 14 page
letter to him and he seized it by drawing a panchanama as per Ex.P.45 and subjected it to P.F. No.
32/2011. PW-83 has not at all been cross examined by the defence on this aspect, that means
handing over of M.O.40 to PW-83 by PW-4 remained unchallenged. For this reason total denial
stand of PW-4 can not be believed, inference is that PW-4 handed over copy of the letter which he
had written to his father to PW-83.
102. Trial court should have read M.O.40 and assessed the evidence of PW-83 and PW-4 together. If
we read M.O.40, two
- 82 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB aspects become clear. Firstly there were differences between the brothers
in regard to division of properties and educational institutions. And secondly PW-4 brought to the
notice of his father that accused no.1 had insulted the deceased and staff of the college (found in
page no. 7 of the letter) and, had once threatened the deceased that he would shed his blood. The
threatening sentences found in page no. 9 of the letter is extracted here.

(underlining by us) The extracted sentences indicate that accused no.1 hated the deceased and had
given life threat to him. M.O.40 provides ample proof for the circumstance of motive. Further
inference that can be drawn is that PW-4 did make a statement before the investigating officer as
per Ex.P.16 regarding the reasons
- 83 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB for accused no.1 developing hatred towards the deceased, and his oral
evidence in this regard was false.
103. The further case of prosecution is that once there was a quarrel between PW4 and accused no.1
relating to a matter pertaining to the college mess. Attention of PW4 was drawn to this quarrel
during cross examination by the public prosecutor and at that time he admitted that there had taken
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 36
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
place exchange of words between them although he denied the suggestion that it was a heated
exchange of words. PW-58, PW-59 and PW-60 are the witnesses examined to testify the quarrel.
Although these witnesses turned hostile, because of admission given by PW4 about exchange of
words and, presence of staff of the college and some others at that time, an inference can be drawn
that both of them might have quarreled or had some discussion in regard to involvement of the
deceased. It can also be said that PW-58 to PW-60 knew this quarrel being present at that time and
they turned hostile intentionally.
104. It can be demonstrated very well the reason why PW4 did not fully support the prosecution
case. It is his clear admission
- 84 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB that his sister Govardhini had filed a suit at Madikeri court in relation to
property disputes and in the said suit, accused no.1 and PW4 were the defendants. The suit was filed
after the incident and they engaged a common lawyer for defending them. A suggestion was given to
him that because of this reason he decided not to depose against his brother. He might have denied
the suggestion, but it is not impossible to draw an inference that because of this subsequent
development, he might have decided not to depose against his brother.
105. Another contradictory stand of PW4 can be mentioned here to infer his intention to turn hostile
partly. The deceased was working under PW4 as an administrator of the medical college. Soon after
attack on the deceased, PW4was informed of the same by PW7. He should have been informed
obviously. In the examination in chief he has stated that he came to know about the incident and
immediately telephoned to his driver Haneef to go to the spot and then he went to the hospital.
According to prosecution the name of the driver was Abdul Raheman and therefore a suggestion was
given to him that as soon as he came to know of the incident, he asked his driver Abdul Raheman to
go to Ambetadka, the place where the
- 85 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB incident had occurred. He denied that he asked his driver Abdul
Raheman. Here the name of the driver is not important, what is important is his asking the driver to
go to the spot. If he denied that he gave a statement before the police to that extent it is nothing but
a falsehood and therefore a clear inference can be drawn that PW4 did not want to depose about the
motive behind the incident. His partly turning hostile was intentional. PW-54, PW-55 and PW-56
are the other witnesses examined for proving motive as in their presence accused no.1 had scolded
the deceased and used to say that something should be done to him. These witnesses have not
supported, but we do not find any reason to ignore the testimony of the investigating officer, PW-87
who has affirmed that PW-54, PW- 55 and PW-56 did give statements before her during their
investigation that they had seen accused no.1 scolding the deceased.
106. PW-10 is the wife of deceased. Nobody has disputed the fact that the deceased had resigned
from the post of Principal of K.V.G. Polytechnic, and later PW-4 appointed him as Administrator of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 37
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
the medical college. PW-10 being the wife of deceased must be aware of the reasons for her
husband's
- 86 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB resignation. If she deposed that she did not know the reason, that answer
cannot be believed. For the same reason it can be further inferred that she knew the differences
between accused no.1 and her husband, and about the threat given by accused no.1 to her husband.
In this view, her statement, Ex.P.28 duly proved through the investigating officer becomes
admissible.
107. PW-6, PW-7 and PW-11 to PW-13 are the relatives of accused no.1 and their turning hostile is
quite obvious; their denial statements show their interestedness in accused no.1. The way PW-6 has
given answers itself demonstrates that she is untruthful, her strong determination to deviate from
earlier statements. But so far as PW-5 is concerned, there is a strong reason for his turning hostile.
It appears that PW-5 and the deceased were very close; he was working as Administrator of K.V.G.
Ayurvedic Medical College. Though in the examination in chief he denied his knowledge about
differences between accused no.1 and the deceased, in the cross-examination by public prosecutor
he admitted a suggestion that a quarrel had taken place between accused no.1 and the deceased in
regard to a matter relating to college mess. He denied the other suggestion as regards threat given to
the deceased at that time
- 87 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB by accused no.1. The rest of his evidence taking complete ignorance of the
prosecution case appears to be owing to threat signal given to him. The name of the son of PW-5 is
'Moksh'. His wife received a postal cover on 23.04.2011. In that postal cover there were pieces of the
wrapper of the Agarbatti packet on which the name 'Moksh' was printed. The seizure of cut pieces of
the wrapper at two places stands proved from the evidence of the concerned investigation officers
whose evidence is already referred to. PW-5 might have denied that he himself handed over the
wrapper pieces, but it is a false answer. This circumstance clearly indicates that because of this
threat, PW-5 might have deposed against prosecution. The wife of PW5 might have received the
postal cover on 23.04.2011, i.e., five days before the occurrence of incident. The trial court has
commented that this is irrelevant. This reason cannot be accepted. The date is not important.
Because, PW5 continued to work in the same institutions when he was summoned to the court to
depose, overwhelmed by the threat signal and his employment in the institution under the
management of accused no.1, he might have decided not to support the prosecution.
- 88 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
108. The next two connected circumstances are conspiracy and the preparation. As discussed above
no witnesses has supported. Direct evidence to prove conspiracy is seldom available and therefore
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 38
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
the established principle is that inferences are to be drawn from the attending circumstances. There
must be evidence indicating the approximate time of commencement of conspiracy. The conspiracy
must have continued till the accomplishment of the act. It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Mohd. Khalid V. State of W.B. [(2002) 7 SCC 334] that:
"24. Conspiracies are not hatched in the open, by their nature, they are secretly
planned, they can be proved even by circumstantial evidence, the lack of direct
evidence relating to conspiracy has no consequence.
25. In Kehar Singh v. State (Delhi Admn.), (AIR at p. 1954) this Court observed (SCC
pp. 732-33, para 275) "275. Generally, a conspiracy is hatched in secrecy and it may
be difficult to adduce direct evidence of the same. The prosecution will often rely on
evidence of acts of various parties to infer that they were done in reference to their
common intention. The prosecution will also more often rely upon circumstantial
evidence. The conspiracy can be undoubtedly proved by such evidence direct or
circumstantial. But the court must enquire whether the two persons are
independently pursuing the same end or they have come
- 89 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB together to the pursuit of the unlawful object. The former
does not render them conspirators, but the latter does. It is, however, essential that
the offence of conspiracy required some kind of physical manifestation of agreement.
The express agreement, however, need not be proved. Nor actual meeting of the two
persons is necessary. Nor is it necessary to prove the actual words of communication.
The evidence as to transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design may be
sufficient."
Conspiracy can be proved by circumstances and other materials.
To establish a charge of conspiracy knowledge about indulgence in either an illegal act or a legal act
by illegal means is necessary. In some cases, intent or unlawful use being made of the goods or
services in question may be inferred from the knowledge itself. This apart, the prosecution has not
to establish that a particular unlawful use was intended, so long as the goods or service in question
could not be put to any unlawful use. Finally, when the ultimate offence consists of a chain of
actions, it would not be necessary for the prosecution to establish, to bring home the charge of
conspiracy, that each of the conspirators had the knowledge of what the collaborator would do, so
long as it is known that the collaborator would put the goods or service to an unlawful use."
The case put forward is that accused no.1 had discussions with his employees, i.e. accused nos.2 to 4,
and then engaged accused nos.5 and 6. Firstly whether accused nos.2 to 4 were working under
accused no.1 or not, is to be examined. PW71 is

The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB the main witness examined to prove this aspect. She being the wife of
accused no.1 turned hostile obviously. She was the director of Academy of Liberal Education, Sullia.
In the examination in chief she denied her acquaintance with accused nos.3 and 4, although she
stated that she knew accused no.2 who was working as an attender in their institutions. She
admitted her signatures on three documents Ex.P.74 to 76, but denied to have given those
documents to police. Though she stated that the police obtained her signatures on the documents in
the police station, without any hesitation, it can be stated that her answer is nothing but falsehood.
Ex.P.74 is a letter written by her to the police circle inspector stating that accused no.2-Manoj Rai
was working as the assistant of accused no.1 and as a site supervisor. Ex.P.75 is a letter in regard to
accused no.3-Nagesh who was working as writer in their Amar Jyoti Farms and Ex.P.76 was another
letter issued by her to the police inspector stating that accused no.4 was a construction worker on
daily wages in the institutions of which she was a director. These letters cannot be ignored and they
testify the fact that accused nos.2 to 4 were all known to accused no.1.
- 91 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
109. PW-72 has also given evidence that accused no.2 was working in the Academy of Liberal
Education for which accused no.1 was the General Secretary. Ex.P.78 is the salary certificate of
accused no.2 issued by PW-72 in the capacity of in-charge Principal of Dental College. This evidence
fortifies Ex.P.74. As it becomes clear that accused nos.2 to 4 were known to accused no.1, the next
aspect to be examined is whether there is evidence for the conspiracy.
110. Since conspiracy gets revealed only during investigation, the evidence of the investigating
officers must be first considered. We have already held that the investigating officers' evidence is
believable. And therefore, from the evidence of PW-87, it is forthcoming that accused nos.3, 5 and 6
gave confession or voluntary statements before her. Their statements disclosed that accused no.1
had hatched conspiracy with them. After getting to know the information from their voluntary
statements, PW-87 proceeded further to ascertain related circumstances. It is to be noted here that
unless any one of the accused gives information about conspiracy it does come to light; the
investigating officer cannot be expected to have clairvoyance; therefore such a statement by the
accused
- 92 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB is a disclosure of fact within the meaning of Section 27 of the Evidence
Act. It is necessary to mention here that confession or voluntary statement need not always lead to
recovering concealed incriminating materials. The disclosure thus made by accused nos. 3, 5 and 6
is also a disclosure of fact, and it gets fortified if other corroborative evidence is available. Applicable
to this context, we place reliance on a judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Mehboob Ali
and another Vs. State of Rajasthan (2016) 14 SCC 640. In paragraph no. 15 it is held as below:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 40
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
"15. It is apparent that on the basis of the information furnished by accused Mehboob
Ali and Firoz and other accused, Anju Ali was arrested. The fact that Anju Ali was
dealing with forged currency notes was not to the knowledge of the police. The
statement of both the accused has led to discovery of fact and arrest of co-accused not
known to the police. They identified him and ultimately statements have led to
unearthing the racket of use of fake currency notes. Thus the information furnished
by the aforesaid accused persons vide information memos is clearly admissible which
has led to the identification and arrest of accused Anju Ali and as already stated from
possession of Anju Ali fake currency notes had been recovered. As per information
furnished by accused Mehboob and Firoz vide memos Exts.P-41 and P-42, the fact
has been discovered by police as to the involvement of accused Anju Ali which was
not to the knowledge of the police.
- 93 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Police was not aware of accused Anju Ali as well as the fact
that he was dealing with fake currency notes which were recovered from him. Thus
the statement of the aforesaid accused Mehboob and Firoz is clearly saved by Section
27 of the Evidence Act. The embargo put by Section 27 of the Evidence Act was
clearly lifted in the instant case. The statement of the accused persons has led to the
discovery of fact proving complicity of the other accused persons and the entire chain
of circumstances clearly make out that the accused acted in conspiracy as found by
the trial court as well as the High Court.
(emphasis supplied) Examined whether any corroboration is available, the first one is
ascertainment of places where accused no.1 held meetings with accused nos.2 to 4.
PW-87 has deposed that accused no.1 himself showed those places and the other
accused also showed the places. If at all for any reason the sentences in their
voluntary statements can not be used against accused nos.2 to 4 because of bar
contained in Section 26 of the Evidence Act, nevertheless the unimpeached testimony
of the investigation officers stands. Ex.P.51 is the panchanama drawn by PW-87 in
the presence of PW-42 and PW-43 at K.V.G. International Public School seeing the
place of meeting shown by accused no.1. The hostile evidence of PW-42 and PW-43
- 94 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB does not matter. Ex.P.54 is another panchanama drawn in
the presence of PW-48 and PW-49 at a place i.e., a shed in front of the farm house
belonging to accused no.1. This was another place where accused no.1 held discussion
with accused nos.2 to 4 for killing Ramakrishna. Again the hostile evidence of PW-48
and PW-49 does not assume significance. Therefore ample evidence is available that
accused nos.1 to 4 met and held discussions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 41
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
111. PW-61 to PW-64 may have resiled from their statements, Ex.P.65 to Ex.P.68
made before the investigating officer, but those statements, which are to be accepted
inspite of their hostility towards prosecution, throw light that accused no.3 had taken
accused nos.5 and 6 to the hotels, and more particularly all these three accused
visited Hotel Rama on 28.04.2011 soon before occurrence of incident. The duly
proved statements of these witnesses is additional factor to infer conspiracy.
112. The preparation made by accused nos.1 to 4 has been unfolded. The witnesses
examined for proving preparation turned hostile, yet their hostile evidence does not
have negative impact on the prosecution case. The evidence of
- 95 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB police officer in this regard is believable. The preparations
unravelled during investigation is like this. Accused nos.1 to 4 searched for hired
killers. PW-14, 15 and 25 were contacted and enquired by accused no.4 about
availability of anybody being ready to take up the task of killing Ramakrishna. As
they did not agree, accused no.2 engaged accused nos.5 and 6.
Accused no.5 came to Sullia on 27.04.2011 riding the motorcycle belonging to PW-18.
There is believable evidence which shows that accused nos.5 and 6 were lodged in the
farm house and they used to be supplied food in the pick up van which was seized.
There is no reason to discard the evidence of the investigating officer in this regard.
The number plate of the motorcycle was also changed, PW-16 would meet PW-51 and
ask him to write a number plate in Kannada numerical.
They may have not supported but their evidence is nothing but falsehood. Then
accused no.4 would buy two machetes from the hardware shop of PW-50. Evidence
in this regard is believable. These are the supporting factors for conspiracy.
113. There is another important aspect which can be deciphered from the evidence of
PW-23 and 24. They too have turned hostile, notwithstanding that, what can be
discerned is
- 96 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB that accused no.5 met PW-23 in the second week of April,
2011 and told him about the offer given to him. Accused no.5 told him that they
would be killing Ramakrishna, and whether he was ready to admit the guilt and if he
did so, he would be suitably rewarded monetarily and all the court expenses would be
met. Accused no.5 also enquired PW-24 about availability of another boy. PW-24
agreed for it and then contacted PW-23.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 42
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
Then after 28.04.2011, PW-23 and PW-24 were brought to farm house and lodged
there. They were shown the place of incident, the house of the deceased and the
college. That means they were fed with information, but ultimately the investigating
officer came to know about their non involvement and therefore they were shown as
chargesheet witnesses. This is an important factor which throws light on how the
accused nos.1 to 4 planned to implement the object of their conspiracy.
The evidence in regard to preparation made by them not only strengthens the other
part of evidence pointing to conspiracy but also provides supplementary evidence for
motive. It is impossible to obtain minute details, rule of prudence is to be applied to
draw inferences as it is the best test. The conclusion to be drawn therefore is this:
accused no.1 first conspired with
- 97 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB accused nos.2 to 4; probably in the month of March, 2011,
they conceived their plan and it continued till Ramakrishna was killed on 28.04.2011.
Accused nos.5 and 6 were not part of conspiracy at the inception, once they agreed to
attack Ramakrishna with the sole object of killing him, they also became members of
conspiracy. The evidence shows that only after coming to know the background they
gave their consent.
Therefore there was meeting of minds of accused nos.1 to 6.
In this view, the circumstances of conspiracy also stands proved from the primary
evidence provided by the prosecution.
114. The third circumstance is seizures and recoveries made by the investigating
officers. The oral evidence of the witnesses is already referred to. Except the
testimonies of police officers, there is no corroboration from independent witnesses.
The evidence of investigating officers do very well prove the seizure of supari money
from the possession of each of accused nos.2 to 6, the seizure of machetes, blood
stained clothes of the accused, the number plate of the motorcycle and the cut
wrapper pieces of 'Moksh' agarabatti pack. The seizures made by PW-84 was not
based on voluntary statements, but his evidence discloses that he had been
- 98 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB instructed by his superior police officer to search and
seize, which is permissible under Sec. 102 of Cr.P.C. The comment made by the trial
court that PW-84 was not authorized to conduct investigation is another instance of
non application of mind. The trial court has also observed that PW-84 was working in
Income Tax Department and the information he received was about illgotten income
of accused nos.5 and 6. It is wondering how such an observation could be made
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 43
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
without any basis. His clear evidence is that he conducted search when he was
working as Police Inspector at DCIB (District Crime Investigation Bureau) of
Dakshina Kannada District.
115. The trial court has made an observation that the clothes of accused nos.5 and 6
were not seized on the basis of their voluntary statements and therefore the seizure of
clothes is not believable and therefore the seizure of clothes is not believable.
This is another instance of non-application of mind by the trial court to the evidence.
The evidence brought on record is that accused nos.5 and 6, handed over their blood
stained clothes and the weapons to accused no.3 who thereafter concealed them. The
recovery of clothes could be made only at the instance of accused no.3. It has come in
evidence that at the
- 99 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB time of this recovery accused nos.5 and 6 were also
present.
The testimony of PW-87 in regard to seizure panchanamas drawn by her stands
unblemished despite lack of support from panch witnesses. Apposite to this context
we place reliance on a judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Mallikarjun and
others Vs. State of Karnataka [(2019) 8 SCC 359] where it is held in paragraph no. 23
as under:
"23. As pointed out earlier, based on the disclosure statement of Accused 1, MO 1
dagger which was kept hidden in the haystack of fodder in the loft of the cattle shed
behind the house of Accused 1 had been seized under Ext.P-9 panchnama in the
presence of panch witnesses PW 8 Chandrappa and PW 9 Mahadevappa Needgera.
The said panch witnesses have not supported the prosecution case and turned
hostile. MO 2 dagger and MO 3 handle of the axe were recovered from the scene of
occurrence under Ext.P-7 spot panchanama. On behalf of the accused, the learned
Senior Counsel contended that the evidence of PW 17 PSI as to the recovery of MO 1
dagger at the behest of Accused 1 is doubtful and when PWs 8 and 9 have turned
hostile, no weight could be attached to the alleged recovery of MO 1 dagger. There is
no merit in the contention that merely because the panch witnesses turned hostile,
the recovery of the weapon would stand vitiated. It is fairly well settled that the
evidence of the investigating officer can be relied upon to prove the recovery even
when the panch witnesses turned hostile, In Rameshbhai

NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Mohanbhai Koli V. State of Gujarat, it was held as under:
(SCC pp. 121-22, paras 33-35).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 44
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
"33. In Modan Singh V. State of Rajasthan it was observed (at SCC p. 438, para 9)
that where the evidence of the investigating officer who recovered the material
objects is convincing, the evidence as to recovery need not be rejected on the ground
that seizure witnesses did not support the prosecution version. Similar view was
expressed in Mohd. Aslam v. State of Maharashtra.
34. In Anter Singh V. State of Rajasthan, it was further held that: (SCC p. 661, para
10) '10. ... even if panch witnesses turn hostile, which happens very often in criminal
cases, the evidence of the person who effected the recovery would not stand vitiated.
35. This Court has held in a large number of cases that merely because the panch
witnesses have turned hostile is no ground to reject the evidence if the same is based
on the testimony of the investigating officer alone. In the instant case, it is not the
case of defence that the testimony of the investigating officer suffers from any
infirmity or doubt. (Vide Modan Singh case, Krishna Gopal case and Anter Singh
cae.)"
PW 17 PSI has clearly spoken about the recovery of MO 1 dagger at the behest of Accused 1 and MO
2 dagger and MO 3 handle of the axe from the scene of occurrence and his evidence cannot be
discarded merely because panch witnesses have turned hostile."

NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
116. The next circumstance to be examined is whether the report given by PW-77 connects the
accused to the crime. PW-77 was a Scientific Officer at Regional Forensic Science Laboratory at
Mangalore. Her deposition is that having received the articles in sealed packs on 10.06.2011 in
relation to Crime No. 66/2011 of Sullia Police Station, she subjected the same to examination. The
articles sent to the laboratory were, a shirt, pants, a belt, a pair of shoes and socks, road surface
scrapings with and without blood stains, the clothes of accused nos.5 and 6, the weapons and petrol
tank cover. The shirt, pants, belt, shoes and socks belonged to the deceased. Road scrapings were
collected at the time of conducting spot panchanama. The other pack contained the articles such as
two shirts with labels 'Peenuts' and 'Sun Valley', two pants one being of light brown colour with the
lable 'Comet Casual' and another jeans pant containing the sticker 'Racing'. These clothes belonged
to accused nos.5 and 6. She also examined two machetes and a petrol tank cover. The serology test
conducted on the blood stains found in them confirmed the presence of 'O' group human blood in all
the items except a few. Her clear evidence is, in the items marked with letters 'D'
- 102 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 45
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB and 'H', i.e., the road scrappings with blood stains and the cotton used for
collecting blood stains, the features of blood had been destroyed and therefore she could not detect
the origin of blood and its group. She also could not determine the blood group in article No. B1 i.e.,
belt. But her report confirmed the presence of 'O' group human blood in all the items except item 'E'
which was a 'controlled road scrapings' without blood stains. Ex.P.92 and Ex.P.94 are her reports.
Ex.P.93 is the seal of laboratory. She identified her signature on the reports.
117. One main suggestion given to her in the cross examination was that the report would be
incomplete if there was no mention of 'Rh' factor as positive or negative. She did not agree this
suggestion. It may be noted here that before giving such a suggestion, it was elicited from her that
fresh blood sample was necessary for correctly determining 'Rh' factor. Therefore if she did not
mention 'Rh' factor in the report, it cannot be said that her report was incomplete. Her testimony is
believable.
- 103 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
118. The testimony of PW-74, the doctor who conducted the postmortem examination finds
relevancy here. His evidence is that the blood group of the deceased was 'O+'. And on 11.05.2011, he
was asked by PW-87 to collect the blood samples of accused nos.5 and 6 and give a report about
their blood groups. When he conducted the test, he found that the blood group of accused no.5 was
'A+' and that of accused No. 6 was 'O(-)'. Ex.P.87 and P.88 are the out patient slips of accused nos.5
and 6 respectively.
119. The evidence given by PW-74 is an answer to the argument of Sri R.B. Deshpande that the
evidence of PW-77 cannot be accepted because the prosecution failed to prove the blood samples of
accused nos.5 and 6. Now if the entire evidence of PW-74 and 77 is put to analysis, firstly it can be
said that both the witnesses have not been discredited at all in the cross-examination and secondly
that their evidence clearly points to the involvement of accused nos.5 and 6 in attacking and killing
Ramakrishna. This circumstance therefore is also proved.
- 104 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
120. As we have found that there is clinching primary evidence in proof of the circumstances that
the prosecution was to prove, in order to further strengthen the independent evidence thus available
in respect of each circumstance, we may refer to Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act. This Section
reads as below:
"30. Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and others jointly
under trial for same offence.-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 46
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a
confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such
persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against
such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession."
121. The ingredients of the section are; (1) more persons than one should be jointly tried for the
same offence; (2) confession should have been given by one of such persons; (3) that confession
must affect himself and some other of such persons; (4) the confession must be proved. If all the
ingredients are proved, the court may take into consideration such confession not only against the
other person implicated by the person who
- 105 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB has given confession but also against him. Illustration (a) to this Section
explains the meaning of Section 30 very clearly. The illustration is extracted here.
"(a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved tht A said - "B and I
murdered C". The Court may consider the effect of this confession as against B."
122. Section 30 speaks about confession given by one accused against another. What is this
confession? The simple meaning of confession is admitting guilt. It may be extra judicial confession,
or a confession made before the police officer or a confession made before the Magistrate u/s 164 of
The Code of Criminal Procedure.
123. Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act is a clear bar for proving confession made by an accused
to a police officer. Section 26 states that confession made by a person while being in the custody of a
police officer cannot be proved against him; but if a confession has been made in the immediate
presence of Magistrate, it can be proved.
124. Section 27 is an exception to Section 26. This section permits proving discovery of a fact
disclosed by an accused in his confession statement before the police. The fact disclosed
- 106 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB must relate to distinct fact which a police officer comes to know only
from the confession statement. That means till then, the police officer should not have had the
information of fact disclosed in the confession statement.
125. Section 30 does not state that only a particular type of confession can be considered by the
Court if it is proved. Therefore all types of confessions as mentioned above can be considered
provided other ingredients of Section 30 are satisfied. Thus seen even though there is a clear bar
under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, the confession made by one accused before the
investigating officer can be used against the other accused. We now refer to some of the decided
cases on this point.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 47
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
126. A full bench decision of Madras High Court in the case of Athappa Goundan & Others Vs.
Emperor (AIR 1937 MADRAS 618) holds that confession under Section 27 can be taken into
consideration under Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act. This observation is found in page
no.629, the relevant paragraph reads as below:
- 107 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB "Upon the second question referred, in my view, so much
of the statement set out in Question 1, as is admissible against accused 1, can be taken
into consideration as against accused
2. I see no reason for drawing any distinction between the confession in S. 27 and the
confession which cannot be proved at all under S.25, and under S.26 only when is
made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate or a confession made in Court or to a
member of the public. There is nothing in the section which restricts the confession
to one recorded before a Magistrate. On the other hand, Illustration A. to S.30
suggests that the section contemplates "the taking into consideration" of a confession
to an ordinary witness. It follows therefore that all such confessions when the
accused are being tried jointly for the same offence when made by one of them
affecting himself and another or others of the accused, may be taken into
consideration as against the other of others under S.30, Evidence Act. In support of
this view there are 31 Mad. 127, 50 Bom. 683 and 54 Mad. 75. I would therefore
answer this question in the affirmative. The question of whether the same
considerations apply to accused 3 does not arise as all references to her were deleted
by the trial Court and I am only dealing with such part of the statement as was
admitted. My answer to Question 1 is that the following statement is admissible in
evidence under S.27 of the Act, viz.:
He stated that at about 11 o'clock in the night of 26th March, 1936, he and Gurunatha
Goundan, son of Erangattur Kanda Goundan together murdered the deceased
Sottayan alias Sennimalai Goundan by gagging his mouth with cloth by pressing him
with rope....that that night....they got two bottles of illicit arrack....that a small
quantity was left over in one
- 108 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB bottle only.... After (1), the empty bottle, (2), a rope and
the cloth which was used for gagging the mouth have been buried in cowdung pond
adjoining the cattle-shed in the compound and the other bottle with some arrack in a
heap of mud near a log of wood in a corner of the compound east of the choultry at
Kallippatti and that he would go there, take them out and give.
And, as I have said in my answer to Question 2, the whole of that statement can be
taken into consideration as against accused 2 also. It is necessary to add for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 48
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
information of the Sessions Judges and the Police that as pointed out in Cr. Appeals
Nos. 615 and 660 of 1936, by a Bench of this High Court, statements made by an
accused person which are or may be provable under S. 27, Evidence Act, should be
clearly and carefully recorded by the police officers concerned. They should be
recorded in the first person, that is to say, as far as possible in the actual words of the
accused. They should not be paraphrased. Obviously, if what a man says is to be used
in evidence his own words should be used and not a rendering into third person of
the purport of his statement. With such a record of the statement before him it will
then be for the trial Judge to decide how much of it is admissible under the section. I
might add that no point has been taken by the accused's advocate, in this case that
the statement before us was an inaccurate paraphrase. The making of any such
statement was wholly denied. I cannot leave this case without saying that in my
opinion the case for appellant 1 has been most ably argued by Mr. Chandrasekhara
Sastry, his learned Counsel. Although his efforts have been unsuccessful they clearly
deserve such a tribute."

127. The case of Kashmira Singh Vs. State of M.P. (AIR 1952 SC 159) in a way sets out the guidelines
for applying Sec. 30. The observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court are:
"8. Gurubachan's confession has played an important part in implicating the
appellant, and the question at once arises, how far and in what way the confession of
an accused person can be used against a co-accused? It is evident that it is not
evidence in the ordinary sense of the term because, as the Privy Council say in
Bhuboni Sahu v. The King, 76 Ind. App 147 at p. 155.
"It does not indeed come within the definition of 'evidence' contained in S. 3 of the
Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the
accused and it cannot be tested by cross examination."
Their Lordships also point out that it is "obviously evidence of a very weak type......... It is a much
weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver, which is not subject to any of those
infirmities." They stated in addition that such a confession cannot be made the foundation of a
conviction and can only be used in "support of other evidence." In view of these remarks, it would be
pointless to cover the same ground, but we feel it is necessary to expound this further as
misapprehension still exists. The question is, in what way can it be used in support of other
evidence? Can it be used to fill in missing gaps? Can it be used to corroborate an accomplice or, as in
the present case, a

NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB witness who, though not an accomplice, is placed in the same category
regarding credibility because the judge refuses to believe him except in so far as he is corroborated?
9. In our opinion, the matter was put succinctly by Sir 'Lawrence Jenkins in Emperor v. Laist
Mohan, 38 Cal. 559 at p. 588 where he said that such a confession can only be used to "lend
assurance to other evidence against a co-accused" or to put it in another way as Reilly J. did in In re
Periyaswami Moopan, 54 Mad. 75 at p. 77.
"the provision goes no further than this - where there is evidence against the
co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of
confession described in S.30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for
believing that evidence."
10. Translating these observations into concrete terms they come to this. The proper way to
approach a case of this kind is, first to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the
confession altogether from consideration and see whether, if it is believed, a conviction could safely
be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not
necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on
the other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction.
In such an event the judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other
evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be
prepared to accept."

128. In Balbir Singh Vs. State of Punjab (AIR 1957 SC
216) it is held:
"...... So far as the confessional statement of Jagir Singh is concerned, it may be taken
into consideration against the appellant if it fulfils the conditions laid down in
Section 30 of the Evidence Act. One of the conditions is that the confession must
implicate the maker substantially to the same extent as the other accused person
against whom it is sought to be taken into consideration. On reading Jagir Singh's
confession as a whole, it appears that he was really trying to throw the main blame on
the appellant, though he admitted that he entered into the house of Mst. Chinti,
brought out a Kirpan lying there, and took some silver ornaments from that house.
He denied that he had anything to do with the murder of Mst. Chinti or even the
murder of the two boys; he more or less tried to make out that he was an unwilling
spectator of the crime committed by the appellant. In these circumstances, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 50
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
utmost that can be, submitted on behalf of the appellant is that the confession of
Jagir Singh should not be used at all against the appellant. At one stage of his
argument Mr. Sethi did submit that the confession of Jagir Singh should be excluded
altogether from consideration against the appellant; later, however, he submitted
that both the confessions should be read together in order to condemn both as untrue
on the ground of the differences between the two confessions. We are unable to
accept this submission of Mr.Sethi. We have pointed out, that some of the differences
are immaterial; some are due to the desire of Jagir Singh to throw the blame on the
appellant - a circumstance of which the benefit has been given to the appellant, and
some other differences are clearly
- 112 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB resolved by other evidence on the records. We do not
think that in these circumstances the confessional statements can be condemned out
of hand or in, limine as untrue."
129. Another judgment of the Supreme Court to be referred to here is in the case of Mohd. Khalid
Vs. State of West Bengal (2002) 7 SCC 334 (supra) where Kashmira Singh was followed to hold as
below:
"A confessional statement is not admissible unless it is made to the Magistrate under
Section 25 of the Evidence Act. The requirement of Section 30 of the Evidence Act is
that before it is made to operate against the co-accused the confession should be
strictly established. In other words, what must be before the Court should be a
confession proper and not a mere circumstance or an information which could be an
incriminating one. Secondly, it being the confession of the maker, it is not to be
treated as evidence within the meaning of Section 3 of the Evidence Act against the
non-maker co- accused and lastly, its use depends on finding other evidence so as to
connect the co-accused with the crime and that too as a corroborative piece. It is only
when the other evidence tendered against the co-accused points to his guilt then the
confession duly proved could be used against such co-accused if it appears to effect
(sic) him as lending support or assurance to such other evidence. To attract the
provisions of Section 30, it should for all purposes be a confession, that is a statement
containing an admission of guilt and not merely a statement raising the inference
with regard to such a guilt. The evidence
- 113 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB of the co-accused cannot be considered under Section 30
of the Evidence Act, where he was not tried jointly with the accused and where he did
not make a statement incriminating himself along with the accused. As noted above,
the confession of a co-accused does not come within the definition of evidence
contained in Section 3 of the Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 51
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is
only when a persons admits guilty to the fullest extent, and exposes himself to the
pains and penalties provided for his guilt, there is a guarantee for his truth. The
legislature provides that his statement may be considered against his fellow accused
charged with the same crime. The test is to see whether it is sufficient by itself to
justify the conviction of the person making it of the offence for which he is being
jointly tried with the other person or persons against whom it is tendered. The proper
way to approach a case of this kind is, first to marshal the evidence against the
accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether if it
is believed, a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief
independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the
confession in aid. But cases may arise where the Judge is not prepared to act on the
other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a
conviction. In such an event the Judge may call in aid the confession and use it to
lend assurance to the other evidence. This position has been clearly explained by this
Court Kashmira Singh v. State of M.P. The exact Scope of Section 30 was discussed
by the Privy Council in the case of Bhuboni Sahu v R. The relevant extract from the
- 114 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB said decision which has become locus classicus reads as
follows: (AIR p.260 para 9) "Section 30 applies to confessions, and not to statements
which do not admit the guilt of the confessing party. ... But a confession of a
co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. ... It is a much weaker type of
evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of those
infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the Court may take the confession into
consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the Court may act;
but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there
must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all
the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other
evidence. The confession of a co-accused can be used only in support of other
evidence and cannot be made the foundation of a conviction".
32. Kashmira Singh's principles were noted with approval by a Constitution Bench of this Court
Haricharan Kurmi V. State Of Bihar. It was noted that the basis on which Section 30 operates is that
if a person makes a confession implicating himself, that may suggest that the maker of the
confession is speaking the truth. Normally, if a statement made by an accused person is found to be
voluntary and it amounts to a confession in the sense that it implicates the maker, it is not likely that
the maker would implicate himself untruly. So Section 30 provides that such a confession may be
taken into consideration even against the co-accused who is being tried along with the maker of the
confession. It is significant, however, that like other evidence which is produced before the Court, it
is not obligatory on the Court to take the confession into account. When evidence as defined by the
Evidence Act is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 52
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
- 115 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB produced before the Court, it is the duty of the Court to consider that
evidence. What weight should be attached to such evidence is a matter in the discretion of the Court.
But the Court cannot say in respect of such evidence that it will just not take that evidence into
account. Such an approach can, however, be adopted by the Court in dealing with a confession
because Section 30 merely enables the Court to take the confession into account. Where, however,
the Court takes it into confidence, it cannot be faulted. The principle is that the Court cannot start
with confession of a co-accused person; it must begin with other evidence adduced by the
prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said
evidences, then it is permissible to turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the
conclusion of guilt which the judicial mind is about to reach on some other evidence. That is the true
effect of the provision contained in Section 30. We may note that great stress was laid down on the
so-called retraction of the makers of the confession. Apart from the fact that the same was made
after about two years of the confession, PWs 81 and 82 have stated in Court as to the procedures
followed by them, while recording the confession. The evidence clearly establishes that the
confessions were true and voluntary. That was not the result of any tutoring, compulsion or
pressurization. As was observed by this Court in Shankaria v. State of Rajasthan, the Court is to
apply double test for deciding the acceptability of a confession i.e. (i) whether the confession was
perfectly voluntary, and (ii) if so, whether it is true and trustworthy. Satisfaction of the first test is a
sine qua non for its admissibility in evidence. If the confession appears to the Court to have been
caused by any inducement, threat or
- 116 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB promise, such as mentioned in Section 24 of the Evidence Act, it must be
excluded and rejected brevi manu. If the first test is satisfied, the Court must before acting upon the
confession reach the finding that what is stated therein is true and reliable. ...."
(emphasis supplied)
130. A division bench of this court as long back as in 1955, in the case of Malayara Seethu (AIR 1955
Mysore 27) held as below:
"5. The only facts proved therefore are that A-1 was taken in a taxi from her house to
the bank of a river, she went to the other side and was in company with A-2 for some
time at a distance in a lonely place, the delivery of A-2 on the next day and emergence
of a green stick along with the placenta. Since no one except A-2 knew, if at all, the
alleged insertion of the stick by the appellant, the information said to have been given
by A-3 or A-4 to the other persons of the village is of no consequence. The statement
of A-2 is not evidence in itself. Nor is it a substitute for evidence. As pointed out in -
'Periyaswami Mooppan v. Emperor', AIR 1931 Mad 177 (A) at p. 178.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 53
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
"Section 30, Evidence Act, is a very exceptional, indeed an extraordinary, provision
by which something which is not evidence may be used against an accused person at
his trial. Such a provision must be used with the greatest caution and with care to
make sure that we do not stretch it one line beyond its necessary intention. It is true
that the section provides only that the confession of one accused person may be
"taken into consideration" against the fellow accused. As I
- 117 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB understand the section, the confession cannot take the
place of evidence against the co-accused; nor can it be added to supplement evidence
otherwise insufficient. As I understand the matter, the provision goes no further than
this: where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed to support
his conviction, then the kind of confession described in S. 30 may be thrown into the
scale as an additional reason for believing that evidence."
The same view is reiterated by Reilly C. J. in - 'Sanna Huduga v. Govt. of Mysore', 13 Mys L.J. 69 (B).
The fact that a green stick was seen with the placenta when it came out no doubt implies that it must
have been inside the body earlier. Besides lack of proof that appellant introduced it, there is
uncertainty of its having caused the delivery and the delivery being a miscarriage."
131. Recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Surinder Kumar Khanna V.
Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence [(2018) 8 SCC 271] discusses the scope of
Section 30 of the Evidence Act in the light of its earlier decisions.
132. The conspectus of the above decisions is: confession can be of any type, be it may under Section
27 of the Evidence Act or Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. or extra-judicial confession; such a confession of
an accused can be used against him as also the
- 118 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB fellow accused if making of that confession is proved in accordance with
law; it cannot be a substitute for the other substantive evidence that the prosecution has to prove; it
can only be used as supplemental to the other evidence brought on record and never it can be based
alone for holding an accused guilty of an offence; and whenever section 30 is to be employed, it must
be done with greater circumspection.
133. Now in this case each of the accused nos.1 to 6 gave confession statements before the
investigating officers. Based on their confession statements, the investigating officers were able to
recover the seized incriminating materials and in this regard we have already made elaborate
discussion. The recoveries thus made falls within the ambit of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.
That apart, with regard to two circumstances, namely, motive and conspiracy, the confession
statement of each accused can be used against other. Examined whether the ingredients of Section
30 are present, there is no dispute that accused nos.1 to 6 were tried jointly for the offences u/s
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 54
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
120-B and 302 read with 34 of IPC. The charge u/s 109 of IPC is against accused no.7 whose
involvement in the offence is doubtful for the reasons which we
- 119 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB ascribe later. There is no doubt that accused nos.1 to 6 gave confession
statements, in as much as the accused nos.1 to 6 did not deny specifically when they were examined
u/s 313 Cr.P.C. to have given statements before the investigating officers. Even if they have denied,
it is of no consequence in view of recoveries based on confession statements. Our discussion made
above shows that the evidence given by the investigating officers is fully believable. That means the
giving of confession statements by accused nos.1 to 6 is proved. This finding should not be
understood that we are using the confession statements against each accused in violation of Section
25 of the Indian Evidence Act. Now if the confession given by every accused is seen, each of them
not only implicated himself but also others. All the ingredients of Sec. 30 are very much present and
we find this as a supplementary circumstance in proof of the independent evidence placed before the
prosecution for proving the circumstances.
134. The only shortcoming in the prosecution is not obtaining certificate under Section 65-B of the
Evidence Act for proving the call detail records (CDR) produced as per Exs.P.102 to P.111. This was
the reason for the trial court not considering
- 120 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB the CDRs. It is a fact that certificate under Section 65-B of the Act was
not obtained and produced before the trial court and hence the trial court was justified in rejecting
Exs.P.102 to P.111. We do not think that rejection of Exs.P.102 to P.111 would have a negative impact
on the prosecution case. We have found that the other evidence which we have discussed above is
sufficient enough to draw conclusion that the prosecution case has stood proved beyond reasonable
doubt.
135. Incidentally we may observe here that, what accused no.5 told PW23 and PW24 about
accomplishment of their mission may be treated as extra judicial confession, though in strict sense,
it is not so. Thus it can be stated that overall appreciation of primary evidence made available in
regard to every circumstance leads to ultimate conclusion that the prosecution has proved its case
beyond reasonable doubt. The approach of the trial court just appears to be perfunctory, it appears
that the trial court judge has just noticed that the witnesses have turned hostile; he has not
appreciated the evidence of the police officers and the FSL report in right perspective. It is a well
established principle that whenever witnesses turn hostile, the court must make all endeavours to
- 121 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB separate the chaff from the grain and examine as to what extent the
evidence of the hostile witnesses can be acted upon. If all the witnesses turn hostile in entirety, the
evidence of the investigating officer and other police personnel must be put to analysis or scrutiny to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 55
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
find out whether from their evidence the prosecution case gets established. Casual approach leads to
miscarriage of justice. The witnesses turn hostile for many reasons. At this juncture we would like to
refer to a judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Ramesh and others Vs. State of Haryana
[(2017) 1 SCC 529] where it is observed as below:
"39. We find that it is becoming a common phenomenon, almost a regular feature,
that in criminal cases witnesses turn hostile. There could be various reasons for this
behaviour or attitude of the witnesses. It is possible that when the statements of such
witnesses were recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
by the police during investigation, the Investigating Officer forced them to make such
statements and, therefore, they resiled therefrom while deposing in the Court and
justifiably so. However, this is no longer the reason in most of the cases. This trend of
witnesses turning hostile is due to various other factors. It may be fear of deposing
against the accused / delinquent or political pressure or pressure of other family
members or other
- 122 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB such sociological factors. It is also possible that witnesses
are corrupted with monetary considerations."
(emphasis supplied)
136. In this case, accused no.1 owns many educational institutions and, as has come in evidence, he
wields much influence at Sullia town. Some of the witnesses are his relatives; some of them are
working in the educational institutions under his control and some other independent witnesses are
from the surrounding vicinity. If the witnesses are strongly determined to speak against the
prosecution, the public prosecutor could do nothing more than giving a suggestion to them that they
had turned hostile being influenced or threatened by the accused. Perhaps this was the situation
that we can visualize for the witnesses having decided to turn hostile in this case. Though it is at the
cost of repetition, we are constrained to observe that if the wife of the deceased herself does not
speak about a matter which is expected to be well within her knowledge, only inference that can be
drawn is that accused no.1 might have won over her.
- 123 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB
137. From the above discussion what we find is that the involvement of accused nos.1 to 6 is only
forthcoming. There was a conspiracy among them to eliminate Ramakrishna, first accused being the
main conspirator. They shared common intention while conspiring and thus Section 34 of Indian
Penal Code can be applied. However we do not find a case being made out against accused no. 7. The
investigating officer does not speak against him; there is no evidence to hold that he instigated
accused no.1 to eliminate Ramakrishna. The prosecution evidence shows his emergence only after
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 56
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
the incident was over. What is attributed to him is that his help was sought for collecting the money
to be given to accused nos.5 and 6 as agreed. He also applied for certified copies of some documents
in order to obtain bail for accused no.1. Accused no. 7, being an advocate might have applied for
anticipatory bail. There is no evidence against him at all.
138. Therefore our conclusion is that the judgment of the trial court as against accused nos. 1 to 6
cannot be sustained. It needs to be reversed to hold them guilty of the offences punishable u/s 120-B
and 302 r/w sec. 34 IPC. Now the following order:
- 124 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB ORDER The judgment of the trial court stands set aside as
against accused nos.1 to 6. They are all convicted for the offences punishable under
Section 120-B and Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC.
Appeal stands dismissed concerning accused no.7.
Accused nos.1 to 6 shall be heard regarding sentence to be imposed.

absconded, we proceed to hear accused no.1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 on the sentence
- 126 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB to be imposed on them. After accused no.5 is produced, we will hear him
on the sentence.
It is the submission of accused no.1-Dr. Renuka Prasad that his present age is 63 years and has been
suffering from many diseases. He complains of sleep disorder, hypertension, breathing problem,
diabetes and further submits that he has undergone bye pass surgery. It is his further submission
that his health condition has aggravated after he is held guilty even though he is innocent. He had to
make some arrangements very hurriedly for the management of the educational institutions under
his control. He pleads for showing sympathy.
When we question the second accused-Manoj Rai, his submission is that his present age is 43 years
and has two children aged 15 years and 8 years. He is an agriculturist and his annual income is
around Rs.2 lakhs. His wife is unemployed. He also prays for taking lenient view.
Third accused-Nagesh submits that his age is 40 years; he is an agricultural labourer. He has no
definite income. He has got an aged mother and one child aged about five years. His wife is
unemployed. He is the only support for his family. In these circumstances, he prays for taking a
lenient view.
- 127 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Accused No.4-Vaman Poojary @ Vaman Salian submits that his present
age is 59 years and has two children aged 25 years and 15 years. He has no parents. He further
submits that since he is a coolie, he has no regular income and therefore pleads for taking lenient
view.
Accused no.6-Shankara @ Bhavani Shankara @ Manjoj submits that his present age is 41 years and
he is a carpenter. His income is Rs.15,000/- per month. He is unmarried and has aged parents. He
too prays for taking lenient view.
Sri R.B. Deshpande, learned counsel for accused no.1 submits that accused no.1 is suffering from
several diseases and therefore constant medical monitoring is required. The administration of the
educational institutions has been taken over by the brother of accused no.1 after pronouncement of
judgment and for this reason the financial position of accused no.1 is not good. He submits that this
aspect may be considered while imposing fine on accused no.1. His further submission is that the
wife and the daughter of accused no.1 are already removed from the management of the educational
institutions and now steps are being taken by the brother of accused no.1 for removing the latter
from the management of

NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB the educational institutions. Putting forth these reasons, Sri
R.B.Deshpande prays for taking lenient view while imposing sentence on accused no.1.
Sri P.B. Umesh, learned counsel for accused nos.3 and 4 and appearing on behalf of Sri Harish for
accused no.6, submits that reasonable fine amount may be imposed on accused nos.3, 4 and 6.
Sri B.N. Jagadish, learned Additional State Public Prosecutor submits that accused no. 6 was
convicted for the offence under Section 302 IPC in another case and therefore no lenient view can be
shown while imposing sentence on accused no.6. But Sri P.B. Umesh, learned counsel who appeared
on behalf of accused no.6 today submits that accused no.6 was acquitted by the High Court in the
appeal.
Having heard the accused and their respective counsel we have to state that this is not the rarest of
rare case to impose death penalty. Therefore the next alternative is to impose life imprisonment
keeping in mind the sentencing structure provided in Section 302 IPC.
- 129 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB Section 120-B of IPC does not prescribe a specific punishment. Sub
Section (1) of Section 120-B states that a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence
punishable with death or imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for two years or upwards
shall, where no express provision is made in IPC for the punishment of such conspiracy, be
punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such offence. Therefore we have to refer to
Section 109 of IPC which prescribes punishment for abetment and that Section states that where
there is no express provision in IPC for the punishment of abetment, the accused is to be punished
with the punishment provided for the offence abetted. That means for the offence of conspiracy
under Section 120-B, each of accused nos.1 to 4 and 6 is to be punished for life besides imposing fine
on them.
We are of the opinion that the family of the deceased is to be compensated appropriately and since
accused no.1 is found to be the main conspirator, he should be directed to pay compensation. In the
facts and circumstances noted above, we are of the opinion that a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs appears to be
a
- 130 -
NC: 2023:KHC:35288-DB reasonable amount towards compensation to be paid to the family of the
deceased.
For the aforesaid reasons, we now proceed to sentence accused nos.1 to 4 and 6 in the following
manner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179877561/ 59
The State vs Dr Renuka Prasad on 27 September, 2023
Each of accused nos.1 to 4 and 6 is sentenced to life and fine of Rs.10,000/- for the offence under
Section 302 of IPC. In default to pay fine, each of them shall undergo imprisonment for a period of
six months.
Each of accused nos.1 to 4 and 6 is sentenced to life and fine of Rs.10,000/- for the offence under
Section 120-B of IPC. In default to pay fine, each of them shall undergo imprisonment for a period of

The accused nos.1 to 4 and 6 are entitled for set off for the period they have already spent in jail in
accordance with law.
Acting under Section 357(3) of Cr.P.C. we direct accused no.1 to pay a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs to the
family of the deceased Ramakrishna. The widow of Ramakrishna shall receive the compensation
amount on behalf of the family.
The text of the judgment and the order on sentence shall be sent to the trial court through e-mail.
The trial court shall
