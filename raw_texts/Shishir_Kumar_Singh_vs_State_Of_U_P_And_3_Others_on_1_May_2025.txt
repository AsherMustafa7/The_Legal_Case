4. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant that the aforesaid criminal revision is
pending before the Sessions Judge, Jaunpur and stay application was also moved by the applicant
therein but no order has been passed by the trial court to stay the impugned proceedings. It is also
submitted that the Court concerned is not taking proper interest in disposal of the said revision and
stay application.
5. Learned AGA opposed the prayer.
6. I have considered the submissions and perused the record.
7. The applicant has made a prayer for expeditious disposal of the aforementioned criminal revision
and stay application in a time bound manner. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in a recent judgement
dated 29.2.2024 passed in the case of High Court Bar Association, Allahabad vs. State of U.P. and
others, (2024) 6 SCC 267 has held as under :-
"Constitutional Courts, in the ordinary course, should refrain from fixing a
time-bound schedule for the disposal of cases pending before any other Courts.
Constitutional Courts may issue directions for the time-bound disposal of cases only
in exceptional circumstances. The issue of prioritising the disposal of cases should be
best left to the decision of the concerned Courts where the cases are pending;
and......."
8. Learned counsel for the applicant has not shown any exceptional circumstances to issue direction
for time bound disposal of the said revision and stay application at this stage. However, in view of
the aforesaid, the present application is disposed of with a direction to the court concerned to make
all endeavours for expeditious disposal of the aforesaid criminal revision and also the stay
application, if there is no legal impediment. It is further directed that no unnecessary adjournment
will be sought/granted.
9. It is also made clear that the Court / Presiding Officer is not the only stake holder in the trial and
disposal of a case, hence, besides the P.O. concerned, all the stake holders i.e. police and executive
authorities, counsels, parties to the case, staff etc. are also made bound by this order and it will be
their responsibility also to assist the Court in every manner for the expeditious disposal of this case.
10. With the above observations, the application stands disposed of.
