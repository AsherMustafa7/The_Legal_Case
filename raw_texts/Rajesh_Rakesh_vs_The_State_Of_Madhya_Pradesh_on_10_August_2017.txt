''Mammi Main Boby Main Boby" and started weaping. Monu has further stated that the said sound
was not that of Boby and he gave the number of that caller in writing to Rajwant Kaur (PW/1) and
suggested her to lodge a report in the police Station. Thereafter, Rajwant Kaur (PW/1) informed the
police. After completing inquiry about missing person report, SHO Shri R.S. Parmar (PW/16), of
Police Station Gorakhpur, recorded the FIR on 28.3.2013 vide Crime No.273/2013 Ex.P/35 for

He opined that the death of deceased was caused within 3 to 5 days of his

cut of neck by sharp cutting object.
According to him, the cut wound on the neck was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of
nature and death was likely to be homicidal in nature.
7: The cloths of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby were packed and sealed by Dr. Vivek Shrivastava (PW/7)
and handed over the same to the concerned Constable. The seized knife was also examined by
doctor Vivek Shrivastava (PW/7) and opined that the knife was stained by some rusty spot and

9: After investigation police filed charge sheet before the concerned Judicial Magistrate First Class,
who committed the case to the Sessions Judge. A charge was framed against them under Section
302, 364-A, 120-B and 201 of the IPC. The accused/appellants abjured the guilt. they took plea that
they have been falsely implicated in the case, they were brought to trial. In their statements under
Section 313 of Cr.P.C., the appellants pleaded false implication. Appellant Om Prakash also plaeaded
an alibi and claimed that he had been admitted at Rohaniya Varansi for treatment. They have also
taken defence that police had taken their blood samples by creating pressure and thereafter, false
case has been made against them. In his defence, the appellants examined Dr. Ajay
Bhandari(DW/1), Princy Thakur (DW/2) and Dr. Sandeep Kumar (DW/3).
10 : Learned Sessions Judge, after considering the prosecution evidence convicted and sentenced
the accused/appellants as mentioned above.
11 : We have considered the rival submissions of learned counsel for the parties and perused the
records.
12 : Learned Govt. Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent/State has submitted that there is
enough clinching material evidence to hold guilty the accused/appellants for commission of offence.
Learned Govt. Advocate, further submitted that as per the DNA profile test done by FSL Sagar, it is
clearly proved that there is cogent evidence against the accused/appellants, and they are found
guilty of commission of the offence, because DNA of accused/appellants and DNA profile of the hair
stranded in the finger of right hand of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby, which clearly indicates that
accused/appellants had committed murder of the deceased in brutal manner. The matching of DNA
profile with the dead body cannot be termed as a co- incidence. This is the important piece of
evidence which on meticulous examination are corroborative evidence and cannot be overlooked.
The blood samples of accused/appellants have been kept in proper custody and were sent for test
without tampering. Therefore, the same cannot be questioned. Hence, it is a rarest of rare case and
trial Court has rightly awarded death sentence against the accused/appellants.
13 : Shri Datt, learned counsel for the accused/appellants submits that learned trial Court has failed
to appreciate the factual aspects of the case and has wrongly framed charge against them. He further
submitted that appellants have been falsely implicated in this case as there are material
discrepancies, contradictions, omissions and improvements in the statements of prosecution
witnesses. He further submits that the findings recorded by learned Sessions Judge are erroneous
and not based on proper appreciation of evidence available on record. No ingredients are available
in the present case, which connect the accused/appellants in the crime. Learned counsel for
appellants has drawn our attention to the statements of prosecution witnesses and tried to convince
us that the whole case is based on circumstantial evidence and the prosecution has failed to prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt. It is contended that the Court below has given its findings on
presumptions, surmises and conjectures, therefore, is liable to be set aside. He further contends
before us that there is no direct evidence available on record to prove the guilt of the accused/
appellants. Learned counsel for the accused/appellants further submits that the circumstantial
evidence should be unimpeachable and in the present case no such unimpeachable evidence is
available on record, therefore, the learned Court below erred in holding the appellants guilty. He

Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
prays for acquittal of the appellants by setting aside the judgment of the lower Court.
14: There is no eye witness of the incident in this case and accordingly, conviction of
accused/appellants is based on circumstantial evidence.
15 : Now, the question for our consideration is whether the deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby had died
unnatural death during period of 9:00 PM of 26.3.2013 to 1:45 PM of 29.3.2013? and was his death
homicidal ?
16 : Rajwant Kaur (PW/1) mother of the deceased has stated that on 26.3.2013 at about 9:00 PM
Ajit Pal @ boby had gone somewhere out of the house to see "Holika" and thereafter he did not
return. Rajwant Kaur (PW/1), mother of deceased Ajit Pal @ boby, Amarjeet Singh @ Mitthu
(PW/2), who is brother of Rajwant Kaur and maternal uncle of deceased, Pooran Singh (PW/3),
who is father of sister-in-law of Rajwant Kaur (PW/1), Jitendra Singh (PW/8), who is son of brother
of mother of deceased, Taranjeet Gujral @ Mullu, who is neighbour of deceased, in a voice and
soundhave stated that deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby had died. They had seen the dead body of the
deceased. They had stated in one voice and sound that dead body of the deceased was taken out
from the well contained in a plastic gunny bag. They have also stated that they had seen cut injury
on the neck of dead body of deceased. Certain flock of hair entangled with the finger of deceased,
gunny bag, shawl roped in neck were seized and panchnama was prepared. Spot map vide Ex.P/13
was prepared. Investigating Officer, R.S. Parmar (PW/16) has stated that he discovered the dead
body of deceased on the basis of memorandum statement of appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh on
29.3.2013 at about 13:45 PM and has prepared inquest memo Ex.P/3 of dead body of deceased in
presence of witnesses after giving notice Ex.P/2 to them. Amarjeet Singh @ Mitthu (PW/2) has also
supported the statement of R.S. Parmar (PW/16) and stated that proceedings of inquest memo was

of the deceased and as per their opinion deceased had died due to that injury and other injuries
caused on the neck of deceased. The dead body of deceased was sent to Medical College Jabalpur for
postmortem by R.S. Parmar (PW/16). Dr. Vivek Shrivastava (PW/7) had conducted the postmortem
examination of the dead body of the deceased on 30.3.2013. He has stated that as per his report
Ex.P/7, he found following injuries :-

Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
Scalp, craniel & vertebrae are healthy. Sillo, brain and spinal cord were found
semi-liquified (half were melted), ribs and pneumonia were healthy, already stated
about throat and breath vessels, both lungs were blackish, perchornium and trachea,
spleen, galbladder and kidneys were found melted. There were no blood in big
vessels.
He opined that the death was caused within 3 to 5 days of his examination. The cause
of death was due to haemorrhagic shock which was caused due to cut of neck by
sharp cutting object. According to him, the cut wound on the neck was sufficient to
cause death in ordinary course of nature and death was likely to be homicidal in
nature.
Accordingly, cause of death of the deceased was haemorrhage and shock due to cut of
neck by sharp cutting object. The appellants have shown their ignorance on this
point, which does not rebut the prosecution case. Thus, it is well proved that
deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby had died an unnatural death during the period 9:00 PM of
26.3.2013 to 1:45 PM of 29.3.2013 and his death was homicidal.
17 : Now, the questions arise are whether appellants conspired to kidnap the
deceased for ransom ? and in compliance of conspiracy whether the appellants had
kidnapped the deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby for alleged ransom and they had killed Ajit
Pal @ Body for that ransom ?
18 : The mother of deceased, Rajwant Kaur (PW/1) has stated that deceased Ajit Pal
@ Boby was her son, aged about 15 years and he studied upto 5th Class. She has
further stated that she had sold her house for a sum of Rs.60 lacs on 22.5.2013 to one
Kirti Tiwari. She has further stated that on 26.5.2013, at about 9:00 PM in the night
his son, deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby, had gone somewhere out of the house to see
'Holika' and thereafter he did not return to home. She thought that he went to the
house of his maternal uncle. On the next day, i.e. 27.3.2013, her daughters after
enquiring the matter informed her that deceased did not go to the house of his
maternal uncle, then she asked about her son from her relatives on phone. She went
to Gurudwara, near Gwarighat, and searched about her son, but she could not get
him and thereafter lodged missing report of her son in Gwarighat outpost of Police
Station Gorakhpur, District Jabalpur vide Ex.P/1, which was duly signed by her.
19 : Rajwant Kaur (PW/1) has further stated that on 28.3.2013, her brother Amarjeet
@ Mitthu (PW/2) and her neighbour appellant Om Prakash Yadav went to
Gurudwara of Gwarighat to search the deceased, but they could not get her son.
When they were returning to home, Amarjeet @ Mitthu (PW/2) received a phone of a
person, who was introducing himself as Khan and told that deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby
was in his possession, asked him to send Rs.50 lacs and thereatened that if the said
money is not sent to him, he will kill Ajit Pal @ Boby by cutting his neck. On reaching
house, when Amarjeet Singh was stating above conversation to her, then again said

Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
Khan called him, which was received by Amarjeet Singh in the meantime, he gave the

mobile having duel sim and micromax mobile containing sim No.9993135127, were stated to be
seized from the possesion of accused Brajesh vide Ex.P/19. Accused Brajesh has been arrested vide
Ex.P/21 duly signed and confirmed by R.S. Parmar (PW/16). Bambam @ Shaiwal(PW/9) have
supported the statements of R.S. Parmar (PW/16) and signed to be proved the version mentioned in
Ex.P/17, Ex.P/19 and Ex.P/21.
31 : Invesigating Officer R.S. Parmar (PW/16) has deposed that he had written a letter Ex.P/39 dt.
2.4.2013, duly signed by him to Chief Medical Officer, Victoria Hospital, Jabalpur for taking the
blood samples of accused appellants-Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav. Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW/5) has
deposed in his deposition that on 2.4.2013, the accused/appellants were brought for the said
purpose in the hospital. He further stated that in presence of witnesses Bambam @ Shaiwal(PW/9)
who was of deceased side and Shiv Prakash, who was the witness of accused/appellants side, their
blood samples were taken out, sealed and handed over to the police for DNA test. Blood sample of
accused/appellant Rakesh @ Rajesh was taken and Panchnama vide Ex.P/5 was prepared and blood
sample of accused/appellant Raja was taken and Panchnama vide Ex.P/6 was prepared. Thereafter,
Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW/5) has deposed, that he had signed Ex.P/5 and Ex.P/6, which were signed by
other witnesses also, clearly show that on 2.4.2013 at 18:55 hours, the blood samples of
accused/appellants Rajesh and Raja Yadav were taken on the same day and Panchnama was
prepared in presence of witnesses.
32 : It is clear from para 3 of cross-examination of Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW/5) that blood samples of
accused/appellants were taken by technician, but who has taken the blood samples, his name is not
mentioned in Ex.P/5 and Ex.P/6. This witness has not taken blood samples of accused/ appellants.
From para 4 of his cross- examination, it is clear that persons from whom blood samples were taken,
their identity has not been mentioned. There is no mention about handing over of blood samples to
the police constable and in para 5, name of constable to whom the blood samples were given, has
also not been mentioned. This witness could not state in his statement in para 7 that on what time
he had come to take blood samples, but he has stated that it is true that blood samples Ex.P/5 &
Ex.P/6 were collected by him at about 10-10:30, because on that day police personnel had came to
him at 10-10:30 to 11:00 andhe had completed the proceedings within half an hour. It is denied by
Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW/5) that he did not go to hospital in the evening at 5-6 PM, and also denied that
he had not taken any sample and also denied that he had signed Panchnama Ex.P/5 and P/6 at the
instance of police, thereby, it is clear that sealed samples were taken and handed over by Dr. P.D.
Sharma (PW/5) to constable. It is also denied by Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW/5) that blood samples were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 12
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
not taken by him or before him by the technician. On the basis of not mentioning each and every
particulars in Ex.P/5 and Ex.P/6, it cannot be said that credibility thereof is doubtful.
33 : Shiv Prakash (PW/4) is the brother of accused/appellant Raja Yadav. This witness has not
supported the assertion of Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW/5) and signatures put on Ex.P/5 and Ex.P/6. He
has been declared hostile and in his cross-examination by prosecution, he denied the suggestion of
prosecution that he is not giving true statement with a view to save his brother. Shaiwal @ Bambam
(PW/9) had accepted his signatures on Ex.P/5 and Ex.P/6 and stated that on 2.4.2013 at 6:00 PM in
the evening at Victoria Hospital Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW/5) had taken blood samples of appellants
Raja and Rajesh vide Panchnama Ex.P/5 and Ex.P/6 and at that time, brother of appellant Raja and
uncle Shiv Prakash (PW/4) were present. This version is contradictory to his statement mentioned
in para 17, wherein he has stated that blood samples of appellant Raja and Rajesh were taken by Dr.
Pramod Sharma in a syringe, but this anomaly does not make doubtful about taking of blood
samples of appellants Raja and Rajesh.
34 : R.S. Parmar (PW/16) has deposed that he had sent all articles seized during investigation to
FSL Sagar through Superintendent of Police Jabalpur. He further deposed that he sent sealed hairs
stuck in the finger of right hand of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby, blood samples of acccused/appellants
Rajesh and Raja Yadav to FSL Sagar vide memo Ex.P/40. He also deposed that he sent other seized
articles as per draft Ex.P/41. He had also stated about preparation of summary of call details vide
Ex.P/42. He further deposed that he had received the report from FSL Sagar as Ex.P/43 and DNA
report as Ex.P/44. From perusal of Ex.P/43, it is clear that on 22.4.2013, 10 sealed packets and on
29.3.2013 seized articles A-soil, B-Chappal, C-Chappal, D-Plastic sack, E -Shawl, F- cloth, G-knife
from possession of accused appellant Rajesh, T. Shirt of Ajit Pal @ Boby, Lower, Handkerchief, as
Article H1, H2, H3 & Full pant of Raja Yadav, T-Shirt, I-1 and I-2, Lower, T-shirt, underwear of
appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh, as Article J1, J2 and J3 were produced and the same were chemically
examined. Blood stained Articles A, C, D, E, F,G, H1, H2, H3, I1, I2, J1 & J2 were also chemically
examined. As per report Ex.P/43, human blood was found on Articles G, I1, I2, J1, J2 and J3. Due to
decomposition, blood found on on Articles A, D, E, F, H1, H2 & H3, their blood group could not be
ascertained. No sufficient blood was found on Article C. From above reports it is clear that on Article
G-knife seized from accused appellant Rajesh Yadav, his cloths Article I1, I2 and cloths of appellant
Rajesh, Article J1, J2 and J3, human blood was found.
35: R.S. Parmar (PW/16) has deposed that he had received the report of DNA finger printing unit of
State Forensic Science Laboratory, Sagar as Ex. P/44. It is settled law that the evidence of the
experts is admissible in evidence in terms of section 45 of the Evidence Act, 1872. It can be read
without proving of its contents. Its truthness has not been challenged. As per report Ex. P/44, on
examination of blood of accused/appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav and hairs stuck found
in the finger of right hand of deceased Ajit Pal @ Bobby, it was found that DNA source found on hair
Ex. A (1D-7905), DNA profile of male was found. Male DNA profile found on hair stuck, found in the
finger of the deceased Ex. A (1D7905) and DNA found on the blood of appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh
Ex. B (ID-7906) are similar but, male DNA profile found on hair stuck, found in the finger of the
deceased, Ex. A(1D-7905) and DNA found on the blood of appellant Raja Yadav, Ex.C ID-7907 are
not similar. Thus DNA profile of stuck of hairs found in the finger of the deceased was same as the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 13
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
DNA profile of blood of Rajesh @ Rakesh.
36: The DNA test report maching the DNA profile of blood of appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh as well as
hair found in the finger of dead body of deceased or the curcumstances, which definitely and
unerringly indicate towards the guilt of the said appellant/accused. The maching of DNA profile
with the dead body or hair found in the finger of the deceased cannot be termed as co-incidence.
This is the important piece of evidence, which is on maticulous examination or corroborative
evidence and cannot be overlooked.
37: Pooran Singh (PW/3), knowing the identity of appellants on the basis of name and face, has
stated that deceased Boby was the son of his daughter's sister-in-law. Previously the appellants had
visited his house. He went to the house of Rajvinder Kaur (PW/1) at Narmada Nagar to give the
sweet on Holi Festival in the evening hours after performing his duty at Guru Govind Singh Khalsa
School. When he was going to his house and reached near railway crossing at 9:00 PM from her
daughter's house, then on way, he met with appellants Raja, Rajesh and deceased Ajit @ Boby and
asked Boby that it is 9:00 PM and why he did not go to home, then Boby replied that he is going to
see Holika. Thereafter, Pooran Singh (PW/3) went to bus-stand by an auto-rickshaw to go to his
house at Saliwada. On 28.3.2013, his daughter had called him alleging that Boby was kidnapped and
ransom of Rs.50 lacs is demanded. On the next day i.e. 29.3.2013, again he received call of his
daughter that dead body of Boby was found in a well; which was being taken out at the instance of
appellants Raja and Rajesh. This witness has also attended the cremation of deceased Boby on
30.3.2013.
38: Further, Pooran Singh (PW/3) has stated that when he went to attend the cremation of deceased
Boby, then near railway crossing he met with Town Inspector and told that on 26.3.2013 deceased
was with appellants Rajesh and Raja. In para 3 of his cross-examination, he has stated that his
daughter is the aunt (Mami) of deceased Boby and her house is situated at a distance of 15-20 kms
where he went by an autorickshaw along with other passengers. He went alone to his daughter's
house. During cross- examination, he has also stated that he received the information about
kidnapping of deceased Boby on 28.3.2013, but at that time, he did not give this information to the
police. In para 7, he further stated that deceased Boby was seen with appellants Raja and Rajesh on
26.3.2013, but he has not stated this fact to anyone except police. Pooran Singh (PW/3), in para 8 of
his cross- examination, he deposed that in morning hours at 10:30 AM, he met with Town Inpsector
and on the same day in the evening at 5:00 PM, his statement was recorded in the police station, but
he denied to become a witness in respect of the fact that deceased Boby was seen by him last time
along with appellants Raja and Rajesh. He also denied that he gave the statements as per Town
Inspector's version. Thus, looking to the aforesaid aspects, the statement of Pooran Singh (PW/3) is
contradictory and, therefore, cannot be believed. Accordingly, prosecution is failed to prove that
deceased was lastly seen with appellants-Raja and Rajesh. Thus, there is no evidence of last seen of
deceased with appellants-Raja and Rajesh.
39 : The solitary contention advanced by the learned counsel for the accused/appellants on the
merits of the case was, that the prosecution had ventured to substantiate the allegations levelled
against the appellants only on the basis of circumstantial evidence. It was sought to be pointed out,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 14
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
that in the absence of direct evidence, the slightest of a discrepancy, depicting the possibility of two
views would exculpate the accused of guilt, on the basis of benefit of doubt. Before dealing with the
circumstantial evidence relied upon against the accused/appellants, learned counsel invited our
attention to the legal position declared by the Apex Court, on the standard of proof required for
recording of conviction, on the basis of circumstantial evidence.
40 : The Apex Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda Vs. State of Maharashtra [(1984) 4
SCC 116] has laid down the golden principles of standard of proof, required in a case sought to be
established on the basis of circumstantial evidence. In this case Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as
follows :-
"152. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must
be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established:
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
fully established.
It may be noted here tht this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned 'must
or should'and not 'may be'established. There is not only a gramatical but a legal
distinction between 'may be proved' and 'must be or should be proved as was held by
this Court in Shivaji Sahebrao Bobade V. State of Maharashtra : 1973 Cr.L.J. 1783
where the following observtions were made :
Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be
guilty before a court can convict, and the mental distance between 'may be 'must be'
is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt
of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis
except that the accused is guilty.
(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency.
(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable
ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must
show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.
153. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case
based on circumstantial evidence."
41 : Further, in the case of Tanviben Pankajkumar Divetia Vs. State of Gujarat, (1997) 7SCC 156, the
Apex Court in paras 45 & 46 has held thus :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 15
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
"45. The principle for basing a conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence has
been indicated in a number of decisions of this Court and the law is well settled that
each and every incriminating circumstances must be clearly established by reliable
and clincing evidence and the circumstances so proved must form a chan of events
from which the only irresistible conclusion about the guilt of the accused can be
safely drawn and no other hypothesis against the guilt is possible. This Court has
clearly sounded a note of caution that in a case depending largely upon
circumstantial evidence, there is always a danger that conjecture or suspicion may
take the place of legal proof. The court must satisfy itself that various circumstances
in the chain of events have been established clearly and such completed chain of
events must be such as to rule out a reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the
accused. It has also been indicated that when the important link goes, the chain of
circumstances gets snapped and the other circumstances cannot in any manner,
establish the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts. It has been held that
the Court has to be watchful and avoid the danger of allowing the suspicion to make
the place of legal proof for some times, unconsciously it may happen to be a short
step between moral certainly and legal proof. It has been indicated by this Court that
there is a long mental distance between 'may be true' and 'must be true' and the same
divides conjectures from sure conclusions. (Jharlal Das Vs. State of Orissa : 1991 3
SCC 27).
46. We may indicate here that more the suspicious circumstances, more care and
caution are required to be taken otherwise the suspicious circumstances may
unwittingly enter the adjudicating thought process of the Court even though the
suspicious circumstances had not been clearly established by clinching and reliable
evidences. It appears to us that in this case, the decision of the Court in convicting the
appellant has been the result of the suspicious circumstances entering the
adjudicating thought process of the Court."
42 : It is also the legal position that where there was any vacuum in evidence, the circumstantial
evidence could not be relied upon. The Apex Court in the case of Sucha Singh Vs. State of Punjab
[(2001) 4 SCC 375], has held that each aspect of the criminal act alleged against the accused, had to
be established on the basis of material of a nature, which would be sufficient to lead to the inference
that there could be no other view possible, than the one arrived at on the basis of the said
circumstantial evidence. In para 19, it is observed by the Apex Court as under :-
"19. Learned senior counsel contended that Section 106 of the Evidence Act is not
intended for the purpose of filling up the vacuum in prosecution evidence. He invited
our attention to the observations made by the Privy Council in Attygalle Vs. R. (AIR
1936 PC 169, and also in Stephen Seneviratne Vs. The King : AIR 1936 PC 289. In fact
the observations contained therein were considered by this Court in an early decision
authored by Vivian Bose, J. In Shambhu Nath Mehra Vs. State of Ajmer, AIR 1956 SC
404. The statement of law made by the learned Judge in the aforesaid decision has
been extracted by us in State of West Bengal Vs. Mir Mohammad Omar, 2000 (8)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 16
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
SCC 382. It is useful to extract a further portion of the observation made by us in the
aforesaid decision :
"33. presumption of fact is an inference as to the existence of one fact from the
existence of some other facts, unless the truth of such inference is disproved.
Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be
inferred from certain other proved facts. When inferring the existence of a fact from
othr set of proved facts, the court exercises a process of reasoning and reaches of
logical conclusion as the most probable position. The above principle has gained
legislative recognition in India when Section 114 is incorporated in the Evidence Act.
Itempowers the Court to presume the existence of anyfact which it thinks likely to
have happened. In that process the court shall have regard to the common course of
natural events, human conduct etc. In relation to the facts of the case."
20. We pointed out that Section 106 of the Evidence Act is not intended to relieve the prosecution of
its burden to prove the guilt of the accusedbeyond reasonable doubt, but the section would apply to
cases where prosecution has succeeded in proving facts for which a reasonable inference can be
drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by virtue of special
knowledge regarding such facts failed to offer any explanation which might drive the court to draw a
difference inference."
43 : From the aforesaid scenario, it is clear that the prosecution had placed sufficient material on the
record of the case to substantiate the factum of kidnapping and murder of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby.
Be that as it may, without drawing any such inference, we would still endeavour to determine,
whether the prosecution had been successful in establishing the factum of kidnapping and murder
of the deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby, at the hands of the accused/appellants. In so far as the instance
aspect of the matter is concerned, reference may be made to the statements of Rajwant Kaur
(PW/1), her brother Mitthu @ Amarjeet (PW/2) and Taranjeet Gujral @ Monu (PW/10) wherein
they affirmed that on 25.3.2013 at about 9:00 PM deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby had gone somewhere
out of the house to see Holika, but he did not return. Thereafter, during search, when Amarjeet
Singh @ Mitthu PW/2 was returning from Gurudwara, then Mitthu received a call on mobile phone.
The caller was introducing himself as Khan and he was telling that Ajit Pal @ Boby was in his
possession and he asked him to send Rs.50 lacs towards ransom. The mobile phone number of that
caller was 8305620342 and he received that call on his mobile phone number No.9300434520.
Thereafter, when Amarjeet Singh (PW/2) was stating about conversion to her sister, namely,
Rajwant Kaur (PW/1), then again said person introducing himself as Khan, called on mobile
No.9300434520 then he handed over the mobile phone to Rajwant Kaur (PW/1). Thereafter, said
Khan had talked to Rajwant Kaur (PW/1) and stated that her son was in his possession and
demanded Rs.50 lacs as ransom. During conversation, the mobile pone fell down from her hand,
thereafter appellant-Om Prakash picked up that mobile phone and started talking and asked that
where he should come with said ransom. Appellant-Om prakash was abusing on phone. Appellant
Om Prakash suggested Rajwant Kaur (PW/1) for immediate release of Rs.1 lakh for liberation of Ajit
Pal @ Boby. Thereafter, Taranjeet Gujral @ Monu (PW/10) dialed the same number by his own
mobile phone number and then gave that number of said Khan i.e. 8305620342 to Rajwant Kaur
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 17
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
(PW/1) with advise to inform the police about mobile phone number 8305620342. Thereafter, on
collecting call details of mobile number 8305620342, by which ransom was demanded from cyber
cell, it was found that the said sim was used from phone of IMIE number 358327028551270 and on
that mobile phone sim number 9993135127 was being used which was in the name of appellant Om
Prakash Yadav. It is also clear from EX.P/35-A that on 28.3.2013 from 9:35 to 9:50 hours, there
were calls from mobile phone number 8305620342 having IMEI No.358327028551270 on mobile
No.9300434520 which belongs to Amarjeet Singh @ Mitthu (PW/2) and by the statement of Sai
Datt Bohre (PW/15), Nodal Officer of Bharti Airtel Limited, mobile number 9993135127 was issued
in the name of appellant-Om Prakash. Seizure of dead body of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby from the
well, kept in a plastic sack, murder of the deceased, seizure of knife stained with human blood, on
production of appellant-Rajesh Yadav, recovery of cloths of appellants-Raja and Rajesh @ Rakesh
Yadav, stained with human blood, which have been established beyond reasonable doubt, itself
prove that accused-appellants had committed the offence. Demanding of ransom on phone and
informing that deceased was with appellants-Raja and Rajesh @ Rakesh and thereafter finding of
dead body of deceased Boby, in absence of any contrary material evidence produced by appellants, it
has to be accepted that deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby was in the custody of appellants.
44 : Based on the evidence noticed in the aforesaid paragraphs, there can be no doubt whatsover,
that the accused/appellants had kidnapped Ajit Pal @ Boby and had taken him away, and demanded
ransom of Rs.50 lacs, therefore, stands duly established.
45 : The material question to be determined is, whether the aforesaid circumstantial evidence is
sufficient to further infer, that the accused/appellants had committed the murder of Ajit Pal @
Boby. According to the learned counsel for the appellants, there is no evidence whatsoever, on
record of the case, showing the accused/ appellants participation of the accused/appellants in any of
the acts which led to the death of Ajit Pal @ Boby. It was, therefore, the submission of the learned
Senior counsel for appellants that even though the accused/appellants may be held guilty of having
kidnapped Ajit Pal @ Boby, since it had not been established that he had committed the murder of
Ajit Pal @ Boby, they cannot be held guilty of murder in the facts of this case.
46 : Having given our thoughtful consideration to the submission advanced at the hands of learned
Senior counsel for the appellants, we are of the view that the instant submission is wholly misplaced
and fallacious. In so far as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, reference may be made to
the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Sucha Singh Vs. State of Punjab, (2001) 4 SCC 375
wherein it was held as under :
"21. We are mindful of what is frequently happening during these days. Persons are
kidnapped in the sight of others and are forcibly taken out of the sight of all others
and later the kidnapped are killed. If a legal principle is to be laid down that for the
murder of such kidnapped, there should necessarily be independent evidence apart
from the circumstances enumerated above, we would be providing a safe
jurisprudence for protecting such criminal activities. India cannot now afford to lay
down any such legal principle insulating the marauders of their activities of killing
kidnapped innocents outside the ken of others."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 18
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
A perusal of the aforesaid determination would reveal, that having proved the factum of kidnapping,
the inference of the consequential murder of the kidnapped person, is liable to be presumed. We are
one with the aforesaid conclusion. The logic for the aforesaid inference is simple. Once the person
concerned has been shown as having been kidnapped, the onus would shift on the kidnapper to
establish how and when the kidnapped individual came to be released from his custody. In the
absence of any such proof produced by the kidnapper, it would be natural to infer/presume, that the
kidnapped person continued in the kidnapper's custody, till he was eliminated. The instant
conclusion would also emerge from Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which is being
extracted hereinunder :
"106. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge-. When any fact is
especcially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is
upon him."
(a) When a person does an act with some intention other than that which the character and
circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon him.
(b) A is charged with travelling on a railway without a ticket, the burden of proving that he had a
ticket is on him."
47 : Since in the facts and circumstances of this case, it has been duly established, that Ajit Pal @
boby had been kidnapped by the accused/appellants; the accused/appellants have not been able to
produce any material on the record of this case to show the release of Ajit Pal @ Boby from his
custody. Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 places the onus on them. In the absence of
any material produced by the accused/appellants, it has to be accepted, that the custody of Ajit Pal
@ Boby had remained with the accused/appellants, till he was murdred. The motive/reason for the
accused/appellants, for taking the extreme step was, that ransom as demanded by the
accused/appellants, had not been paid. When the accused/appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh was
detained on 29.3.2013, he had made a confessional statement in the presence of Jitendra Singh @
Sonu (PW/8) stating that his uncle Raju had caught hold deceased and he committed murder by
cutting his neck, whereupon his body was put into gunny bag and thrown into the well and he had
hidden the knife near the drain. It was, thereafter, on pointing out of him the dead body of deceased
was recovered from the aforesaid well kept in a gunny bag as stated by accused/appellant Rajesh @
Rakesh. Dr. Vivek Shrivastava (PW/7) concluded, after holding the postmortem of the dead body of
deceased, that he had died due to haemorrhagic shock, which was caused due to cut of neck by sharp
cutting object. On pointing of accused/appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh, blood stained knife was seized.
Dr. Vivek Shrivastava (PW/7) opined, on perusal of seized knife that injury found on the neck of
dead body of deceased would be caused by said knife. Accused/appellant Raja was also detained on
31.3.2013 and he had made a confessional statement in presence of witness Bambam @ Shaiwal,
stating that he caught hold the hands of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby and accused/appellant Rajesh @
Rakesh by cutting his neck, caused murder of deceased and whereupon his body was put into a
gunny bag and thrown the same in the well. He further stated that during commission of murder,
his cloths were stained with blood of deceased. He further stated that he had concealed that cloths in
his dairy under the 'Khali-Chuni'. On the pointing out of him, blood stained cloths were seized. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 19
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
instant evidence clearly nails all the accused/appellants to be the perpetrator of kidnapping of
deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby for alleged ransom and also nails the accused/appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh
and Raja Yadav as perpetrator of murder of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby, due to not receiving the
alleged ransom. In view of the factual and legal position dealt with herein above, we have no doubt
in our mind that the prosecution has produced substantive material to establish not only the
kidnapping of deceased Ajit Pal @ Boby at the hands of all accused/appellants Om Prakash, Rajesh
@ Rakesh & Raja Yadav, but also his murder at the hands of accused/appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh
and Raja Yadav.
48 : Trial Court convicted the accused/ appellant Om Prakash for offence punishable under Section
364-A r/w Section 120-B of IPC and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and fine of Rs.2,000/-,
in default R.I. for two months whereas appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav have been
convicted for offence under Section 364- A r/w Section 120-B of IPC and they are sentence to death
sentence each and fine amount of Rs.1,000/-, in default R.I. for two months each. They have been
further convicted for offence punishable under Section 302 r/w Section 120-B of IPC and sentenced
to undergo death sentence each and fine of Rs.1,000/- each and in default of payment, R.I. for two
months and they have been also convicted under Section 201 IPC and sentenced to undergo R.I. for
five years each, with fine of Rs.500/- each, in default of fine, R.I. for one month each. The
punishment of co-accused Om Prakash under Section 364-A r/w Section 120-B of IPC is not a
matter of dispute before us as it has not been contested by the prosecution by preferring any appeal.
The minimum sentence for the offence punishable under Section 364-A of IPC is life imprisonment
and thus there is no need to consider the quantum of sentence against appellant Om Prakash.
49 : So far sentence of accused/appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav is concerned, their
learned counsel assailed the death sentence imposed by the trial Court. During the course of
hearing, it was the vehement contention of the learned counsel for the accused-appellants, that
infliction of life imprisonment, in the facts and circumstances of this case, would have satisfied the
ends of justice. It was also the contention of the learned counsel for the accused-appellants, that the
facts and circumstances of this case are not sufficient to categorize the present case as a 'rarest of a
rare case', wherein only the death penalty would meet the ends of justice. To substantiate the
contention of learned counsel for appellants, we may profitably refer to the decision of the Apex
Court in the case of Haresh Mohandas Rajput Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2011) 12 SCC 56, wherein,
having taken into consideration earlier judgments, Apex Court delineated the circumstances in
which the death penalty could be imposed. Reliance was placed on the following observations
recorded therein:-
"Death Sentence ' When Warranted:
"18. The guidelines laid down in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684,
may be culled out as under:
(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of
extreme culpability.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 20
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
(ii) Before opting for the death penalty, the circumstances of the 'offender' also
require to be taken into consideration alongwith the circumstances of the 'crime'.
(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other words,
death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an
altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the
crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of
imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature
and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.
(iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up
and in doing so, the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and
just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating
circumstances before the option is exercised.
19. In Machhi Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjasecb, (1983) 2 SCC 684, this Court
expanded the "rarest of rare" formulation beyond the aggravating factors listed in
Bachan Singh to cases where the "collective conscience"
of a community is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial powers centre to inflict
death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining
death penalty, such a penalty can be inflicted. But the Bench in this case underlined that full
weightage must be accorded to the mitigating circumstances in a case and a just balance had to be
struck between aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
20. "The rarest of the rare case" comes when a convict would be a menace and threat to the
harmonious and peaceful co-existence of the society. The crime may be heinous or brutal but may
not be in the category of "the rarest of the rare case". There must be no reason to believe that the
accused cannot be reformed or rehabilitated and that he is likely to continue criminal acts of
violence as would constitute a continuing threat to the society. The accused may be a menace to the
society and would continue to be so, threatening its peaceful and harmonious co-existence. The
manner in which the crime is committed must be such that it may result in intense and extreme
indignation of the community and shock the collective conscience of the society. Where an accused
does not act on any spur-of-the-moment provocation and indulges himself in a deliberately planned
crime and meticulously executes it, the death sentence may be the most appropriate punishment for
such a ghastly crime. The death sentence may be warranted where the victims are innocent children
and helpless women. Thus, in case the crime is committed in a most cruel and inhuman manner
which is an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting and dastardly manner, where his act
affects the entire moral fiber of the society, e.g. crime committed for power or political ambition or
indulging in organized criminal activities, death sentence should be awarded. (See: C. Muniappan
and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 2010 SC 3718; Rabindra Kumar Pal alias Dara Singh v.
Republic of India, (2011) 2 SCC 490; Surendra Koli v. State of U.P. and Ors., (2011) 4 SCC 80;
Mohd. Mannan (supra); and Sudam v. State of Maharashtra, (2011) 7 SCC 125).

Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
21. Thus, it is evident that for awarding the death sentence, there must be existence of aggravating
circumstances and the consequential absence of mitigating circumstances. As to whether death
sentence should be awarded, would depend upon the factual scenario of the case in hand."
50: The Apex Court in Ramnaresh & Ors. Vs. State of Chhattisgarh, (2012) 4 SCC 257 has laid down
the principles about death sentence and life imprisonment as follows :-
"The death sentence and principles governing its conversion to life imprisonment.
56. Despite the transformation of approach and radical changes in principles of
sentencing across the world, it has not been possible to put to rest the conflicting
views on sentencing policy. The sentencing policy being a significant and inseparable
facet of criminal jurisprudence, has been inviting the attention of the Courts for
providing certainty and greater clarity to it.
57. Capital punishment has been a subject matter of great social and judicial
discussion and catechism. From whatever point of view it is examined, one
undisputable statement of law follows that it is neither possible nor prudent to state
any universal formula which would be applicable to all the cases of criminology
where capital punishment has been prescribed. It shall always depend upon the facts
and circumstances of a given case. This Court has stated various legal principles
which would be precepts on exercise of judicial discretion in cases where the issue is
whether the capital punishment should or should not be awarded.
58. The law requires the Court to record special reasons for awarding such sentence.
The Court, therefore, has to consider matters like nature of the offence, how and
under what circumstances it was committed, the extent of brutality with which the
offence was committed, the motive for the offence, any provocative or aggravating
circumstances at the time of commission of the crime, the possibility of the convict
being reformed or rehabilitated, adequacy of the sentence of life imprisonment and
other attendant circumstances. These factors cannot be similar or identical in any
two given cases.
59. Thus, it is imperative for the Court to examine each case on its own facts, in light
of the enunciated principles. It is only upon application of these principles to the facts
of a given case that the Court can arrive at a final conclusion whether the case in hand
is one of the 'rarest of rare' cases and imposition of death penalty alone shall serve
the ends of justice. Further, the Court would also keep in mind that if such a
punishment alone would serve the purpose of the judgment, in its being sufficiently
punitive and purposefully preventive.

Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
72. The above judgments provide us with the dicta of the Court relating to imposition
of death penalty. Merely because a crime is heinous per se may not be a sufficient
reason for the imposition of death penalty without reference to the other factors and
attendant circumstances.
73. Most of the heinous crimes under the IPC are punishable by death penalty or life
imprisonment. That by itself does not suggest that in all such offences, penalty of
death alone should be awarded. We must notice, even at the cost of repetition, that in
such cases awarding of life imprisonment would be a rule, while 'death' would be the
exception. The term 'rarest of rare' case which is the consistent determinative rule
declared by this Court, itself suggests that it has to be an exceptional case.
74. The life of a particular individual cannot be taken away except according to the
procedure established by law and that is the constitutional mandate. The law
contemplates recording of special reasons and, therefore, the expression 'special' has
to be given a definite meaning and connotation. 'Special reasons' in
contra-distinction to 'reasons' simpliciter conveys the legislative mandate of putting a
restriction on exercise of judicial discretion by placing the requirement of special
reasons.
75. Since, the later judgments of this Court have added to the principles stated by this
Court in the case of Bachan Singh (supra) and Machhi Singh (supra), it will be useful
to restate the stated principles while also bringing them in consonance, with the
recent judgments.
76. The law enunciated by this Court in its recent judgments, as already noticed, adds
and elaborates the principles that were stated in the case of Bachan Singh (supra) and
thereafter, in the case of Machhi Singh (supra). The aforesaid judgments, primarily
dissect these principles into two different compartments - one being the 'aggravating
circumstances' while the other being the 'mitigating circumstances'. The Court would
consider the cumulative effect of both these aspects and normally, it may not be very
appropriate for the Court to decide the most significant aspect of sentencing policy
with reference to one of the classes under any of the following heads while completely
ignoring other classes under other heads. To balance the two is the primary duty of
the Court. It will be appropriate for the Court to come to a final conclusion upon
balancing the exercise that would help to administer the criminal justice system
better and provide an effective and meaningful reasoning by the Court as
contemplated under Section 354(3) Cr.P.C. Aggravating Circumstances:
(1) The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like murder, rape,
armed dacoity, kidnapping etc. by the accused with a prior record of conviction for
capital felony or offences committed by the person having a substantial history of
serious assaults and criminal convictions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 23
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
(2) The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of
another serious offence. (3) The offence was committed with the intention to create a
fear psychosis in the public at large and was committed in a public place by a weapon
or device which clearly could be hazardous to the life of more than one person.
(4) The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like offences to receive
money or monetary benefits. (5) Hired killings.
(6) The offence was committed outrageously for want only while involving inhumane
treatment and torture to the victim.
(7) The offence was committed by a person while in lawful custody.
(8) The murder or the offence was committed to prevent a person lawfully carrying
out his duty like arrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement of himself or
another. For instance, murder is of a person who had acted in lawful discharge of his
duty under Section 43 Cr.P.C.
(9) When the crime is enormous in proportion like making an attempt of murder of
the entire family or members of a particular community.
(10) When the victim is innocent, helpless or a person relies upon the trust of
relationship and social norms, like a child, helpless woman, a daughter or a niece
staying with a father/uncle and is inflicted with the crime by such a trusted person.
(11) When murder is committed for a motive which evidences total depravity and
meanness. (12) When there is a cold blooded murder without provocation.
(13) The crime is committed so brutally that it pricks or shocks not only the judicial
conscience but even the conscience of the society.
Mitigating Circumstances:
(1) The manner and circumstances in and under which the offence was committed,
for example, extreme mental or emotional disturbance or extreme provocation in
contradistinction to all these situations in normal course.
(2) The age of the accused is a relevant consideration but not a determinative factor
by itself. (3) The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of the crime
again and the probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated. (4) The
condition of the accused shows that he was mentally defective and the defect
impaired his capacity to appreciate the circumstances of his criminal conduct. (5) The
circumstances which, in normal course of life, would render such a behaviour
possible and could have the effect of giving rise to mental imbalance in that given
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 24
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
situation like persistent harassment or, in fact, leading to such a peak of human
behaviour that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the accused believed that
he was morally justified in committing the offence.
(6) Where the Court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the view that the
crime was not committed in a preordained manner and that the death resulted in the
course of commission of another crime and that there was a possibility of it being
construed as consequences to the commission of the primary crime. (7) Where it is
absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a sole eye-witness though prosecution
has brought home the guilt of the accused.
77. While determining the questions relateable to sentencing policy, the Court has to follow certain
principles and those principles are the loadstar besides the above considerations in imposition or
otherwise of the death sentence.
Principles:
(1) The Court has to apply the test to determine, if it was the 'rarest of rare' case for
imposition of a death sentence.
(2) In the opinion of the Court, imposition of any other punishment, i.e., life
imprisonment would be completely inadequate and would not meet the ends of
justice. (3) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception.
(4) The option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be cautiously
exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all relevant
considerations.
(5) The method (planned or otherwise) and the manner (extent of brutality and
inhumanity, etc.) in which the crime was committed and the circumstances leading to
commission of such heinous crime.
78. Stated broadly, these are the accepted indicators for the exercise of judicial discretion but it is
always preferred not to fetter the judicial discretion by attempting to make the excessive
enumeration, in one way or another. In other words, these are the considerations which may
collectively or otherwise weigh in the mind of the Court, while exercising its jurisdiction. It is
difficult to state it as an absolute rule. Every case has to be decided on its own merits. The judicial
pronouncements, can only state the precepts that may govern the exercise of judicial discretion to a
limited extent. Justice may be done on the facts of each case. These are the factors which the Court
may consider in its endeavour to do complete justice between the parties.
79. The Court then would draw a balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Both
aspects have to be given their respective weightage. The Court has to strike a balance between the
two and see towards which side the scale/balance of justice tilts. The principle of proportion
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 25
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
between the crime and the punishment is the principle of 'just deserts' that serves as the foundation
of every criminal sentence that is justifiable. In other words, the 'doctrine of proportionality' has a
valuable application to the sentencing policy under the Indian criminal jurisprudence. Thus, the
court will not only have to examine what is just but also as to what the accused deserves keeping in
view the impact on the society at large.
80. Every punishment imposed is bound to have its effect not only on the accused alone, but also on
the society as a whole. Thus, the Courts should consider retributive and deterrent aspect of
punishment while imposing the extreme punishment of death.
81. Wherever, the offence which is committed, manner in which it is committed, its attendant
circumstances and the motive and status of the victim, undoubtedly brings the case within the ambit
of 'rarest of rare' cases and the Court finds that the imposition of life imprisonment would be
inflicting of inadequate punishment, the Court may award death penalty. Wherever, the case falls in
any of the exceptions to the 'rarest of rare' cases, the Court may exercise its judicial discretion while
imposing life imprisonment in place of death sentence."
51: The Apex Court on a decision in the case of Brajendra Singh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2012)
4 SCC 289, having followed the decision rendered in Ramnaresh & Ors. Vs. State of Chhattisgarh
(cited supra), further held as under:-
"38. First and the foremost, this Court has not only to examine whether the instant
case falls under the category of 'rarest of rare' cases but also whether any other
sentence, except death penalty, would be inadequate in the facts and circumstances
of the present case.
39. We have already held the Appellant guilty of an offence under Section 302, Indian
Penal Code for committing the murder of his three children and the wife. All this
happened in the spur of moment, but, of course, the incident must have continued for
a while, during which period the deceased Aradhna received burn injuries as well as
the fatal injury on the throat. All the three children received injuries with a knife
similar to that of the deceased Aradhna. But one circumstance which cannot be
ignored by this Court is that the prosecution witnesses have clearly stated that there
was a rift between the couple on account of her talking to Liladhar Tiwari, the
neighbour, PW10. Even if some credence is given to the statement made by the
accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. wherein he stated that he had seen the deceased
and PW10 in a compromising position in the house of PW10, it also supports the
allegation of the prosecution that there was rift between the husband and wife on
account of PW10. It is also clearly exhibited in the FIR (P-27) that the accused had
forbidden his wife from talking to PW10, which despite such warning she persisted
with and, therefore, he had committed the murder of her wife along with the
children."

52 : The Apex Court in the case of Mukesh & another Vs. State for NCT of Delhi and others
[Criminal Appeal No.607-608 of 2017, arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) Nos. 3119-3120 of 2014] with
Criminal Appeal No. 609-610 of 2017 arising out of SLP (Criminal) No. 5027-5028 of 2014 referring
to pronouncement in the case of Bachan Singh (Supra) Machhi Singh (Supra), Ramnaresh and
others vs. State of Chhattisgarh (2012) 4 SCC 257, has also tried to lay down a nearly exhaustive list
of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. It would be apposite to refer to the same here :
"Aggravating Circumstances :
(1) The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like murder, rape,
armed dacoity, kidnapping etc. by the accused with a prior record of conviction for
capital felony or offences committed by the person having a substantial history of
serious assaults and criminal convictions.
(2) The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of

Mitigating Circumstances:

(2) The age of the accused is a relevant consideration but not a determinative factor

absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a sole eye-witness though prosecution
has brought home the guilt of the accused."
53: We are one with the learned counsel for the accused- appellants, on the parameters prescribed
by the Apex Court, for inflicting the death sentence. Rather than deliberating upon the matter in any
further detail, we would venture to apply the parameters laid down in the judgments of Apex Court
to determine whether or not life imprisonment or in the alternative the death penalty, would be
justified in the facts and circumstances of the present case. We may first refer to the aggravating
circumstances as under:-
(i) The accused-appellants have been found guilty of the offence under Section 364A
of the Indian Penal Code.
Section 364A is being extracted hereunder:-
"364A. Kidnapping for ransom, etc.'Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or keeps
a person in detention after such kidnapping or abduction and threatens to cause
death or hurt to such person, or by his conduct gives rise to a reasonable
apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt, or causes hurt or death to
such person in order to compel the Government or any foreign State or international
inter-governmental organization or any other person to do or abstain from doing any
act or to pay a ransom, shall be punishable with death, or imprisonment for life, and
shall also be liable to fine."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 28
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
A perusal of the aforesaid provision leaves no room for any doubt, that the offence of kidnapping for
ransom accompanied by a threat to cause death contemplates punishment with death. Therefore,
even without an accused actually having committed the murder of the individual kidnapped for
ransom, the provision contemplates the death penalty. Insofar as the present case is concerned,
there is no doubt, that the accused-appellants have been found to have kidnapped Ajit Pal @ Boby
for ransom, and accused/appellants, Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav have also actually committed
his murder. In the instant situation therefore, the guilt of the accused- appellants Om Prakash,
Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav (under Section 364A of the Indian Penal Code) must be
considered to be of the gravest nature, justifying the harshest punishment prescribed for the offence.
(ii) The accused-appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav have also been found guilty of the
offence of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code
also contemplates the punishment of death for the offence of murder. It is, therefore apparent, that
the accused- appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav are guilty of two heinous offences, which
independently of one another, provide for the death penalty.
(iii) The accused/appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav caused the murder of child of about
15 years. The facts and circumstances of the case do not depict any previous enmity between the
parties. There is no grave and sudden provocation, which had compelled the accused to take the life
of an innocent child. The murder of a child, in such circumstances makes this a case of extreme
culpability.
(iv) Kidnapping of a child was committed with the motive of carrying home a ransom. On account of
the non-payment of ransom, a minor child's murder was committed. This fact demonstrates that the
accused had no value for human life. The instant circumstance demonstrates extreme mental
perversion not worthy of human condonation.
(v) The manner in which the child was murdered,and the approach and method adopted by the
accused, disclose the traits of outrageous criminality in the behaviour of the accused. The child was
first murdered by cutting his neck by a sharp edged weapon and the dead body of the child was then
tied in a gunny bag, and finally the gunny bag was thrown into a well. All this was done, in a well
thought out and planned manner. This approach of the accused reveals a brutal mindset of the
highest order.
(vi) All the aforesaid aggravating circumstances are liable to be considered in the background of the
fact, that the child was known to the accused-appellants. The child and accused/appellants were
same locality. Murder was therefore committed, not of a stranger, but of a child with whom the
accused were acquainted. This conduct of the accused-appellants, places the facts of this case in the
abnormal and heinous category.
(vii) The choice of kidnapping the particular child for ransom, was well planned and consciously
motivated. The parents of the deceased had three children ' two daughters and one son. Kidnapping
the only male child was to induce maximum fear in the mind of his parents. Purposefully killing the
sole male child, has grave repercussions for the parents of the deceased. Agony for parents for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140098378/ 29
Rajesh @ Rakesh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 10 August, 2017
loss of their only male child, who would have carried further the family lineage, and is expected to
see them through their old age, is unfathomable. Extreme misery caused to the aggrieved party,
certainly adds to the aggravating circumstances.
54 : As against the aforesaid aggravating circumstances, learned counsel for the accused-appellants
has pointed out following mitigating circumstances :-
(i) The chances of the accused/appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav of not
indulging in commission of the crime again and the probability of the
accused/appellants being reformed and rehabilitated.
(ii) The age of the accused/appellants Rajesh @ Rakesh is a relevant consideration.
Except aforesaid mitigating circumstances, learned counsel for the accused/appellants could not
point out any other mitigating circumstances. So far young age of the appellant Rajesh @ Rakesh is
concerned, there is no mitigating circumstance for commutation to life, as has been held in the case
of Bhagwan Swarup Vs. State of U.P. (1971) 3 SCC 759, Deepak Rai Vs. State of Bihar (2013) 10 SCC
421 and Shabhnam Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (2015) 6 SCC 632. So far as the accused/appellants
Rajesh @ Rakesh and Raja Yadav of not indulging in commission of the crime again and the
probability of the accused/appellants being reformed and rehabilitated is concerned looking to the
nature and way of committing above offence, in our considered view, there is no possibility of any
reform and rehabilitation.
55 : Thus, viewed on the parameters laid down by Apex Court, in the decisions mentioned above, we
have no choice, but to affirm the death penalty imposed upon the accused-appellants Rajesh @
Rakesh and Raja Yadav by the trial Court.
56: In view of the above, we find no justification whatsoever, in interfering with the impugned
judgment of the trial Court, either on merits or on the quantum of punishment.
57: The property seized be destroyed after the appeal period is over.
58: In view of the foregoing discussions, we confirm the death sentence awarded by the trial Court
and dismiss Cr.A.No.83/2017 and Cr.A.No.84/2017.
Ordered accordingly.
