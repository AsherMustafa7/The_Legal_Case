Committee) Manipur Legislative Assembly, thereby a Sub-Committee has been
constituted under Rule 242(1) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in
Manipur Legislative Assembly for delimitation of Constituencies of the Autonomous
District Councils, Manipur, consisting 9 (nine members). It may be stated that the
Chairman of the Hill Areas Committee himself is the Chairman of the
Sub-Committee.
The impugned notification is challenged for violation of Article 14, 19 and 371C of the
Constitution of India and also it should be issued under the name of the Governor. As
per Annexure-8, one PS Mahai, Advocate, submitted a representation dated
16.09.2022 to the Hon'ble Governor of Manipur. The representation stated that the
delimitation of the ADCs has to be done under the supervision of the Government
and not by the Hill Areas Committee and Sub- Committee was constituted by the
Chairman, (HAC). It is submitted that the said representation is still pending.
