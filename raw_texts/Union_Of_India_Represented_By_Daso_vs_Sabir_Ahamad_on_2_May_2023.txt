under Section 135 (1)(b)(ii) of the Customs Act, 1962 and considered the submission of the Ld. SPP

(Special Public Prosecutor) for the Custom to take a lenient view and given the nature of the case,
sentenced the respondents (convicts) to imprisonment till the rising of the Court and to pay a fine of
Rs. 10,000/- each and on default of payment of fine, they shall undergo imprisonment of 15 days.
The convicts also deposited the fine amount.
[3] Vide order dated 28.07.2022 in MC(Crl.Rev.P.) No. 3 of 2022, this Court condoned the delay of
98 days in filing the revision against the impugned judgment and order. In spite of due service of
notice, none of the respondents appeared before this Court during the consideration of application
for condonation of delay nor in the main petition. [4] The brief fact of the case is that from the
possession of the respondents, 14 gold biscuits weighing 2.324 kgs. of foreign origin were recovered.
Accordingly, the case under Section 135 of the Customs Act, 1962 was lodged against the
respondents after getting due sanction for prosecution-cum-authorization for filing complaint dated
23.04.2019. During Criminal Revision Petition No. 17 of 2022 Page 2 the trial, both the respondents
pleaded guilty. The respondents were convicted under Section 135 (1)(b)(ii) of the Customs Act,
1962 by the impugned order dated 02.11.2020 and on the submission of the Ld. SPP for the customs
for taking a lenient view and also the learned counsel for the convicts, the Ld. CJM, Chandel
sentenced both the respondents/convicts to imprisonment till the rising of the day and to pay a fine
of Rs. 10,000/- each and on default, to undergo imprisonment of 15 days as stated above. Both the
convicts deposited the fine amount on the same day.
[5] The main ground of revision is that the sentence imposed by the Ld. CJM, Chandel is too lenient
and without considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and will serve a bad precedent.
While hearing for the admission of the revision petition, vide order dated 18.10.2022, this Court
observed that it would not be open to the custom authority to seek enhancement of the sentence
when the same was passed as per the suggestion of the Ld. SPP to take a lenient view. Mr. Th.
Sanachouba, learned counsel for the Customs, sought some time to get instruction as to whether Ld.
SPP was instructed to make such a suggestion to the Ld. CJM and if not, whether any action was
initiated against him. The order dated 18.10.2022 passed by this Court is reproduced herein below:
"Heard Mr. Th. Sanachouba, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Criminal Revision Petition No. 17 of 2022 Page 3 Perusal of the order under challenge
reflects that it was the learned Special Public Prosecutor, who appeared for the
custom authorities, who had suggested to the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Chandel, that a lenient view should be taken by the Court in so far as sentencing was
concerned, given the nature of the case. Having made such a suggestion to the
learned Magistrate through their counsel, it is not open to the Custom authorities to
now seek enhancement of the sentence.
Mr. Th. Sanachouba, learned counsel, seeks time to get instructions in this regard
and also ascertain as to whether the learned Special Public Prosecutor was instructed
to make such a suggestion to the learned Magistrate and if not, whether any action
has been initiated against him.

Post on 23.11.2022."
[6] Thereafter, the learned counsel for the petitioner took 7 (seven) adjournments to file an
additional affidavit in terms of the order dated 18.10.2022. On 11.04.2023, the petitioner filed an
additional affidavit. On perusal of the additional affidavit dated 11.04.2023 containing 6 (six) pages,
explanation was given as to the maintainability of the revision petition for enhancing sentence and
nothing is stated regarding the specific instruction as to whether any instruction was given to the Ld.
SPP to suggest leniency in sentence. [7] The case was heard on 19.04.2023 for admission. During
the admission hearing, Mr. Th. Sanachouba, learned counsel for the Union of India/Customs, relies
upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Alamgir vs. State of Bihar
Criminal Revision Petition No. 17 of 2022 Page 4 reported as AIR 1959 SC 436 to impress upon the
point that the High Court can exercise revisional power to interfere with the sentence. During the
course of hearing, this Court has pointed out to Mr. Th. Sanachouba, learned counsel for the
petitioner, as to whether how a revision petition has been filed against the order for enhancement of
the sentence. However, Mr. Th. Sanachouba, learned counsel, clarifies by referring to the above
noted judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and various other judgments mentioned in the
additional affidavit that a revision petition is maintainable to examine the sentence and prays this
Court that the matter may be treated as a revision petition praying for enhancement of sentence.
[8] Considering the submission, this Court proceeded with the present revision petition and the
matter was heard on 19.04.2023 and reserved for order.
[9] On mere perusal of the cause title in the first page of the revision petition, the same is filed under
Section 130D of the Customs Act, 1962 read with Section 377(1) of Cr.PC. In the first para of the
revision petition, it is filed under Section 130 of the Customs Act, 1962 read with Section 377(1) of
the Cr.PC. In the additional affidavit dated 11.04.2023, the petition was stated to be filed under
Section 130A of the Customs Act, 1962 read with Section 377 of Cr.PC. Further, on mere perusal of
letters dated 16.09.2021 and 08.12.2021 sent by the Superintendent, Customs Division, Imphal to
Mr. Th. Sanachouba, Criminal Revision Petition No. 17 of 2022 Page 5 learned standing counsel for
the customs, the instruction was for filing the appeal.
[10] There is total non-application of mind in filing the present revision petition/appeal before this
Court. It may be noted that Section 130, 130A and 130D of the Customs Act were repealed with
effect from 28.12.2005 by Act 49 of 2005. The present revision/appeal has been filed under the
provisions which are no longer in the statute book as on the date of filing, i.e. 29.07.2022.
[11] The present petition has been filed against the sentence on the plea that a too lenient view was
taken by the Ld. CJM but on plain reading of the impugned order dated 02.11.2020, the leniency
was taken by the Ld. CJM, Chandel on the specific submission of the Ld. SPP for the custom. As
such, the petitioner has no right to agitate the same before this Court. In the order dated 18.10.2022,
this Court specially directed the petitioner to file an affidavit as to whether the Ld. SPP of custom
was instructed to make a suggestion to the Ld. CJM for taking a lenient view in sentencing and if
not, any action was taken. After seeking 7 (seven) adjournments, an additional affidavit dated
11.04.2023 was filed explaining about the maintainability of the revision petition against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44173581/ 3
Union Of India Represented By Daso ... vs Sabir Ahamad on 2 May, 2023
inadequacy of sentence. However, nothing is stated about the specific query of this Court as to
whether any instruction was given to the Ld. SPP to take a lenient view in the sentence and if not,
what action has been instituted against the Ld. SPP. Criminal Revision Petition No. 17 of 2022 Page
6 [12] Since no specific denial is made in additional affidavit by the Customs, this Court is bound to
presume that an instruction was given to the Ld. SPP by the custom officials to take a lenient view, if
any, while considering of sentencing to the respondents/convicts. [13] Considering all these facts
into account, materials on record and additional affidavit dated 11.04.2023, this Court is of the
opinion that there is no error in the order of sentence passed by the Ld. CJM, Chandel in the
impugned order dated 02.11.2020. It may be noted that Section 135 (1)(b)(ii) of Customs Act, 1962
prescribes imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years or with fine or with both.
[14] In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is not inclined to interfere with
the impugned order. Accordingly, the revision petition is dismissed with cost of Rs. 10,000/- for
wasting valuable time of this Court and public money by filing frivolous petition. The amount of cost
is to be deposited in favour of High Court Legal Services Committee (HCLSC). The cost of Rs.
10,000/- shall be deposited within one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
[15] This Court is constrained to express its displeasure in the manner the appeal/revision has been
filed in the present case by the Union of India. The revision petition is badly drafted and is not
expected from the Union of India. The appeal, which was vehemently argued by the learned counsel
for the petitioner to be treated as a Criminal Revision Petition No. 17 of 2022 Page 7 revision relying
on various judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme court, is filed under repealed provisions, i.e. Sections
130/130A/130D of the Customs Act 1962, which were repealed with effect from 28.12.2005 by the
Act 49 of 2005.
[16] In the opening page of the revision petition, the main Section quoted is 377(1) of Cr.PC, which is
an appeal against the sentence and in the additional affidavit dated 11.04.2023, it was filed under
Section 130A of the Customs Act read with Section 397 Cr.PC, which is a revision case. This Court
expects the Union of India to be mindful under which provisions the appeal/revision is filed. [17]
Send a copy of this order to the Assistant Commissioner, Customs Division, Imphal for information
and necessary compliance.
