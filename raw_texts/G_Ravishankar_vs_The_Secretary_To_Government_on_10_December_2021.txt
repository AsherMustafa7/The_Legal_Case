ORDER
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed by one Ravishankar claiming to be an Advocate by
profession as Party -in- person.

Police Station. According to him, they are indulged in running Kangaroo Court, outsourcing their
power to third parries and extorting money from the general public. He has referred to the incident
of the year 2004, wherein a complaint was registered against him at the instigation of his neighbour
and had cited the incident which occurred on 23.06.2011, a case of an attempt to murder, which was
sought to be covered up.
3. A specific allegation against the police officials is that they have made one Easwaran and his team
as part of police force to extract money and no one in the village is ready to take up Easwaran and
his associate Palanivelrajan and Devadass. Therefore the petitioner seeks a direction to the fifth
respondent for registering a case against the above persons under Sections 124(A), 121, 120(b),211,

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98796759/ 3
G.Ravishankar vs The Secretary To Government on 10 December, 2021
petition was given to either maintain mud wall or to remove the same. The petitioner
is pending enquiry. Besides there was a civil case regarding the dispute of mud wall in
O.S. No.240/2010 on the file of the learned ADM Court, Sankarankovil. The said case
was filed by Govindan father of this petitioner against one Lakshmi and
Shanmugasundaram. The said case has been dismissed for default on 12.07.2013 2
38 of 2017 30.01.2017 Complaint was given by Shanmugasundarm against this
petitioner, his father Govindhan and his mother. The content of the petition is that
the disputed mud wall regarding which shunmugasundaram preferred complaint in
CSR No.22/2017 collapsed on 27.01.2017 at about 7.00 p.m., due to heavy rains and
fell on Mrs. Lakshmiammal, mother of Shunmugasundaram. Soon after

not aware of the current status of those case.

7. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submits that the vague and bald allegations against the
police officials in the petition are imaginary. The petitioner's grievance has been properly heard by
the police officials , but he is not satisfied. Though there are serious allegations against the named
officer, there is no material evidence found to infer abuse of power.
8. This Court, after going through the petition, written submission and memo filed by the fifth
respondent, particularly dated 14.02.2017, is of the view that the petitioner ought not to have come
to this Court filing this petition with all vague and irrelevant facts. If he had any specific grievance
against any particular police official he should have sought for appropriate remedy before
appropriate authorities and if his attempts are failed, he should have approached this Court under
Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
9. This Court, while observing so, does not doubt the bonafide of the petitioner but only concerned
about his reaction to certain incompetency or illegality he has experienced at the hands of the police.
However the petitioner under Section 482 Cr.P.C is the pan acea of such ill.

10. In view of the same, the Criminal Original Petition stands dismissed.
