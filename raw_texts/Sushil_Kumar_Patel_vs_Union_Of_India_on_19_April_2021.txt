ORDER
(Passed on this 19th day of April, 2021) Per: Mohammad Rafiq, Chief Justice The present suo motu
Writ Petition No.8914/2020 was registered on the basis of a letter (dated 08.06.2020) sent by Dr.
Ashwani Kumar, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India, New Delhi to the Chief Justice of India,
which was forwarded to the Registrar General of this Court by the Secretary General of Supreme
Court of India (vide his letter dated 11.06.2020) under His Lordship's direction. The said letter
dated 08.06.2020 had highlighted a tragic and condemnable sight of an elderly Covid-19 patient,
who, as per the story carried out by a media portal with a photograph, was chained to bed in a
private hospital at Bhopal, the capital city of the State of Madhya Pradesh, allegedly on his failure to
make payment of fees for his treatment. One wonders if the situation has changed much since then
when the entire country is struggling to survive the second wave of Covid-19.
This Court has passed number of orders to ensure that the Covid-19 patients in the State are
provided timely treatment inasmuch as they are not subjected to harassment and exploitation.
When the matter was listed on 07.09.2020, this Court directed the State WP No.8914/2020 &
Linked Matters Government to issue necessary directions to every hospital including the private
hospitals to display the rates for treatment of Covid-19 patients at their reception counters and also
publish the same for information of people by publication thereof in the newspapers so that any
incident of overcharging could be brought to the notice of the District Administration and necessary
action be taken. On 09.10.2020 when the matter was next listed, the Coronavirus was at its peak
during the first wave, this Court was informed that 262 hospitals in the State of Madhya Pradesh
have been declared as Covid Care Centre (CCC), 62 hospitals have been declared as Dedicated Covid
Health Centre (DCHC) and 16 hospitals have been declared as Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH), i.e.
in all 347 hospitals, which are providing free treatment and testing to the Covid suspects and
patients. This Court was also informed that there is no shortage of life saving medicines for Covid-19
treatment; scrupulous measures are being taken to ensure that no private hospitals/clinics charge
exorbitant fee for such treatment and that rates are being duly exhibited on the hospital counters
across the entire State of Madhya Pradesh. The State Government was directed to ensure strict
compliance of the norms laid down by the Central Government in their Notification dated
07.04.2020 with regard to infrastructure and other requirements for CCCs, DCHCs and DCHs. The
Commissioner, Health Services was directed to set up a District Level Cell to receive and attend the
complaints, which should be made functional 24x7. Efforts should be made by all the stakeholders
to educate one and all to scrupulously WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters follow the norms of
social distancing, use of face masks and washing hands etc.
2. When the matter was listed before the Court on 10.12.2020, the State Government filed its
response to I.A. No.6360/2020 thereby placing on record copy of the order dated 04.09.2020
issued by the Commissioner, Health Services, Department of Public Health and Family Welfare,
Madhya Pradesh issued under the approval of the Additional Chief Secretary of the State
Department, directing that under no circumstances the Private Hospitals/Nursing Homes/Clinical
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 3
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
Establishments' charges shall exceed by 40% of the rates communicated on or before 29.02.2020
including all expenses such as PPE kits etc. The aforesaid order was addressed to all the Chief
Medical & Health Officers of the State, President of the Indian Medical Association, President of the
Nursing Home Association and the Additional Director, IDSP (MP). It was assured that the said
order shall be prominently published in daily newspapers having wide circulation in the respective
Districts of the State after interval of every 15 days. It was also informed on behalf of the State that
approximately 1.5 Crore e-cards covering 56% of the beneficiaries families under Pradhan Mantri
Jan Arogya Yojana (which is hereinafter referred to as "Ayushman Bharat Yojana", as is commonly
known) have been issued; total number of 652 health care providers have been empanelled in the
State; the State Government is providing WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters free cashless health
facility to all Covid-19 patients at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and designated Government
facilities.
3. Thereafter, the matter was listed before the Court on 07.04.2021 on two Interlocutory
Applications filed by the learned Amicus Curiae. The first application (IA No.3929/2021) was filed
by him on the premise that he has learnt from reliable sources that the District Administration,
Jabalpur has orally directed all the private Labs and Hospitals to stop conducting Covid-19 tests
from 25.03.2021. The Chief Medical & Health Officer, Jabalpur (CMHO) who was present before the
Court along with the Regional Director, Health Services, denied having issued any oral directions
and submitted that orders have been issued to regulate the rates of the tests to be charged by the
private Labs/Hospitals. IA No.4125/2021 was also filed by learned Amicus Curiae that in view of the
second wave of Covid-19, all the District Administrations of the State should be directed to ensure
strict compliance with the directions of the State Government dated 25.03.2021 and that all
hospitals empanelled under Ayushman Bharat Niramayam Yojana should be directed not to deny
treatment to Covid- 19 suspected/confirmed patients falling under that scheme and should be
further required to reserve minimum 20% beds for Covid-19 patients. In response, it was informed
on behalf of the State that the Commissioner, Health-cum-Officiating Secretary, Directorate of
Health Services, Government of Madhya Pradesh had issued an order on 05.04.2021 thereby
prescribing a sum of Rs.700/- as the rate for WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters RT-PCR Covid-19
Test and a sum of Rs.300/- for Rapid Antigen Covid-19 Test, with an additional sum of Rs.200/- if
the sample is required to be collected from the home of the patient, by all ICMR & NABL approved
Private Labs and NABH recognised Private Hospitals. Another order dated 05.04.2021 was placed
on record whereby the Secretary, Department of Public Health and Family Welfare, Government of
Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal taking note of large number of grievances raised by public complaining
about exorbitant charges, directed all Private Hospitals/Nursing Homes/Diagnostic Centres to
charge a maximum sum of Rs.3,000/- for Chest CT/HRCT Scan from Covid-19 suspects/patients.
The aforesaid order was to remain in operation till 30.04.2021.
4. This Court in the aforesaid order dated 07.04.2021 took note of submissions made by Mr.
Shivendra Pandey, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Indian Medical Association (respondent
No.5 in WP No.8914/2020) and Mr. Shreyas Pandit, learned counsel appearing for M.P. Nursing
Home Association (respondent No.8 in WP No.8914/2020) that in their joint meeting held on
06.04.2021, they have decided to comply the aforementioned orders of the Government with regard
to charges for RT-PCR Test, Rapid Antigen Test and Chest CT/HRCT Scan from Covid-19
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 4
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
suspects/patients. However, they informed the Court that there are in the State, approximately
3000 Private Hospitals, which are registered with Indian Medical Association and approximately
3000 Private Nursing WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters Homes having membership with the
M.P. Nursing Home Association but only a negligent number of 320 Private Hospitals and Nursing
Homes are presently empanelled under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, of which only 81 are approved for
treatment of Covid-19. This Court therefore while appreciating the stand taken by both Indian
Medical Association and M.P. Nursing Home Association, also observed that their members in the
time of current crisis faced by the country following the second wave of Covid-19 should desist from
exploiting the situation by overcharging the affected persons. The Court also directed the State
Government to give wide publicity to above orders issued by it, in all print and electronic media and
by any other means. The State Government was also directed to increase the empanelment of
Private Hospitals and Private Nursing Homes in the State in Ayushman Bharat Yojana, which fulfill
the relevant criteria prescribed by the Central Government, for treatment of Covid-19
suspects/patients under the scheme.
5. The matters had to be then urgently listed on 15.04.2021 on special mention by number of
Advocates, who had filed Interlocutory Applications in the present suo motu writ petition inasmuch
as I.A. No.4347/2021 (regarding passing of directions to all the competent authority to follow the
guidelines issued by the State Government regarding Covid-19 with immediate effect) has been filed
by Mr. Subhash Upadhyay, Advocate at Indore; I.A. No.4349/2021 (application for permission to
intervene in suo motu writ petition) has WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters been filed by one Dr.
M.A. Khan through Mr. Ajay Raizada, Advocate; and I.A. No.4346/2021 (subject: Uncontrolled
upsurge and serious mismanagement issue in Covid Pandemic control) has been registered on the
basis of a letter addressed to this Court by Mr. Vivek Krishna Tankha, Senior Advocate. Besides, a
fresh Writ Petition by way of public interest litigation bearing W.P. No.8753/2021 has been filed by
an NGO, named, 'Srijan Ek Asha'.
6. Mr. Naman Nagrath, learned Amicus Curiae has made his submissions and given written
suggestions. Mr. P.K. Kaurav, learned Advocate General appearing along with Mr. R.K. Verma,
learned Additional Advocate General, Mr. Pushpendra Yadav, learned Additional Advocate General
and Ms. Chhavi Bhardwaj, Managing Director, National Health Mission (Madhya Pradesh), aside of
making submissions, filed action plan of the State to manage the situation. Apart from learned
Amicus Curiae, we have also heard Mr. Shashank Shekhar Dugwekar, Mr. Sanjay Kumar Verma, Mr.
Shekhar Sharma and Mr. Pawan Kumar Dwivedi, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in
respective writ petitions as well as heard Mr. Jitendra Kumar Jain, learned Assistant Solicitor
General for the respondents- Union of India and Mr. Vivek Krishna Tankha, learned Senior Counsel,
Mr. Subhash Upadhyay, Mr. Ajay Raizada, Mr. Shivendra Pandey and Mr. Shreyas Pandit, learned
counsel appearing for the respective intervenors/respondents on Interlocutory Applications filed in
the suo motu writ petition. All of them have, more or less, raised WP No.8914/2020 & Linked
Matters similar arguments as to the ongoing crisis faced by the State following the second wave of
Covid-19. A gist of what all of them have submitted in the course of hearing can be summarized
thus:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 5
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
(i) there is an acute medical crisis in the State of Madhya Pradesh due to sudden
spread of Covid-19, which has engulfed not only the urban areas but also reached the
villages;
(ii) many deaths have been reported during the past few days from various hospitals
including the private Hospitals/Nursing Homes across the State due to non-
availability of Oxygen. There is an acute shortage of Oxygen in the Government Hospitals as well as
Private Hospitals/Nursing Homes not only in the major cities like Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and
Jabalpur but also in District Headquarters and Sub Divisions. Large number of newspaper clippings
have been filed to bring home the point;
(iii) there is an acute shortage of Remdesivir- a life saving drug which is quite crucial for saving the
life of Covid-19 patients. In most of the Districts of the State including the major cities like Bhopal,
Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur one vial of Remdesivir, which costs approximately Rs.800-1,000, is
being sold at an exorbitant price to the extent of Rs.18,000/-. The private hospitals are exploiting
WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters the situation by charging arbitrary rates for providing
Remdesivir injections. The black-marketing of Remdesivir injection is leading to registration of
criminal cases in some instances. Many newspaper clippings have been produced to substantiate
this;
(iv) while dedicated Covid-19 Hospitals have been established in the major cities like Bhopal,
Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur but there are hardly any such hospitals in any other District
Headquarters of the State, with the result that all critical Covid patients have to be rushed there;
(v) oral instructions have been issued to all Private Labs/ Private Hospitals/Nursing Homes not to
conduct any RT- PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests;
(vi) although the rates have been prescribed by the Government for all private Hospitals/Nursing
Homes for being charged from Covid-19 patients but most of them are not abiding by the same;
(vii) the private Hospitals/Nursing Homes are blankly refusing to have availability of beds for
Covid-19 patients inasmuch as the beds are being provided to only those who are either ready to pay
higher charges or having some kind of influence. Resultantly, middle class, lower middle class and
poor are worst hit;
WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters
(viii) most of the private hospitals are not providing cashless treatment to the patients having
insurance cover, inasmuch as, some private hospitals even though they are approved for CGHS
facilities are not accepting the patients under that head. Similarly, the private hospitals empanelled
and approved for Covid-19 treatment under Ayushman Bharat Yojana are also not accepting the
Covid patients and the patients from Below Poverty Line having BPL cards under Deendayal
Antyodaya Upchar Yojana are also not being provided treatment under that scheme by approved
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 6
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
Hospitals;
(ix) there are in the State, 51 District Hospitals; 84 Civil Hospitals and 330 Community Health
Centres with 30 beds facility each; 1199 Primary Health Centres having 6 bed facility each but most
of them, apart from having acute shortage of Medical and Para-Medical Staff, are ill- equipped to
deal with the current crisis. As per the Annual Report of 2019-20, there are 3620 sanctioned posts of
specialists, as against which nearly 80% of them (2855 posts) are vacant with only 765 presently
working and there are 5097 posts of Health Officers, as against which only 3,589 are working and
nearly 30% i.e. 1,508 posts are vacant;
(x) there is no system in place whereby it could be known as to how many normal beds, ICU beds
and Ventilators are WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters available in Government and Private
Hospitals and that the Covid Portal of the State, namely, "Sarthak" (https://sarthak.nhmmp.gov.in)
is mostly not updated and therefore, does not provide the correct information;
(xi) every second and third home in cities, namely, Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Jabalpur and Gwalior has
a Covid-19 patient but the correct number of patients are being suppressed inasmuch as the
newspapers are widely reporting much higher number of deaths in the Districts of the State due to
Coronavirus than what is officially declared by the District Administration which is corroborated by
number of funerals taking place in the Cremation grounds as per the Corona Protocol;
(xii) the test report of RT-PCR samples is being received with delay of three to five days in most of
the instances. If the patient in the meantime dies, dead body is handed over to the family members
and the cremation in such cases is not being conducted as per the Corona Protocol. In some
instances, even after the death of declared Covid-19 patients, the dead bodies are being allowed to be
taken to home rather than being cremated/buried as per the standard Corona protocol, thus giving
rise to spread of Coronavirus amongst the family members and others;
(xiii) as per the data given in W.P. No.8753/2021, ever since the onset of second wave of Covid-19
since February, WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters 2021 till 13th April, 2021, almost 1,38,70,731
Covid-19 cases were detected in India out of which 3,53,632 cases have till date been traced in State
of Madhya Pradesh, of which total 8,998 Covid-19 positive cases along with 14 deaths were reported
in Madhya Pradesh on 13th April, 2021;
(xiv) not many effective steps are being taken by the State Government to check the citizens who are
not wearing face masks and not maintaining social distance, which could be easily witnessed at the
market places;
(xv) neither any containment zones are being declared nor any kind of barricading is being done and
even the banners or posters are also not being affixed to warn people about the severity of the
disease, as was a regular feature in first wave of Covid-19. There are no regular mobile sanitization
units to spray the sanitizer in vulnerable places of townships and colonies as was a regular feature in
the first wave of Covid-19;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 7
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
(xvi) there is a crisis of availability of wood in all the funeral grounds and the electric crematoriums
wherever they are situated, are mostly out of order;
(xvii) there are no beds available in Government as well as Private Hospitals in cities like Bhopal,
Indore, Jabalpur and other places. ICU beds and ventilators are nowhere to be found. The private
hospitals are taking exorbitant WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters charges for ICU beds and
Ventilators thereby exploiting the situation.
7. Learned Amicus Curiae and the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the intervenors
have submitted that all the newspapers in the State of past ten days are replete with stories pointing
out acute medical crisis and total lack of medical facilities and non-availability of Oxygen and
Remdesivir injections throughout the State of Madhya Pradesh. The patients are being asked to
bring their own Oxygen cylinders with them and manage the vials of Remdesivir on their own. It is
submitted that there is demand of advance deposit of huge amount by the private Hospital/Nursing
Homes. It is the duty of the Government to ensure that common man is not made to suffer due to
non-availability of Oxygen and life saving drug like Remdesivir. The Government has miserably
failed to ensure the availability of treatment to poor and needy, especially in semi- urban and rural
areas thereby violating the right to life of the citizens enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of
India. There is state of panic and fear amongst the people who are with every passing day becoming
restless. All these circumstances are pointer towards disorganized health infrastructure of the State
Government, which has miserably failed to manage this medical emergency despite the advance
warning by World Health Organization (WHO) of approaching second wave. The State Government
has utterly failed to cope up with the ongoing medical emergency inasmuch as there is WP
No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters huge communication gap and lack of coordination amongst
various government functionaries. In fact, the entire State machinery has been caught off-guard and
has been found lacking in its efforts to provide basic health care to the citizens.
8. Mr. Naman Nagrath, learned Senior Counsel appearing as Amicus Curiae has submitted that
already this Court on 07.09.2020 directed the State Government to issue directions to every private
Hospitals and Nursing Homes to display the rates for treatment of Covid-19 suspects/patients at
their reception counters and give due publicity to the same. In fact, in the order dated 10.12.2020 it
was clearly noted that the Commissioner, Health Services, Department of Public Health and Family
Welfare has issued an order on 04.09.2020 that under no circumstances the charges of private
Hospitals/Nursing Homes/Clinical establishments shall exceed by 40% of the rates communicated
by them on or before 29.02.2020 including all expenses such as PPE Kits etc. The direction was also
issued that this information should also be brought in the public domain by getting it repeatedly
published in the daily newspapers having circulation in the respective districts after interval of every
15 days. Similar direction was issued by this Court on 07.04.2021. The State Government should
therefore be required to mandate all the private Hospitals/Nursing Homes/Clinics and Labs to
charge only the notified rates, not only for RT-PCR, Rapid Antigen Tests, Chest CT/HRCT Scan but
also all other hospital charges in that regard. All these directions earlier issued WP No.8914/2020 &
Linked Matters by this Court in the suo motu writ petition have regained significance in view of the
current second wave of Covid-19 and therefore, the State Government should ensure strict
compliance of all such directions including about the treatment of poor patients under Ayushman
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 8
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
Bharat Yojana reserving 20% beds for Ayushman Bharat Yojana beneficiaries and increase the
empanelment of more private hospitals under the said scheme. The State Government should
ensure regular and continuous supply of Oxygen not only to the Government Hospitals but also to
private hospitals, which are generally denying treatment to Covid-19 patients due to non-availability
of Oxygen. Since the State is wholly dependent on supply of Liquid Oxygen from other States for its
refueling plants employed for supply of Oxygen cylinders to the hospitals, it should initiate the
process of setting up Liquid Oxygen Plant in the State of Madhya Pradesh. In the meantime, the
State should maximise its efforts to procure Liquid Oxygen or filled Oxygen cylinders from other
States by all means. The State Government must come forward to assist private hospitals in setting
up their Oxygen-Concentration Units by providing them soft loan by involving leading Banks and
Financial Institutions so that they become self-reliant.
9. Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that it has been informed on behalf of the State Government
that the price of Remdesivir injection has been capped at Rs.3,500/- but such drug is being sold in
the market at an exorbitant price inasmuch as many of the private WP No.8914/2020 & Linked
Matters hospitals are found charging Rs.5,400/- per vial for Remdesivir injection. The State
Government should ensure the availability of Remdesivir injection and regulate its supply but such
supply should be approved as per the prescription of the treating doctors of Covid-19 patients
admitted in the hospitals and should not be denied at the discretion of the Patwari, Tehsildar or any
other Administrative Officers. The State Government should be required to restore the facilities of
number of Covid Care Centres (CCC), Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) and Dedicated Covid
Hospitals (DCH), which it informed to this Court on 09.10.2020.
10. Mr. P.K. Kaurav, learned Advocate General, Mr. Pushpendra Yadav and Ms. Chhavi Bhardwaj,
Managing Director of National Health Mission (MP) have presented the case of the State
Government before this Court, which has been supplemented by a written note of submissions and

sources located outside of the state. With an in-house production capacity of 66 MT
(Metric Ton) by way of Air Separation Units (ASUs), MP sources a large part of its
daily oxygen required from steel plants located outside of the state and suppliers who
source it from diverse sources across the country. With an overall surge in demand
and limited supply, the state is making all efforts to be able to meet its daily oxygen
requirement. The State is expected to have a demand of 651 MT (Metric Ton) by 30th
April, 2021 and is continuously in talks with GoI regarding our future requirements
of LMO (Liquid Medical Oxygen). The GoI has proposed Madhya Pradesh to procure

Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
In accordance with AIIMS' guideline dated April 7, 2021 pertaining to the use of Remdesivir for
COVID treatment, the state has initiated for supply of Remdesivir for COVID treatment across
medical colleges and district hospitals in the state. Approximately 42000 injections have been
supplied in the government sector as on April 14th.
In view of the shortage of Remdesivir in the private sector, state government has also facilitated the
private sector by tying up with various suppliers for supply of approximately more than 39000
Remdesivir injections to private health institutions. The state government is also supporting private
hospitals by making available part of the government supply from the stores of the district Chief
Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) to private hospitals.
Of the total government supply being sourced by the state, approximately 50% is being made
available to Government Medical Colleges and the remaining is being made available to the Chief
Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) of every district. To support private health institutions, supply
available to CMHO is being allotted to government and private facilities under the supervision and
control of the WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters District Collector. While the 7 private contracted
facilities in Indore, Bhopal, Ujjain and Dewas are being issued Remdesivir free of cost along with the
public facilities, other private facilities are being supported with Remdesivir at the purchase cost of
Rs 1548 per injection from government supply.
6. Current bed availability and planning for bed capacity:
While Madhya Pradesh has a total of 19948 beds currently available at public health
facilities and another 16756 beds are currently available at various private hospitals,
going by the current surge in covid cases, the state has planned for expansion of
isolation beds, oxygen supported beds and HDU/ICU beds at the 13 medical colleges,
51 District Hospitals, 84 Civil hospitals and 313 CHCs.
It is pertinent to mention here that as on 31st March 2020, 23 district hospitals in the
state did not have a single ICU unit. In light of the Covid pandemic, the state
government set up 585 ICU beds across 50 district hospitals in the state and 3700
Oxygen supported beds were also put in place by way of medical gas pipeline last
year. In wake of the current surge the state plans to further extend the oxygen
supported beds infrastructure at the District Hospitals, Civil Hospitals, and CHCs
thereby increasing the numbers of oxygen supported beds from 7880 beds to 14770
in the public hospitals next one month. Similarly ICU/HDU beds at Government
Medical Colleges are planned to be increased from 3258 beds at present to 4356 beds
in the next one month. District administration is also actively engaging with the
private hospitals to increase the bed capacity for covid patients at private hospitals.
Below is the current and planned status of beds - isolation beds, oxygen supported
beds and ICU/HDU beds across public and private health facilities in the state.

Last year, Government of Madhya Pradesh had temporarily relaxed the empanelment criteria for
Ayushman Bharat in order to broad base the availability of Private Facilities for COVID-19
treatment. Consequently, 111 facilities were empanelled after the relaxation of empanelment norms.

11. Mr. Shivendra Pandey, learned counsel appearing for Indian Medical Association and Mr.
Shreyas Pandit, learned counsel appearing for the M.P. Nursing Home Association, submitted that
howsoever the Government may assert that it is continuously making the Oxygen cylinders available
to all the private hospitals in the State but the fact is that many private hospitals are struggling with
the acute shortage of Oxygen throughout the State. Some of them may not be in a position to admit
the patients infected with Coronavirus for reason of non-availability of Oxygen but when the
attendants or family members of the patients are so informed, it results in law and order situation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 14
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
Apart from Oxygen, there is acute shortage of availability of Remdesivir injection. Many of the
private Hospitals/Nursing Homes are in negotiation with the Government authorities to increase
their bed capacity by using casualty wards and even the labour rooms for treatment of Covid-19
patients. Even when the beds are not available, they do not refuse admission even if the patients
have to be accommodated in the corridors. Learned counsel submitted that the State Government
ought to consider either by itself or through the leading Banks/Financial Institutions for providing
interest free loan or at the reasonable rate of interest, to major private hospitals, for setting up their
own Air Separation Units, which may cost hardly between Rs.50.00 Lac to Rs.1.00 Crore but which
takes only 5-7 days to set up WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters such units. The State Government
may also make an endeavour to engage the medical students who have recently passed out and have
completed their clinical training. The private hospitals can also consider engaging such medical
graduates even in their set up. It is contended that a joint meeting of the members of the Indian
Medical Association and M.P. Nursing Home Association was convened on 14th April, 2021 and
they have decided to honour the rates for treatment of Covid-19 patients fixed by the Government in
terms of the order of the Government dated 04.09.2020, which provided that their charges should
not exceed 40% of the rates communicated on or before 29.02.2020. The rates of treatment so
prescribed by the State Government are being adhered to by the private Hospitals/Nursing Homes
and they are displaying such rates on their reception counters prominently. Learned counsel further
argued that the gravity of illness of Covid-19 patients may vary from patient to patient. All Covid
patients need not be prescribed same medicines inasmuch as they cannot be subjected to same kind
of treatment. Therefore, the charges for critical patients may differ from those who may be having
mild symptoms. Thus, there cannot be any uniformity with regard to charges/expenses of the
treatment.
12. Mr. Jitendra Kumar Jain, learned Assistant Solicitor General for the respondent-Union of India
submitted that the ICMR Laboratories in the State are conducting more than 13,000 RT-PCR tests
per day. The Central Government has recently issued licences to five new WP No.8914/2020 &
Linked Matters pharmaceutical companies for manufacturing of Remdesivir and they are likely to
commence the production shortly. Thus, there will be no shortage of Remdesivir.
13. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions made by the learned counsel for
the parties at the Bar.
14. Article 38, Article 39(e), Article 41 and Article 47 in Part-IV of the Constitution of India as well as
the fundamental right guaranteed vide Article 21 of the Constitution of India deal with potent and
substantive contents of the right to life which in its broad sweep also includes right to good health.
The Supreme Court of India in catena of judgments has given dynamic interpretation to Article 21 of
the Constitution of India thereby expanding the meaning of right to life to also include the right to
health. Thus, the right to health forms an integral component of right to life enshrined under Article
21 of the Constitution of India. The right to health can be secured to the citizens only if the State
provides adequate measures for their treatment, healthcare and takes their care by protecting them
from calamities like Coronavirus. A reference in support of this proposition can be made to the
judgments of Supreme Court in Pt. Parmanand Katara vs. Union of India (1989) 4 SCC 286;
Consumer Education and Research Centre vs. Union of India (1995) 3 SCC 42; Paschim Banga Khet

SCC 9 and Murli S. Devda vs. Union of India (2000) 8 SCC 765. The Supreme Court WP
No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters in all these cases has held that preservation of one's life is the
necessary concomitant of the right to life enshrined under Article 21, fundamental in nature,
secured, precious and inviolable.
15. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ratified by India, which is considered as
having the force of customary international law declares that "Everyone has the right to a standard
of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food,
clothing, housing, and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the
event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in
circumstances beyond his control". Similarly, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which also has been ratified by India, details out the different
facets of the right to health and provides that "(1) The States Parties to the present Covenant
recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and
mental health" and that "(2) The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present Covenant to
achieve the full realization of this right shall include those necessary for: (a).........; (b)............; "(c)
the prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases" and
"(d) the creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in
the event of sickness". The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 recognizes all the above
conventions as part of human rights law, WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters therefore above
referred to international human rights norms, as contained in the Conventions, which have been
ratified by India, are binding on India to the extent they are not inconsistent with the domestic law
norms. Section 2(d) of the Act of 1993 (supra) defines "human rights" to mean "the rights relating to
life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the
International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India". In view of above, it must be held that
right to health and medical care is one of the facets enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of
India.
16. The Supreme Court in Association of Medical Superspeciality Aspirants and Residents and
others v. Union of India and others, (2019) 8 SCC 607 with regard to effect of ratification of the
aforementioned declaration/covenants by the country, made the following observations in para-32
of the judgment:-
"32. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) recorded in the Preamble
its recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all
members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace. The
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)
recognizes the right of every person to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
standard of physical and mental health. ICESCR mandates the States Parties to
achieve full realization of the aforementioned right through the creation of conditions
which would assure to all, medical service and medical attention in the event of
sickness, inter alia."

17. The Supreme Court in Pt. Parmanand Katara vs. Union of India, (1989) 4 SCC 286 has
recognised the obligation of the WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters Government to preserve life.
In the said case, the victim of a scooter accident was denied treatment as the hospital did not attend
him and told that he be taken to another hospital, which was authorised to handle medico-legal
cases. The failure to receive treatment, eventually led to victim's death. While interpreting the ambit
of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Supreme held that "Article 21 of the
Constitution casts the obligation on the State to preserve life...... The obligation being total, absolute
and paramount, laws of procedure whether in statute or otherwise, which would interfere with the
discharge of this obligation cannot be sustained and must, therefore, give way."
18. The Supreme Court in Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samiti vs. State of West Bengal, (1996) 4
SCC 37 dealing with a case of member of the petitioner Samiti, who suffered a brain injury after
falling from train and was denied treatment at several hospitals due to lack of expertise and
non-availability of bed was forced to avail treatment at a private hospital. The Supreme Court way
back in the year 1996 made certain observations which continue to be relevant even for the present
purpose. While dealing with a claim of compensation and the expenses incurred, the Supreme Court
in that case further observed that the obligation to provide medical care was an obligation of welfare
State and in para 9 of the report held that "The Constitution envisages the establishment of a welfare
State at the federal level as well as State level. In a welfare State the primary WP No.8914/2020 &
Linked Matters duty of the Government is to secure the welfare of the people. Providing adequate
medical facilities for the people is an essential part of the obligation undertaken by the Government
in a welfare State. The government discharges this obligation by running hospitals and health
centres which provide medical care to the person seeking to avail these facilities. Article 21 imposes
an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person. Preservation of human life is
thus of paramount importance. The government hospitals run by the State and the medical officers
employed therein are duty-bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life. Failure on
the part of a government hospital to provide timely medical treatment to a person in need of such
treatment results in violation of his right to life guaranteed under Article 21.".......Their Lordships
then in para 16 of the report further held that "It is no doubt true that financial resources are needed
for the providing these facilities. But at the same time it cannot be ignored that it is the
constitutional obligation of the State to provide adequate medical services to the people. Whatever is
necessary for this purpose has to be done. In the context of the constitutional obligation to provide
free legal aid to a poor accused this Court has held that the State cannot avoid its constitutional
obligation in that regard on account of financial constraints...."
19. The Supreme Court in Devika Vishwas vs. Union of India, (2016) 10 SCC 726 while reiterating
the settled law held that "right to WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters health" is a facet of the "right
to life" guaranteed vide Article 21 of the Constitution. The Court in paras 107, 108 and 109 held as
under:-
"107. It is well established that the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution
includes the right to lead a dignified and meaningful life and the right to health is an
integral facet of this right. In CESC Ltd. V. Subhash Chandra Bose, (1992) 1 SCC 441
dealing with the right to health of workers, it was noted that the right to health must
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 17
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
be considered an aspect of social justice informed by not only Article 21 of the
Constitution, but also the Directive Principles of State Policy and international
covenants to which India is a party. Similarly, the bare minimum obligations of the
State to ensure the preservation of the right to life and health were enunciated in
Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of W.B.
108. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, (1984) 3 SCC 161 this Court
underlined the obligation of the State to ensure that the fundamental rights of weaker
sections of society are not exploited owing to their position in society.
109. That the right to health is an integral part of the right to life does not need any
repetition."
20. The Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Vs. Moolchand Kharaiti Ram Trust (2018) 8
SCC 321 held as under:-
"65. The State has to ensure the basic necessities like food, nutrition, medical
assistance, hygiene etc. and contribute to the improvement of health. Right to life
includes right to health as observed In State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh Chawla
(1997) 2 SCC 83. Right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution
also includes right of patients to be treated with dignity as observed by this Court in
Balram Prasad v. Kunal Saha (2014) 1 SCC 384. Right to health i.e.right to live in a
clean, hygienic and safe environment is a right under Article 21 of the Constitution as
observed in Occupational Health and Safety Association v. Union of India (2014) 3
SCC 547=AIR 2014 SC 1469. The concept of emergency medical aid has been
discussed WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters by this Court in Pt. Parmanand
Katara v. Union of India (1989) 4 SCC 286. In Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity
and others v. State of W.B. (1996) 4 SCC 37, right to medical treatment has been
extended to prisoners also."
21. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar and others Vs. Union of
India (2018) 10 SCC 1, upon survey of previous case law held that right to health and health care is
one of the facets of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It was held that "the
right to life is meaningless unless accompanied by the guarantee of certain concomitant rights
including, but not limited to, the right of health. The right of health is understood to be
indispensable to a life of dignity and well-being, and includes, for instance, the right of emergency
medical care and the right to the maintenance and improvement of public health". (See para 483 of
the report).
22. The Supreme Court in Association of Medical Superspeciality Aspirants and Residents (supra)
held that the primary duty of the State is to "provide all facilities to make right of a citizen to secure
his health meaningful." The relevant discussion is to be found in paras 25 and 26 of the judgment,
which are reproduced hereunder:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 18
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
"25. It is for the State to secure health to its citizens as its primary duty. No doubt the
Government is rendering this obligation by opening Government hospitals and
health centers, but in order to make it meaningful, it has to be within the reach of its
people, as far as possible, to reduce the queue of waiting lists, and it has to provide all
facilities to employ best of talents and tone WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters up
its administration to give effective contribution, which is also the duty of the
Government.
26. Right to health is integral to the right to life. Government has a constitutional
obligation to provide health facilities 21. The fundamental right to life which is the
most precious human right and which forms the ark of all other rights must therefore
be interpreted in a broad and expansive spirit so as to invest it with significance and
vitality which may endure for years to come and enhance the dignity of the individual
and the worth of the human person. The right to life enshrined in Article 21 cannot be
restricted to mere animal existence. It means something much more than just
physical survival. The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all
that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate
nutrition, clothing and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing and expressing
oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with
fellow human beings. Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity
would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and the restriction would
have to be in accordance with reasonable, fair and just procedure established by law
which stands the test of other fundamental rights."
23. The action plan produced by the State Government before this Court clearly indicates that apart
from having an in-house production capacity of 66 Metric Ton by way of Air Separation Units, it has
now swung into action to utilize all the resources at its command for arranging the Oxygen to
procure 747 Metric Ton of Liquid Medical Oxygen from Steel Plants located in different parts of the
country with the assistance from the Government of India to meet the expected demand of 651
Metric Ton by 30th April, 2021. It has installed 5 Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) Oxygen
Generation Plants and is likely to install three more, thus catering to the need of eight different WP
No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters districts to the extent of 5 Metric Ton. The State Government has
also floated tenders for 13 more Pressure Swing Absorption Oxygen Plants of 600 LPM capacity for
13 districts and has decided to float another tender for 10 other districts shortly. According to the
submission made on behalf of the State, 42,000 injections of Remdesivir have been supplied in
government sector as on 14.04.2021 and that it is in negotiation with different manufacturers for
supply of more than 39,000 Remdesivir injections to the private Health Care Institutions. Apart
from this, the State Government has promised to ensure supply of Remdesivir injections to the
private hospitals from the stores of the district Chief Medical & Health Officers. Of the total supply
sourced by the State Government, approximately 50% is being made available to the Government
Medical Colleges and remaining 50% is being given to the Chief Medical & Health Officer of every
district out of which supply of Remdesivir is also made to the private hospitals under the
supervision and control of the District Collector. According to the State, there is availability of

(which would include 14,770 Oxygen beds and 4356 ICU beds) and 18,293 beds in private hospitals
(which would include 9767 Oxygen beds and 4091 ICU beds) by next 30-40 days. Apart from this,
the State Government has set up Covid Command and Control Centres in each WP No.8914/2020 &
Linked Matters of the 52 districts with 1075 as the toll free number and has submitted that it keeps
updating bed occupancy and non-availability twice every day on the Sarthak portal. It has engaged
8843 additional human resource locally, which includes 472 MBBS doctors, who have completed
their internships as on 31.03.2021, 93 PGMOs and 276 MOs. It is trying to increase the coverage of
Ayushman Bharat Niramayam Yojana to bring many more private hospitals under its umbrella. It
has so far administered first dose of Covid vaccine to 64,09,582 and second dose to 7,20,296
citizens. The work undertaken in the State Government within the past month or so is commendable
and its preparation for the future is also quite impressive, however, efforts that it is making should
also reflect on ground and benefit thereof should reach the common man. It therefore needs to work
hard towards that aim and goal.
24. Although it is true that in the past few days there has been a spate of new reports putting all kind
of blames on the Private Hospitals and Private Nursing Homes, but at the same time, one should not
lose sight of the fact that there are more than 6000 Private Hospitals and Private Nursing Homes in
the State and therefore it is of utmost importance and necessity that support and cooperation of the
private sector to combat the menace of Covid-19 is enlisted which is why the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare, Government of India recognized the need and importance of seeking their support
and for that purpose has issued the "Guidelines for notifying Covid-19 WP No.8914/2020 & Linked
Matters affected persons by Private Institutions" which can be found on the website of the Ministry.
The Indian Council of Medical Research has also approved hundreds of the private laboratories to
test the suspects/patients of Covid-19. Need of the hour in this time of crisis therefore is to have best
of cooperation and coordination with the Hospitals and Nursing Homes in the private sector and
seek their support for timely treatment of the Covid-19 patients so as to save their lives. The State
Government can in that behalf even invoke the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and Disaster
Management Act, 2005 to the extent necessary.
25. Coronavirus, if not treated timely, may in certain cases prove a deadly disease, especially for
those citizens who suffer from different kind of morbidities and are elderly in age. This has had
catastrophic effect on the citizens of the country. It has befallen on the countrymen unpredictably
more than a year ago. The right of the citizen to adequate healthcare emanates from the dignity and
sanctity of the human life which belongs to all of them. Health, besides being a fundamental right, is
a basic human right, which no popular government can afford to negate. Health has its own
prerequisites of social justice and equality and that it should be accessible to all. It includes the
ability to obtain all kind of healthcare services including prevention, diagnosis, treatment and
management of diseases, management of health disorders, diseases and illness as also the
management of other health impacting conditions. Such health care WP No.8914/2020 & Linked
Matters should not only be accessible but also be conveniently affordable to all the citizens. The core
obligation of the State in securing the right to life to all its citizens is non-negotiable. Article 21 of the
Constitution of India in this regard clearly casts a duty on the State to take whatever steps are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 20
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
necessary in securing such rights to access to health facilities to the citizens. It also includes an
obligation on the State in ensuring access to all the citizens inflicted with disease of Coronavirus
with life saving means and drugs such as Oxygen and Remdesivir in this case.
26. Even though we may make it clear that we are not experts in the field of Medicine but at the
same time we are also cognizant of the fact that the State of Madhya Pradesh in past few days has
faced a crisis like situation never seen before where a lot of hue and cry by the people in different
forms is being witnessed when their near and dear ones are infected with Coronavirus and some of
them lose their life. The newspapers of the State during last week or so, are replete with the reports
of incidents where either the patients are allegedly not being admitted or are being allegedly
exploited by exorbitant charges by the private hospitals. The Remdesivir injection is being sold in
the black-market and certain arrests have also been made. The attendants and the family members
of the Covid patients are being found complaining about non-availability of Oxygen, Remdesivir and
beds in the hospitals. Non-availability of ICU beds and Ventilators is also a common complaint. We
are inclined to believe that these news items WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters may have
reported only part truth and part emotions of those who have gone through such agony. But even if
only part of it is true, the situation is really very grim. This is a scenario which is emerging from
major cities like Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur. One can easily imagine the situation of
district headquarters, sub-divisions and rural areas where the disease of Coronavirus is said to have
made inroads. Ordinarily these matters lie in the domain of the Executive, who has the
responsibility to resolve all the identified problematic issues. However, despite being cognizant of its
jurisdictional limitations, this Court, in an extraordinary situation like the present one, when they
are brought to its notice, cannot just play a silent spectator. In this scenario, the Court has the
responsibility to see that the faith of the people in the system is not eroded and if erosion to some
extent has taken place, is restored. Towards that end, the Court can play the role of a catalyst by
reminding the State of its duties, for reassuring the people to continue to have faith in the system so
as to revive their confidence.
27. In view of the above discussion, we deem it appropriate to issue the following directions to the
State Government:-
(i) The State Government shall ensure continuous and regular supply of Oxygen and
Remdesivir not only to all the Government Hospitals, City Hospitals, District
Hospitals but also to the Private Hospitals/Nursing Homes, which may give Indent of
their requirement of WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters Oxygen as well as
Remdesivir in advance, depending on the load of the patients and their condition, as
per the modalities decided by the State, to the Collector/Chief Medical & Health
Officer concerned and/or Officer nominated by the State;
(ii) the State Government shall, if it has already not done so, consider immediately
reactivating 262 hospitals Covid Care Centres (CCC), 62 Dedicated Covid Health
Centre (DCHC) and 16 Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) as per the details furnished
to this Court in its order dated 09.10.2020;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 21
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
(iii) the State Government shall consider strengthening/ augmenting all the District Hospitals and
City Hospitals, which generally cater to the medical needs of middle class/lower middle class and
poor/below poverty line families, by providing them necessary equipments and the required
quantity of Oxygen, Remdesivir injections and other requisite medicines so that considering the
spread of Coronavirus, focus of the Covid-19 patients does not entirely remains on major cities like
Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior where due to huge population, the medical facilities are
already under immense pressure and rush of the Covid patients to these cities is dissuaded;
WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters
(iv) the State Government shall ensure that the District Collectors and Chief Medical & Health
Officers in every District shall periodically hold meetings with the
Superintendents/Directors/Head/Representatives of all Government Hospitals, Private
Hospitals/Nursing Homes and Diagnostic Centres/Labs to take stock of the day to day situation of
the number of patients, availability of normal beds, ICU beds and Ventilators and also as per the
requirement consider enhancing the capacity to cater to the need of a given place;
(v) the State Government shall, if it has not already notified the rates, fix the rates for being charged
by the private Hospitals/Nursing Homes and private Pathological Labs/ Diagnostic Centres for
treatment/tests in consonance with its earlier order dated 04.09.2020, 25.03.2021 and 05.04.2021
by indicating capping of such charges and should ensure that these rates are adhered to by them. In
doing so, the State Government should also take note of the concerns of the private
Hospitals/Nursing Homes with regard to differentiation of charges based upon seriousness of illness
of patients;
(vi) the State Government shall in consultation with representatives of Indian Medical Association
and M.P. Nursing Home Association require the private WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters
Hospitals/Nursing Homes to refrain themselves from demanding hefty amount as advance deposit
for starting treatment of Covid-19 patients;
(vii) the State Government shall ensure displaying of data with regard to availability of normal beds,
ICU beds and Ventilators on its Sarthak portal (https://sarthak.nhmmp.gov.in) in all the
Government Hospitals and Private Hospitals/ Nursing Homes on real time basis. The Chief Medical
& Health Officers of the districts concerned should keep a regular watch over such availability and
randomly cross- check the same to verify its correctness. On the basis of regular vigil about the
availability of normal beds, ICU beds and Ventilators, the District Collector, in consultation with the
Chief Medical & Health Officers, should take day to day decision for increase in the number of such
beds by procuring additional infrastructure/hardware/machines etc. from the State Government to
ensure continuous availability of medical health care to the increasing number of Covid patients;
(viii) the State Government should require all the private Hospitals/Nursing Homes,
Chemists/Medical Shops to display the rates of Remdesivir per vial, separately for generic and
branded injections, and all of them should be mandated not to charge more than the prescribed
rates;

WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters
(ix) even though the State Government may regulate the supply of Remdesivir injections and other
life saving drugs but the process adopted for this purpose should be so hassle free and should not be
cumbersome as to ensure the supply of the drug in such a way that time limit from requisition by the
treating doctors and supply of medicines does not exceed an hour;
(x) the State Government, through its representatives, preferably the District Collectors and the
Chief Medical & Health Officers shall have regular consultation with the
Superintendents/Directors/Heads of the Government Hospitals and leading private
Hospitals/Nursing Homes to resolve the day-to-day problems faced not only by the patients but also
by such private Hospitals/Nursing Homes, either by physical or virtual mode;
(xi) the State Government should give due publicity to the Toll Free Number 1075 (with the STD
code number of respective districts) of its Covid Command and Control Centres so that the Covid
patients and their family members/attendants having any grievance with any government or private
hospital, may immediately lodge their complaint with such Centres. In that event, expeditious
remedial action should be taken to redress the grievances by knowing the stand of both the parties;
WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters
(xii) the State Government should by taking over the buildings of government and private
schools/colleges, Training Centres, Marriage Halls, Hotels and Stadiums etc. wherever needed, set
up more number of Covid Care Centres (CCC), Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) and
Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH), either by itself or by involving the private hospitals or reputed
NGOs;
(xiii) the State Government should take steps to setup more number of Electric Crematoriums, in
at-least big cities of the State, and get the Electric Crematoriums repaired, wherever they have gone
out of order;
(xiv) the RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests shall be conducted by the Government Laboratories as
well as duly approved private Pathological Labs/Diagnostic Centres. The State should consider
increasing per day testing number of Covid infected persons for their early detection so as to prevent
further spread of Coronavirus. Test reports should be provided to concerned patients positively
within 36 hours from the time of collection of sample;
(xv) the State Government ought to consider the suggestions made on behalf of Indian Medical
Association and M.P. Nursing Home Association for providing them soft loan to set up their own Air
Separation Units so that some of WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters them may become
self-reliant with regard to their requirement of Oxygen;
(xvi) the State Government should work out the modalities for ensuring that patients from Below
Poverty Line families having BPL Cards under Deendayal Antyodaya Upchar Yojana and those
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26801899/ 23
Sushil Kumar Patel vs Union Of India on 19 April, 2021
having Ayushman Cards and CGHS coverage facilities are not dishonoured by the
Hospitals/Nursing Homes if they are approved for their treatment;
(xvii) in W.P. No.8753/2021 purportedly based on the Annual Report 2019-2020 it has been
asserted that as against 3620 sanctioned posts of specialists, only 765 are presently working and
nearly 2855 are vacant. Moreover, as against 5097 posts of Health Officers, only 3,589 are working
and 1,508 posts are vacant. In this respect, the State Government should place on record correct
data with regard to number of sanctioned posts and working strength of Senior specialists,
Specialists, Medical Officers, Health Officers, PGMOs, Ayush Medical Officers, Staff Nurse, Support
Staff/Ward Boy, Other Health Care Workers, Lab Technicians, ECG Technicians, X-ray Technicians,
Scientists, OT Technicians, Radiographers, Lab Attendants, ICU/Ventilator Technicians,
Pharmacists, and Oxygen WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters Technicians etc., within a period of
15 days. If the furnished data are correct, such huge vacancy position in the Government Hospitals,
City Hospitals and District Hospitals poorly reflects on the health care system of the State. The State
Government ought to therefore consider engaging the Medical Officers on emergent and short term
basis on the basis of walk-in interviews by issuing advertisement for short duration so as to cater to
the emergent requirements of Districts & City Hospitals and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and
Community Health Centres (CHCs);
(xviii) looking to the scarcity of adequate number of staff in the emergent situation, the State
Government should consider reappointing those Medical Officers, Para Medical and Nursing Staff,
who have retired during past two to three years, to cope up with the ongoing crisis; and (xix) all the
hospitals whether government or private, shall not refuse to attend the patients suffering from other
serious ailments and provide them timely treatment depending on the seriousness of the ailments.
28. Apart from Madhya Pradesh, this Court can also take judicial cognizance of the fact that similar
problem with regard to scarcity of Oxygen and Remdesivir is being faced by several other States.
This WP No.8914/2020 & Linked Matters being a national calamity and country-wide problem, the
Central Government should consider stepping in to arrange the Oxygen firstly, by diverting the
available stock of Liquid Medical Oxygen from the Steel Plants and other industries located in
different parts of the country and secondly, if that is not sufficient, by importing the Oxygen. The
Central Government should also consider to step in to ensure increase in the production of
Remdesivir and till such time it is not done, it should consider procuring the Remdesivir by
importing it so that by the time the peak of Coronavirus is reached, Oxygen and Remdesivir both
remain available to the affected persons in sufficient quantity, to tide over the crisis.
29. In view of the aforesaid, Interlocutory Application Nos.4346/2021, 4347/2021 and I.A.
No.4349/2021 filed in W.P. No.8914/2020 are disposed of. Similarly, W.P. No.8696/2020, W.P.
No.14805/2020, W.P. No.2513/2021 & W.P. No.8753/2021 are also disposed of in terms indicated
hereinabove. No order as to costs.
30. Action taken report/progress report on the basis of the aforesaid directions shall be filed by the
respondents-State, on or before the next date of hearing in Suo Motu Writ Petition No.8914/2020,
which shall come up again for further consideration along with W.P. No.20889/2020, on
