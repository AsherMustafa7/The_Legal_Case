(5) After completion of necessary investigation, police filed the charge-sheet. The
matter was committed for trial. The accused was charged for committing offence
punishable under Sections 377, 302, 201(1), 363 IPC and Section 4 read with Section
3 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The accused abjured his
guilt. The matter was committed for trial. Prosecution examined 28 witnesses and
exhibited 36 documents to bring home the charge.
Whereas, the accused person while confronting the prosecution witnesses exhibited 9 documents.
(6) The Trial Court vide impugned judgment found the accused guilty of the charges levelled and
imposed the death penalty. And has submitted the matter to the High Court under Section 366
Cr.P.C. for confirmation of death sentence. Even the accused person has also preferred an appeal
under Section 374 Cr.P.C.
(7) Before entering into rival contentions, submissions which border around the provision contained
under Section 273 Cr.P.C. are taken up first.
(8) Section 273 Cr.P.C. envisages that except as otherwise expressly provided, all evidence taken in
the course of the trial or other proceeding shall be taken in the presence of the accused, or, when his
personal attendance is dispensed with, in the presence of his The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.
Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The
State of Madhya Pradesh pleader:
Provided that where the evidence of a woman below the age of eighteen years who is
alleged to have been subjected to rape or any other sexual offence, is to be recorded,
the court may take appropriate measures to ensure that such woman is not
confronted by the accused while at the same time ensuring the right of
corss-examination of the accused.
Explanation.- In this section, "accused" includes a person in relation to whom any
proceeding under Chapter VIII has been commenced under this Code.
(9) It is urged on behalf of the accused/appellant that de hors the mandatory
stipulations contained in Section 273 Cr.P.C. the Trial Court on various occasions
recorded prosecution evidence in absence of accused. As a result whereof, since the
valuable right of the accused of having prosecution witnesses examined in his
presence has been infringed, the entire proceedings got vitiated, and for that the
judgment based on such proceedings is a nullity in the eyes of law, which deserves to
be set aside, with the matter be relegated to the Trial Court for fresh trial. Reliance is
placed on the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in "State of Madhya Pradesh
Vs. Budhram s/o Kunkuram Satnami [1996 Cri.L.J 46]". The appellant also relies on
the recent decision in "Atma Ram & Ors. Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.
Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @
Jogeshnath Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh State of Rajasthan [2019 Cr.L.R. (SC)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111300735/ 6
Yogesh Nath @ Jogesh Nath vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 6 September, 2019
633]". In Budhram (supra), the Division Bench relied on earlier decision in Daryav
Singh Vs. State of M.P.: Cr.A.345/88 decided on 05.05.1988; wherein, taking note of
the fact that on 12.12.1987 one prosecution witness was examined in absence of
accused, the matter was remanded back to the Trial Court for redeciding the matter
after recording the evidence of said witness in presence of the accused. In Budhram
(supra), the Division Bench took note of the fact that when the trial commenced the
accused was not defended by a lawyer. Opportunity was afforded to him to engage a
lawyer as he had made a request to the Court in that behalf. Ultimately he engaged a
lawyer. During the course of the trial on a number of occassions the accused was not
produced before the Court and the trial had to be adjourned. On 31-1-95 the story was
repeated and the appellant/accused was not produced before the Court. On that date
Bhogilal (P. W. 14), Urmilabai (P.W. 15), Kamlabai (P.W. 16), Kiranbai (P.W. 17) and
Nandram (P.W. 18), Awadesh Kumar (P.W.19) and Investigating Officer C.P. Jhariya
(P.W.20) were present. The learned counsel representing the accused informed the
Court that he had no objection if the witnesses in attendance were examined and,
accordingly, the learned Judge recorded the evidence of all these witnesses in
absence of the accused.
Ultimately, the matter ended in conviction based mainly on the The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.
Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The
State of Madhya Pradesh testimony of P. W. 10 Kotwar Patel Das who testified to the extra-
judicial confession made by the accused to him. Being convinced that the provision of Section 273
Cr.P.C. was violated appellants' conviction and sentence of death was set aside and the case was
remitted to the Trial Court for recording of evidence of (PW-14) to (PW-20) afresh in presence of the
appellant, who be given full opportunity to cross-examine them.
(10) In Atma Ram (supra), in respect of the offences punishable under Sections 302, 307, 452, 447,
323, 147, 148 and 149 IPC, the Trial Court without ensuring the presence of the accused proceeded
to examine PW/3, PW/4, PW/12, PW/13, PW/14, PW/15, PW/17, PW/18, PW/20 and PW/23,
respectively on 13.02.2015, 13.08.2015, 03.09.2015, 09.10.2015, 05.11.2015, 08.03.2016,
12.05.2016, 20.06.2016, 14.02.2017, 22.11.2016 and 14.02.2017 and after recording conviction
proceeded to impose the sentence of death penalty. The High Court of Rajasthan in reference under
Section 366 Cr.P.C. taking note of the fact that despite objection of the defence counsel (raised at
initial stage) the Trial Court proceeded to record the evidence of 12 witnesses. While posing the issue
as to whether the entire trial should be declared vitiated or that the matter be remanded to the Trial
Court for recording the statements of these witnesses afresh by exercising powers under Section 391
Cr.P.C. or that the The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal
No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh impugned judgment
should be set aside and the de novo trial be directed by exercising power under Section 386(b)
Cr.P.C., directed that to do complete justice to the accused as well as to the victims, directed:
"........It is hereby directed that Trial Court shall summon and record the statements
of the witnesses PW-1 Chandu Ram, PW-2 Chandrakala, PW-3 Surendra Singh,

PW-15 Sushila, PW-17 Dr. Arun Tungariya, PW-18 Ram Pratap, PW-20 Sahab Singh
and PW-23 Ramesh Kumar afresh after securing presence of the accused in the
Court. Upon remand, the Trial Court shall conduct the proceedings on a day to day
basis and shall, after recording the statements of the witnesses afresh in the above
terms, re-examine the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C.; provide them a
justifiable/proper opportunity of leading defence and decide the case afresh and as
per law within four months from the date of receipt of copy of this judgment."
(11) On its challenge before the Supreme Court, the order was upheld. Their Lordships were pleased
to hold:
"18. Section 273 opens with the expression "Except as otherwise expressly
provided..." By its very nature, the exceptions to the application of Section 273 must
be those which are expressly provided in the Code. Shri Hegde is right in his
submission in that behalf. Sections 299 and 317 are such express exceptions provided
in the Code. In the circumstances mentioned in said Sections 299 and 317, the
contents of which need no further elaboration, the Courts would be justified in
recording evidence in the absence of the accused. Under its latter part, Section 273
also provides for a situation in which evidence could be recorded in the absence of
the accused, when it says "when his personal attendance is dispensed with, in the
presence of his pleader". There was a debate during the course of hearing in The State
of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019
Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh the present matter
whether such dispensation by the Court has to be express or could it be implied from
the circumstances. We need not go into these questions as the record clearly indicates
that an objection was raised by the Advocate appearing for the appellant's right at the
initial stage that the evidence was being recorded without ensuring the presence of
the appellants in Court. There was neither any willingness on the part of the
appellants nor any order or direction by the Trial Court that the evidence be recorded
in the absence of the appellants. The matter, therefore, would not come within the
scope of the latter part of Section 273 and it cannot be said that there was any
dispensation as contemplated by the said Section. We will, therefore, proceed on the
footing that there was no dispensation and yet the evidence was recorded without
ensuring the presence of the accused. The High Court was, therefore, absolutely right
in concluding that Section 273 stood violated in the present matter and that there was
an infringement of the salutary principle under Section 273. The submissions
advanced by Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Advocate, relying upon paragraphs in
Jayendra Vishnu Thakur Vs. State of Maharashtra and others, (2009) 7 SCC 104 as
quoted above, that the right of the accused to watch the prosecution witness is a
valuable right, also need not detain us. We accept that such a right is a valuable one
and there was an infringement in the present case. What is material to consider is the
effect of such infringement? Would it vitiate the trial or such an infringement is a
curable one?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111300735/ 8
Yogesh Nath @ Jogesh Nath vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 6 September, 2019
19. The emphasis was laid by Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate for the
State on the articles relied upon by him to submit that the theory of "harmless error"
which has been recognized in criminal jurisprudence and that there must be a remedial approach.
Again, we need not go into these broader concepts as the provisions of the Code, in our considered
view, are clearly indicative and lay down with clarity as to which infringements per se, would result
in vitiation of proceedings. Chapter XXXV of the Code deals with "Irregular Proceedings", and
Section 461 stipulates certain infringements or irregularities which vitiate proceedings. Barring
those stipulated in Section 461, the thrust of the Chapter is that any infringement or The State of
Madhya Pradesh Vs. Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @
Jogeshnath Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh irregularity would not vitiate the proceedings unless,
as a result of such infringement or irregularity, great prejudice had occasioned to the accused. Shri
Hegde, learned Senior Advocate was quick to rely on the passages in Jayendra Vishnu Thakur to
submit that the prejudice in such cases would be inherent or per se. Paragraphs 57 and 58 of said
decision were as under:-
"57. Mr. Naphade would submit that the appellant did not suffer any prejudice. We
do not agree. Infringement of such a valuable right itself causes prejudice. In S.L.
Kapoor v. Jagmohan, (1980) 4 SCC 379, this Court clearly held: (SCC p. 395, para
24) "24. ... In our view the principles of natural justice know of no exclusionary rule
dependent on whether it would have made any difference if natural justice had been
observed. The non-
observance of natural justice is itself prejudice to any man and proof of prejudice independently of
proof of denial of natural justice is unnecessary. It will comes from a person who has denied justice
that the person who has been denied justice is not prejudiced."
58. In A.R. Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602, a seven-Judge Bench of this Court has also
held that when an order has been passed in violation of a fundamental right or in breach of the
principles of natural justice, the same would be a nullity. (See also State of Haryana Vs. State of
Punjab, (2004) 12 SCC 673 and Rajasthan SRTC Vs. Zakir Hussain, (2005) 7 SCC 447."
20. The aforementioned observations in Jayendra Vishnu Thakur must be read in the peculiar
factual context of the matter. The accused Jayendra Vishnu Thakur was tried in respect of certain
offences in a Court in Delhi and at the same time he was also an accused in a trial under the
provisions of TADA Act [Terrorists and Anti Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987] in a Court
in Pune. The trial in the Court in Pune proceeded on the basis that Jayendra Vishnu Thakur was an
absconding accused. The evidence was thus led in the trial in Pune in his absence The State of
Madhya Pradesh Vs. Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @
Jogeshnath Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh when he was not sent up for trial, at the end of which
all the accused were acquitted. However, in an appeal arising therefrom, this Court convicted some
of the accused for offences with which they were tried. In the meantime, Jayendra Vishnu Thakur
was convicted by the Court in Delhi and was undergoing sentence imposed upon him. Later, he was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111300735/ 9
Yogesh Nath @ Jogesh Nath vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 6 September, 2019
produced before the Court in Pune with a supplementary charge-sheet and charges were framed
against him along with certain other accused. A request was made by the Public Prosecutor that the
evidence of some of the witnesses, which was led in the earlier trial be read in evidence in the fresh
trial against Jayendra Vishnu Thakur as those witnesses were either dead or not available to be
examined [Paras 8 and 9 of Jayendra Vishnu Thakur Vs. State of Maharashtra (supra)]. The request
was allowed which order of the Court in Pune was under challenge before this Court. It was found by
this Court that the basic premise for application of Section 299 of the Code was completely absent.
The Accused had not absconded. He was very much in confinement and could have been produced
in the earlier trial before the Court in Pune. Since the requirements of Section 299 were not
satisfied, the evidence led on the earlier occasion could not be taken as evidence in the subsequent
proceedings. The witnesses were not alive and could not be re-examined in the fresh trial nor could
there be cross-examination on behalf of the accused. If the evidence in the earlier trial was to be
read in the subsequent trial, the accused would be denied the opportunity of cross-examination of
the concerned witnesses. Thus, the prejudice was inherent. It is in this factual context that the
observations of this Court have to be considered. Same is not the situation in the present matter. It
is not the direction of the High Court to read the entire evidence on the earlier occasion as evidence
in the de novo trial. The direction is to re-examine those witnesses who were not examined in the
presence of the appellants. The direction now ensures the presence of the appellants in the Court, so
that they have every opportunity to watch the witnesses deposing in the trial and cross-examine said
witnesses. Since these basic requirements would be scrupulously observed and complied with, there
is no prejudice at all.

21. The learned Amicus Curiae was right in relying upon the provisions of Chapter XXVIII (Sections
366 to 371 of The Code) and Chapter XXIX (Sections 372 to 394 of The Code). He was also right in
saying that the Chapter XXVIII was more relevant in the present matter and the judgment of the
High Court was supported more strongly by provisions of Chapter XXVIII. The provisions of
Sections 366 to 368 and Sections 386 and 391 are quoted here for ready reference:-
"366. Sentence of death to be submitted by Court of Session for confirmation - (1)
When the Court of Session passes a sentence of death, the proceedings shall be
submitted to the High Court, and the sentence shall not be executed unless it is
confirmed by the High Court.
(2) The Court passing the sentence shall commit the convicted person to jail custody
under a warrant.
367. Power to direct further inquiry to be made or additional evidence to be taken -
(1) If, when such proceedings are submitted, the High Court thinks that a further
inquiry should be made into or additional evidence taken upon, any point bearing
upon the guilt or innocence of the convicted person, it may make such inquiry or take
such evidence itself, or direct it to be made or taken by the Court of Session.

(b) may annul the conviction, and convict the accused of any offence of which the
Court of Session might have convicted him, or order of a a new trial on the same or
an amended charge, or
(c) may acquit the accused person:
Provided that no order of confirmation shall be made under this section until the
period allowed for preferring an appeal has expired, or, if an appeal is presented
within such period, until such appeal is disposed of.
386. Powers of the Appellate Court. - After perusing such record and hearing the
appellant or his Pleader, if he appears, and in case of an appeal under Section 377 or
section 378, the accused, if he appears, the Appellate Court may, if it considers that
there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal, or may -

offence which is in its opinion the accused has committed, than might have been
inflicted for that offence by the Court passing the order or sentence under appeal.
391. Appellate Court may take further evidence or direct it to be taken - (1) In dealing
with any appeal under this Chapter, the Appellate Court, if it thinks additional
evidence to be necessary, shall record its reasons and may either take such evidence
itself, or direct it to be taken by a Magistrate, or when the Appellate Court is a High
Court, by a Court of Session or a Magistrate.
(2) When the additional evidence is taken by the Court of Session or the Magistrate, it or he shall
certify such evidence to the Appellate Court, and such Court shall thereupon proceed to dispose of
the appeal.
(3) The accused or his Pleader shall have the right to be present when the additional evidence is
taken.
(4) The taking of evidence under this section shall be The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Yogeshnath
@ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The State of
Madhya Pradesh subject to the provisions of Chapter XXIII, as if it were an inquiry."
22. According to Section 366 when a Court of Sessions passes a sentence of death, the proceedings
must be submitted to the High Court and the sentence of death is not to be executed unless it is
confirmed by the High Court. Section 367 then proceeds to lay down the power of the High Court to
direct further enquiry to be made or additional evidence to be taken. Section 368, thereafter, lays
down the power of the High Court to confirm the sentence so imposed or annul the conviction. One
of the powers which the High Court can exercise is one under Section 368(c) of the Code and that is
to "acquit the accused person". Pertinently, the power to acquit the person can be exercised by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111300735/ 12
Yogesh Nath @ Jogesh Nath vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 6 September, 2019
High Court even without there being any substantive appeal on the part of the accused challenging
his conviction. To that extent the proceedings under Chapter XXVIII which deals with "submission
of death sentences for confirmation" is a proceeding in continuation of the trial. These provisions
thus entitle the High Court to direct further enquiry or to take additional evidence and the High
Court may, in a given case, even acquit the accused person. The scope of the chapter is wider.
Chapter XXIX of the Code deals with "Appeals". Section 391 also entitles the Appellate Court to take
further evidence or direct such further evidence to be taken. Section 386 then enumerates powers of
the Appellate Court which inter alia includes the power to "reverse the finding and sentence and
acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction
subordinate to such Appellate Court or committed for trial". The powers of Appellate Court are
equally wide. The High Court in the present case was exercising powers both under Chapters XXVIII
and XXIX of the Code. If the power can go to the extent of ordering a complete re-trial, the exercise
of power to a lesser extent namely ordering de novo examination of twelve witnesses with further
directions as the High Court has imposed in the present matter, was certainly within the powers of
the High Court. There is, thus, no infraction or jurisdictional error on the part of the High Court.
23. It is true that as consistently laid down by this Court, an The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.
Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The
State of Madhya Pradesh order of retrial of a criminal case is not to be taken resort to easily and
must be made in exceptional cases. For example, it was observed by this Court in Pandit Ukha Kolhe
Vs. State of Maharashtra, as under:-
"15. An order for retrial of a criminal case is made in exceptional cases, and not
unless the Appellate Court is satisfied that the Court trying the proceeding had no
jurisdiction to try it or that the trial was vitiated by serious illegalities or irregularities
or on account of misconception of the nature of the proceedings and on that account
in substance there had been no real trial or that the Prosecutor or an accused was, for
reasons over which he had no control, prevented from leading or tendering evidence
material to the charge, and in the interests of justice the Appellate Court deems it
appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the accused should
be put on his trial again. An order of re-trial wipes out from the record the earlier
proceeding, and exposes the person accused to another trial which affords the
prosecutor an opportunity to rectify the infirmities disclosed in the earlier trial, and
will not ordinarily be countenanced when it is made merely to enable the prosecutor
to lead evidence which he could but has not cared to lead either on account of
insufficient appreciation of the nature of the case or for other reasons. Harries, C.J.,
in Ramanlal Rathi Vs. The State, AIR (1951) Cal. 305. "If at the end of a criminal
prosecution the evidence leaves the Court in doubt as to the guilt of the accused the
latter is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. A retrial may be ordered when the original
trial has not been satisfactory for particular reasons, for example, if evidence had
been wrongly rejected which should have been admitted, or admitted when it should
have been rejected, or the Court had refused to hear certain witness who should have
been heard. But retrial cannot be ordered on the ground that the prosecution did not
produce the proper evidence and did not know how to prove their case."

24. The order passed by the High Court in the present The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Yogeshnath
@ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The State of
Madhya Pradesh matter was not to enable the Prosecutor to rectify the defects or infirmities in the
evidence or to enable him to lead evidence which he had not cared to lead on the earlier occasion.
The evidence in the form of testimony of those twelve witnesses was led and those witnesses were
cross- examined. There was no infirmity except the one that the evidence was not led in the presence
of the appellants. The remedy proposed was only to rectify such infirmity, and not to enable the
Prosecutor to rectify defects in the evidence.
25. We must also consider the matter from the stand point and perspective of the victims as
suggested by the learned Amicus Curiae. Four persons of a family were done to death. It is certainly
in the societal interest that the guilty must be punished and at the same time the procedural
requirements which ensure fairness in trial must be adhered to. If there was an infraction, which
otherwise does not vitiate the trial by itself, the attempt must be to remedy the situation to the
extent possible, so that the interests of the accused as well as societal interest are adequately
safeguarded. The very same witnesses were directed to be de novo examined which would ensure
that the interest of the prosecution is sub-served and at the same time the accused will have every
right and opportunity to watch the witnesses deposing against them, watch their demeanor and
instruct their Counsel properly so that said witnesses can be effectively cross-examined. In the
process, the interest of the accused would also stand protected. On the other hand, if we were to
accept the submission that the proceedings stood vitiated and, therefore, the High Court was
powerless to order de novo examination of the concerned witnesses, it would result in great
miscarriage of justice. The persons who are accused of committing four murders would not
effectively be tried. The evidence against them would not be read for a technical infraction resulting
in great miscarriage. Viewed thus, the order and directions passed by the High Court completely
ensure that a fair procedure is adopted and the depositions of the witnesses, after due distillation
from their cross-examination can be read in evidence.
26. We, therefore, see no reason to interfere with the order passed and the directions issued by the
High Court in the The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal
No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh present matter. We
affirm the view taken by the High Court and dismiss these appeals. The restraint which we had
placed on the Trial Court not to pronounce the judgment hereby stands vacated. The Trial Court is
now free to take the matter to its logical conclusion. Let a copy of this Order be immediately
transmitted to the concerned Trial Court."
(12) In the case at hand, it is borne out from the record that prosecution examined its witnesses on
08.11.2017 in absence of the accused/appellant when Dr. J.P. Sonkar (PW-6), Dr. Heeralal Manjhi
(PW-7), Nathu Singh Rajawat (PW-8) and Preetam Prajapati (PW-9) were present. Dr. J.P. Sonkar
(PW-6), Dr. Heeralal Manjhi (PW-7) were examined and cross-examined on 08.11.2017 while Nathu
Singh Rajawat (PW-8) and Preetam Prajapati (PW-9) were examined before the Court on
08.11.2017. On 20.03.2018, prosecution examined its witness Vijay Saxena (PW-19) and was
cross-examined also. On 06.04.2018, Rambabu Nagar (PW-20) was examined, cross-examined and
re-examined in the absence of accused.

Yogesh Nath @ Jogesh Nath vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 6 September, 2019
(13) In the light of the law laid down in the case of Atma Ram & Ors. (supra) wherein it has been
held that Section 273 opens with the expression "Except as otherwise expressly provided..." and the
only exception is that if accused remained absent for the circumstances mentioned in Sections 299
and 317 of Cr.P.c., no examination and cross-examination of the witnesses could have been
undertaken.
Record reveals that on these three dates viz., 08.11.2017, 20.03.2018 The State of Madhya Pradesh
Vs. Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath & Criminal Appeal No.6086/2019 Yogeshnath @ Jogeshnath Vs. The
State of Madhya Pradesh and 06.04.2018, none of the circumstances as provided in Section 299
and/or 317 Cr.P.C. were available. Therefore, learned Trial Court erred in proceedings with these
witnesses overlooking the mandatory provision contained in Section 273 Cr.P.C.
(14) For these reasons, matter is remanded to the Fifth Additional Sessions Judge & Special Judge
[Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012], Gwalior (M.P.) to cause examination,
cross-
examination and re-examination of prosecution witnesses, namely, Dr. J.P. Sonkar (PW-6), Dr.
Heeralal Manjhi (PW-7), Nathu Singh Rajawat (PW-8), Preetam Prajapati (PW-9), Vijay Saxena
(PW-19) & Rambabu Nagar (PW-20) and then to record statement of accused under Section 313
Cr.P.C. Thereafter, the Trial Court shall pronounce the judgment.
(15) We hope and trust that the Trial Court shall complete the proceedings within a period of three
months from the date of receipt of the judgment. Let a copy of judgment along with the record be
transmitted forthwith to the Trial Court.
(16) The reference and appeal are disposed of finally in above terms.
