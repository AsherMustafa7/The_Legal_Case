JUDGMENT
1. By the medium of instant petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
petitioner seeks quashment of FIR No. 0007 of 2021 dated 28.02.2021 for the commission of
offences punishable under sections 498-A,109, 201 IPC r/w Section 4 of the Muslim Women
(Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 registered with Police Station Women Cell Gandhi
Nagar Jammu against the petitioner on the complaint of respondent No.2, as well as the charge
sheet pending before the Court of learned Electricity Magistrate Jammu arising out of the said FIR.
2. It is averred, that in view of the failed matrimonial alliance between the petitioner and respondent
No.2, the marriage broke and the petitioner was forced to execute a lawful divorce upon her; that
out of vengeance and ill will, respondent No.2 lodged impugned FIR against the petitioner which
culminated in filing of the charge sheet against the petitioner alongwith another co-accused u/s
498-A, 109 IPC r/w Section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019;
that the learned Electricity Magistrate Jammu took cognizance of the matter, however, in absence of
any material on the file to support the accusations made against the co-accused, he was discharged
while the petitioner was ordered to stand trial under the aforementioned offences; that during
pendency of all these proceedings a compromise was arrived at between petitioner and respondent
No.2 and accordingly a compromise deed dated 31.05.2022 was executed between them wherein in
para 10 of the Compromise Deed it has been stated that the parties shall have no cause of action left
to institute any proceedings of any kind or nature of civil or criminal nature against each other
arising out of their relationship extinguished by virtue of the Divorce Deed; that in view of the
amicable outside court settlement and compromise between the parties, the FIR and all the
proceedings arising there from be quashed.

3. The parties have entered into compromise and settled their disputes and differences, however, the
chargesheet is pending before the Court of learned Electricity Magistrate Jammu arising out of
impugned FIR registered against the petitioner. Consequently, a compromise deed dated
31.05.2022 duly attested before the Notary Jammu has been placed on record to support the
averments of the petition. Instant petition is supported by affidavits of the petitioner and
respondent No.1.
4. Pursuant to the order dated 01.03.2023, the Registrar Judicial of this court has recorded the
statements of the parties on oath, the same are placed on record, which read as under:-
Statement of Murtaza Sadeeq Khan (petitioner); Age; 37 years; S/o Mohd. Sadeeq
Khan; R/o Village Kotan, Tehsil Mendhar, District Poonch on oath today i.e
01.03.2023;
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all issues and disputes with Sehrish Choudhary
(respondent no.2) and have also dissolved marriage with her. A compromise deed
dated 31.05.2022 duly attested and registered on 31.05.2022, has also been executed
between us in this regard and photocopy of the same is also placed on the record of
the file. In view of our amicable settlement and dissolution of marriage, I pray before
the Hon'ble Court to quash FIR No. 0007/2021 lodged at Police Station, Women Cell,
Gandhi Nagar, Jammu for commission of offences u/s 498-
A/109 IPC and section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, and
chargesheet which is pending adjudication before the Court of Learned Electricity Magistrate
Jammu. Statement of Sehrish Choudhary (respondent No.2); Age; 38 years; D/o Abdul Majeed R/o
Ramzanpura, Near Eidgah, Janipur, District Jammu on oath today i.e 01.03.2023;
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all issues and disputes with Murtaza Sadeeq Khan (petitioner)
and have also dissolved marriage with him. A compromise deed dated 31.05.2022 duly attested and
registered on 31.05.2022, has also been executed between us in this regard and photocopy of the
same is also placed on the record of the file. In view of our amicable settlement and dissolution of
marriage, I have no objection in case Hon'ble Court quashes FIR No. 0007/2021 lodged at Police
Station, Women Cell, Gandhi Nagar, Jammu for commission of offences u/s 498-A/109 IPC and
section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, and chargesheet which
is pending adjudication before the Court of Learned Electricity Magistrate Jammu.
5. Bare perusal of the statements of petitioner and respondent No.2 placed on record demonstrate
that the parties have entered into a compromise whereby they have settled their disputes/issues, so
there would be no chance of conviction in near future in case trial is held and concluded.
6. The Apex Court in the case of "B. S. Joshi & others Vs State of Haryana and another", reported in
(2003) 4 SCC 675, while discussing the ambit and scope of inherent powers of High Courts under
Section 482 CPC in paras 1, 3, 11, 14, 15 and 16 held as under :

Murtaza Sadeeq Khan vs Ut Of J&K & Anr on 27 March, 2023
"1.The question that falls for determination in the instant case is about the ambit of
the inherent powers of the High Courts under Section 482, Code of Criminal
Procedure (Code) read with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India to
quash criminal proceedings. The scope and ambit of power under Section 482 has
been examined by this Court in catena of earlier decisions but in the present case that
is required to be considered in relation to matrimonial disputes. The matrimonial
disputes of the kind in the present case have been on considerable increase in recent
times resulting in filing of complaints by the wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC
not only against the husband but his other family members also. When such matters
are resolved either by wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or mutual
separation of husband and wife and also mutual settlement of other pending disputes
as a result whereof both sides approach the High Court and jointly pray for quashing
of the criminal proceedings or the First Information Report or complaint filed by the
wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC, can the prayer be declined on the ground
that since the offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code and,
therefore, it is not permissible for the Court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR
or complaint.
3.The High Court has, by the impugned judgment, dismissed the petition filed by the
appellants seeking quashing of the FIR for in view of the High Court the offences
under Sections 498A and 406 IPC are non-compoundable and the inherent powers
under Section 482 of the Code cannot be invoked to bypass the mandatory provision
of Section 320 of the Code. For its view, the High Court has referred to and relied
upon the decisions of this Court in State of Haryana & Ors. v. Bhajan Lal & Ors. [1992
Supp.(1) SCC 335]; Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra [(1977) 4 SCC 551;
and Surendra Nath Mohanty & Anr. v. State of Orissa [AIR 1999 SC 2181].
11.In Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia & Ors. v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre & Ors.
[(1988) 1 SCC 692], it was held that while exercising inherent power of quashing
under Section 482, it is for the High Court to take into consideration any special
features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in
the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. Where, in the opinion of
the Court, chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful
purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the
court may, while taking into consideration the special facts of a case, also quash the
proceedings.
14.There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX-A containing Section
498A in the Indian Penal Code was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband
or by relatives of her husband. Section 498A was added with a view to punishing a
husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives
to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be
counterproductive and would act against interests of women and against the object
for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128105803/ 3
Murtaza Sadeeq Khan vs Ut Of J&K & Anr on 27 March, 2023
inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent
women from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA of Indian Penal
Code.
15.In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court in exercise of its
inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section
320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code.
16.For the foregoing reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment and allow the
appeal and quash the FIR above mentioned."
7. Ratio of the judgment of B. S. Joshi's case (supra) makes the legal proposition abundantly clear,
that the High Court has inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to
quash the proceedings even in non-compoundable offences to meet the ends of justice if the parties
have settled their disputes amicably by a compromise. Ratio of the judgment (supra) is squarely
applicable to the facts of the case in hand. In the case in hand, petitioner and respondent No.2 by a
mutual compromise deed dated 31.05.2022 duly attested and registered with Notary Jammu, have
dissolved their marriage, and by the said mutual compromise, respondent No.2 has no objection in
quashment of FIR No. 0007/2021 registered by her against petitioner in police station women cell
Gandhi Nagar Jammu for commission of offences u/ss 498-A/109 IPC r/w Section 4 of Muslim
Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019. In view of the above, instant petition stands
allowed. Consequently, FIR No. 0007 of 2021 registered with Police Station Women Cell Gandhi
Nagar Jammu for the commission of offences punishable under sections 498-A, 109 IPC r/w section
4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 against the petitioner
alongwith all the proceedings arising out of the said FIR pending in the Court of learned Electricity
Magistrate Jammu, in view of compromise arrived at between the parties, stand quashed. Copy of
this judgment be forthwith provided to the Court below/ concerned police station for information
and compliance.
8. Disposed of accordingly.
