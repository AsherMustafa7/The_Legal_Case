4. Personal liberty of a citizen of India is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of
India and is not to be fiddled with by pre- conceived impression on the part of the detention
authority even if a citizen has come to suffer registration of criminal cases against him. The power of
preventive detention is vested with the detention authority that only in a given case which meets the
requirements of the mandate of law prescribing for detention then only a citizen can be subjected to
suffer loss of his personal liberty. The present case, however, is the one in which by reference to
three FIRs i.e. FIR no. 8/2014 under section 341/323/34 registered with Police Station, Bakshi
Nagar, Jammu, FIR no. 62/2020 u/s 8/21/22/25/29 of the NDPS Act registered with Police Station,
Bakshi Nagar, Jammu and the third FIR no. 39 of 2021 under section 8/21/22 of the NDPS Act
registered with Police Station, Bakshi Nagar, Jammu that the Senior Superintendent of Police,
ANTF, J&K Jammu reckoned in August 2022 the petitioner deserving to suffer detention and as
such he came to prepare a dossier which came to be laid before the respondent no. 2-Divisional
Commissioner, Jammu.
5. Law and enforcement agencies acting under the preventive detention legal regime are well within
their right to put up a case for seeking preventive detention of a Subject under the Prevention of
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 but CM Nos.1278 &
1279/2021 the application of mind whether to lend approval to the request of the Law and Order
Enforcement Agency is vested with the detention authority with a purpose so that the detention
authority is able to detach itself with any pre-conceived impression which the sponsoring law and
order enforcement agency carried with respect to the Subject and as such, the application of mind
on the part of the detention authority is not and cannot be a matter of simply going through motions
and coming forward with cyclostyled order of detention just with change of signatory thereto.
6. In this case, the last FIR against the petitioner is FIR no. 39 of 2021 dated 26.02.2021 whereas
the dossier submitted by the Senior Superintendent of Police, ANTF, J&K, Jammu is dated
29.08.2022 meaning thereby there is a time interval of 18 months before the laying of dossier by
Senior Superintendent of Police, ANTF, J&K Jammu, the petitioner had come to be bailed out by the
trial courts which are seized of the cases qua aforesaid three FIRs. There is no reference to the fact
on the record of the case that the petitioner ever breached any of the term and condition of his bail
bond. There is no act of omission and commission alleged against the petitioner from the date of
registration of FIR no. 39 of 2021 dated 26.02.2021 to the date of laying of dossier by Senior
Superintendent of Police, ANTF, J&K Jammu whereby the petitioner could be said to have resorted
to his alleged purported habitual tendency vis-Ã -vis the offences under the Prevention of Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. Thus, the aforesaid three FIRs are
the only CM Nos.1278 & 1279/2021 basis upon which the Senior Superintendent of Police, ANTF,
J&K Jammu and the detention authority i.e. Divisional Commissioner, Jammu chose to act upon
and subject the petitioner to suffer loss of his personal liberty.
7. Exercise of power on the part of the Divisional Commissioner, Jammu is nothing but mechanical
in nature and is thus antithesis to the fundamental right to personal liberty and dignity of a citizen
of India. If the petitioner would be found guilty of commission of offences for which he is facing trial
before the criminal courts then the petitioner would be suffering the sentences deserving against
him but till that happens the preventive detention cannot come in between as a substitute for the

purpose of inflicting punishment upon the petitioner by reference to aforesaid three FIRs as such,
the impugned detention order no. PITNDPS 10 of 2022 dated 06.09.2022 passed by the respondent
no. 2-Divisional Commissioner, Jammu read with consequential order of confirmation of detention
order of the petitioner is quashed. The petitioner is restored to his personal liberty and be released
forthwith from the place of his lodgement by reference to the impugned detention order.
8. Disposed of accordingly. Record be returned back by the Registry against proper receipt.
