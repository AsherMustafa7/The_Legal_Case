Jitendra Chaudhary vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
3. The prosecution case, in brief, is that the informant Jitendra Chaudhary, resident of village
Khojachak, Purandarpur, Ekangasarai police station states that on Thursday, May 31, 2018, at 4:00
am, his mother Ramrati Devi, went to the western courtyard of the house to take out the buffalo and
saw his father Bindu Chaudhary, groaning in pain. Hearing his groans, his mother began shouting.
Upon hearing her cries, Jitendra Chaudhary came out of the house and saw his father covered in
blood. Meanwhile, he saw some people, running from the north side of the house. He turned on his
torch and saw that the fleeing individuals were accused Ajay Chaudhary, Sunaina Devi and Asha
Devi. The prosecution claims that these three individuals murdered the informant's father, Bindu
Chaudhary, by slitting his throat with a sharp weapon. The prosecution states that the reason for the
incident was land dispute and the informant alleges that the accused wanted to usurp his family's
property.
4. On the basis of written statement of the informant, Ekangarsarai P.S. Case No. 113 of 2018 was
instituted under Sections 302/34 of Indian Penal Code and investigation was Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 taken up by the police. The police after investigation
submitted charge-sheet against Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and, accordingly, cognizance was taken.
Thereafter the case was committed to the Court of Sessions. Charges were framed against the
accused persons to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
5. During the trial, the prosecution examined altogether nine prosecution witnesses i.e. PW1-
Ramrati Devi, PW2- Kaleshwar Chaudhary, PW3- Raju Chaudhary, PW4- Jagdish Chaudhary, PW5-
Pappu Chaudhary, PW6- Gagan Chaudhary, PW7- Jitendra Chaudhary, PW8- Dr. Pramod Kumar
Singh and PW9- Dinesh Kumar Malakar. The prosecution has also produced certain documents
which were marked as 'Exhibits' i.e., Exhibit 1- the signature of PW 6 on the carbon copy of the
death inquiry report, Exhibit 2- written application, Exhibit 3- the signature of PW 7, Exhibit 4-
Hand writing and signature of the post-mortem report, Exhibit 5- report marked by the Station
House Office on the written application, Exhibit 6- Signature of the Station House Officer on the
formal FIR, Exhibit 7- death inquiry report and Exhibit 8- Handwriting and signature of the
charge-sheet. The defence has also examined two witnesses viz. DW1 Saryug Chaudhary and DW2
Nageshwar Prasad. After closure of prosecution evidence, the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 statements of the accused persons were recorded under Section 313
Cr.P.C. and after conclusion of trial, learned trial Court has acquitted the accused persons.
6. The learned trial Court on the basis of the materials available on record, and the evidence
produced before the Court, acquitted the accused persons observing that even though the
informant's house is centrally located in the village and the ensuing commotion, no other villager
witnessed or pursued the accused. Furthermore, the accused remained at their residence and
continued their daily activities immediately following the incident. In light of these circumstances, it
is evident that they point towards the innocence of the accused and the prosecution has falsely
implicated the accused due to previous enmity. The learned trial Court further observed that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove the case beyond the shadow of reasonable doubts against
the accused persons under trial.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the learned trial Court has miserably failed
to appreciate that prosecution has established the complete chain of circumstances pointing
exclusively towards the guilt of the accused and has fully proved that motive for commission of the
alleged occurrence by the accused.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025
8. The learned counsel for the State has submitted that there is no perversity in the judgment of the
learned trial court, and the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused before the learned
trial Court.
9. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and the State and have also gone through the
records of the case.
10. The sole question that requires consideration by this Court is whether the impugned judgment
requires any interference by this Court.
11.On meticulous examination of evidence available on record, this Court finds substantial
infirmities in the prosecution case which go to the root of the allegations.
12. It is evident from the FIR that there is no eyewitness to the actual assault on the deceased. The
informant (PW7), who is the son of the deceased stated in F.I.R. that PW1 (wife of the deceased) was
the first to reach the place of occurrence. However, the F.I.R. does not indicate that she witnessed
the assault. Contrarily, during the trial, PW1 claimed to have seen the assault being committed. Such
a contradiction between the FIR and the trial testimony reflects an attempt to embellish the
prosecution case. Where the trial testimony introduces facts absent in the FIR, it becomes unsafe to
rely Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 upon such statements without
independent corroboration.
13. The Investigating Officer has categorically deposed that none of the witnesses recorded during
investigation claimed to have seen the cutting of the throat of the deceased. This fact, underscores
the absence of direct ocular evidence and confirms that the prosecution case rests primarily on
conjecture rather than concrete proof.
14. The post-mortem report indicates the presence of rigor mortis in all four limbs at 11:05 a.m.,
approximately seven hours after the alleged occurrence which took place at 4-4:30 a.m. The
development of rigor mortis in all limbs suggests that death may have occurred 16-17 hours prior to
the post-mortem. Moreover, the post-mortem notes that the time elapsed since death was
approximately 24 hours.
15. These observations are inconsistent with the prosecution's narrative of the time of occurrence,
casting further doubt on the reliability of the evidence regarding the timing of the alleged assault.
The inconsistencies between the alleged time of occurrence and medico-legal findings are material
and cannot be overlooked.

16. The informant (PW7) claimed to have identified the accused while they allegedly fled in
torchlight. However, the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 informant
did not mention whether the accused were armed. No weapon was recovered during the
investigation, and consequently, there is no evidence to establish that any instrument was used in
the commission of the alleged offense. This further weakens the prosecution's case.
17. All independent witnesses, as confirmed by the Investigating Officer, admitted that they did not
witness the occurrence. Additionally, the prosecution case appears to have been developed
subsequent to the incident in a manner influenced by an admitted property dispute between the
parties. This indicates a potential ulterior motive in implicating the accused.
18. The prosecution's case, being devoid of direct evidence, is largely circumstantial. As established
in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (1984) 4 SCC 116, Paragraph Nos.
153 and 154 of the judgment reads as under:
"153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must
be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established:
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
fully established.
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned "must or should"
and not "may be" established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 distinction between "may be proved" and "must be or should be
proved" as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra [(1973) 2 SCC
793 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 1033 : 1973 Crl LJ 1783] where the observations were made: [SCC para 19, p.
807:
SCC (Cri) p. 1047] "Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and
not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between
'may be' and 'must be' is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions."
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt
of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis
except that the accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive
nature and tendency, (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the
one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to
leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by
the accused.
154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case
based on circumstantial evidence."

Jitendra Chaudhary vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
19. In the instant case, the contradictions in witness statements, absence of direct ocular evidence,
inconsistencies in post-mortem findings, unrecovered weapon, and possible ulterior motive
collectively indicate that the prosecution has failed to establish a complete and unbroken chain of
events pointing to the guilt of the accused.
20. In light of the above, the Court observes that the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.29 of 2022
dt.25-09-2025 prosecution has failed to prove the allegations against the accused beyond reasonable
doubt. The inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence, both oral and medico-legal,
significantly undermine the veracity of the prosecution case. Accordingly, the benefit of doubt must
be extended to the accused.
21. We find that the findings recorded by the learned trial Court do not suffer from any illegality and
perversity. In a criminal case, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused
beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Wherever, any doubt is cast upon the case of the
prosecution, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt.
22. In criminal appeal against acquittal what the Appellate Court has to examine is whether the
finding of the learned court below is perverse and prima facie illegal. Once the Appellate Court
comes to the finding that the grounds on which the judgment is based is not perverse, the scope of
appeal against acquittal is limited considering the fact that the legal presumption about the
innocence of the accused is further strengthened by the finding of the Court. At this point, it is
imperative to consider the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrinal Das vs. State
of Tripura reported in Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 (2011) 9 SCC
479, Paragraph Nos. 13 & 14 of which read as under:
"13. It is clear that in an appeal against acquittal in the absence of perversity in the
judgment and order, interference by this Court exercising its extraordinary
jurisdiction, is not warranted. However, if the appeal is heard by an appellate court, it
being the final court of fact, is fully competent to reappreciate, reconsider and review
the evidence and take its own decision. In other words, the law does not prescribe any
limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and the appellate court
is free to arrive at its own conclusion keeping in mind that acquittal provides for
presumption in favour of the accused. The presumption of innocence is available to
the person and in criminal jurisprudence every person is presumed to be innocent
unless he is proved guilty by the competent court. If two reasonable views are
possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb
the findings of acquittal.
14. There is no limitation on the part of the appellate court to review the evidence
upon which the order of acquittal is found and to come to its own conclusion. The
appellate court can also review the conclusion arrived at by the trial court with
respect to both facts and law. While dealing with the appeal against acquittal
preferred by the State, it is the duty of the appellate court to marshal the entire
evidence on record and only by giving cogent and adequate reasons set aside the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/17845666/ 5
Jitendra Chaudhary vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
judgment of acquittal. An order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there
are "compelling and substantial reasons" for doing so. If the order is "clearly
unreasonable", it is a compelling reason for interference.........."
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025
23. In Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar & Ors. vs. State of Karnataka reported in 2024 SCC Online
SC 561, Hon'ble Supreme Court, after referring to relevant precedents, has observed as follows:
"41. Thus, it is beyond the pale of doubt that the scope of interference by an appellate
Court for reversing the judgment of acquittal recorded by the trial Court in favour of
the accused has to be exercised within the four corners of the following principles:
41.1. That the judgment of acquittal suffers from patent perversity;
41.2. That the same is based on a misreading/omission to consider material evidence
on record;
41.3. That no two reasonable views are possible and only the view consistent with the
guilt of the accused is possible from the evidence available on record.
42. The appellate Court, in order to interfere with the judgment of acquittal would
have to record pertinent findings on the above factors if it is inclined to reverse the
judgment of acquittal rendered by the trial Court."
24. Thus, an order of acquittal is to be interfered with only for compelling and substantial reasons.
In case if the order is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for interference. But where
there is no perversity in the finding of the impugned judgment of acquittal, the Appellate Court must
not take a different view only because another view is possible. It is because the trial Court has the
privilege of seeing the demeanour of witnesses and, therefore, its decision must not be upset in
absence of strong and compelling grounds.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.29 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025
25. In view of the above, we do not find any illegality and perversity in the findings recorded by the
trial Court.
26. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed.
27. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
