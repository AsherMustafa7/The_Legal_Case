Subsequently, the respondent has deposited the cheque in the year 2014. Therefore, according to the
learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, when the cheque was deposited, there was no existing
debt or liability on that date, since the alleged loan itself has become time barred.
3.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would further submit that the respondent refers
to an agreement on 04.02.2014. Even though the respondent refers to the said agreement, the
respondent does not even state as to what was the amount that was agreed to be paid by the
petitioner to the respondent. Therefore, except for a bare statement to the effect that there was an
agreement on the part of the petitioner to pay an amount, there is nothing to indicate as to what was
the amount that was agreed to be paid by the petitioner to the respondent. http://www.judis.nic.in

4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner further brought to the notice of this Court the suit
that was filed by the petitioner in O.S.1255 of 2014, on the file of the District Munsif Court,
Trichirappalli, against the respondent for mandatory injunction, directing the respondent to return
the cheques. In the schedule of property, the cheque, which is the subject matter of the complaint
under Section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act, is also referred (Cheque 393867).
5.According to the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, after the summons was issued in the
suit, the respondent has in a hasty manner proceeded to file a complaints under Section 138
Negotiable Instruments Act against the petitioner.
6.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the action on the part of the
respondent is clearly an abuse of process of Court.
7.The respondent has been served in this case and he is neither present in person nor represented by
the counsel. Even http://www.judis.nic.in Crl.O.P.(MD)21135 of 2016 today, the name of the
respondent has been printed in the cause list and there is no representation for the respondent.
8.This Court has carefully considered the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for
the petitioner.
9.This Court is of the considered view that debt that is sought to be claimed from the petitioner by
the respondent, is a time barred debt. Therefore, the time barred debt can never fall within the
requirements of Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, which talks about only an existing debt
or a liability. That apart, the respondent has gone ahead and filed this complaint in the year 2014,
after coming to know about the suit filed by the petitioner. Therefore, even according to the
averments made in the complaint, the respondent is not able to explain as to what happened during
the period from 2009 to 2014. The complaint is totally silent on this aspect.

10.In view of the above, this Court is of the considered view that the complaints itself are abuse of
process of Court and the same are liable to be quashed by this Court.
