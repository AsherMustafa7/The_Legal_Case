(KUSHAL SINGH SENGAR Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)
Jabalpur, Dated : 27-08-2019
Shri R.K. Verma, learned Senior Advocate with Shri Ram Murti Tiwari,
Advocate for petitioner.
Shri Dilip Pandey, learned Government Advocate for
respondents/State.
Petitioner has filed the present petition for review of order dated 06.08.2019 passed in Writ Petition
No.15274/2019. Writ petition filed by the petitioner was dismissed on the ground that same suffered
from delay and latches.
Counsel appearing for the State Government submitted that representation of the petitioner has
already been considered and decided on 18.09.2002.
On the basis of aforesaid submission, writ petition was dismissed as it suffered from delay and
latches. Petitioner has filed the petition after period of 17 years and no cause of action accrues to the
petitioner after passing of order dated 18.09.2002 though he may have give repeated representation
before the authorities.
The counsel appearing for the petitioner is seeking review of the order dated 06.08.2019 on the
ground that petitioner had made a representation in detail on 18.06.2019 which remain undecided,
therefore, writ petition was filed. Petitioner made no prayer for quashing of order dated 18.09.2002
therefore, there will be no delay and latches in filing of the writ petition. State being model employer
has to act with all fairness with all its employees. It was submitted that when a particular set of
employee is given relief then identically situated person should be treated alike by extending the
same benefit and not doing so would amount to discrimination and violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. It was submitted that the order dated 18.09.2002 is a non-speaking order and

2 RP-1174-2019 Learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the judgment of State of M.P. Vs. Bani
Singh i.e. representation preferred by an employee remain undecided for years together. The
employee cannot be held responsible for causing delay.
On the aforesaid ground, the petitioner made a prayer that order dated 06.08.2019 may be reviewed
and respondents be directed to decide the representation of the petitioner. In review petition,
petitioner has not controverted that his representation was not decided on 18.09.2002.
It was also submitted by the counsel for petitioner that he had filed a fresh representation in the
year 2019 and government may be directed to consider the representation.
It is also an admitted fact that some other employees were extended the benefit by order dated
08.08.2014 passed in W.P. No.11444/2014. It was only passing of this order that petitioner on
18.06.2019 had moved a representation before the State Government.
Learned counsel for the petitioner relied on 2003 (2) MPLJ 499. The said case lays down the scope
of review in CPC under Section 140 and under Order 47 Rule 1 of CPC. There is no quarrel with the
law laid down in the aforesaid judgment. In this case, second appeal was dismissed without giving
the reasons and therefore, review petition was filed. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
argued that any other sufficient reason which is mentioned in Order 47 Rule 1 of CPC will also
include order which are per incuriam and the order dated 18.09.2002 was per incuriam Petitioner
in its review petition has not stated that there was no delay on his part to prefer the representation
before the State Government. Petitioner only wants to press the issue that if some relief is granted to
other employees, then same relief may also be granted to him as the order which passed in his case
was per incuriam and the circular of the State Government was not considered therefore, he may
also be given same benefit and he may not be discriminated. It was submitted by the petitioner that
Government is a model 3 RP-1174-2019 employer therefore, he is also entitled to review. On
aforesaid grounds, petitioner made a prayer for review of the order.
The petition filed by the petitioner is dismissed from delay and latches. Petitioner took no action
after his representation was decided and it is also a trite law that after rejection of representation if
fresh representations are filed that will not give him any cause of action.
Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that order dated 18.09.2002 is per incuriam and same
is passed by the authority without considering the circular of 19.07.1973 and 13.05.1993, the same is
not binding and therefore, order dated 18.09.2002 was not required to be challenged in the writ
petition. A decision is given per incuriam when the Court has acted in ignorance of previous decision
of its own or of a Coordinate jurisdiction which covered the case before it. Per incuriam has also
been defined as in ignorance of a decision or decision given in ignorance of the terms of statute or
rule having statutory force. Apex Court in case of Government of Andhra Pradesh and another Vs. B.
Satyanarayana Rao (dead by LRs) reported in 2000 (4) SCC 262 observed as under;
"The rule of per incuriam can be applied where Court omits to consider a binding
precedent of the same Court or superior Court rendered on the same issue or where a

Court omits to consider any statute while deciding that issue."
Similarly, in Constitutional Bench judgments of Apex Court in matter o f Union of India Vs.
Raghubir Singh; (1989) 2 SCC 754, the Chief Justice observed as under:
"the doctrine of binding precedent has the merit of promoting a certainty and
consistency in judicial decisions, and enables an organic development of law, besides
providing assurance to the individual as to the consequence of transaction forming
part of his daily affairs. And, therefore, the need for a clear and consistent
enunciation of legal principle in the decisions of a Court."
A lower Court is free, however, to depart from and earlier judgment of a superior Court where that
earlier judgment was decided per incuriam. Also 4 RP-1174-2019 the doctrine of per incuriam is an
exception to Article 141 of the Constitution of India which embodies the doctrine of precedents as a
matter of law.
In view of aforesaid, it is clear that Rule of per incuriam is applicable in respect of judgment passed
by the Court and same will not be applicable in case of orders passed by administrative authorities.
Order dated 18.09.2002 was not challenged before the Court of law and same has attained finality.
Hon'ble Apex Court has consistently rejected the contention that petition should be considered
ignoring the delay and latches. In this case, petitioner has approached this Court after coming to
know of relief granted by this Court in a similar case. A litigant cannot wake up from deep slumber
and claim impetus from the judgment in cases where some diligent persons had approached the
Court within a reasonable time. In case mentioned above reference was made to the case of Root
Diamonds Vs. Union of India; (1989) 2 SCC 356, State of Karnataka Vs. S.M. Kottaraya; (1996) 6
SCC 267, Jagdish Lal Vs. State of Haryana; (1997) 6 SCC 538.
In view of the aforesaid, petition filed by the petitioner i.e. W.P. No.15274/2019 suffered from delay
and latches and also from defect of not challenging the order dated 18.09.2002. Resultantly, the
petition was dismissed.
No ground of review is made out by the petitioner and resultantly, this review petition is dismissed.
C.C. as per rules.
