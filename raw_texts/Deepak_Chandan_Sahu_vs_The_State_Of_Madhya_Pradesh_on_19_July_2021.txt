Jabalpur, Dated 19/07/2021
Shri Mayank Sharma, learned counsel for the
appellants.
Shri Anoop Sonkar, learned Panel Lawyer for the
State.
Heard on I.A.Nos.13674/2020 & 13678/2020, third
applications on behalf appellant Deepak @ Chandan
Sahu in Cr.A.No.1217/2017 and on behalf of appellant
Kanhaiya Sahu in Cr.A.No.1232/2017 respectively for
suspension of jail sentence and grant of bail.
The appellants stand convicted for the offence
punishable under Section 20(b)(ii)(C) of NDPS Act,1985
and sentenced to undergo R.I. for 10 years with fine of
Rs.1,00,000/- also with default stipulation.
As per prosecution case, at the relevant point of time
Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ms. Shraddha Sonkar
who was posted as Probationary Station House Officer,
of Police Station Garhasarai on 26.01.2016 received in
information from the informant that Chandhan Sahu and
Kanhaiya Sahu had been transporting contraband
substance, who may be apprehended. On such
information, entry of the information was made in
Rojnamachasana. Panchnama to procedure search
warrant was also prepared which was also registered in
Rojnamachasanha. Constable Ganga Yadav went to the
office of Additional Superintendent of Police, Dindori to
procure search warrants, entry of the same was also

made in Rojnamachasanha. Thereafter the police party
proceeded towards the alleged place of incident in a
government vehicle. Where a white colour Bolero Pickup
vehicle was seen coming from the side of Anuppur
bearing registration No.MP52 GA 0391 which was
stopped by the police, in which the appellants were
alleged to have sat. The appellants were informed about
the search and on search nothing objectionable was

found from their possession. Thereafter, the vehicle was
also searched, in which, 48 KG 550 gm contraband was
found in three bags and in a khaki colour cartoon.
Thereafter two samples, each of 50 gms were taken on
which signatures of the witnesses were also obtained. On
the aforesaid allegation, offence was registered against
the appellants and they were taken into custody. Vehicle
was also taken into custody by the police. After
registration of the FIR, charge-sheet was filed before the
trial Court and after the trial, the impugned judgment is
passed and the trial Court found the appellants guilty for
the aforesaid offence.
Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the
appellants have wrongly been convicted by the trial Court.
The circumstances so mentioned in the judgment do not
incriminate the appellants with the said offence. The bags
and the cartoon which are said to have been found in the
Bolero Pickup vehicle do not belong to him. There are
major contradictions, omissions and improvements in the

Cr.A.Nos.1217/2017 & 1232/2017

testimony of the prosecution witnesses. There are major
contradictions in the version of the prosecution witnesses
about the seized quantity of the contraband.
Learned counsel for the appellants further submits
that independent witnesses of the seizure and search
have turned hostile. The police had not followed the
proper procedure while conducting search of the
appellants and the procedural mistakes apparent on the
face of record. There is no evidence on record to show
that the appellants had any intention to commit the
offence. The learned trial Judge has failed to appreciate
the prosecution evidence in its proper perspective
resulting into grave miscarriage of justice. It is also clear
from the circumstances that concocted and fabricated
evidence has been utilized for conviction of the
appellants.
Learned counsel for the appellants has further
submitted that there is no criminal antecedent against the
appellants and, therefore, there is no probability to repeat
such offence in future. He has further argued that the
appellants have suffered substantial jail sentence period
out of 10 years of conviction and if they are not released
on bail, purpose of filing the criminal appeal would be
frustrated. There is no possibility of early hearing of the
appeals especially because of COVID-19 pandemic. With
the aforesaid, he prays for allowing the said applications.

On the other hand, learned Panel Lawyer opposes
the prayer of the counsel for the appellants submitting
that earlier applications filed for the same purpose have
been rejected by the Court after considering each and
every aspect of the case. There is no change in
circumstances to consider these successive bail
applications. The contraband substance was seized from
the possession of the appellants.
Heard and perused the evidence on record.
On perusal, it is found that 48 kgs and 550 gms of
contraband substance (ganja) was seized from the Bulero
Pickup vehicle whereon the present appellants were
sitting. As per the prosecution, the appellants were
transporting the contraband substance. Prima facie, it
appears that the appellants were on the vehicle and the
vehicle and contraband substance were seized from the
possession of the appellants. The ground of falsely
implication of the appellants and non-compliance of
mandatory provisions of NDPS Act, prima facie, having no
force as it appears that the learned trial Court has
discussed about the compliance of mandatory provisions
of NDPS Act and prima facie, the case does not seem of
falsely implication.
The learned counsel for the appellant has also
expressed his anxiety about futility of purpose of filing the
appeals, if the appellants are not released on bail or the
appeal will not be heard finally. As per the appellants'
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
Cr.A.Nos.1217/2017 & 1232/2017

counsel, the appellants have already suffered substantial
part of their jail sentence out of 10 years of conviction and
if they are not released on bail, the appeal would be in
vain.
Section 37 of NDPS Act restricts the bail of accused
for offence involving commercial quantity unless the Court
is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing
that he is not guilty of such offence.
In the case of Union of India v. Abdul Momin
reported in (2005) 13 SCC 144, after considering the
question of applicability of Section 37 of NDPS Act, the
Hon'ble Apex Court has held that merely on the ground
that there was no prospect of early hearing of appeal, bail
cannot be granted to the accused.
Further, in the case of Rasheed and others Vs.
State of Karnataka reported in 2007 Cri. L.J. 2316, the
High Court of Karnataka has held that under NDPS Act,
'the negation of bail is rule and grant of bail is an
exception'. The Court discussed the provision of Section
37 of NDPS Act and held that the expression 'reasonable
ground' as used in Section 37 of the Act means
something more then prima facie ground.

In another case Ratan Kumar Vishwas v. State of
U.P. & another reported in AIR 2009 SC 581, the Hon'ble
Apex Court has denied to suspend the jail sentence of the
appellant whose possession contraband substance was
seized. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that bail cannot be

Cr.A.Nos.1217/2017 & 1232/2017

granted to accused unless there are reasonable ground
for holding that he is not guilty and not likely to commit
any offence while on bail.
Further, in the case of Union of India v. Ratan
Malik @ Habul reported in (2009) 2 SCC 624, the reason
of delay in conclusion of appeal and undergone period of
accused were citing before the Hon'ble Apex Court for
granting bail but the Hon'ble Apex Court did not found
said circumstances sufficient to satisfy the mandatory
requirements of Section 37 of NDPS Act.
A Full Bench of this Court in the case of Dhashrath
Vs. State of MP in Cr.A. No. 1248/2005, order dated
26.04.2017
has already settled the principle that the custody period of the accused is not a sole ground to
suspend jail sentence of accused and release him on bail.
The record shows that the quantity of seized substance is more than commercial quantity i.e. 48.550
kgs and same were seized from the possession of the appellants. As discussed above, the trial Court
found that the appellants were fully aware with the fact that the substance was kept in the Bulero
Pickup vehicle, therefore, prima facie, the involvement of accused is found in the case and there is
no sufficient reasonable ground for believing that the appellants are not guilty of such offence.
Accordingly, I.A.Nos.13674/2020 & 13678/2020 are hereby rejected. However, the grounds raised
by the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Cr.A.Nos.1217/2017 & 1232/2017 appellants'
counsel are still kept alive for consideration thereof while hearing the appeals finally. The appellants
may also approach the Appropriate Authority requesting early final hearing of this appeal.
