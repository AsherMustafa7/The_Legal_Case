4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case titled Surinder Kaushik and ors. Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported in 2013 (5) SCC
148.
5. Status report has been filed by respondent No. 2 stating therein that during investigation, the
investigating officer recorded the statements of witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C and also got
recorded the statements of SI Mohd Qasim and SPO Bashir Ahmed before the Court of learned
Munsiff, JMIC, Mahore under Section 164-A Cr.P.C and received the copies of statements. During
investigation, the investigating officer received the medical reports of two injured policemen in
which the medical officer has reported that the SgCt Malook Singh has received critical injury with
blunt object, as such, offence under Section 333 was added in the FIR. It has been further stated that
on the basis of statements and evidence collected during the course of investigation, prima facie it
was established that the accused/petitioners have committed the offence under Sections 307 382,
353 /332/ 333 /336, 147, 201 RPC. It is further stated that accused/petitioners were arrested and
subsequently they were bailed out by the Court below.
6. The aforesaid judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not applicable in
the present case. It is true that there cannot be two FIRs with regard to the same occurrence, but
when the occurrences are different, 3 CRM(M) 242/2019 may be they have taken place
simultaneously one after another, there can be two FIRs.
7. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on file.
8. In the instant case, FIR No. 79 of 2018 was registered with Police Station, Dansal for commission
of offences punishable under Sections 307, 382, 353, 323, 147 RPC alleging therein that the
petitioners/accused mentioned in the FIR entered in the office of Venser Construction Company Ltd
at 9.30 a.m and attacked one of their staff member, namely, Rohit Kumar who got injured and they
also damaged the Scorpio vehicle and computer of the office whereas, another case FIR No. 79 of
2018 was lodged against the petitioners for commission of offences punishable under Sections 452,
147, 323, 506 and 427 RPC alleging therein that on 16.11.2018 at 11.30 a. m when the police reached
the spot with regard to the aforesaid occurrence which had taken place, accused/petitioners
mentioned in the FIR attacked the police party, in which one SgCt Malook Singh received critical
injury. This, in no way, can be said to be the part of the same occurrence. These are the two different
occurrences, which had taken place at two different places.
9. It will be appropriate and advantageous herein to refer to a judgment of the Supreme Court in
case titled Upkar Singh v. Ved Prakash (2004)13 SCC 292, wherein, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court has
held that in a case if allegations made in two complaints are different in versions in respect of same
incident, not required to be interfered with the 2nd FIR and investigation would be carried under
both of them by the same investigating agency. Thus filing of FIR giving a 4 CRM(M) 242/2019
counter claim in respect of the same incident having different version of the event is permissible in
law.

10. In another case titled Babubhai v. State of Gujrat : (2010)12 SCC 254, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme
Court considered the issue of lodging of 2nd FIR. In this case, two communities for same issue
fought against each other which resulted in death of some persons, led to lodging of two FIRs. The
Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court has considered the earlier judgments and held if an FIR is lodged against
accused persons for an incident, after some time, a subsequent FIR is lodged, for the same
transaction of facts is not permissible but counter claim, a fact with different version in lodging of
two FIRs is permissible. It is relevant to quote Para-20 of the said judgment:
"20. Thus, in view of the above, the law on the subject emerges to the effect that an
FIR under Section 154 CrPC is a very important document. It is the first information
of a cognizable offence recorded by the officer in charge of the police station. It sets
the machinery of criminal law in motion and marks the commencement of the
investigation which ends with the formation of an opinion under Section 169 or 170
CrPC, as the case may be, and forwarding of a police report under Section 173 CrPC.
Thus, it is quite possible that more than one piece of information be given to the
police officer in charge of the police station in respect of the same incident involving
one or more than one cognizable offences. In such a case, he need not enter each
piece of information in the diary. All other information given orally or in writing after
the commencement of the investigation into the facts mentioned in the first
information report will be statements falling under Section 162 CrPC."
11. Law with regard to quashing of FIR/complaint is well settled. This can only be quashed in order
to prevent abuse of process of law or to otherwise secure the ends of justice. The expressions 'ends of
justice' and 'to prevent abuse of process of any court' are intended to work out either when an
innocent person 5 CRM(M) 242/2019 is unjustifiably subjected to an undeserving prosecution or if
an ex-facie all merited prosecution is throttled at the threshold without allowing the material in
support of it.
12. It may not be out of place to mention here that the Supreme Court in State of Telangana v. Habib
Abdullah Jeelani, reported in 2017 (2) SCC 779, has held that the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C
or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, to quash the FIR, is to be exercised in a very
sparing manner as is not to be used to choke or smother the prosecution that is legitimate. Inherent
powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or
caprice. Such power has to be exercised sparingly, with circumspection and in the rarest of rare
cases. Inherent powers in a matter of quashing FIR have to be exercised sparingly and with caution
and only when such exercise is justifying by the test specifically laid down in provision itself. Power
under Section 482 Cr.P.C, is a very wide, but conferment of wide power requires the Court to be
more conscious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the Court.
13. In the instant case, it is seen in regard to the incident which took place on 16.11.2018, the
Manager- Venser Construction Company Ltd and the Police have lodged separate complaints giving
different versions, even the offences which are stated to have been committed, and for which the two
FIRs were registered in these respective cases were different and distinct. These were two different
FIRs relatable to different occurrences which are alleged to have occurred at different points of time.

Thus, lodging of the subsequent FIR was not a second FIR for the same occurrence as stated in the
instant petition as both cases are completely distinct and different.
6 CRM(M) 242/2019
14. Perusal of the record further tends to show that the averments made in the complaint/FIR prima
facie revel the commission of cognizable offences, at this stage, it would be premature to pronounce
the conclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint/FIR does not deserve to be investigated or
that it amounts to abuse of process of law. Therefore, looking to the nature of offences attributed to
the petitioners, it is not a fit case wherein inherent powers can be exercised by this Court for
quashing the FIR.
15. The investigation in the instant case has been completed, the allegations leveled in the
complaint/FIR regarding the commission of the alleged offence are required to be proved during the
trial by adducing the evidence and the grounds taken by the petitioners in the instant case can well
be taken in defence before the Court below.
16. In view of the above, I do not see any case having been made out by the petitioners for quashing
the impugned FIR.
17. The instant petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
