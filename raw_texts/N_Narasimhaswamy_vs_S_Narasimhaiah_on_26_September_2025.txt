bearing Sy.No.63 was allotted to the said Kunnegowda (father of original plaintiff) and as such more
extent of land was allotted in Sy.No.64, during the time of partition and the plaintiffs were in
possession of the suit schedule property. Hence, the plaintiffs have filed suit in O.S.No.271 of 1991
seeking relief of declaration of title with consequential relief of permanent injunction in respect of
the suit property as the defendants are interfering with the suit schedule property.
22. After service of notice, defendant Nos.1 to 4 entered appearance and filed detailed written

ARGUMENTS OF THE APPELLANTS- MORTGAGOR
28. Sri. G. Papi Reddy learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants, in RSA No.1884 of 2023
and
- 32 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR RSA No. 2482 of 2017 argued by
referring to the genealogy of the parties, that, the original propostius Marthandegowda @
Sirigowda, had three children Kunnegowda, (father of the original plaintiff in OS No.271 of 1991), S.
Narasimhaiah-defendant No.1 and defendant No.4-S. Ramakrishnappa. It is further argued that, the
said Kunnegowda, being eldest son in the family, was cultivating the entire land since, his younger
brother-S. Narasimhaiah, was employed in Southern Railways as Station Master and another
brother- defendant No.4 (S. Ramakrishnappa), was doing Arrack business at Mandya.
He argued that, both the defendant No.1 and defendant No.4, were not interested in agriculture and
as such, the father of the original plaintiff-Kunnegowda was cultivating the suit schedule property. It
is further argued that, partition had taken place, in the Joint family of Marthandegowda @
Sirigowda, and little more share was allotted in favour of Kunnegowda, than defendant No.1 and
defendant No.4. He further argued that the joint
- 33 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR family had two items of the suit schedule
property namely, land bearing Sy No.63 measuring 03 acres, 34 guntas and land bearing Sy No.64
consisting of 07 acres, 9 guntas of Halaguru village. In the partition, held between the Kunnegowda
and his brothers, the said Kunnegowda got, 02 acres, 33 guntas in land bearing Sy No.64. The said
additional share of 02 acres, 33 guntas, in land bearing Sy No.64 was in addition to the land divided
between the said Kunnegowda and his brothers in Sy No.63. In land bearing Sy No.63, the said
Kunnegowda got 96 gutnas, and therefore, it is contended by the learned Senior Counsel that the
said Kunnegowda got larger portion of the suit schedule property than his brothers S. Narasimhaiah
(defendant No.1) and S. Ramakrishnappa (defendant No.4). It is also argued by the learned Senior
Counsel for the appellants by referring to the Mortgage Deed dated 24.09.1951 and another
Mortgage Deed dated 07.06.1952 that, as per the Mortgage Deed dated 24.09.1951, an extent of 01

N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
acre, was mortgaged in favour of one
- 34 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR Madegowda. Thereafter, as per Mortgage
Deed dated 07.06.1952, land to an extent of 01 acre 33 guntas, was mortgaged in favour of his
brother-defendant No.1 (S.Narasimhaiah). It is also contended by learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the appellants by referring to the shara mentioned in the unregistered document dated
21.04.1958 and 30.12.1973 that, the said land mortgaged under the aforementioned Mortgage Deeds
dated 24.09.1951 and 07.06.1952 was redeemed and the said Kunnegowda was in cultivation of the
suit schedule property and therefore, the children of S.Narasimhaiah and S.Ramarkishappa have no
right, title or interest in respect of the suit schedule property and accordingly, sought for
interference of this court.
29. Nextly, it is argued by the learned Senior Counsel by referring to the written statement filed by
the defendants in OS No.271 of 1991 that, there is no specific denial of the redemption of mortgage
by the defendants as required under Order VIII Rule 3 and 5 of Code of Civil
- 35 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR Procedure, and further as there is no
specific denial in the written statement and as such, the claim made by the plaintiffs with regard to
possession of the suit schedule property by the legal representatives of Kunnegowda, is to be
confirmed. Emphasising on the evidence of the PW2 and PW3, neighbour land owners of the suit
schedule property, it is argued by the learned Senior Counsel that, the neighbors of the suit schedule
property have deposed about the possession of the suit schedule property by Kunnegowda, based on
the redemption of mortgage by Kunnegowda and accordingly, sought for interference in these
appeals filed by the legal representatives of Kunnegowda.
30. Further, it is contended by learned Senior Counsel by referring to paragraphs 30 and 32 of the
judgment of the Trial Court that in a usufructuary mortgage wherein, the mortgagor is in possession
of the suit schedule property, in view of redemption of mortgage, the legal representatives of
Kunnegowda held to be
- 36 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR absolute owners of the suit schedule
property. It is also argued by the learned Senior Counsel by referring to boundary mentioned in the
plaint schedule in respect of the Sy No.64/C of Halaguru village, as well as the measurement of the
suit schedule property in Exhibits P13 and P14 (Village map and Rough Sketch), it is argued by the
learned Senior Counsel that, the redemption of the mortgage was admitted by the parties and the
said aspect of the matter was considered by the Trial Court, however, First Appellate Court has
committed an error in erroneously re-appreciating the material on record and accordingly, sought
for interference of this court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 23
N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
31. It is the categorical submission of the learned Senior Counsel that, there is no limitation for
redemption of mortgage in a usufructuary of mortgage, and therefore, sought for interference of this
court. It argued by the learned Senior Counsel that the issue Nos.1 to 3 in O.S.No.59 of 2007 was
held against the defendants in O.S.No. 59 of 2007 and same has reached finality and
- 37 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR same has been unchallenged by the
respondents herein and therefore, sought for setting aside the judgment in R.A.No.05 of 2020.
Emphasising on these aspects, it is argued that mere receipt of money by the Mortgagee from the
Mortgagor is sufficient and same does not require the registration of redemption of mortgage. In
addition to this, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants argued that, the
Mortgagee-S.Narasimhaiah, himself has handed over the original Mortgage Deeds in favour of
Kunnegowda, that itself would establish, the fact of redemption of mortgage has been made by
Kunnegowda, in favour of the his brother-S.Narasimhaiah and therefore, sough for allowing RSA
No.2482 of 2017 and RAS No. 1884 of 2023.
32. In order to buttress his arguments, learned Senior Counsel appellants has places reliance on the
order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Harminder Singh (D) Thr. LRs. vs. Surjit Kaur (D)
Thr. LRs. and others in Civil Appeal No.89 of 2012 dated 27.04.2022

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR and in the case of Major Singh and
Others vs. Jaswinder Singh and Others in Civil Appeal No.7844- 7845 of 2012 dated 17.11.2021 and
argued that, in respect of the proposition with regard to the admission made by the defendants in
respect of the possession of the suit schedule property by father of original plaintiff-
Kunnegowda, which has been proved in the earlier proceedings and in this regard, learned Senior
Counsel places reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case Barkat Ali and
Another vs. Badrinarain (D) by Lrs., reported in (2008) 4 SCC 615 and argued that the principles of
res-judicata is not only applicable in respect of different proceedings but also applied at the
subsequent stage of the same proceedings and accordingly, sought for interference of this Court.
33. Nextly, it is contended by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants that, the
period of limitation is not applicable for redemption of mortgage and in this regard, learned Senior

Court in the case of Harminder Singh (supra) and argued that, the finding recorded by the First

N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Prabhakaran and Others vs. M.Azhagiri Pillai
(D) by LRs and Others reported in AIR 2006 SC 1567 and in the case of Mohan Lal vs. Mohan Lal
reported in AIR Online 2016 SC 206 and accordingly, sought for interference of this Court.
ARGUMETNS OF THE RESPONDENT- MORTGAGEE:
34. Per Contra, Sri. Raja. L., appearing for the respondents argued that, as per the Mortgage Deed
(Exhibit P9), a period of three years was stipulated for the redemption of the mortgage and after the
completion of three years, the cause of action arises for seeking redemption of mortgage, by the
Mortgagor is for a period of 30 years and therefore, as the suit is filed after 33
- 40 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR years of the execution of the Mortgage
Deed at Ex.P9, i.e. after the lapse of 30 years as per Article 61 of the Limitation Act, 1908 and
therefore, the suit filed by the legal representatives of the Mortgagor, is not maintainable and
accordingly, sought for dismissal of the appeals. It is also argued by the learned counsel appearing
for the respondents that, insofar period for redemption of mortgage is not mentioned in the
document, then the limitation period would be 30 years from the date of execution of the Mortgage
Deed. In this regard, supporting the judgment of the First Appellate Court, in R.A.No. 5 of 2020,
learned counsel appearing for the respondents places reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Singh Ram (D) thru LRs vs. Sheo Ram and Others reported in AIR
2014 SC 3447 referring to paragraph 5, 14 and 15 it is argued that, right to redeem has been held to
accrue on the date of mortgage and the said right will be exhaust after 30 years, and therefore,
sought for dismissal of the appeals filed by
- 41 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR the legal representatives of the
Mortgagor. It is also argued by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents by placing on the
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Prabhakaran (supra) and argued that, the period
of limitation is applicable to the usufructuary mortgage also if the period is fixed in the Deed of
Mortgage as there is transfer of interest in an immovable property for securing the amount
advanced therein and therefore, sought for interference of this Court.
35. In respect of the contention raised by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants
that, the legal representatives of the original mortgagee-S. Narasimhaiah have not questioned the
judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court despite being aggrieved by the finding recorded on
Issue Nos.1 to 3, Sri. M. B. Chandrachooda, learned counsel appearing for the respondents argued
that, since the suit filed by the legal representatives of the Mortgagor was dismissed and

defendants to challenge the judgment of the trial court and decree passed by the Trial Court and in
this regard, Sri. M. B. Chandrachooda, learned counsel for the respondents refers to the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Banarasi and others vs. Ram Phal reported in (2003) 9
SCC 606 and in the case of Hardevinder Singh vs. Paramjit Singh and Others reported in (2013) 9
SCC 261 and argued that, the defendants in the said suit were not the aggrieved parties, and
accordingly, sought for dismissal of the appeals preferred by the legal representatives of the original
Mortgagor.
ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENTIONS :
36. In the light of the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, I have
carefully examined the finding recorded by both the Courts below and perused the original records.
37. RSA No.287 of 2018 is arising out of dismissal of the R.A.No.34 of 2016 by confirming the
judgment and
- 43 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR decree in O.S.No.19 of 2007. O.S.No.19
of 2007 is filed by H.N. Ramanna, S/o late S. Narasimhaiah (Mortgagee), seeking relief of
declaration in respect of the suit schedule property which came to be dismissed and same was
confirmed by the First Appellate Court in R.A.No.34 of 2016.
38. RSA No.2173 of 2017 is filed by the legal representatives of S. Narasimaiah (Mortgagee) and RSA
No.2482 of 2017 is filed by the legal representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor) in O.S.No.59 of
2007. These two appeals are arising out of the judgment and decree in O.S.No.59 of 2007 filed by
legal representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor), which came to be dismissed by the Trial Court
and partly allowed by the First Appellate Court in R.A.No.36 of 2012.
39. RSA No.1884 of 2023 is filed by legal representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor), challenging
the judgment and decree passed in R.A.No.5 of 2020,
- 44 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR whereby, the First Appellate Court
allowed the appeal preferred by the legal representatives of S. Narasimaiah (Mortgagee) by setting
aside the judgment and decree passed in O.S.No.271 of 1991. O.S.No.271 of 1991 was filed by legal
representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor), seeking declaration of title with consequential relief of
permanent injunction.
40. The undisputed facts of the case are that the original propositus-Marthandegowda @ Sirigowda
had three children namely, Kunnegowda (Mortgagor), S. Narasimhaiah (Mortgagee) and S.
Ramakrishnappa. The parties in these appeals are descendants of Kunnegowda and S.

Narasimhaiah. Kunnegowda, being eldest son in the family was managing the family affairs as his
younger brother- S. Narasimhaiah was working in Southern Railways as Station Master. It is also
not disputed that, another brother of Kunnegowda viz. S. Ramakrishnappa had business at Mandya.
Kunnegowda was looking after the agricultural operations.

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR
41. It is the contention of the Kunnegowda (Mortgagor) that, as per the partition in their family, 02
acre 33 guntas in Sy No.64 of Halaguru Village was allotted in favour of Kunnegowda. Kunnagowda
had mortgaged 01 acre of land in Sy. No.64 in favour of Madegowda as per Mortgage Deed dated
24.09.1951 (Exhibit P10) for sum of Rs.200/-. It is also to be noted that as per the Mortgage Deed
dated 07.06.1952 (Exhibit P9). Kunnegowda had mortgaged the land covered under the Mortgage
Deed dated 24.09.1951 in favour of his brother S. Narasimhaiah for Rs.400/-. In terms of the said
Mortgage Deed dated 07.06.1952, S. Narasimhaiah (Mortgagee) had to discharge the mortgage
amount of Rs.200/- due under the earlier mortgage made in favour of Madegowda for sum of
Rs.200/-. It is also forthcoming from the finding of the Courts below that, a shara has been made on
the original Mortgage Deed reflecting the date as 30.12.1973 (Exhibit P15), wherein, the Mortgagor-
Kunnegowda had repaid the entire mortgage amount to
- 46 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR the Mortgagee - S. Narasimhaiah
redeeming the two original mortgage deeds referred to above. It is not in dispute that the original
Mortgage Deeds were in the custody of the legal representatives of Kunnegowda.
Kunnegowda died during the year 1981 and his legal representatives succeed to the estate. In view of
the interference made by the legal representatives of S. Narasimhaiah (Mortgagee), the plaintiffs
(legal representatives of Kunnegowda) in O.S.No.271 of 1991 sought for relief of declaration with
consequential relief of permanent injunction against the defendants. O.S.No.59 of 2007 was filed
seeking redemption of mortgage by the legal representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor).
O.S.No.19 of 2007 is filed by the son of S. Narasimhaiah (Mortgagee), seeking relief of declaration in
respect of the suit schedule property. In the backdrop of the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel appearing for the parties, the question to be answered in these appeals as to whether the
relief of redemption of mortgage and
- 47 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR declaration sought for by the legal
representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor) is barred by limitation or not. In this regard,
arguments were heard at length.

42. The Senior Counsel representing the legal representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor) made a
principal submission that the limitation is not applicable in respect of usufructuary mortgage and it
is for the Mortgagor to redeem the suit schedule property only after repayment of the amount
received from the original Mortgagor. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the legal
representatives of S. Narasimhaiah (Mortgagee) contended that the time fixed in the Mortgage Deed
as three years for redemption of mortgage and as the Mortgagor has not resorted for redemption of
mortgage and therefore, the period of limitation as per Section 62 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882
i.e., the Mortgagor or his legal representatives have to redeem the mortgage within thirty years from
the time specified in the Mortgage Deed. It is further case of the legal
- 48 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR representatives of S. Narasimhaiah that,
since the period is lapsed, the suit filed by the legal representatives of Kunnegowda, itself is not
maintainable.
43. It is also forthcoming from the records that the judgment and decree in O.S.No.271 of 1991
confirmed in R.A.No.69 of 2006 was challenged before this Court in RSA No.1063 of 2010 filed by
legal representatives of S. Narasimhaiah and this Court, by judgment and decree dated 12.11.2014,
remitted the matter to the First Appellate Court to re-consider the issue afresh.
44. In order to answer the aforementioned legal question pertaining to the applicability of limitation
to the suit filed by the Mortgagor, it is relevant to follow the dictum of Hon'ble Supreme Court as
under:
44.1. In the case of Singh Ram (supra) at paragraph 15 reads as under:
"15. We, thus, hold that special right of usufructuary mortgagor under Section 62 of
the TP Act to recover
- 49 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR possession commences in
the manner specified therein i.e. when mortgage money is paid out of rents and
profits or partly out of rents and profits and partly by payment or deposit by the
mortgagor. Until then, limitation does not start for the purposes of Article 61 of the
Schedule to the Limitation Act. A usufructuary mortgagee is not entitled to file a suit
for declaration that he had become an owner merely on the expiry of 30 years from
the date of the mortgage. We answer the question accordingly."
44.2. In the case of Shakeena and Another vs. Bank of India and Others reported in (2021) 12 SCC
761, paragraph 16.4 reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 28

"16.4. While considering the second point, after noticing Section 37 of the 2002 Act
and Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, the Court rejected the argument of the
appellants for the following reasons : (K. Chidambara Manickam case [K.
Chidambara Manickam v. Shakeena, 2007 SCC OnLine Mad 675 : (2008) 1 CTC 660]
, SCC OnLine Mad para 11) "11.4. We have more than one reasons to reject the said
contention of the learned counsel for the borrowers.
*** 11.5.1. Firstly, as held by us, while answering Point (i) the sale in this case has
become absolute and complete on the date when the sale was confirmed on the
appellant/auction-
- 50 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR purchaser and he is
vested with all the rights in relation to the property purchased by him in the public
auction on issuance of sale certificate on 6-1-2006 i.e. prior to the date on which the
borrowers have approached the second respondent for repayment, contrary to the
provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act.
11.5.2. Secondly, the sale certificate issued in this case does not require any
registration as per Section 17(2)(xii) of the Registration Act, 1908 and our said view is
fortified with the decisions of the Division Bench of this Court in S. Arumugham v.
C.K. Venugopal Chettiar [S. Arumugham v. C.K. Venugopal Chettiar, 1986 SCC
OnLine Mad 189 :
(1994) 1 LW 491] and the Supreme Court in B. Arvind Kumar v. Union of India [B.
Arvind Kumar v. Union of India, (2007) 5 SCC 745] , referred supra.
*** 11.5.3.1. Thirdly, it is true that the borrowers have the right of redemption as provided under
Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, in view of Section 37 of the SARFAESI Act and to
substantiate the said stand, the learned counsel for the borrowers relies on the decision of the
Supreme Court in Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam [Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam,
(1977) 3 SCC 247] , wherein it is held that the mortgagor has a right to redemption unless the sale of
the property was complete by registration in accordance with the provisions of the Registration Act.

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR 11.5.3.2. With great respect, we are of the
view that the decision of the Supreme Court in Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam [Narandas
Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247] , referred supra, is not applicable to the facts of this
case. Even, as held by the Supreme Court in Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam [Narandas
Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247] , referred supra, the right of the mortgagor to
redemption continues only till such time the sale of the property was complete by registration. In
this case, our finding, following the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in S. Arumugham v.

C.K. Venugopal Chettiar [S. Arumugham v. C.K. Venugopal Chettiar, 1986 SCC OnLine Mad 189 :
(1994) 1 LW 491] and the Supreme Court in B. Arvind Kumar v. Union of India [B. Arvind Kumar v.
Union of India, (2007) 5 SCC 745] , referred supra, is that the sale in this case has become absolute
and complete by the issuance of sale certificate on 6-1-2006. Further, Section 17(2)(xii) of the
Registration Act, 1908 does not require registration of a sale certificate granted to any purchaser of
any property sold in public auction by a Civil or Revenue Officer and it is the finding of the Supreme
Court in B. Arvind Kumar v. Union of India [B. Arvind Kumar v. Union of India, (2007) 5 SCC 745] ,
referred supra, that the sale certificate issued by a Civil or Revenue Officer in respect of a property
sold in public auction does not fall under the category of non-testamentary documents which
require registration under sub-sections (b) and (c) of Section 17(1) of the Registration Act, 1908.
- 52 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR 11.5.4. Fourthly, the right to redeem the
mortgage, as provided in Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, is, of course, a very valuable
right possessed by the mortgagor. At the same time, such a right to redeem the mortgage can be
exercised before it is foreclosed, or the estate is sold. It has been held that the mortgagor can adopt
the course provided under Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act only before the mortgagee has
filed a suit for enforcement of the mortgage and not thereafter, vide Poulose v. State Bank of
Travancore [Poulose v. State Bank of Travancore, 1987 SCC OnLine Ker 48 : AIR 1989 Ker 79] . In
this case, as discussed earlier, the borrowers approached the second respondent Bank only after
initiation of the proceedings under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act, and that too after the
property was sold in public auction and the sale was confirmed in favour of the appellant."
44.3. In the case of L. K. Trust vs. EDC Limited and Others reported in (2011) 6 SCC 780, paragraph
53, 61 and 62 reads as under:
"53. On analysis of arguments advanced at the Bar, this Court finds that the
proposition that in India it is only on execution of conveyance and the registration of
transfer of the mortgagor's interest by registered instrument that the mortgagor's
right of redemption stands extinguished is well settled. Further, it is not the case of
the appellant that a registered sale deed had been executed between the appellant
Trust and Respondent 1 pursuant to the resolution passed by
- 53 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR Respondent 1 and,
therefore, in terms of Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 no title relating
to the disputed property had passed to the appellant at all.
***
61. The mortgagor under Indian law is the owner who had parted with some rights of
ownership and the right of redemption is the right which he exercises by virtue of his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 30
N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
residuary ownership to resume what he has parted with. In India this right of
redemption, however, is a statutory one. A right of redemption is an incident of a
subsisting mortgage and subsists so long as the mortgage itself subsists. The judicial
trend indicates that dismissal of an earlier suit for redemption whether as abated or
as withdrawn or in default would not debar the mortgagor from filing a second suit
for redemption so long as the mortgage subsists. This right cannot be extinguished
except by the act of parties or by the decree of a court. As explained by this Court in
Jayasingh Dnyanu Mhoprekar v. Krishna Babaji Patil [(1985) 4 SCC 162] : (SCC p.
167, para 6) "6. ... the right of redemption under a mortgage deed can come to an end
only in a manner known to law. Such extinguishment of the right can take place by
contract between the parties, by a merger or by a statutory provision which debars
the mortgagor from redeeming the mortgage."
62. The mortgagor's right of redemption is exercised by the payment or tender to the mortgagee at
the proper time and at
- 54 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR the proper place of the mortgage money.
When it is extinguished by the act of parties, the act must take the shape and observe the formalities
which the law prescribes. A mortgage being a security for the debt, the right of redemption
continues although the mortgagor fails to pay the debt at the due date. Any provision inserted to
prevent, evade or hamper the redemption is void."
44.4. In the case of Jayasingh Dnyanu Mhoprekar and Another vs. Krishna Babaji Patil and Another
reported in (1985) 4 SCC 162, paragraph 6 reads as under:
"6. The only question which arises for decision in this case is whether by reason of the
grant made in favour of the defendants the right to redeem the mortgage can be
treated as having become extinguished. It is well settled that the right of redemption
under a mortgage deed can come to an end only in a manner known to law. Such
extinguishment of right can take place by a contract between the parties, by a merger
or by a statutory provision which debars the mortgagor from redeeming the
mortgage. A mortgagee who has entered into possession of the mortgaged property
under a mortgage will have to give up possession of the property when the suit for
redemption is filed unless he is able to show that the right of redemption has come to
an end or that the suit is liable to be dismissed on some other valid ground. This
flows from the legal principle which is applicable to all mortgages, namely
- 55 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR "Once a mortgage, always
a mortgage". It is no doubt true that the father of the first defendant and the second
defendant have been granted occupancy right by the Prant Officer by his order dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 31
N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
February 5, 1964 along with Pandu, the uncle of Defendant 1. But it is not disputed
that the defendants would not have been able to secure the said grant in their favour
but for the fact that they were in actual possession of the lands. They were able to be
in possession of the one-half share of the plaintiffs in the lands in question only by
reason of the mortgage deed. If the mortgagors had been in possession of the lands
on the relevant date, the lands would have automatically been granted in their favour,
since the rights of the tenants in the watan lands were allowed to subsist even after
the coming into force of the Act and the consequent abolition of the watans by virtue
of Section 8 of the Act. The question is whether the position would be different
because they had mortgaged land with possession on the relevant date."
44.5. In the case of Achaldas Durgaji Oswal (D) through LRs vs. Ramvilas Gagngabisan Heda (D)
through LRs reported in (2003) 3 SCC 614, paragraphs 8 to 23, 26 to 40 reads as under:
"Findings
8. Usufructuary mortgage is defined in Section 58(d) of the Transfer of Property Act
in the following terms:
- 56 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR "58. (d) Where the
mortgagor delivers possession or expressly or by implication binds himself to deliver
possession of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee, and authorises him to retain
such possession until payment of the mortgage-money, and to receive the rents and
profits accruing from the property or any part of such rents and profits and to
appropriate the same in lieu of interest, or in payment of the mortgage-money, or
partly in lieu of interest or partly in payment of the mortgage-money, the transaction
is called an usufructuary mortgage and the mortgagee an usufructuary mortgagee."
9. Mortgagor, despite having mortgaged the property might still deal with it in any way consistent
with the rights of the mortgagee. He has an equitable right to redeem the property after the day
fixed for payment has gone by but his right or equity of redemption is no longer strictly an equitable
estate or interest although it is still in the nature of an equitable interest. (See Halsbury's Laws of
England, 4th Edn., Vol. 32, p. 264.)
10. The right of the mortgagor, it is now well settled, to deal with the mortgaged property as well as
the limitation to which it is subject depends upon the nature of this ownership which is not absolute,
but qualified by reason of the right of the mortgagee to recover his money out of the proceedings.
The right to redeem the mortgage is a very valuable right possessed by the mortgagor. Such a right
to redeem the mortgage can be exercised before it is foreclosed or the estate is sold. The equitable
right of redemption is dependent on the mortgagor giving the mortgagee reasonable notice of his

performing his obligations under the mortgage.
11. The doctrine of redemption of mortgaged property was not recognised by the Indian courts as the
essence of the doctrine of equity of redemption was unknown to the ancient law of India. The Privy
Council in Thumbasawmy Mudelly v. Mohd. Hossain Rowthen [(1874-75) 2 IA 241 : ILR (1875) 1
Mad 1] called upon the legislature to make a suitable amendment which was given a statutory
recognition by reason of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act which reads thus:
"60. Right of mortgagor to redeem.--At any time after the principal money has
become due, the mortgagor has a right, on payment or tender, at a proper time and
place, of the mortgage-money, to require the mortgagee (a) to deliver to the
mortgagor the mortgage-deed and all documents relating to the mortgaged property
which are in the possession or power of the mortgagee, (b) where the mortgagee is in
possession of the mortgaged property, to deliver possession thereof to the mortgagor,
and (c) at the cost of the mortgagor either to retransfer the mortgaged property to
him or to such third person as he may direct, or to execute and (where the mortgage
has been effected by a registered instrument) to have registered an acknowledgement
in writing that any right in derogation of his interest transferred to the mortgagee has
been extinguished:
- 58 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR Provided that the right
conferred by this section has not been extinguished by act of the parties or by decree
of a court.
The right conferred by this section is called a right to redeem and a suit to enforce it
is called a suit for redemption.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to render invalid any provision to the effect
that, if the time fixed for payment of the principal money has been allowed to pass or
no such time has been fixed, the mortgagee shall be entitled to reasonable notice
before payment or tender of such money."
12. A right of redemption, thus, was statutorily recognized as a right of a mortgagor as an incident of
mortgage which subsists so long as the mortgage itself subsists. The proviso appended to Section 60,
as noticed hereinbefore, however, confines the said right so long as the same is not extinguished by
an act of the parties or by a decree of court.
13. In the law of Mortgage by Dr Rashbehary Ghose at pp. 231-32 under the heading "Once a
mortgage, always a mortgage", it is noticed:

mortgagee as against a mortgagor coming to redeem. In 1902 the well-known maxim,
'once a mortgage, always a mortgage', was supplemented by the words 'and nothing
but a mortgage' added by Lord Davey in the leading case of Noakes v. Rice [1902 AC
24 : 71 LJ Ch 139 : 86 LT 62 : (1900-03) All ER Rep 34 (HL)] in which the maxim was
explained to mean 'that a mortgage cannot be made irredeemable and a provision to
that effect is void'. The maxim has been supplemented in the Indian context by the
words 'and therefore always redeemable', added by Justice Sarkar of the Supreme
Court in the case of Seth Ganga Dhar v. Shankar Lal [AIR 1958 SC 770 :
1959 SCR 509] .
It is thus evident that the very conception of mortgage involves three principles. First,
there is the maxim: 'once a mortgage, always a mortgage'. That is to say, a mortgage
is always redeemable and if a contrary provision is made, it is invalid. And this is an
exception to the aphorism, modus et conventio vincunt legem (custom and
agreement overrule law). Secondly, the mortgagee cannot reserve to himself any
collateral advantage outside the mortgage agreement. Thirdly, as a corollary from the
first another principle may be deduced, namely, 'once a mortgage, always a mortgage,
and nothing but a mortgage'. In other words, any stipulation which prevents a
mortgagor from getting back the property mortgaged is void. That is, a mortgage is
always redeemable.
The maxim 'once a mortgage always a mortgage' may be said to be a logical corollary
from the doctrine, which is the
- 60 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR very foundation of the law
of mortgages, that time is not of the essence of the contract in such transactions; for
the protection which the law throws around the mortgagor might be rendered wholly
illusory, if the right to redeem could be limited by contract between the parties. Right
to redeem is an incident of a subsisting mortgage and is inseparable from it so that
the right is coextensive with the mortgage itself. The right subsists until it is
appropriately and effectively extinguished either by the acts of the parties concerned
or by a proper decree of the competent court."

14. In The Law of Mortgages by Edward F. Cousins at p. 294, in relation to protection of the right to
redeem, it is stated:
"But the protection of embarrassed mortgagors could not be achieved by the mere
creation of the equitable right of redemption. As soon as the practice in equity to
allow redemption after the contract date became known, mortgagees sought to defeat
the intervention of equity by special provisions in the mortgage-deed. These
provisions were designed either to render the legal right to redeem illusory, and thus
prevent the equity of redemption from arising at all, or to defeat or clog the equity of
redemption after it had arisen. For example, the mortgage contract might provide for
an option for the mortgagee to purchase the mortgaged property, thus defeating both
the legal and equitable right to redeem, or might allow redemption after the contract
date only upon payment of an additional sum or upon performance of some
additional obligation. Consequently, the Chancellor began to relieve mortgagors
against such restrictions and fetters on the legal and
- 61 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR equitable rights to redeem
imposed by special covenants in the mortgage.
The protection of a mortgagor against all attempts to defeat or clog his right of
redemption involved the creation of subsidiary rules of equity, invalidating the
various contrivances which ingenious conveyancers devised. These rules are
sometimes summed up in a maxim of equity 'once a mortgage always a mortgage'.
This means that once a contract is seen to be a mortgage no provision in the contract
will be valid if it is inconsistent with the right of the mortgagor to recover his security
on discharging his obligations. Provisions offending against the maxim may either
touch the contractual terms of redemption, rendering the right to redeem illusory, or
they may touch only the equitable right to redeem after the passing of the contract
date, hampering the exercise of the right. Provisions of the latter kind are termed
'clogs' on the equity of redemption. Greene, M.R. in Knightsbridge Estates v. Byrne
[(1938) 4 All ER 618 (CA)] emphasized that provisions touching the contractual right
to redeem are not properly to be classed as clogs on the equity of redemption. But it is
evident that such provisions are in substance clogs on the equity of redemption, since
they tend to defeat it altogether."
15. In Fisher and Lightwood's Law of Mortgage, the nature of the right of redemption is stated thus:
"The rights of redemption.-- The right to redeem a mortgage was formerly conferred
on the mortgagor by a proviso or condition in the mortgage to the effect that, if

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR the mortgagor or his
representative should pay to the mortgagee the principal sum, with interest at the
rate fixed, on a certain day, the mortgagee, or the person in whom the estate was
vested, would, at the cost of the person redeeming, reconvey to him or as he should
direct (a). This is still the practice in the case of a mortgage effected by an assignment
of the mortgagor's interest (b). A proviso for reconveyance was no longer appropriate
after 1925 for a legal mortgage of land [which has to be made by demise
(c)], and it is not necessary to have a proviso for surrender of the term in such a
mortgage, since the term ceases on repayment (d). Nevertheless, in order to define
the rights of the mortgagor and the mortgagee, a proviso is inserted expressly stating
that the term will cease at the date fixed
(e).
It has been seen (f) that, at law, whatever form the mortgage took, upon non-payment by the
appointed time, the estate of the mortgagee became absolute and irredeemable, but that equity
intervened to enable the mortgagor to redeem after the date of repayment.
There are, therefore, two distinct rights of redemption -- the legal or contractual right to redeem on
the appointed day and the equitable right to redeem thereafter (g). The equitable right to redeem,
which only arises after the contractual date of redemption has passed, must be distinguished from
the equity of redemption, which arises when the mortgage is made (g)."

16. The question which falls for consideration in this appeal must be considered keeping in view the
statutory right of the mortgagor in terms of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act. By reason of
Article 61 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the limitation provided for a suit to redeem or recover the
possession of immovable property mortgaged by a mortgagor is thirty years from the date of accrual
of right to redeem or recover possession. Article 137 which is a residuary provision provides for
limitation of three years in a case where no period of limitation is provided.
17. Order 34 CPC deals with suits relating to mortgages of immovable property. Rule 7 thereof deals
with preliminary decree in redemption suit. Sub-clause (i) of clause (c) of Rule 7(1) of Order 34
empowers the court to direct as under:
"7. (1)(c)(i) that, if the plaintiff pays into court the amount so found or declared due
on or before such date as the court may fix within six months from the date on which
the court confirms and countersigns the account taken under clause (a), or from the
date on which such amount is declared in court under clause (b), as the case may be,
and thereafter pays such amount as may be adjudged due in respect of subsequent

costs, charges and expenses as provided in Rule 10, together with subsequent interest
on such sums respectively as provided in Rule 11, the defendant shall deliver up to the
plaintiff, or to such person as the plaintiff appoints, all documents in his possession
or power relating to the mortgaged property, and shall, if so required, retransfer the

under whom he claims, and shall also, if necessary, put the plaintiff in possession of
the property; and"
18. The consequence for non-payment has been contained in sub-clause (ii) of clause (c) which is in
the following terms:
"7. (1)(c)(ii) that, if payment of the amount found or declared due under or by the
preliminary decree is not made on or before the date so fixed, or the plaintiff fails to
pay, within such time as the court may fix, the amount adjudged due in respect of
subsequent costs, charges, expenses and interests, the defendant shall be entitled to
apply for a final decree--
(a) in the case of a mortgage other than a usufructuary mortgage, a mortgage by
conditional sale, or an anomalous mortgage the terms of which provide for
foreclosure only and not for sale, that the mortgaged property be sold, or
(b) in the case of a mortgage by conditional sale or such an anomalous mortgage as
aforesaid, that the plaintiff be debarred from all right to redeem the property."
19. A bare perusal of the aforementioned provisions would clearly show that sub-clause (ii) has no
application in relation to usufructuary mortgage. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 of Order 34 empowers the
court to extend the time fixed for payment. Rule 8 of Order 34 provides for final decree in
redemption suit. The right of the mortgagor to file an application for passing a
- 65 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR final decree has been provided in the
manner laid down therein.
20. The statutory provisions, as noticed hereinbefore, are required to be construed having regard to
the redeeming features of usufructuary mortgage, namely, (a) there is a delivery of possession to the
mortgagee, (b) he is to retain possession until repayment of money and to receive rents and profits
or part thereof in lieu of interest, or in payment of mortgage-money, or partly in lieu of interest and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 37
N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
partly in payment of mortgage-money, (c) there is redemption when the amount due is personally
paid or is discharged by rents or profits received, and (d) there is no remedy by sale or foreclosure.
21. Order 34 Rules 7 and 8 do not confer any right upon the usufructuary mortgagee to apply for
final decree which is conferred on the mortgagee on other types of mortgages. By reason of sub-rule
(1) of Rule 8 of Order 34, a mortgagor is entitled to make an application for final decree at any time
before a final decree debarring the plaintiff from all rights to redeem the mortgaged property has
been passed or before the confirmation of a sale held in pursuance of a final decree passed under
sub-rule (3) of this Rule. No such application is again contemplated at the instance of the
usufructuary mortgagee. By reason of sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of Order 34, a right of redemption is
conferred upon the mortgagor of a usufructuary mortgage. Such a provision has been made
evidently having regard to the right of redemption of a mortgagor in terms of Section 60 of the
Transfer of Property Act and further, having regard to the fact that a usufructuary
- 66 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR mortgagee would be entitled to possess
the property in question till a final decree of redemption is passed.
22. The right of redemption of a mortgagor being a statutory right, the same can be taken away only
in terms of the proviso appended to Section 60 of the Act which is extinguished either by a decree or
by act of parties. Admittedly, in the instant case, no decree has been passed extinguishing the right
of the mortgagor nor has such right come to an end by act of the parties.
23. A right for obtaining a final decree for sale or foreclosure can be exercised only on payment of
such money. Such a right can be exercised at any time even before the sale is confirmed although the
final decree might have been passed in the meanwhile. The mortgagee is also not entitled to receive
any payment under the preliminary decree nor is the mortgagor required to make an application to
recover before paying the same.
***
26. As regards application of Article 137 of the Limitation Act, the different High Courts have laid
down different laws. The Oudh High Court in Banke Behari Lal v. Ghani Ahmad [AIR 1922 Oudh 33
: 9 OLJ 14] held that Article 181 of the old Limitation Act will have no application. Similar view has
been taken in Ramaiah v. Veeraiah [ILR (1983) 1 Kar 114] . However, some High Courts have taken
a view that the period of limitation provided for under Article 137 starts from the date of deposit.

default in making the payment of the amount declared under the decree within the time fixed does
not operate to debar the plaintiff mortgagor from all right to redeem the mortgaged property."

which might have been passed by a competent court and which might have become final till the

not come to an end. Conversely once the amount is deposited by the mortgagor decree-holder even
during the execution proceedings the relationship between the parties as mortgagor and mortgagee

remains merely as judgment-debtor in illegal possession."

(SCC pp. 303-04, para 13) "13. In the instant case, the earlier suit was not a suit for foreclosure nor
was either of the mortgages, a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage and,
accordingly, there was no declaration in the final decree passed in the earlier suit for redemption

decree passed in a suit for sale. Similarly, Rule 8(1) of Order 34 permits the mortgagor to redeem
the mortgaged property before the confirmation of the sale held in pursuance of a final decree in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 39

redemption suit, unless such final decree debars the mortgagor from all right to redeem the
mortgaged property which, as noticed earlier, is provided for in sub-rule (3)(a) of Rule 8 of Order 34
relating to a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage. Thus, the provisions of Order
34 have laid down in clear terms the circumstances when the right of redemption of the mortgagor
would stand extinguished. It is also clear that in a suit for redemption, a mortgage other than a
mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage, the mortgagor has right of redemption
even after the sale has taken place pursuant to the final decree, but before the confirmation of such
sale. In view of these provisions, the question of merger of mortgage debt in the decretal debt does
not at all arise. We are, therefore, of the view that the decision in Sheo Narain case [Sheo Narain Sah
v. Deolochan Kuer, AIR 1948 Pat 208 : ILR 26 Pat 97] , insofar as it lays down the merger of the
mortgage debt in the decretal debt and the consequent extinguishment of the right of redemption of

Ramgonda Patil [(1988) 3 SCC 298 :

and to hold and enjoy as he was entitled to hold and enjoy it before the mortgage. If he is prevented
from doing so or is prevented from redeeming the mortgage, such prevention is bad in law. If he is
so prevented, the equity of redemption is affected by that whether aptly or not, and it has always

34. In Vora Aminbai Ibrahim v. Vora Taherali Mohmedali [AIR 1998 Guj 31 : (1998) 1 Guj LR 760] it
is stated thus: (AIR pp. 35-36, para 11) "11. So far as the second substantial question of law is
concerned it would be useful to consider what is redemption and what is scope of a suit for that
purpose. 'Redemption' presupposes existence of a 'mortgage'. 'Mortgage' as defined in the Transfer
of Property Act, is the transfer of an interest in immovable property for the purpose of securing the
payment of a loan. A mortgage is created by act of parties. In usufructuary mortgage, the transfer is
made of the right of the possession and enjoyment of the usufruct. The rights of a usufructuary
mortgagee form part of the bundle of rights which constitute ownership the remainder still remains
with the mortgagor and can be transferred by him. On the execution of a mortgage two distinct
rights are carved out, namely, (i) the mortgagee's right; and (ii) the mortgagor's right. The
mortgagee's right is the right of security for the respondent of his loan. The mortgagor's right is as
indicated in Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act i.e. after the principal money has become
due, the mortgagor has a right to pay the mortgage-money and on such payment he has a right to
require the mortgagee, among others, to deliver possession. This right cannot be

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR extinguished except by the act of parties
or by a decree of a court. This right is called the right to redeem and a suit to enforce it is called a
suit for redemption. Thus, the scope of a suit for redemption is primarily to enforce the right to
make payment of the mortgage-money. A claim to redeem a mortgage actually does not attach to the
land, although the decree passed in that suit may ultimately affect possession which is also an
interest in land. An owner has a bundle of interests in property. By executing a mortgage he
transfers only some interest to the mortgagee and that also by way of security. That interest is
confined to realisation of mortgage debt, which, in the event of non-payment, may be realized out of
the said security. What remains with the mortgagor after execution of the mortgage, is the
ownership of the property, minus the interest transferred, and the right to repay the
mortgage-money and to get the burden of security discharged. That right has been created in the
mortgagor and not in the property. Thus, when a mortgagor enforces his right to redeem, he does
not enforce a right in land."
It was further observed: (AIR p. 36, para 11) "However, there is no manner of doubt that successive
suits for redemption of mortgage can be filed till right of redemption is not extinguished. Having
regard to provisions of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act and Order 23 Rules 1 and 2 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, it will have to be held that dismissal of earlier suit for redemption whether
as abated or as withdrawn or in default would not debar the mortgagor from filing a suit for
redemption and that such
- 74 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR second suit for redemption to redeem
the same mortgage can be brought so long as the mortgage subsists and the right of redemption is
not extinguished by afflux of time or by a decree of court passed in the prescribed form. This is
because the right of redemption is an incident of a subsisting mortgage and is inseparable from it so
that the right is coextensive with the mortgage itself. It subsists so long as mortgage itself subsists
until it is appropriately and effectively extinguished and the extinguishment of the right of
redemption can only happen either by the act of the parties concerned, or by a proper decree of the
competent court. The right of redemption can be extinguished as provided in Section 60 of the
Transfer of Property Act and when it is alleged to have been extinguished by a decree the decree
should run strictly in accordance with the form prescribed for the purpose."
35. In Pranil Kumar Sett v. Kishorilal Bysack [AIR 2003 Cal 1] (AIR at p. 4, para 14) it has been
stated:
"Moreover the right of redemption of the mortgagor in a suit for foreclosure subsists
till final decree debarring the defendant (mortgagor) from all rights to redeem the
mortgage property has been passed...."
36. We are therefore, of the opinion that although by reason of preliminary decree in the suit for
redemption of usufructuary mortgage, the court may fix the time for payment of the amount
declared due but default in depositing such payment would not debar him from a right to redeem

37. In the aforementioned backdrop the decisions of this Court relied upon by Mr Bobde are
required to be considered.
38. In K. Parameswaran Pillai case [(1993) 4 SCC 431] whereupon Mr Bobde has placed strong
reliance, a suit was filed by the successors-in-interest of the mortgagee of the usufructuary
mortgage. Consequent to subrogation, the appellant became a mere puisne mortgagee and the
respondent therein after the preliminary decree transposed herself to be a mortgagor. The direction
of the Court in the preliminary decree was, inter alia, as under: (SCC p. 438, para 5) "5. (3) And it is
hereby further ordered and decreed that, in default of payment as aforesaid, the defendants may
apply to the court for a final decree for the sale of the mortgaged property: and on such application
being made, the mortgaged property or a sufficient part thereof shall be directed to be sold; and for
the purpose of such sale the defendant shall produce before the court or such officer as it appoints
all documents in his possession if power relating to the mortgaged property."

excludes the right to the mortgagee to apply for foreclosure or sale or redemption. Necessary
consequence is that so long as the right subsists,
- 76 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR though there is delay in compliance of
the condition imposed in the preliminary decree, the right of redemption to the mortgagor is not
lost. It will be barred only on expiry of the period of limitation prescribed under the Limitation Act.
The reasons are obvious. Order 34 Rule 8(3) does not give any right to the mortgagee but the right is
given only to the mortgagor, to seek redemption of the usufructuary mortgage in a decree under
Rule 8(3) of Order 34. The mortgagee, having been in possession and enjoyment of the hypotheca is
not disabled by the preliminary decree. On the other hand the liability continues to subsist against
the mortgagor. Therefore, it is up to the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage. Till then his liability
under the mortgage continues to run on the estate. It is, therefore, clear that the limitation to file an
application under Order 34 Rule 8(1) to pass a final decree for redemption, other than the
preliminary decree for redemption of usufructuary mortgage, starts running and continues to run its
course from the date of expiry of the period fixed in the preliminary decree, unless it is stayed or
suspended or the time prescribed in the preliminary decree is extended by an order of the court. In
its absence on expiry of the limitation of three years from the date fixed in the preliminary decree
expired under Article 137 of the Schedule to Limitation Act, 1963 (Article 181 of Schedule I of old

Act), the plaintiff is debarred to enforce the right to pass the final decree. But in the case of
preliminary decree for redemption of usufructuary mortgage no limitation begins to run until
deposit is made though there is a conditional preliminary

mortgagor for compliance thereof."
(emphasis supplied)
40. This Court, thus, made a distinction on the applicability of limitation as regards initiation of a
proceeding for passing a final decree between other types of mortgages and usufructuary mortgage.
This Court in no uncertain terms held:
(SCC p. 440, para 9) "9. The proceeding in the preliminary decree does not get
terminated by dismissal of IA No. 58 of 1972, on 26-6-1975 or for non-prosecution.
Till date of passing the final decree and its execution or till the remedy is barred by
limitation under Article 137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 the court has
power and jurisdiction to entertain the application to pass the final decree. At any
time before the remedy is barred, it is open to the plaintiff to deposit the redemption
money under the preliminary decree. The dismissal of the earlier application or
non-prosecution, therefore, does not per se bar the right of the plaintiff. But if
remedy to enforce preliminary decree for the redemption is barred by the limitation,
thereafter the right remains unenforceable. The deposit, therefore, is non est and the
court cannot proceed to pass final decree as the remedy is lost. Therefore, the mere
dismissal of the first application for non-prosecution and withdrawal of the
redemption money deposited thereunder per se creates no bar to entertain second
application. Equally instead of availing the remedy of depositing the redemption
amount in the
- 78 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR pending proceedings under Rule 8(1) of
Order 34, the respondent instituted an independent suit for redemption. Per force, though it does
not operate as bar to maintain the application to pass final decree, court cannot proceed further with
the application. Otherwise conflicting decisions would arise giving rise to multiplicity of
proceedings. The court would stop to proceed further in the matter. In view of the finding that the
application to pass final decree is barred by limitation, the trial court has no jurisdiction to proceed
with the application under Rule 8(3) of Order 34 and to pass final decree. Accordingly, though for
different reasons, the decree of the High Court, in the second appeal, is legal and does not warrant
interference. The appeal is dismissed but without costs."

44.6. In the case of Narayan Deorao Javle (D) through LRs vs. Krishna and Others reported in
(2021) 17 SCC 626 , paragraph 14 to 19 and 27 reads as under:
"14. In Allokam Peddabbayya [Allokam Peddabbayya v. Allahabad Bank, (2017) 8
SCC 272 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 62] , the purchaser filed a suit for injunction. The suit
was dismissed. The appeal against the judgment and decree of the trial court was also

in execution were dismissed, so is the appeal against an order of dismissal of
objections was dismissed. It was in these circumstances, this Court held as under :
(SCC p. 279, paras 12 & 14) "12. The sale certificate was issued to Defendant 2 on 2-7-
1997 followed by delivery of possession in Execution Petition No. 203 of 1997. The
objection of the plaintiffs in Execution Appeal No. 996 of 1997 was also rejected. Only
thereafter the plaintiffs instituted OS No. 96 of 1999 for redemption of the mortgage
under Order 34 Rule 1CPC contending that they were willing to deposit the mortgage
dues and that the decree in OS No. 68 of 1987 was not binding on them because they
had not been impleaded as party in the same. In cross-examination, the plaintiffs
acknowledged having been informed by their lawyer at the time of purchase, of the
mortgage created by deposit of title deeds, by Defendants 3 and 4.
***
14. No challenge was laid out in OS No. 96 of 1999, either to the auction-sale or to set
aside the sale certificate issued to Defendant 2. The reliance upon Order 34 Rule
1CPC is completely misconceived as under Rule 8 the right to redemption survived
only till confirmation of the sale and not thereafter. The suit was instituted only after
issuance of the sale certificate and the question for redemption had become
irrelevant."

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR In view of the said fact, the judgment
referred to by the learned counsel for the respondent is not applicable to the facts of the present
case.
15. Still further, in terms of Section 91 of the Act, the plaintiff having stepped into the shoes of the
mortgagor in respect of land purchased by him has a right to redeem the land mortgaged. In
addition, Order 34 Rule 1 of the Code provides that all persons having an interest either in the
mortgage- security or in the right of redemption shall be joined as parties to any suit relating to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 45
N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
mortgage including suit for foreclosure. The original mortgagors i.e. Defendants 1 and 2 denied the
plaintiff's right to redeem the property though admitting they have borrowed Rs 1000 from the
plaintiff. It was pleaded that the plaintiff was put in possession of the suit property for ten years and,
therefore, the plaintiff was required to resell the property to Defendants 1 and 2. But the said
defendant has not supported such plea in evidence. Defendants 1 and 2 entered into compromise
with the mortgagee to pay the mortgage amount. The said mortgage amount was not paid which led
to passing of the final decree. Thus, it is a case of collusion between the original mortgagors and the
mortgagee so as to defeat the right of the plaintiff.
16. The equity of redemption means a right to redeem the property based upon equitable principles.
This Court in a judgment reported as Shivdev Singh v. Sucha Singh [Shivdev Singh v. Sucha Singh,
(2000) 4 SCC 326] , held that the right of redemption recognised under the Act is a statutory and
legal right which cannot be extinguished. This Court held as under : (SCC p. 330, para 8)

32. Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that at any time after the money
becomes due, the mortgagor has a right, on payment or tender, at a proper time and place, of the
mortgage-money to require the mortgagee to deliver the mortgage deed and all documents relating
to the mortgaged property, and where the mortgagee is in possession of the mortgaged property, to
deliver possession thereof to the mortgagor. In Shivdev Singh v. Sucha Singh [Shivdev Singh v.
Sucha Singh, (2000) 4 SCC 326] , it was held as under : (SCC p. 330, para 8) '8. ... The right of
redemption recognised under the Transfer of Property Act is thus a statutory and legal right which
cannot be extinguished by any agreement made at the time of mortgage as part of the mortgage
transaction.' "
19. The equity of redemption is a right which is subsidiary to the right of ownership.
Such right is not over and above the right of ownership purchased by the plaintiff.
The expression "equity of redemption" is a convenient maxim but an owner, who has
stepped into the shoes of the mortgagor, after the purchase from the mortgagor but

Bala Sasmal [Mrutunjay Pani v. Narmada Bala Sasmal, 1961 SCC OnLine SC 41 : AIR
1961 SC 1353] . It was an appeal filed by the mortgagee who claimed to have
purchased the equity of redemption. The argument of the appellant was that the
mortgagee has failed to pay rent which was the responsibility of the mortgagor in
terms of the mortgage deed. For the default of payment of arrears of rent, the
property was put to sale and was purchased by the mortgagee. Therefore, the remedy
of the mortgagor is to seek setting aside of sale. It was held as under : (AIR pp.
1355-56, para 7) "7. The legal position may be stated thus : (1) The governing
principle is "once a mortgage always a mortgage" till the mortgage is terminated by
the act of the parties themselves, by merger or by order of the court. (2) Where a
mortgagee purchases the equity of redemption in execution of his mortgage decree
with the leave of court or in execution of a mortgage or money decree obtained by a
third party, the equity of redemption may be extinguished; and, in that event, the
mortgagor cannot sue for redemption without getting the sale set aside. (3) Where a
mortgagor purchases the mortgaged property by reason of a default committed by
him the mortgage is not extinguished and the relationship of mortgagor and

subsist even thereafter, for his purchase of the equity of redemption is only in trust
for the mortgagor."
The said judgment does not advance the case of the mortgagee."
44.7. In the case of Harminder Singh (supra) the relevant paragraph reads as under:
"Since the mortgage was not redeemed by the mortgagor within a period of 30 years,
the plaintiff filed a suit for declaration that she had become the owner after the
extinguishment of the mortgage rights and for permanent injunction.
The suit was decreed by the trial Court. Such decree was affirmed by the First
Appellate Court as well but in Second Appeal, the suit was dismissed relying upon the
judgment of this Court in 'Sampuran Singh Vs. Niranjan Kaur', reported in (1999) 2
SCC 679.
After the judgment was rendered by the Single Judge Bench, the Full Bench of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court in 'Ram Kishan & Ors. Vs. Sheo Ram & Ors.'
reported in AIR 2008 P&H 77 held that once a usufructuary mortgage is created, the
mortgagor has a right to redeem the mortgage at any point of time on the principle
that once a mortgage always a mortgage. Such judgment was affirmed by this Court
in 'Singh Ram (Dead) Through Legal

44.8. In the case of N. Nanjappa and Another vs. Siddiah and Others reported in (1972) SCC Online
KAR 130, paragraph 8 reads as under:
"8. The usufructuary mortgagee in this case, as already found, was able to maintain
possession of the suit properties on the basis of the title derived by him under the
mortgage deeds, and therefore he is liable in law to hold the mortgaged property for
the benefit of the mortgagor. He cannot be permitted to make use of his position as a
mortgagee for depriving the mortgagor of the equity of redemption. The same is the
principle underlying in the legal maxim "once a mortgage, always a mortgage". It is
the right of a mortgagor on redemption to get back the subject of the mortgage and to
hold and enjoy the same as he was entitled to hold and enjoy before the mortgage.
Unless the right conferred on the mortgagor under Section 60 of the Transfer of
Property Act has been extinguished by the act of parties or by a decree of a court, the
mortgagee cannot prevent the mortgagor from securing a decree for redemption. I
am of the opinion that in the instant case, defendants 1 and 2 have not been able to

44.9. In the case of Ishwar Dass Jain (D) through LRs vs. Sohan Lal (D) through LRs reported in
(2000) 1 SCC 434, paragraph 32 reads as under:
"32. The appellate court, in our view, went wrong in thinking that the plaintiff had
only a half share in the property. The defendant's title was a derivative title as
mortgagee. Having come into possession of the whole property as a mortgagee from
the plaintiff, treating the plaintiff as full owner it was not open to the defendant to
question the title of the plaintiff. In Tasker v. Small [(1837) 3 My & Cr 63 : 5 LJ Ch
321] Lord Cottenham said:
"To him (mortgagee) it is immaterial, upon repayment of the money, whether the
mortgagor's title was good or bad. He is not at liberty to dispute it any more than a
tenant is at liberty to dispute his landlord's title."
A usufructuary mortgagee cannot deny the title of his mortgagor. Nor can he set up adverse
possession unless he actually leaves the holding and re-enters under a different status (Jai Nandan
Tewari v. Umrao Koeri [AIR 1929 All 305 : 119 IC 568] and Shri Ram v. Thakur Dhan Bahadur

43. This Court in Narandas Karsondas [Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247] ,
upon examination of Section 60 of the 1882 Act, held that the mortgagor's right to redeem will be
extinguished only after completion of sale by a registered deed, and made the following relevant
observations reproduced below : (SCC pp. 253-55, paras 28, 33-35 & 37) "28. The rights and
liabilities of mortgagor are dealt with in Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act. It is that at any

either to re-transfer the mortgaged property to him or to such third person as he may direct, or to
execute and to have registered an acknowledgment in writing that any right in derogation of his
interest transferred to the mortgagee has been extinguished. There is a proviso that the right
conferred by this section has not been extinguished by the act of the parties or by decree of a court.
The right conferred by Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act is called a right to redeem.
Therefore, the said Section 60 provides for a right of redemption provided that the right has not
been extinguished by the act of parties.

33. In India, the word "transfer" is defined with reference to the word "convey". The word "transfer"
in English law in its narrower and more usual sense refers to the transfer of an estate in land.
Section 205 of the Law of Property Act in England defines:"Conveyance" includes a mortgage,
charge, lease, assent, vesting declaration, vesting instrument. The word "conveys" in Section 5 of the
Transfer of Property Act is used in the wider sense of conveying ownership.
34. The Transfer of Property Act is available to the mortgagor unless it has been extinguished by the
act of parties. The combined effect of Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 17 of the
Registration Act is that a contract for sale in respect of immovable property of the value of more
than one hundred rupees without
- 91 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR registration cannot extinguish the equity
of redemption. In India it is only on execution of the conveyance and registration of transfer of the
mortgagor's interest by registered instrument that the mortgagor's right of redemption will be
extinguished. The conferment of power to sell without intervention of the Court in a mortgage deed
by itself will not deprive the mortgagor of his right to redemption. The extinction of the right of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102145686/ 51
N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
redemption has to be subsequent to the deed conferring such power. The right of redemption is not
extinguished at the expiry of the period. The equity of redemption is not extinguished by mere
contract for sale.
35. The mortgagor's right to redeem will survive until there has been completion of sale by the
mortgagee by a registered deed. In England a sale of property takes place by agreement but it is not
so in our country. The power to sell shall not be exercised unless and until notice in writing
requiring payment of the principal money has been served on the mortgagor. Further Section 69(3)
of the Transfer of Property Act shows that when a sale has been made in professed exercise of such a
power, the title of the purchaser shall not be impeachable on the ground that no case had arisen to
authorise the sale. Therefore, until the sale is complete by registration the mortgagor does not lose
right of redemption.

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR cannot be held that the mortgagor lost

redeem unless the sale of the property was complete by registration in accordance with the
provisions of the Registration Act."
(emphasis supplied)
44. A similar view was taken by this Court in L.K. Trust v. EDC Ltd. [L.K. Trust v. EDC Ltd., (2011) 6
SCC 780 : (2011) 3 SCC (Civ) 475] wherein it was observed as follows : (SCC p. 798, paras 53-55)
"53. On analysis of arguments advanced at the Bar, this Court finds that the proposition that in
India it is only on execution of conveyance and the registration of transfer of the mortgagor's
interest by registered instrument that the mortgagor's right of redemption stands extinguished is
well settled. Further it is not the case of the appellant that a registered sale deed had been executed
between the appellant Trust and Respondent 1 pursuant to the Resolution passed by Respondent 1
and, therefore, in terms of Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 no title relating to the
disputed property had passed to the appellant at all.
54. What is ruled inNarandas Karsondas [Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247] is
that in India, there is no equity or right in property created in favour of the purchaser by the
contract between the mortgagee and the proposed purchaser and in view of the

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR fact that only on execution of
conveyance, ownership passes from one party to another, it cannot be held that the mortgagor lost
the right of redemption just because the property was put to auction. In that case, the respondent
housing society, the mortgagor, had taken loan from the co-respondent finance society and
mortgaged the property to it under an English mortgage. On default, the mortgagee exercised its
right under the mortgage to sell the property without intervention of the court and after notice, put
the property to sale by public auction. The appellant auction- purchaser paid the sums due. Before
the sale was completed by registration, etc. the mortgagor sought to exercise his right of redemption
by tendering the amount due. The appellant had based his case on the plea that in such a situation
the mortgagee acts as agent of the mortgagor and hence binds him.
55. Rejecting the appeal, this Court inNarandas Karsondas case [Narandas Karsondas v. S.A.
Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247] has held that the right of redemption which is embodied in Section 60
of the Transfer of Property Act is available to the mortgagor unless it has been extinguished by the
act of parties or by decree of a court. What is held by this Court is that, in India it is only on
execution of the conveyance and registration of transfer of the mortgagor's interest by registered
instrument that the mortgagor's right of redemption will be extinguished but the conferment of
power to sell the mortgaged property without intervention of the court, in a mortgage deed, in itself,
will not deprive the mortgagor of his right of redemption. This Court in the
- 94 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR said case further explained that the
extinction of the right of redemption has to be subsequent to the deed conferring such power and
the right to redemption is not extinguished at the expiry of the period. This Court emphasised in the
said decision that the equity of redemption is not extinguished by mere contract for sale."
(emphasis supplied)
45. Following the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforementioned cases, in the present
case, the mortgage is of usufructuary mortgage, the right to seek redemption arises on the date when
a Mortgagor pay or tender the amount to the Mortgagee or deposit the same in the Court as
mortgaged money. It is well settled principle in law in the aforementioned cases that "once a
mortgage, always a mortgage unless redeemed". The Mortgagee cannot claim right over the
mortgaged property just because long period of time has been lapsed since in the case of
usufructuary mortgage, unlike other types of mortgages, the Mortgagee cannot claim ownership
over the suit property even after the expiry of thirty years from the date of mortgage. In this regard,
I find force in the

NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR submission made by learned Senior
Counsel appearing for the appellants (mortgagor) to emphasising on the judgment of Hon'ble
Supreme Court particularly paragraphs 14 and 15 in the case of Singh Ram (supra).

N Narasimhaswamy vs S Narasimhaiah on 26 September, 2025
It is also to be noted from the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ram Rattan
(supra), wherein it is held that, in a suit for usufructuary mortgage, where the right to recover the
possession by the Mortgagor as per Section 62 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 commences on
payment of mortgaged money.
It is pertinent to mention herein that the right of usufructuary mortgage is not only an equitable
right but it has a statutory recognition under Section 62 of Transfer of Property Act. Applying the
aforementioned principles to the present case, wherein the claim made by the legal representatives
of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor) seeking redemption of mortgage, despite the unregistered shara at
Exhibit P15, the Mortgagor-Kunnegowda and his legal representatives have right to claim
redemption of
- 96 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR mortgage as long as the Mortgagee- S.
Narasimhaiah or his legal representatives, have not filed suit for foreclosure nor made any claim for
return of the amount due to them.
46. In view of the legal position enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Jayasingh
Dnyanu Mhoprekar (supra) and in the case of Achaldas Durgaji Oswal (supra), wherein a period of
five years was contractually stipulated in the Mortgage Deed by mutual consent of the parties, it has
been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that such stipulation is intended to operate for the benefit
of the Mortgagee. Any restriction imposed upon the mortgagor from exercising the right of
redemption during the said interregnum emanates from the terms of the Mortgage Deed between
the parties.
However, the fixation of such a period cannot, in law, be construed as prescribing a limitation
period under Section 62 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The said stipulation is merely a
contractual term in the Mortgage Deed to protect the interest of the Mortgagee and does not
- 97 -
NC: 2025:KHC:40259 2482 of 2017 &1884/2023 HC-KAR curtail or extinguish the statutory right
of redemption vested in the Mortgagor.
47. In that view of the matter, I am of the view that the appellants in RSA No.1884 of 2023 and RSA
No.2483 of 2017 have made out case for interference in the impugned judgment and decree passed
by the Courts below. Hence, the substantial question of law and the questions arises for
consideration as stated above favours the legal representatives of Kunnegowda (Mortgagor) -
appellants in RSA No.1884 of 2023 and RSA No.2482 of 2017. Hence, I pass the following:
