3. By consent, both the writ petition as well as the miscellaneous case were heard together and
disposed of by this common order.
4. Heard Mr. A. Mohendro, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned AG for
the respondents.
5. Brief facts are as follows:
Holy Spirit Catholic Church is a Church situated at Tribal Colony, New Checkon,
Imphal East and the settlers of New Checkon area who profess Christianity (Catholic)
felt the need of a Catholic Church in the locality and, as such, some volunteers have
made efforts for establishment of a Catholic Church. The volunteers tried to purchase
a piece of land suitable for establishment of a Church. After rigorous search, the
volunteers met the owners of the land where the present Church is situated and
requested the owners to transfer a piece of land for construction of a Catholic Church.
The owners agreed to allow the volunteers to use a piece of land measuring 0.16 acre
out of their land for construction of the Church, but the owners refused to transfer
the piece of land.
5.1. After getting permission from the land owners, namely Rajkumari Victoria and
Rajkumar Tamphasana Devi, the Church was constructed in the year 1990. Initially
the structure was Kutcha type and later on a semi-pucca Church was constructed in
the year 1998. On 16.8.2021, the Parish Pariest, St. paul Parish, Sangaiprou issued a
certificate to the effect that Holy Spirit Catholic Church at Tribal Colony, New
Checkon is one of the unit (entity) Churches of Catholic Christians. The Holy Spirit
Catholic Church have at present 67 members, representing each family and about
250 persons have been attending the Church regularly.
5.2. In the year 2018, the Director of Settlement and Land Records, Manipur
addressed a letter to the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East regarding unauthorized
construction of religious structures in connection with PIL No.19 of 2013, wherein it
has been stated that Holy Spirit Catholic Church was constructed over a piece of land,
which is part and parcel of land under C.S.Dag No.265. It has also been stated that
the land under C.S. Dag No.265 of Patta No.639 measuring 8.00 acre, Ingkhol class
was recorded in the name of Victoria Devi and Rajkumari Tamphasana Devi.
5.3. The petitioner purchased a piece of land measuring 0.16 acre on the south
eastern portion, out of the land under C/R 982 DLR, patta No.639(new) covered by
C.S. Dag No.265 measuring an area of 8.00 acre Ingkhol class situate within the
Revenue Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai, Porompat Sub Division from its
new owners, namely Rajkumar Balaram and Chongtham Bijoy vide registered sale
deed dated 21.12.2018 in the name of Holy Spirit Catholic Church. Thereafter, the
name of Holy Spirit Catholic Church has been mutated in the land records of patta
land as co-pattadars concerning the south-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/115632457/ 3
The Holy Spirit Catholic Church vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 March, 2023
eastern portion measuring 0.16 acre. After separation, the land of Holy Spirit Catholic Church has
been brought under Patta No.639/902 (new) covered by C.S. Dag No.265/1003 and the revenue for
the land has been paid from the year 2019. The members of the Church made development works in
or around the Church building and a compound wall fencing and gate have also been constructed.
5.4. While so, all of a sudden on 24.12.2020, the Sub Divisional Officer, Porompat issued a notice in
connection with Eviction Case No.17 of 2020 purporting to have been taken up under the Manipur
Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1978 alleging that the Holy Spirit
Catholic Church encroached over the Government land and also directed to show cause the said
notice. On 30.12.2020, the petitioner Church submitted a reply narrating all the facts.
5.5. On 4.1.2021, the Commissioner (Revenue) issued allotment orders thereby allotting a piece of
land in favour of Chief Engineer (Building) PWD for construction of Government Residential
Quarters and the land allotted does not include the land under C.S. Dag No.265/1003 measuring
0.16 acre. On 20.3.2021, the Principal Secretary and Link Secretary (Works)-cum-Estate Officer
notified construction of new Government Residential quarters by demolishing the present old
structures of Government quarters. The patta land of Holy Spirit Catholic Church is not included in
the land allotted to the PWD for construction of multi-stored Government quarters.
5.6. On 18.3.2021, the Survey and Settlement Officer-I submitted a report giving details of
unauthorized religious structures. In the said report, the Survey and Settlement Officer furnished
wrong information to the Deputy Commissioner stating that the land of Holy Spirit Catholic Church
covered by C.S. Dag No.265(P) measuring 0.156 acre is patta land of Chief Engineer (Building)
PWD. Having felt suspicious about the acts of the revenue officials, the second petitioner filed an
application seeking copy of jamapandi. A certified copy of jamabandi with cancelled name of the
pattadar has been issued on 5.4.2021 and the cancellation of the name of Holy Spirit Catholic
Church without affording any opportunity of being heard is bad in law.
5.7. According to the petitioners, they have apprehension that the Government will take steps to
evict the Holy Spirit Catholic Church from its lawfully acquired land by alleging that the Church is
unauthrised occupant of the Government land without affording a chance of being heard. In the
happening of such event, the faith of the families who are attending the Holy Spirit Catholic Church
will be at jeopardy. The respondents have no power to evict the Holy Spirit Catholic Church from the
land without adopting proper course of law. Hence, the petitioners have filed this writ petition.
6. Resisting the writ petition, the first respondent filed affidavit-in- opposition stating that the land
covered by C.S. Dag No.265 was recorded as Sarkari Khas in the original Dag Chitha in the year
1960. When the land records were transferred from the office of the Deputy Commissioner,
Porompat in the year around 2004/2005 to Directorate of Settlement and Land Records, Manipur
for the purpose of re-survey, the names of Victoria Devi and Rajkumari Tamphasana Devi were
found recorded as co-pattadars in the jamabandi under Patta No.639(new) covered by C.S. Dag
No.265 measuring an area of 8.00 acre of Revenue Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai without
any valid documents. Later on names of Chongtham Bijoy and R.K.Balaram Singh were recorded as
co-pattadars vide Mutation Case No.421/AS&SO/IE-II dated 3.11.2018 and 429/AS & SO/IE-II
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/115632457/ 4
The Holy Spirit Catholic Church vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 March, 2023
dated 24.11.2018 respectively. However, the said jamabandi under Patta No.639(new) covered by
C.S. Dag No.265 measuring an area of 8.00 acre of Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai were
declared as not genuine for lack of relevant allotment order/documents vide order dated 13.10.2020
passed by As & SO-V, DSLR in Rev. Misc. Case No.19 of 2020 after giving notice dated 6.10.2020 to
the concerned pattadars and the names of pattadars were cancelled and corrected as per above
order.
6.1. It is stated that the land in question is State land and subsequently included in the land allotted
to the Chief Engineer (Building), Public Works Department, Manipur for construction of
Government Residential quarters vide order dated 4.1.2021 issued by the Commissioner (Revenue),
Government of Manipur. The alleged land owners, Rajkumari Victoria, Rajkumari Tamphasana
Devi, Rajkumar Balaram and Chongtham Bijoy from whom the petitioners purchased the land in
question have no right and title over the land where Catholic Church was constructed, as the former
alleged land owner from whom he purchased the said land has no right and title over the said land.
6.2. It is stated that the sale deed being No.3224 (v) of the Sub-Registrar, Imphal East District had
been declared as non-est vide order dated 8.12.2020 by the Deputy Commissioner and the names of
the pattadars were cancelled. The petitioners have constructed the Church building and other
structures without proper verification as to the right and title of the land owners from whom the
Church purchased the land. As such the construction of Church building and other structures is at
their own risk. Since the land in question is a Government land, notice for eviction was served upon
the petitioners and others who are encroachers to show cause why they should not vacate the
premises. Since the petitioners have no right and title over the land in question, the writ petition is
liable to be dismissed.
7. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that Holy Spirit Catholic Church was
constructed in the year 1990 in C.S. Dag No.265 after getting permission from the land owners
Rajakumari Victoria and Rajkumar Tamphasana Devi. The Church had purchased a piece of land
measuring 0.16 acre on the south-eastern portion, out of the land under C/R 982 DLR, Patta
No.639(new) covered by C.S. Dag No.265 measuring an area of 8.00 acre situate within the Revenue
Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai from the new owners, Rajkumar Balaram and Chongtham
Bijoy vide sale deed dated 21.12.2018. The Church has been mutated in the land records and has
been brought under Patta No.639/902(new) covered by C.S. Dag No.265/1003 measuring 0.16 acre
and separate jamabandi was also issued in the name of the Church. While so, the SDO, Porompat
issued a notice dated 24.12.2020 in connection with Eviction Case No.17 of 2020 purporting to have
been taken up under the Manipur Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1978
alleging that the petitioners have encroached over the Government land.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that though the Commissioner (Revenue),
Government of Manipur issued allotment order thereby allotting a piece of land in favour of the
Chief Engineer (Building), PWD for construction of Government Residential Quarters, the area of
land allotted does not include the land under C.S. Dag No.265/1003 measuring 0.16 acre i.e. the
land of Holy Spirit Catholic Church and the said land measuring 0.16 acre have distinct identity.
While so, the Survey and Settlement Officer, DSLR, Manipur, submitted a report dated 18.3.2021 to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/115632457/ 5
The Holy Spirit Catholic Church vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 March, 2023
the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East stating that the land of Holy Spirit Catholic Church covered
under C.S. Dag No.265(P) measuring 0.156 acre is a patta land of Chief Engineer (Building). Having
felt suspicious about the acts of the revenue officials, the second petitioner filed an application for
certified copy of the jamabandi and in the certified copy of jamabandi, the petitioners found
cancellation of the name of Holy Spirit Catholic Church without affording any opportunity to the
petitioners. Since the acts of the respondents amount to violation of the right of Church guaranteed
by Articles 14, 19, 21, 25 and 26 of the Constitution and the petitioners have strong apprehension
that Government will take steps to evict Holy Spirit Catholic Church from its lawfulfully acquired
land by alleging that the Church is unauthorized occupant of Government land, the petitioners have
approached this Court not to evict the Church from the land in question. Such a prayer can be
allowed in the interest of worshippers of the Church.
9. On the other hand, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondents submitted
that the preparation of jamabandi under Patta No.639(new) covered by C.S. Dag No.265 measuring
an area of 8.00 acre of Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai was declared as not genuine for lack
of relevant documents vide order dated 13.10.2020 passed by the AS & SO-V, DSLR in Rev. Misc.
Case No.19 of 2020 after giving notice dated 6.10.2020 to the concerned pattadars and the names of
the pattadars were cancelled and corrected. Resultantly, the sale deed dated 20.12.2018 referred to
by the petitioners was also declared as non-est vide order dated 8.12.2020 by the Deputy
Commissioner. Since the name of the pattadars was cancelled and the sale deed stood in the name of
the Church was declared as non-est and also the land in question was included in the allotment of
the land to the Chief Engineer (Building) PWD for construction of Government Residential
Quarters, the Church in question has no right over the same and, therefore, the respondent
authorities are right in initiating eviction proceedings against the Church. Thus, a prayer has been
made to dismiss the writ petition and to vacate the interim order granted in the writ petition.
10. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
11. It is the plea of the petitioners that Holy Spirit Catholic Church was constructed in year 1990
after getting permission from the land owners namely Rajkumari Victoria and Rajkumar
Tamphasana Devi. The further plea of the petitioners is that, on 20.12.2018, Holy Spirit Catholic
Church had purchased a piece of land measuring 0.16 acres on the south-eastern portion out of the
land under C/R 982 DLR, Patta No.639(new) covered under C.S. Dag No.265 situate within the
Revenue Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai, Porompat Sub Division from its new owners,
Rajkumar Balaram and Chongtham Bijoy. It is also the plea of the petitioners that separate
jamabandi was issued in the name of Holy Spirit Catholic Church for the piece of land under C.S.
Dag No.639/902 in Patta No.265/1003 measuring an extent of 0.16 acres. Therefore, the initiation
of action against Holy Spirit Catholic Church alleging that it has been constructed on a Government
land is totally against the law and, therefore, Holy Spirit Catholic Church should not evicted from
the land in question.
12. On the contrary, the respondent State contended that the land in question is a Government land
and the petitioners or even their alleged vendors have not right over the same. Further, the names of
pattadars found in the revenue records was declared as not genuine thereby the names of pattadars

The Holy Spirit Catholic Church vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 March, 2023
were cancelled and corrected in the revenue records vide order dated 13.10.2020 passed in Rev.
Misc. Case No.19 of 2020 after notice to the pattadars. Since the land in question is a Government
land, the same was allotted to the Chief Engineer (Building), PWD for construction of Government
Residential Quarters.
13. As could be seen from the records, on 6.10.2020, the Assistant Survey and Settlement Officer-V
issued a notice to (1) R.K.Gopalsana; (2) Victoria; (3) R.K.Tamphasama Devi; (4) R.K.Balaram
Singh; (5) Ch. Bijoy Singh; (6) Philem bankimSingh; (7) Karam (N) Yumnam (O) Ibempishak Devi;
(8) Sawnwithangee and (9) Holy Spirit Catholic Church calling upon them to furnish relevant
documents in connection with C.S. Dag No.265 and its corresponding C.S. Dag No.265/988,
265/694/697, 265/694 and 265/1003 of Revenue Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai on or
before 12.10.2020. The said notice was responded by the aforesaid persons and after hearing them,
the Assistant Survey and Settlement Office-V has passed an order dated 13.10.2020 in Revenue
Misc. Case No.19 of 2020. The order dated 13.10.2020 reads thus:
"Take note of the AS&SO-V letter No.700/85/AS & SO-
V/Misc/019/DSLR dted 03.10.2020 this court registered the Revenue Misc Case No.19 of 2020 for
the purpose of re-verification of the land records relating to Re-verification of lad records relating to
the land covered by C.S. Dag N.265 and its corresponding C.S. Dag No.265/988, 265/694/697,
265/694 and 265/1003 of revenue village No.26/Wangkheirakpam Leikai, Imphal East, Porompat
Tehsil, Manipur.
Notice dated 06.10.2020 was served upon R.K.Gopalsana s/o Gopeshwor Singh of Rajbari,
Smt.Victoria w/o Sanayaima of Rajbari, R.K.Balaram Singh s/o RK Victoria of Rajbari, Ch. Bijoy

The Holy Spirit Catholic Church vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 March, 2023
On the other hand Sawnwithangee w/o T.Vaiphei of New Checkon submitted a copy of Jamabandi
for the land covered by C.S. Dag No.265/988 an area of 0.16 acre patta No.885 Village No.26-
Wangkheriakpam Leikai, Porompat, Imphal East along with allotment Order N.21/74/73-R dated
27.08.1974 relating allotment of land covered by C.S. Dag No.265 measuring an area of 0.16 acre
under Village No.26-Wangkheriakpam Leikai along with other related documents.
This court noted that excepting in the case of Sawnwithangee w/o T.Vaiphei of New Checkon, there
is no allotment order in respect of other persons. Hence the Jamabndi/Patta under (1) C.S. Dg
No.265 having an area of 8.00 acre under Patta No.639(new) Village No.26- Wangkheriakpam
Leikai, Porompat, Imphal recorded in the name of Smt. Victoria w/o Sanayaima of Rajabari,
R.K.Tamphasana Devi d/o Ketukisana of Rajbari, (ii) C.S. Dag No.265/694/697 having an area of
0.16 acre under patta NO.637/638(new) Village No.26- Wangkheriakpam Leikai, Porompat, Imphal
recorded in the name of R.K.Tamphasana Devi w/o RK Sanayaima Singh of Rajbari and (iii) C.S.
Dag No.265/1003 Patta No.369/902 recorded in the name of Holly Spirit Catholic Church, New
Checkon and (iv) C.S. Dag No.265/694 having an area of 0.08 acre udner patta No.637(new) Village
No.26- Wangkheriakpam Leikai, Porompat, Imphal recorded in the name of R.K.gopalsana s/o
Gopeshwor Singh of Rabari and Smt. Victoria w/o Sanayaima of Rajbari are declared as not
genuine.
14. Admitted, the aforesaid order dated 13.10.2020 passed by the Assistant Survey and Settlement
Officer has not been challenged by the petitioners. That apart, a reading of the aforesaid order would
clearly indicate that the Holy Spirit Catholic Church has failed to prove and/or establish their right
over the land in question.
15. On a perusal of the materials available on record, it is clear that on 8.12.2020, the Deputy
Commissioner/Registrar, Imphal East District passed an order declaring the sale deed in favour of
Holy Spirit Catholic Church bearing registration No.3224(V) dated 20-12-2018 is null and void and
on 23.11.2020, the Assistant Survey and Settlement Officer-V, Manipur has requested the Deputy
Commissioner/District Registrar, Imphal East for cancellation of the sale deed executed between
Rajkumar Balaram; Chongtham Bijoy and Holy Spirit Catholic Church, Tribal Colony, New Checko
vide sale deed bearing No.3224(V) dated 20.12.2018 of SR Porampat as the corresponding patta was
cancelled ad declared not genuine in order to avoid any legal complexity and confusion in future.
16. Thus, the aforesaid narrated factual facts clearly prove that Holy Spirit Catholic Church in
question or its representative has no right over the land in question and in fact, the Holy Spirit
Catholic Church had purchased piece of land measuring an extent of 0.16 acre in C.S. Dag 265 out of
8.00 acre from persons having no right and title over the same. Based on the cancelled sale deed and
cancelled jamabandi, now the Holy Spirit Catholic Church cannot claim right over the land in which
Holy Spirit Catholic Church now stand. Therefore, it is clear that the Holy Spirit Catholic Church
and its other structures are standing in the Government land which was allotted by the Government
of Manipur to the Chief Engineer (Building), PWD for construction of Government Residential
Quarters. Therefore, there is no hurdle in saying that Holy Spirit Catholic Church was constructed
unauthorisedly in the Government land way back in the year 1990 that too without the approval
from the State authorities.

The Holy Spirit Catholic Church vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 March, 2023
17. At this juncture, it is pertinent to mention that with regard to the removal of unauthorized
religious structures in public streets, public parks, public places etc., the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Union of India v. State of Gujarat and others (arising out of the order dated 2.5.2006
passed by the Gujarat High Court in SCA No.9686 of 2006) in Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)
No.8519 of 2006 dated 29.9.2009 passed the following orders:
"..... As an interim measure, we direct henceforth no unauthorized construction shall
be carried out or permitted in the name of Temple, Church, Mosque or Gurudwara
etc. on public streets, public parks or other public places etc. In respect of the
unauthorized construction of religious nature which has already taken place, the
State Governments and the Union Territories shall review the same on case to case
basis and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible."
18. Again on 7.12.2009, when the Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8519 of 2006 came up for
hearing, the Hon'ble Supreme passed the following order:
"All the Chief Secretaries, in consultation with the respective Governments are
directed to frame the policy in respect of existing unauthorized construction of
religious nature, which had already taken place. This Court directed the respondents
to review the same on case to case base. Let the policies be formulated by all the
States and Union Territories within four weeks from today.
We are reiterating that the Chief Secretaries, the concerned District Magistrates and
the Collectors/Deputy Commissioners in-charge of the Districts must ensure total
compliance of our order. Any breach in this respect shall be viewed seriously by this
Court."
19. It appears that in compliance of the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Government of
Manipur framed a policy and published vide notification dated 3.4.2010 and had also constituted
State Level Committee for reviewing the unauthorized construction of religious nature and the
District Committees headed by District Commissioner/Chairperson were constituted for the
purpose of removal/relocation/regularization of the religious structure. Accordingly, the District
Level Committee where the religious structures located in Village No.26-Wangkheirakpam Leikai
discussed existence of nine religious structures on the land allotted to the PWD Building Division,
Government of Manipur. Out of 9 religious structures located at Government Quarters Complex in
New Checkon, 5 were removed and 4 are still standing on the Dag Nos.410, 411, 412(P), 265, 267(P)
and 265(P). As stated supra, Holy Spirit Catholic Church is one of the Church facing eviction
proceedings.
20. Since the action for removal of the Church in question is based on the decision taken by the State
Cabinet pursuant to the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 29.9.2009, this Court
exercising writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India cannot issue direction on
the respondent authorities not to evict Holy Spirit Catholic Church standing in the Government
land. That apart, as stated supra, Holy Spirit Catholic Church was built unauthorisedly on the

The Holy Spirit Catholic Church vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 March, 2023
Government land which was meant for construction Government quarters.
21. At this juncture, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that since Holy
Spirit Catholic Church is functioning with full spirit by attending the worshipers for prayers, they
may be given 15 days' time to vacate the Church and hand over vacant possession of the property.
The learned Government Advocate is also agreeable for grant of 15 days' time to the petitioners for
vacating Holy Spirit Catholic Church.
22. Since the petitioners have not made out a case for interference with the eviction proceedings
initiated by the respondent authorities and the respondent authorities proved that the Holy Spirit
Catholic Church stand on the Government land and had been constructed without approval from the
State authorities, there is no bona fide in the present writ petition.
23. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. In view of the dismissal of the writ petition, MC (WP)
No.90 of 2023 is allowed and the order of status quo dated 4.10.2021 granted by this Court in the
writ petition stands vacated. As agreed, the petitioners are directed to vacate and hand over vacant
possession of the property in question within a period of ten days' from today, i.e. on or before
10.04.2023. No costs.
