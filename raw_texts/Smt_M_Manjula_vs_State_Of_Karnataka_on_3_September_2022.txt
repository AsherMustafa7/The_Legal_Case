THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED
FOR ORDERS ON 04.07.2022, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
The petitioners are before this Court calling in question orders dated 21-02-2022 and 10-03-2022
passed by the XXIX Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore in P.C.R.No.51691 of 2020
directing further investigation to be conducted by a different Investigating Officer (HAL Police
Station), other than the one who had filed a report before the concerned Court. The petitioners have
further sought a direction by way of a writ in the nature of mandamus directing handing over of the
entire matter to the 9th respondent/Central Bureau of Investigation for a re-
investigation/fresh investigation or further investigation. 'B' report filed before the concerned Court
is also called in question.
2. Brief facts leading to the filing of the present petition, as borne out from the pleadings, are as
follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 4
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
The 1st petitioner is the wife of one K.Raghunath and the 2nd petitioner is the son of
the 1st petitioner. K.Raghunath during his life time is claimed to have owned many
immovable properties in different places in the District of Bangalore - a few of them
in Devanahalli Taluk, K.R.Puram Taluk and in several other places. It is averred that
K.Raghunath was closely related to one D.K.Adikeshavalu, a Member of Parliament
who was active in politics in his life time. D.K.Adikeshavalu died on 24-04-2013 and
then began the scouting of the properties held by D.K. Adikeshavalu. The children of
D.K.Adikeshavalu, in particular respondent No.10 and other close associates of 10th
respondent started pressurizing K.Raghunath for transfer of some of the immovable
properties owned by him alleging that the source of income of the properties in his
name is of their father. It is the case of the petitioners that K.Raghunath resisted their
pressure and asserted that he is the absolute owner of the properties acquired from
his own source of income coming from real estate and had thus become owner of
those properties. The difference between K.Raghunath and the children of the
deceased D.K.Adikeshavalu became irreconcilable.
3. In the year 2016, it transpires that an income tax raid took place in the premises of late
D.K.Adikeshavalu and the raid and the seizure was attributed to K.Raghunath. It is contended that
K.Raghunath executed a Will on 28-01-2016 and got it registered and as per the Will the 1st
petitioner was to succeed to all the properties owned by K.Raghunath. K.Raghunath had not
disclosed the fact of execution of the Will to any of the private respondents herein during his life
time. It appears that when K.Raghunath wanted to sell one of the properties and was about to
execute a sale deed on 4-05-2019, the private respondents herein got to know of the same and the
10th respondent and his sister, the 14th respondent herein summoned K.Raghunath to the place of
the 14th respondent. The 14th respondent always used to be in the hospital "Vydehi Institute of
Medical Sciences and Research Centre" located in Whitefield. On being summoned K.Raghunath
leaves the house on the afternoon of 02-05-2019 informing the petitioners herein that he was going
to meet 10th and 14th respondents. For about two days there was no news about K.Raghunath. On
04-05-2019 two days after he had left the house, at 7.00 a.m., it is contended, that a call comes from
K.Raghunath that his life was not safe. Since K.Raghunath had expressed threat to his life, the 1st
petitioner sends the 2nd petitioner/son to the house of the 10th respondent to verify about
K.Raghunath. The 2nd petitioner goes to the guest house of respondent No.10 situated in Whitefield
and enters the guest house and sees his father hanging to a ceiling fan. This was at about 8.30 a.m.
On this incident, the entire episode of crime unleashed. A statement of the 2nd petitioner/son, was
recorded on the very day, who at that point of time did not suspect anyone and thought that it was
an act of suicide by his father and gave a statement accordingly to the Police that he was not
suspecting anyone. Based upon the said statement of the son, an unnatural death report was
generated in U.D.R.No.28 of 2019 by the H.A.L.Police and the case was closed.
4. On 15-02-2020 a complaint comes to be registered by the 1st petitioner alleging that her husband
had been murdered by respondents 10 to 13 and others. The Police refused to register the complaint.
The same was forwarded to the Commissioner and again the contention is that there was no
registration of the crime.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 5
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
When the crime was not registered, the 1st petitioner on 24-02-2020 registers a private complaint in
P.C.R.No.51691 of 2020 invoking Section 200 of the Cr.P.C alleging commission of murder of her
husband K.Raghunath by respondents 10 to 13. An enquiry was conducted by the learned Magistrate
and investigation was ordered on 02-03-2020. In terms of the order an FIR came to be registered
against respondents 10 to 13 in Crime No.89 of 2020 for offences punishable under Sections 34,
120B, 467, 468, 421, 474, 302, 464 and 471 of the IPC. Two other crimes also came to be registered
in Crime No.148 of 2020 and 7 of 2021. The crime was registered on 05-03-2020. Several civil
proceedings between the private respondents herein and the petitioners were generated after
registration of the crime by the petitioners alleging murder of K.Raghunath.
5. When investigation was not completed despite an order of registration of crime, the petitioners
knock the doors of this Court in Writ Petition No. 4333 of 2021. The petition, after hearing the
parties, came to be disposed of directing constitution of a SIT to enquire into the complaint. The SIT
is directed to be constituted within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. In
terms of the direction, an order was issued by the Department to constitute a three member team as
a Special Investigation Team.
The three member team conducts investigation and files a 'B' report before the concerned Court in
Crime No.89 of 2020 and other crimes 148 of 2020 and 7 of 2021. The learned Magistrate by his
order dated 21-02-2022 rejected the 'B' report and directed Station House Officer of HAL Police
Station before whom the complaint had been initially registered to conduct further investigation and
submit a report on or before 22-04-2022. On the order being passed by the learned Magistrate, the
petitioners are before this Court calling in question the said order, insofar as it directs conduct of
further investigation by the Station House Officer of HAL Police Station and have also sought that
the investigation be entrusted to CBI in the light of SIT having already filed a 'B' report.
6. Heard Sri. Hashmath Pasha, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, Sri Dhyan
Chinnappa, learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the State, Sri S.Mahesh, learned
counsel representing respondents 10, 11 and 14, Sri P.Prasanna Kumar, learned Special Public
Prosecutor appearing for the CBI, 9th respondent and Sri.Pelikal.K.Arjun, learned counsel
appearing for respondents 12 and 13.
7. The learned senior counsel would submit that the act of the State in constituting a three member
committee was to see that the order of this Court has been complied with. The entire investigation
was not carried out by the SIT, but only by one R.Prakash, Police Inspector of Govindapura Police
Station who is shown to be the Investigating Officer in the order, he has without looking into any
factor submitted his report in which lacunae galore. The body which was buried in Hyderabad was
exhumed by the Investigating Officer without there being any dispute about the identity of the body
and commenced investigation on a wrong footing. The learned senior counsel would demonstrate
that the entire investigation conducted is so shoddy that it does not even fit in to any contours of
investigation to be in accordance with law. He would contend that the learned Magistrate himself
raised a doubt about the way investigation was conducted and directed further investigation, but
erred in directing investigation by the HAL Police, as it runs counter to the order passed by this
Court directing handing over of investigation to the SIT. He would contend that the learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 6
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
Magistrate does not have power to direct further investigation under Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C. by
any other investigating agency. It is the power available only at the hands of this Court.
He would seek to place reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court on the power of the Magistrate
to direct investigation by any other authority in the case of CHANDRA BABU @ MOSES v.
STATE THROUGH INSPECTOR OF POLICE AND OTHERS -
(2015) 8 SCC 774.
8. The learned senior counsel would further submit that further investigation should be handed over
to the CBI, as the conduct of investigation by the SIT did not inspire confidence with the learned
Magistrate before whom a 'B' report was filed. He would place reliance upon several judgments of
the Apex Court which have held that further investigation in certain cases if necessary, can be
handed over to the CBI as well. In this regard he would place reliance on the judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of POOJA PAL v. UNION OF INDIA - (2016) 3 SCC 135 for the proposition that
reinvestigation or further investigation can be directed in certain circumstances and it can be at the
hands of the CBI. He would place a later judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Dr. NARESH
KUMAR MANGLA v. ANITA AGARWAL - 2020 SCC OnLine SC 1031 wherein further investigation
is handed over to the CBI. Both the aforesaid judgments followed the earlier judgment in the case of
STATE OF WEST BENGAL v.
COMMITTEE FOR PROTECTION OF RIGHT, WEST BENGAL -
(2010) 3 SCC 571 where the investigation was handed over to the CBI by the High Court in exercise
of its power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and the same was affirmed by the Apex Court and
would submit that this is a fit case for handing over the matter to the CBI.
9. On the other hand, the learned Additional Advocate General Sri Dhyan Chinnappa who
represented the State would contend that the 'B' report filed by the SIT is pursuant to a herculean
task conducted by the State, this cannot be brushed aside as is done by the learned Magistrate. If the
Court would direct further investigation by the SIT, the same would be carried out with all diligence
and in compliance with the order to be passed by this Court. He would submit that there is no
warrant to involve the CBI for conduct of investigation in the teeth of the State having performed its
duty to the fullest.
10. The learned counsel for the CBI would also submit that if the Court directs investigation at the
hands of the CBI it would conduct, but submits that the Court would not in a routine manner
entrust investigation to the hands of the CBI, he would place reliance upon the judgment of the Apex
Court in SHREE SHREE RAM JANKI JI ASTHAN TAPOVAN MANDIR AND ANOTHER v.
STATE OF JHARKHAND AND OTHERS - (2019) 6 SCC 777 and ARNAB RANJAN GOSWAMI v.
UNION OF INDIA - (2020) 14 SCC 12 to contend that reference to CBI should not be done in a
routine manner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 7
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
11. The learned counsel appearing for private respondents would contend that the private
respondents cannot be repeatedly harassed in the name of investigation, as the issue has gone on for
the last two years and private respondents again should not be harassed at the hands of the CBI as
'B' report submitted is in accordance with law.
12. To the submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the private respondents, the learned
senior counsel Sri Hashmath Pasha would contend that the accused has no locus to interfere with
the proceedings in a case where further investigation is ordered or sought. He would place reliance
upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of SATISHKUMAR NYALCHAND SHAH v.
STATE OF GUJARAT AND OTHERS - (2020) 4 SCC 22 to buttress his submission on the said issue.
At the end of it he seeks further investigation to be handed over to CBI only.
13. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned
counsel and have perused the material on record. In furtherance whereof, the following issues arise
for my consideration:
(1) Whether the learned Magistrate was justified in directing further investigation to
a different Investigating Officer other than the one who had investigated the crime?
(2) Whether the accused will have to be heard in a case where a direction is issued for
further investigation, either by the concerned Court under Section 173(8) of the
Cr.P.C. or by this Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the
Cr.P.C.?
(3) Whether the prayer of the petitioners to entrust the investigation to the hands of
the CBI merits any acceptance?
Issue No.1:
(1) Whether the learned Magistrate was justified in directing further investigation to
a different Investigating Officer other than the one who had investigated the crime?
14. The afore-quoted narration of facts need not be reiterated. For the consideration of the lis that is
brought before this Court in the present case, it would suffice to begin with the observation of the
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court which directed constitution of a SIT. The crime against private
respondents herein was registered in Crime Nos.89 of 2020, 148 of 2020 and 7 of 2021 and when
there was no progress in the investigation, the petitioners herein had knocked the doors of this
Court in Writ Petition No.4333 of 2021. This Court accepting the plea of the petitioners passed the
following order:
"9. Undisputed facts of the case are, Raghunath was found hanging in the guest house
belonging to respondent No.6. He was declared 'brought dead' by the Doctors of
Vydehi Hospital belonging to respondent No.6. There are Civil disputes pending with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 8
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
regard to the property in the name of deceased Raghunath. Pursuant to order passed
by the learned Magistrate, FIR No.89 of 2020 has been registered on 5-03- 2020 in
HAL Police Station.
10. Shri Hashmath Pasha, placing reliance on paragraphs No.69 and 70 in State of
West Bengal and others v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights,, West
Bengal and others (2010) 3 SCC 571 submitted that Supreme Court and High Courts
not only have the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to protect the
fundamental rights guaranteed by Par-III in general and under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India, in particular.
11. It is averred in the complaint registered as PCR No.51691 filed by the 1st
petitioner, that late Shri D.K.Adikeshavulu was related to the complainant. Her
husband Raghunath and Adikeshavulu had good relationship and mutual trust. After
death of Shri Adikeshavulu, petitioner's husband had told her and children that hi9s
life and lives of children were in great danger as he was being threatened by sixth and
seventh respondents. They sent her elder son Pradeep to Hyderabad to pursue his
area of interest. Sixth respondent and his sister Kalpaja believed that Raghunath was
responsible for Income Tax Authorities who raided their office and residences and
recovered money to the tune of Rs.60 crores and issued notices in respect of
immovable properties worth Rs.250/- crores.
12. Shri Hashmath Pasha also submitted that the learned Magistrate had issued
reminder to the police on 3.04.2021. Yet the respondent-police are not investigating
the matter diligently.
13. Though more than one year has elapsed from the date of registration of FIR, there
appears no progress in the investigation. It is also significant to note that petitioners
had to take recourse to filing a private complaint before the learned Magistrate.
14. A fair investigation in Criminal cases to bring culprits to justice, is one of the
essential duties of Police in a Rule of Law Society. The facts of the case recorded
hereinabove, prima facie show that investigation is not satisfactory. It was urged by
Shri Hashmath Pasha that the Court may consider directing the State to entrust
investigation to a team headed by an IGP, which, in substance is prayer clause (b).
15. On careful perusal of the material on record and keeping in view the facts and
circumstances of this case, in the opinion of this Court, ends of justice would be met
by directing investigation by a team headed by a Senior Police Officer. Hence, the
following:
ORDER
(a) Petition is allowed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 9
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
(b) Respondents No.1 and 2 are directed to assign the investigation of FIRs
No.89/2020 148/2020 & 7/2021 to a SIT headed by an Officer in the rank of Deputy
Commissioner of Police, who has not earlier dealt with this case or held supervisory
jurisdiction over those police stations, by fixing a time limit; and
(c) The Team shall be formed within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order."

The SIT conducts investigation and submits its report which runs into 639 pages. On consideration
of 'B' report and protest petition so filed by the petitioners, the learned Magistrate passed the
following order:
"6. Heard the complainant and perused the material on record. The following point
arises for my consideration.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 10
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
1. Whether the 'B' report filed by the SIT requires to be rejected?
2. What order?
7. My answer to the above points is as follows:
Point No.1: In the AFFIRMATIVE Point No.2: As per final order, for the following:
REASONS
8. Point No.1: This is a complaint filed u/s 200 of Cr.P.C. against the accused No.1 to
4 alleging the offences punishable u/s 302, 201, 421, 464, 467, 466, 471, 474, 120(B)
r/w Section 34 of IPC. The case of the complainant in brief is that all the accused
have criminally conspired with each other and in furtherance of common intention
have murdered her husband and destroyed the evidence and also forged the
documents with an intention to grab the properties of her deceased husband and
cheat the complainant. The jurisdictional police have not taken any action in respect
of her complaint. Hence the complainant has approached this Court by filing a
private complaint u/s 200 of Cr.P.C.
9. After receiving the complaint, this Court has taken cognizance of the alleged
offences as contemplated u/s 190(1)(a) of Cr.P.C. The sworn statement of the
complainant and her son was recorded. They were examined as CW-1 and CW-2.
Thereafter further enquiry was ordered u/s 202 of Cr.P.C. Since, the HAL Police did
not conduct the investigation expeditiously, the complainant has approached the
Hon'ble High Court in W..No.4333 of 2021 wherein the Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka vide order dated 28-04-2021 has constituted SIT to conduct enquiry and
submit the report before this Court. The SIT has filed 'B' final report in this case.
The complainant has filed protest memo against the 'B' final report and has prayed to reject the 'B'
final report and direct further investigation.
10. I have perused the report submitted by the SIT. The contentions on behalf of the complainant is
that the SIT has not investigated the case with all fairness and that the investigation is lopsided. On
perusal of the report of the SIT it is evident that the material aspects leading to the death of
deceased K.Raghunath, the cause of death, the events subsequent to the death of the deceased are
material facts which need to be investigated. The investigation pertaining to the disputed documents
needs to the meticulously investigated. The investigation conducted by the SIT is unsatisfactory.
Therefore, there is necessity of further investigation in this case.
11. In this case the purpose for which an enquiry u/s 202(1) of Cr.P.C. is directed so as to determine
whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding, if so, to issue process against the accused
herein. The investigating agency instead of submitting the report to assist the Court in this regard,
has submitted 'B' report which is unacceptable. The purpose and the object of the enquiry directed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 11
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
u/s 202(1) of Cr.P.C. appears to have been misconceived by the investigating agency. Therefore,
having considered the material on record, I find that it is just and necessary that the 'B' report filed
by the SIT be rejected. Since there is necessity of further investigation in this case, I deem it proper
to direct the SHO of HAL Police Station to conduct further investigation and submit report. Hence, I
answer Point No.1 in the Affirmative.
12. Point No.2: For the reasons mentioned above, I proceed to pass the following:
ORDER The 'B' report filed by the SIT is hereby REJECTED.
Acting u/s 202(1) of Cr.P.C . the SHO of HAL Police Station shall conduct further
investigation and submit 22.04.2022."
(Emphasis applied) The order though is not in great detail qua the contents of 'B'
report it has traveled beyond its jurisdiction insofar as it directs conduct of further
investigation by the HAL Police Station which was not the investigating authority.
This Court (supra) had directed constitution of SIT. Further investigation, if at all had
to be, in the circumstances, directed only to be done by the SIT. On the order
directing further investigation by the HAL Police Station, by rejecting the 'B' report
on 21-02-2022, the petitioners herein filed a memo seeking to recall the order, in the
light of the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of CHANDRA BABU
(supra). Rejecting the said contention of the petitioners that further investigation had
to be conducted only by the SIT that was constituted the learned Magistrate has
transgressed his jurisdiction by directing further investigation by the HAL Police
Station. The power of the learned Magistrate is restricted to further investigation by
the same investigating agency and not to any other investigating agency. The view of
mine is in consonance with what the Apex Court has held in the aforesaid judgment
in the case CHANDRA BABU1. The Apex Court in the case of CHANDRA BABU has
held as follows:
"20. We have reproduced the conclusion in extenso as we are disposed to think that
the High Court has fallen into error in its appreciation of the order passed by the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate. It has to be construed in the light of the eventual
direction. The order, in fact, as we perceive, presents that the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate was really inclined to direct further investigation but because he had
chosen another agency, he has used the word "reinvestigation". Needless to say, the
power of the Magistrate to direct for further investigation has to be cautiously used.
In Vinay Tyagi [(2013) 5 SCC 762 : (2013) 4 SCC (Cri) 557] it has been held : (SCC p.
791, para 41) "41. ... The power of the Magistrate to direct 'further investigation' is a
significant power which has to be exercised sparingly, in exceptional cases and to
achieve the ends of justice. To provide fair, proper and unquestionable investigation
is the obligation of the investigating agency and the court in its supervisory capacity
is required to ensure the same. Further investigation conducted under the orders of
the court, including that of the Magistrate or by the police of its own accord and, for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 12
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
valid reasons, would lead to the filing of a supplementary report. Such supplementary
report shall be dealt with as part of the primary report. This is clear from the fact that
the provisions of Sections 173(3) to 173(6) would be applicable to such reports in
terms of Section 173(8) of the Code."
(2015) 8 SCC 774
21. In the said case, the question arose, whether the Magistrate can direct for reinvestigation. The
Court, while dealing with the said issue, has ruled that : (Vinay Tyagi case [(2013) 5 SCC 762 :
(2013) 4 SCC (Cri) 557] , SCC p. 791, para 43) "43. At this stage, we may also state another
well-settled canon of the criminal jurisprudence that the superior courts have the jurisdiction under
Section 482 of the Code or even Article 226 of the Constitution of India to direct 'further
investigation', 'fresh' or 'de novo' and even 'reinvestigation'. 'Fresh', 'de novo' and 'reinvestigation'
are synonymous expressions and their result in law would be the same. The superior courts are even
vested with the power of transferring investigation from one agency to another, provided the ends of
justice so demand such action. Of course, it is also a settled principle that this power has to be
exercised by the superior courts very sparingly and with great circumspection."
And again: (SCC p. 794, para 51) "51. ... Whether the Magistrate should direct 'further investigation'
or not is again a matter which will depend upon the facts of a given case. The learned Magistrate or
the higher court of competent jurisdiction would direct 'further investigation' or 'reinvestigation' as
the case may be, on the facts of a given case. Where the Magistrate can only direct further
investigation, the courts of higher jurisdiction can direct further, reinvestigation or even
investigation de novo depending on the facts of a given case. It will be the specific order of the court
that would determine the nature of investigation."
22. We respectfully concur with the said view. As we have already indicated, the learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate has basically directed for further investigation. The said part of the order cannot
be found fault with, but an eloquent one, he could not have directed another investigating agency to
investigate as that would not be within the sphere of further investigation and, in any case, he does
not have the jurisdiction to direct reinvestigation by another agency. Therefore, that part of the
order deserves to be lancinated and accordingly it is directed that the investigating agency that had
investigated shall carry on the further investigation and such investigation shall be supervised by the
Superintendent of Police concerned. After the further investigation, the report shall be submitted
before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate who shall deal with the same in accordance with law.
We may hasten to add that we have not expressed any opinion relating to any of the factual aspects
of the case."
(Emphasis supplied) In the light of the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the aforesaid case,
the part of the order where the learned Magistrate directs further investigation to be conducted by
the HAL Police Station is rendered without jurisdiction and requires to be obliterated, as power of
superior Court cannot be exercised by the learned Magistrate. Therefore, issue No.1 is answered in
favour of the petitioners, only to the extent of it directing further investigation to be carried out by a
different agency.

Issue No.2:
(2) Whether the accused will have to be heard in a case where a direction is issued for
further investigation, either by the concerned Court under Section 173(8) of the
Cr.P.C. or by this Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the
Cr.P.C.?
15. The Complainant was before this Court. Based upon the order in Writ Petition No.4333 of 2021,
SIT was constituted. SIT conducted investigation and has filed a 'B' report in the matter. The learned
Magistrate has not accepted or rejected the 'B' report, but has directed further investigation under
Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C. When the learned Magistrate directs further investigation under
Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C., or this Court would direct further investigation in exercise of its power
under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., hearing of the accused is not contemplated in law. The view of
mine, in this regard, is fortified by the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of
SATISHKUMAR NYALCHAND SHAH v. STATE OF GUJARAT2. The Apex Court in the said
judgment has held as follows:
"10. Having heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties
and the private respondent herein, we are of the opinion that as such no error has
been committed by the High Court dismissing the application submitted by the
appellant herein to implead him in the special criminal application filed by the
private respondent herein challenging the order passed by the learned Chief (2020) 4
SCC 22 Judicial Magistrate rejecting his application for further investigation under
Section 173(8) CrPC with respect to one other accused, namely, Shri Bhaumik against
whom no charge-sheet has been filed till date. Therefore, it is not at all appreciable
how the appellant against whom no relief is sought for further investigation has any
locus and/or any say in the application for further investigation under Section 173(8)
CrPC. How he can be said to be a necessary and a proper party. It is required to be
noted that, as such, even the proposed accused Shri Bhaumik shall not have any say
at this stage in an application under Section 173(8) CrPC for further investigation, as
observed by this Court in W.N. Chadha [Union of India v. W.N. Chadha, 1993 Supp
(4) SCC 260:1993 SCC (Cri) 1171]; Narender G. Goel [Narender G. Goel v. State of
Maharashtra, (2009) 6 SCC 65 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 933] and Dinubhai Baghabhai
Solanki [Dinubhai Boghabhai Solanki v. State of Gujarat, (2014) 4 SCC 626 : (2014) 2
SCC (Cri) 384] . In Dinubhai Baghabhai Solanki [Dinubhai Boghabhai Solanki v.
State of Gujarat, (2014) 4 SCC 626 :
(2014) 2 SCC (Cri) 384] after considering another decision of this Court in Sri
Bhagwan Samardha Sreepada Vallabha Venkata Vishwanandha Maharaj v. State of
A.P. [Sri Bhagwan Samardha Sreepada Vallabha Venkata Vishwanandha Maharaj v.
State of A.P., (1999) 5 SCC 740: 1999 SCC (Cri) 1047], it is observed and held that
there is nothing in Section 173(8) CrPC to suggest that the court is obliged to hear the
accused before any direction for further investigation is made.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 14
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
In Sri Bhagwan Samardha [Sri Bhagwan Samardha Sreepada Vallabha Venkata Vishwanandha
Maharaj v. State of A.P., (1999) 5 SCC 740: 1999 SCC (Cri) 1047], this Court in para 11 held as
under: (Sri Bhagwan Samardha case [Sri Bhagwan Samardha Sreepada Vallabha Venkata
Vishwanandha Maharaj v. State of A.P., (1999) 5 SCC 740 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1047] , SCC p. 743) "11.
In such a situation the power of the court to direct the police to conduct further investigation cannot
have any inhibition. There is nothing in Section 173(8) to suggest that the court is obliged to hear
the accused before any such direction is made. Casting of any such obligation on the court would
only result in encumbering the court with the burden of searching for all the potential accused to be
afforded with the opportunity of being heard. As the law does not require it, we would not burden
the Magistrate with such an obligation."
11. Therefore, when the proposed accused against whom the further investigation is sought, namely,
Shri Bhaumik is not required to be heard at this stage, there is no question of hearing the appellant,
one of the co- accused against whom the charge-sheet is already filed and the trial against whom is
in progress and no relief of further investigation is sought against him. Therefore, the High Court is
absolutely justified in rejecting the application submitted by the appellant to implead him as a
party-respondent in the special criminal application.
12. Now, so far as the reliance placed upon Rule 51 of the Gujarat High Court Rules by the learned
Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant is concerned, we are of the opinion that in the
facts and circumstances of the case, Rule 51 shall not have any application for further investigation
under Section 173(8) CrPC. Proceedings arising out of an application under Section 173(8) CrPC
cannot be equated with the appeal or application against the order passed in criminal case as stated
in Rule 51. Therefore, Rule 51 of the Gujarat High Court Rules has no application at all."
(Emphasis supplied) In the light of the judgment of the Apex Court (supra), hearing of the accused,
particularly at the stage where the Court would direct further investigation is not a procedure
contemplated in law, as the case would be still at a pre-process stage. Therefore, the contention of
the learned counsel appearing for the 10th respondent that he is to be heard in the matter prior to a
direction for further investigation sans substance and is, therefore rejected. The issue that has arisen
is answered holding that the accused has no right to contend that he should be heard in a matter at a
pre-process stage.
Issue No.3:
(3) Whether the prayer of the petitioners to entrust the investigation to the hands of
the CBI merits any acceptance?
16. Before embarking upon consideration of acceptance or otherwise of the prayer to entrust the
investigation to the hands of the CBI, it is germane to notice the line of law as laid down by the Apex
Court in the cases that are referred to the CBI for investigation; further investigation;
re-investigation or de novo investigation and the cases where the Apex Court has declined the plea
to refer the matter to the CBI.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 15
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
Cases where the investigation has been referred to the CBI:
The Apex Court in the case of POOJA PAL3 (supra). The Apex Court in the said
judgment has held as follows:
"85. As succinctly summarised by this Court in Committee for Protection of
Democratic Right [State (2016) 3 SCC 135 of W.B. v. Committee for Protection of
Democratic Rights, (2010) 3 SCC 571 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 401] , the extraordinary
power of the constitutional courts in directing CBI to conduct investigation in a case
must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional situations, when it is
necessary to provide credibility and instil confidence in investigation or where the
incident may have national or international ramifications or where such an order
may be necessary for doing complete justice and for enforcing the fundamental
rights. In our comprehension, each of the determinants is consummate and
independent by itself to justify the exercise of such power and is not interdependent
on each other.
86. A trial encompasses investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal and retrial i.e. the entire
range of scrutiny including crime detection and adjudication on the basis thereof.
Jurisprudentially, the guarantee under Article 21 embraces both the life and liberty of the accused as
well as interest of the victim, his near and dear ones as well as of the community at large and
therefore, cannot be alienated from each other with levity. It is judicially acknowledged that fair trial
includes fair investigation as envisaged by Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Though
well-demarcated contours of crime detection and adjudication do exist, if the investigation is neither
effective nor purposeful nor objective nor fair, it would be the solemn obligation of the courts, if
considered necessary, to order further investigation or reinvestigation as the case may be, to
discover the truth so as to prevent miscarriage of the justice. No inflexible guidelines or hard-and-
fast rules as such can be prescribed by way of uniform and universal invocation and the decision is
to be conditioned to the attendant facts and circumstances, motivated dominantly by the
predication of advancement of the cause of justice.
87. Any criminal offence is one against the society at large casting an onerous responsibility on the
State, as the guardian and purveyor of human rights and protector of law to discharge its sacrosanct
role responsibly and committedly, always accountable to the law-abiding citizenry for any lapse. The
power of the constitutional courts to direct further investigation or reinvestigation is a dynamic
component of its jurisdiction to exercise judicial review, a basic feature of the Constitution and
though has to be exercised with due care and caution and informed with self-imposed restraint, the
plenitude and content thereof can neither be enervated nor moderated by any legislation.
... ... ... ...
97. Reverting to the facts, the gruesome and sordid assassination of the appellant's husband in
broad daylight under the public gaze is not in dispute. As a consequence of the murderous assault
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 16
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
with firearms and indiscriminate use thereof, Raju Pal along with two others fell to the bullets.
Records seem to suggest that even prior to the incident, attempts were made on his life but he
survived the same in view of the timely intervention of the security guards. That representations
were made by him seeking additional protection and that after his murder, the appellant and the
party higher-ups of Raju Pal had persistently appealed, amongst others, to the Governor and the
Chief Minister of the State for handing over the investigation to CBI is also testified by the records.
98. Pleaded imputations of the appellant include deliberate, uncalled for and mysterious
replacement of the earlier sets of personal security officers/gunners of the deceased, presence of
high police officials near the place of occurrence, indifference on the part of the State Police to act
with alacrity, hasty conduct of the post-mortem of the dead body and cremation thereof without
handing over the same to the appellant or any of his relatives, political pressure on the investigating
agency to distort the course of the probe and to screen the incriminating evidence collected, etc. One
of the investigating officers in his writ petition, questioning his suspension had also pleaded on oath
about the unexpected and unwarranted interference of the higher-ups in the department to withhold
evidence gathered in course of the investigation underway. Though nothing decisively turns on these
accusations, the same having been refuted by the respondents, the fact remains that the appellant's
husband had been mercilessly killed by a group of gun-wielding assailants in a public place, in the
open view of all concerned. Such a daring and desperate act did have a terrorising impact on the
society sending shock waves amongst all cross-sections of the community and received wide
coverage by the media. The incident understandably is not one to be lightly glossed over or
trivialised.
99. The trial on the basis of the investigation completed hitherto by the State Police and CB-CID has
remained stayed by the orders of this Court. Prior thereto, however, as per the materials laid before
this Court, several eyewitnesses cited by the investigating agency have been examined. As the trial is
pending for the present, we refrain from commenting on their testimony, except that they seem to
have resiled from their statements under Section 161 of the Code. Having regard to the manner in
which the offence had been committed, it is incomprehensible that there was no eyewitness to the
incident. Thus, if the persons cited as eyewitnesses by the investigating agency retract from their
version made before the police, then either they have been wrongly projected as eyewitnesses or
they have for right or wrong reasons resiled from their earlier narration. In both the eventualities, in
our opinion, the investigation has to be faulted as inefficient, incomplete and incautious with the
inevitable consequence of failure of the prosecution in the case in hand. Such a fallout also spells a
dismal failure of the State machinery as a pivotal stakeholder in the process of justice dispensation
to protect and assure the witnesses of their safety and security so as to fearlessly testify the truth. We
would hasten to add that these observations are by no means suggestive of the complicity of
Respondents 4 and 5 and other accused persons standing trial. These, to reiterate, are farthest from
even any presumptive hypothesis of their involvement in the offence for the present and are
engendered by the concern of possible failure of justice. If the investigating agencies, as involved,
have not been able to identify and present eyewitnesses of the incident who would under all
circumstance religiously and devotedly abide by their version about the same, the shortcoming
apparently is in the probe made, sadly reflecting on the competence, commitment and efficacy of
such agencies. The very fact that this Court had earlier stayed the trial while permitting the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 17
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
appellant to approach the High Court with the relief for assignment of the investigation to CBI does
signify its expectation that the High Court would adopt a sensitive insight into the issues raised and
appropriately address the same. The pendency of the trial and the examination of the witnesses so
far made thus in our estimate is not a disarming factor for this Court, to consider the necessity of
entrusting the investigation to CBI even at this stage. To reiterate, a decision in this regard has to be
induced and impelled by the cause of justice viewed in the overall facts and circumstances attendant
on the incident. No inflexible norm or guideline is either available or feasible.
100. The present factual conspectus leaves one with a choice either to let the ongoing trial casually
drift towards its conclusion with the possibility of offence going unpunished or to embark upon
investigation belated though, spurred by the intervening developments, to unravel the truth,
irrespective of the persons involved. As it is, every offence is a crime against the society and is
unpardonable, yet there are some species of ghastly, revolting and villainous violations of the
invaluable right to life which leave all sensible and right-minded persons of the society shell-
shocked and traumatised in body and soul. Such incidents mercifully, rare though, are indeed
exceptionally agonising, eliciting resentful condemnation of all and thus warrant an extraordinary
attention for adequate remedial initiatives to prevent their recurrence. In our considered view, even
if such incidents, otherwise diabolical and horrendous, do not precipitate national or international
ramifications, these undoubtedly transcend beyond the confines of individual tragedies and
militatively impact upon the society's civilised existence. If the cause of complete justice and
protection of human rights are the situational demands in such contingencies, order for further
investigation or reinvestigation, even by an impartial agency as CBI ought to be a peremptory
measure in the overwhelming cause of justice.
101. Judged in these perspectives, we are of the firm opinion that notwithstanding the pendency of
the trial, and the availability of the power of the courts below under Sections 311 and 391 of the Code
read with Section 165 of the Evidence Act, it is of overwhelming and imperative necessity that to rule
out any possibility of denial of justice to the parties and more importantly to instil and sustain the
confidence of the community at large, CBI ought to be directed to undertake a de novo investigation
in the incident. We take this view, conscious about the parameters precedentially formulated, as in
our comprehension in the unique facts and circumstances of the case any contrary view would leave
the completed process of crime detection in the case wholly inconsequential and the judicial process
impotent. A court of law, to reiterate has to be an involved participant in the quest for truth and
justice and is not expected only to officiate a formal ritual in a proceeding far-seeing an inevitable
end signalling travesty of justice. Mission justice so expectantly and reverently entrusted to the
judiciary would then be reduced to a teasing illusion and a sovereign and premier constitutional
institution would be rendered a suspect for its existence in public estimation. Considering the live
purpose for which judiciary exists, this would indeed be a price which it cannot afford to bear under
any circumstance.
102. In the wake of the above, we are unhesitatingly inclined to entrust CBI, with the task of
undertaking a de novo investigation in the incident of murder of Raju Pal, the husband of the
appellant as aforementioned. Though a plea has been raised on behalf of Respondents 4 and 5 in
particular that this incident has been exploited by the appellant for her political gains, we are left
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 18
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
unpersuaded thereby, as her achievements in public life must have been fashioned by very many
ponderable as well as imponderable factors. In any view of the matter, such a contention, in our
view, is of no consequence or relevance. We would, however, make it abundantly clear that this
direction for entrustment of the investigation to CBI anew has been made in view of the exceptional
features of the case as overwhelmingly demonstrated by attendant facts and circumstances
indispensably necessitating the same.
103. We are aware that in the meantime, over a decade has passed. The call of justice, however,
demands that CBI in spite of the constraints that it may face in view of the time lag, would make all
possible endeavours to disinter the truth through its effective and competent investigation and
submit the same before the trial court, as early as possible, preferably within the period of six
months from today. The clarion call of justice expects a befitting response from the country's
premier and distinguished investigating agency. On receipt of the report by CBI only, the trial court
would proceed therewith in accordance with law and conduct and conclude the trial expeditiously
and not later than six months. The interim order staying the ongoing trial is hereby made absolute."
(Emphasis supplied) The judgment quoted (supra) in POOJA PAL was following the judgment
rendered by a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the case of STATE OF WEST BENGAL V.
COMMITTEE FOR PROTECTION OF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS, WEST BENGAL4 wherein the Apex
Court has held as follows:
"51. The Constitution of India expressly confers the power of judicial review on this
Court and the High Courts under Articles 32 and 226 respectively. Dr. B.R.
Ambedkar described Article 32 as the very soul of the Constitution--the (2010) 3 SCC
571 very heart of it--the most important article. By now, it is well settled that the
power of judicial review, vested in the Supreme Court and the High Courts under the
said articles of the Constitution, is an integral part and essential feature of the
Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. Therefore, ordinarily, the power
of the High Court and this Court to test the constitutional validity of legislations can
never be ousted or even abridged. Moreover, Article 13 of the Constitution not only
declares the pre-Constitution laws as void to the extent to which they are inconsistent
with the fundamental rights, it also prohibits the State from making a law which
either takes away totally or abrogates in part a fundamental right. Therefore, judicial
review of laws is embedded in the Constitution by virtue of Article 13 read with
Articles 32 and 226 of our Constitution.
... ... ...
55. In his concurring judgment, Dr. A.S. Anand, J. (as His Lordship then was),
observed as under: (Nilabati Behera case [(1993) 2 SCC 746: 1993 SCC (Cri) 527],
SCC p. 769, para 35) "35. This Court and the High Courts, being the protectors of the
civil liberties of the citizen, have not only the power and jurisdiction but also an
obligation to grant relief in exercise of its jurisdiction under Articles 32 and 226 of
the Constitution to the victim or the heir of the victim whose fundamental rights

Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
under Article 21 of the Constitution of India are established to have been flagrantly
infringed by calling upon the State to repair the damage done by its officers to the
fundamental rights of the citizen, notwithstanding the right of the citizen to the
remedy by way of a civil suit or criminal proceedings. The State, of course has the
right to be indemnified by and take such action as may be available to it against the
wrongdoer in accordance with law--
through appropriate proceedings."
... ... ...
57. As regards the powers of judicial review conferred on the High Court, undoubtedly they are, in a
way, wider in scope. The High Courts are authorised under Article 226 of the Constitution, to issue
directions, orders or writs to any person or authority, including any Government to enforce
fundamental rights and, "for any other purpose". It is manifest from the difference in the
phraseology of Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution that there is a marked difference in the nature
and purpose of the right conferred by these two articles. Whereas the right guaranteed by Article 32
can be exercised only for the enforcement of fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the
Constitution, the right conferred by Article 226 can be exercised not only for the enforcement of
fundamental rights, but "for any other purpose" as well i.e. for enforcement of any legal right
conferred by a statute, etc. ... ... ...
Conclusions
68. Thus, having examined the rival contentions in the context of the constitutional scheme, we
conclude as follows:
(i) The fundamental rights, enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, are inherent and
cannot be extinguished by any constitutional or statutory provision. Any law that
abrogates or abridges such rights would be violative of the basic structure doctrine.
The actual effect and impact of the law on the rights guaranteed under Part III has to be taken into
account in determining whether or not it destroys the basic structure.
(ii) Article 21 of the Constitution in its broad perspective seeks to protect the persons of their lives
and personal liberties except according to the procedure established by law. The said article in its
broad application not only takes within its fold enforcement of the rights of an accused but also the
rights of the victim. The State has a duty to enforce the human rights of a citizen providing for fair
and impartial investigation against any person accused of commission of a cognizable offence, which
may include its own officers. In certain situations even a witness to the crime may seek for and shall
be granted protection by the State.
(iii) In view of the constitutional scheme and the jurisdiction conferred on this Court under Article
32 and on the High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution the power of judicial review being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 20
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution, no Act of Parliament can exclude or curtail
the powers of the constitutional courts with regard to the enforcement of fundamental rights. As a
matter of fact, such a power is essential to give practicable content to the objectives of the
Constitution embodied in Part III and other parts of the Constitution. Moreover, in a federal
constitution, the distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the State Legislature
involves limitation on legislative powers and, therefore, this requires an authority other than
Parliament to ascertain whether such limitations are transgressed. Judicial review acts as the final
arbiter not only to give effect to the distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the
State Legislatures, it is also necessary to show any transgression by each entity. Therefore, to borrow
the words of Lord Steyn, judicial review is justified by combination of "the principles of separation
of powers, rule of law, the principle of constitutionality and the reach of judicial review".
(iv) If the federal structure is violated by any legislative action, the Constitution takes care to protect
the federal structure by ensuring that the Courts act as guardians and interpreters of the
Constitution and provide remedy under Articles 32 and 226, whenever there is an attempted
violation. In the circumstances, any direction by the Supreme Court or the High Court in exercise of
power under Article 32 or 226 to uphold the Constitution and maintain the rule of law cannot be
termed as violating the federal structure.
(v) Restriction on Parliament by the Constitution and restriction on the executive by Parliament
under an enactment, do not amount to restriction on the power of the Judiciary under Articles 32
and 226 of the Constitution.
(vi) If in terms of Entry 2 of List II of the Seventh Schedule on the one hand and Entry 2-A and
Entry 80 of List I on the other, an investigation by another agency is permissible subject to grant of
consent by the State concerned, there is no reason as to why, in an exceptional situation, the Court
would be precluded from exercising the same power which the Union could exercise in terms of the
provisions of the statute. In our opinion, exercise of such power by the constitutional courts would
not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. In fact, if in such a situation the Court fails to grant
relief, it would be failing in its constitutional duty.
(vii) When the Special Police Act itself provides that subject to the consent by the State, CBI can take
up investigation in relation to the crime which was otherwise within the jurisdiction of the State
police, the Court can also exercise its constitutional power of judicial review and direct CBI to take
up the investigation within the jurisdiction of the State. The power of the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution cannot be taken away, curtailed or diluted by Section 6 of the Special Police
Act. Irrespective of there being any statutory provision acting as a restriction on the powers of the
Courts, the restriction imposed by Section 6 of the Special Police Act on the powers of the Union,
cannot be read as restriction on the powers of the constitutional courts. Therefore, exercise of power
of judicial review by the High Court, in our opinion, would not amount to infringement of either the
doctrine of separation of power or the federal structure.
69. In the final analysis, our answer to the question referred is that a direction by the High Court, in
exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, to CBI to investigate a cognizable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 21
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
offence alleged to have been committed within the territory of a State without the consent of that
State will neither impinge upon the federal structure of the Constitution nor violate the doctrine of
separation of power and shall be valid in law. Being the protectors of civil liberties of the citizens,
this Court and the High Courts have not only the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to
protect the fundamental rights, guaranteed by Part III in general and under Article 21 of the
Constitution in particular, zealously and vigilantly.
70. Before parting with the case, we deem it necessary to emphasise that despite wide powers
conferred by Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, while passing any order, the Courts must bear
in mind certain self-imposed limitations on the exercise of these constitutional powers. The very
plenitude of the power under the said articles requires great caution in its exercise. Insofar as the
question of issuing a direction to CBI to conduct investigation in a case is concerned, although no
inflexible guidelines can be laid down to decide whether or not such power should be exercised but
time and again it has been reiterated that such an order is not to be passed as a matter of routine or
merely because a party has levelled some allegations against the local police. This extraordinary
power must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional situations where it becomes
necessary to provide credibility and instil confidence in investigations or where the incident may
have national and international ramifications or where such an order may be necessary for doing
complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights. Otherwise CBI would be flooded with a large
number of cases and with limited resources, may find it difficult to properly investigate even serious
cases and in the process lose its credibility and purpose with unsatisfactory investigations.
71. In Minor Irrigation & Rural Engg. Services, U.P. v. Sahngoo Ram Arya [(2002) 5 SCC 521 : 2002
SCC (L&S) 775] this Court had said that an order directing an enquiry by CBI should be passed only
when the High Court, after considering the material on record, comes to a conclusion that such
material does disclose a prima facie case calling for an investigation by CBI or any other similar
agency. We respectfully concur with these observations."
(Emphasis supplied) Both these judgments are considered by a subsequent Three Judge Bench of
the Apex Court in the case of DR. NARESH KUMAR MANGLA v. ANITA AGARWAL5 wherein the
Apex Court has answered a point formulated reading 'Transfer of further investigation to the CBI' as
follows:
"D Transfer of further investigation to the CBI
24. The investigation by the UP Police in the present case leaves much to be desired.
We have already extracted in the earlier part of this judgment, the contents of the
counter affidavit which have been filed on behalf of the Deputy Superintendent of
Police, Agra. The contents of the counter affidavit are at a material divergence with
the contents of the charge-sheet filed on 5 November 2020. During the course of the
hearing, this Court has been specifically informed by learned Senior Counsel
appearing on behalf of the State of Uttar Pradesh, that no investigation was
conducted into the allegation in the FIR that the deceased had been murdered.
Though much was sought to be made out of the alleged suicide note, at this stage it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 22
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
needs to be emphasised that its authenticity has been seriously disputed by the
appellant. As the learned Senior Counsel for the State of Uttar Pradesh informed the
Court, the forensic science laboratory referred the matter back in the absence of
adequate material to assess the genuineness of the suicide note and upon
re-submission, a report is awaited.
25. Within a couple of days of the death of Deepti, the alleged suicide note found its
way into the newspapers in Agra. This is in fact a circumstance relied upon by the
learned Counsel for the accused when they submit that despite the publicity given to
the suicide note, the FIR does not impugn its authenticity. The sequence in this case
appears to follow familiar patterns. Immediate publicity was given to the alleged
suicide note. These examples are now becoming familiar.
2020 SCC OnLine SC 1031 Selective disclosures to the media affect the rights of the
accused in some cases and the rights of victims' families in others. The media does
have a legitimate stake in fair reporting. But events such as what has happened in this
case show how the selective divulging of information, including the disclosure of
material which may eventually form a crucial part of the evidentiary record at the
criminal trial, can be used to derail the administration of criminal justice. The
investigating officer has a duty to investigate when information about the
commission of a cognizable offence is brought to their attention. Unfortunately, this
role is being compromised by the manner in which selective leaks take place in the
public realm. This is not fair to the accused because it pulls the rug below the
presumption of innocence. It is not fair to the victims of crime, if they have survived
the crime, and where they have not, to their families. Neither the victims nor their
families have a platform to answer the publication of lurid details about their lives
and circumstances. Having said this, we prima facie reject the insinuation that the
FIR had not doubted or referenced the suicide note, despite its publication in the
news media. The daughter of the appellant had died in mysterious circumstances.
The family had completed the last rites. To expect that they should be scouring the
pages of the print and electronic media before reporting the crime is a mockery of the
human condition. The apprehension of the appellant that A-2 and his family have a
prominent social status in Agra and may have used their position in society to thwart
a proper investigation cannot be regarded to be unjustified.
26. In the backdrop of what has been stated above and the serious deficiencies in the
investigation, we have during the hearing, made all the counsel aware of the
possibility of this court referring the case for further investigation to the CBI. The
court must enter upon the prospect of such a course of action with circumspection for
two reasons. First, this court has repeatedly observed that the power which is vested
in a superior court to transfer the investigation to another agency, such as the CBI,
must be wielded with caution.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 23
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
In a recent judgement of this Court, Arnab Goswami v. Union of India14, one of us
(Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud) had interpreted the rationale underpinning the
circumspection in the following terms:
"44. In assessing the contention for the transfer of the investigation to the CBI, we
have factored into the decision-making calculus the averments on the record and
submissions urged on behalf of the petitioner. We are unable to find any reason that
warrants a transfer of the investigation to the CBI. In holding thus, we have applied
the tests spelt out in the consistent line of precedent of this Court. They have not been
fulfilled. An individual under investigation has a legitimate expectation of a fair
process which accords with law. The displeasure of an accused person about the
manner in which the investigation proceeds or an unsubstantiated allegation (as in
the present case) of a conflict of interest against the police conducting the
investigation must not derail the legitimate course of law and warrant the invocation
of the extraordinary power of this Court to transfer an investigation to the CBI.
Courts assume the extraordinary jurisdiction to transfer an investigation in
exceptional situations to ensure that the sanctity of the administration of criminal
justice is preserved. While no inflexible guidelines are laid down, the notion that such
a transfer is an "extraordinary power" to be used "sparingly" and "in exceptional
circumstances" comports with the idea that routine transfers would belie not just
public confidence in the normal course of law but also render meaningless the
extraordinary situations that warrant the exercise of the power to transfer the
investigation. Having balanced and considered the material on record as well as the
averments of and submissions urged by the petitioner, we find that no case of the
nature which falls within the ambit of the tests enunciated in the precedents of this
Court has been established for the transfer of the investigation."
(emphasis supplied)
27. Second, in the facts of this case, the charge-sheet which is dated 24 October 2020 has been
submitted to the competent court on 5 November 2020. The submission of the charge-sheet does
not oust the jurisdiction of a superior court, when as in the present case, the investigation is tainted
and there is a real likelihood of justice being deflected. In Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad15, a two judge Bench
of this Court, speaking through Justice Swatanter Kumar, has held:
"43. At this stage, we may also state another well-settled canon of the criminal
jurisprudence that the superior courts have the jurisdiction under Section 482 of the
Code or even Article 226 of the Constitution of India to direct "further investigation",
"fresh" or "de novo" and even "reinvestigation". "Fresh", "de novo"
and "reinvestigation" are synonymous expressions and their result in law would be the same. The
superior courts are even vested with the power of transferring investigation from one agency to
another, provided the ends of justice so demand such action. Of course, it is also a settled principle
that this power has to be exercised by the superior courts very sparingly and with great
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 24
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
circumspection."
(emphasis supplied)
28. The court held that wherever a charge-sheet has been submitted to the court, even this Court
would not ordinarily reopen the investigation especially by entrusting it to a specialized agency.
However, in a proper case, when the Court feels that the investigation by the police has not been in
the proper perspective and that in order to do complete justice, where the facts of the case demand
that the investigation be handed over to a specialized agency, a superior court is not bereft of the
authority to do so. (Disha v. State of Gujarat [(2011) 13 SCC 337 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 628] and
Rubabbuddin Sheikh v. State of Gujarat [(2010) 2 SCC 200 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1006])
29. In Pooja Pal v. Union of India16, a two judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Justice
Amitava Roy, observed that there was no embargo on this Court to transfer an investigation to the
CBI after submission of the charge-sheet in the following terms-
"79. The precedential ordainment against absolute prohibition for assignment of
investigation to any impartial agency like CBI, submission of the charge- sheet by the
normal investigating agency in law notwithstanding, albeit in an exceptional fact
situation warranting such initiative, in order to secure a fair, honest and complete
investigation and to consolidate the confidence of the victim(s) and the public in
general in the justice administering mechanism, is thus unquestionably absolute and
hallowed by time. Such a measure, however, can by no means be a matter of course
or routine but has to be essentially adopted in order to live up to and effectuate the
salutary objective of guaranteeing an independent and upright mechanism of justice
dispensation without fear or favour, by treating all alike.....
81. The judicially propounded propositions on the aspects of essentiality and
justifiability for assignment of further investigation or reinvestigation to an
independent investigating agency like CBI, whether or not the probe into a criminal
offence by the local/State Police is pending or completed, irrespective of as well, the
pendency of the resultant trial have concretised over the years, applicability whereof,
however, is contingent on the factual setting involved and the desideratum for
vigilant, sensitised and even-handed justice to the parties.
83....... Though a court's satisfaction of want of proper, fair, impartial and effective
investigation eroding its credence and reliability is the precondition for a direction
for further investigation or reinvestigation, submission of the charge-sheet ipso facto
or the pendency of the trial can by no means be a prohibitive impediment. The
contextual facts and the attendant circumstances have to be singularly evaluated and
analysed to decide the needfulness of further investigation or reinvestigation to
unravel the truth and mete out justice to the parties."

Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
30. Similarly, in Dharam Pal v. State of Haryana17, a two judge Bench of this Court, speaking
through Justice Dipak Mishra (as the learned Chief Justice then was), upheld the power of this
Court to transfer an investigation to the CBI, irrespective of the stage of the trial. It held:
"24. Be it noted here that the constitutional courts can direct for further investigation
or investigation by some other investigating agency. The purpose is, there has to be a
fair investigation and a fair trial. The fair trial may be quite difficult unless there is a
fair investigation. We are absolutely conscious that direction for further investigation
by another agency has to be very sparingly issued but the facts depicted in this case
compel us to exercise the said power. We are disposed to think that purpose of justice
commands that the cause of the victim, the husband of the deceased, deserves to be
answered so that miscarriage of justice is avoided. Therefore, in this case the stage of
the case cannot be the governing factor.
25. ....If a grave suspicion arises with regard to the investigation, should a
constitutional court close its hands and accept the proposition that as the trial has
commenced, the matter is beyond it? That is the "tour de force" of the prosecution
and if we allow ourselves to say so it has become "idée fixe" but in our view the
imperium of the constitutional courts cannot be stifled or smothered by bon mot or
polemic...."
31. Having regard to the circumstances which have emerged on the record, which have been
adverted to in the earlier part of the judgment, we are of the view that it is necessary to entrust a
further investigation of the case to the CBI in exercise of the powers of this Court under Article 142
of the Constitution. The conduct of the investigating authorities from the stage of arriving at the
scene of occurrence to the filing of the charge-sheet do not inspire confidence in the robustness of
the process. A perusal of the charge-sheet evinces a perfunctory rendition of the investigating
authorities' duty by a bare reference to the facts and the presumption under Section 304B of the IPC
when the death occurs within seven years of the marriage. The stance taken by the Deputy
Superintendent of Police in the Counter Affidavit, filed a few days after forwarding the charge-sheet,
travels beyond the scope of the investigation recorded in the charge-sheet with respect to the
veracity of the suicide note, medical examination of injuries and the past miscarriages of the
deceased. Critical facts of the money trail between the deceased, her father (the informant), and the
accused; and the call history of A2, the informant and the deceased are unexplored. No attempt at
custodial interrogation of the applicants was made between the issuance of non-bailable warrants
on 9 September 2020 and interim protection from arrest by the High Court granted on 22
September 2020. As noted above, upon questioning during the hearing, the Counsel for the State
answered that no investigation on the allegation of murder had been conducted. It would indeed be
a travesty if this Court were to ignore the glaring deficiencies in the investigation conducted so far,
irrespective of the stage of the proceedings or the nature of the question before this Court. The
status of the accused as propertied and wealthy persons of influence in Agra and the conduct of the
investigation thus far diminishes this Court's faith in directing a further investigation by the same
authorities. The cause of justice would not be served if the Court were to confine the scope of its
examination to the wisdom of granting anticipatory bail and ignore the possibility of a trial being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 26
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
concluded on the basis of a deficient investigation at best or a biased one at worst.
32. Mr. K.M. Nataraj, Additional Solicitor General of India has appeared in these proceedings with
Mr. Arvind Kumar Sharma, and stated that the CBI would abide by the orders of this Court.
E Summation
33. We accordingly allow the appeal and issue the following directions:
(i) The order passed by the Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad
allowing the applications for anticipatory bail by the respondents-accused shall stand
set aside and the bail granted to them shall stand cancelled; and
(ii) The CBI is directed to conduct a further investigation of the case arising out of
case Crime No. 0623 of 2020 registered at Police Station Tajganj, District Agra, dated
7 August 2020."
(Emphasis supplied)
17. These are the judgments where in the facts and circumstances as obtaining in those cases before
the Apex Court directs investigation to be conducted by the CBI, be it, further, de novo or re. The
judgments quoted hereinabove also caution the Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of
the Cr.P.C. that direction of entrustment of investigation to the CBI should be made sparingly and
only in extraordinary circumstances. The Apex Court found those extraordinary circumstances
existing in those cases before it and, therefore, directed the CBI to take over the investigation, as the
investigation conducted by the Investigating Agencies were so shoddy that the Apex Court had to do
so.
Cases where the Apex Court has declined such request for entrustment of investigation to the hands
of the CBI:
The Apex Court in the case of ROMILA THAPAR v. UNION OF INDIA6 has held as
follows:-
(2018) 10 SCC 753 "24. Turning to the first point, we are of the considered opinion
that the issue is no more res integra.
In Narmada Bai v. State of Gujarat [Narmada Bai v. State of Gujarat, (2011) 5 SCC 79 : (2011) 2 SCC
(Cri) 526] , in para 64, this Court restated that it is trite law that the accused persons do not have a
say in the matter of appointment of investigating agency. Further, the accused persons cannot
choose as to which investigating agency must investigate the offence committed by them. Para 64 of
this decision reads thus : (SCC p. 100) "64. ... It is trite law that the accused persons do not have a
say in the matter of appointment of an investigating agency. The accused persons cannot choose as
to which investigating agency must investigate the alleged offence committed by them."

by the "accused" challenging the order [J. Anbazhagan v. Union of India, 2018 SCC OnLine Mad
1231 : (2018) 3 CTC 449] of the High Court directing investigation by CBI, in para 10 observed :
(SCC pp. 370-71) "10. As regards the second ground urged by the petitioner, we find that even this
aspect has been duly considered in the impugned judgment [J. Anbazhagan v. Union of India, 2018
SCC OnLine Mad 1231: (2018) 3 CTC 449]. In para 129 of the impugned judgment, reliance has been
placed on Dinubhai Boghabhai Solanki v. State of Gujarat [Dinubhai Boghabhai Solanki v. State of
Gujarat, (2014) 4 SCC 626: (2014) 2 SCC (Cri) 384], wherein it has been held that in a writ petition
seeking impartial investigation, the accused was not entitled to opportunity of hearing as a matter of
course. Reliance has also been placed on Narender G. Goel v. State of Maharashtra [Narender G.
Goel v. State of Maharashtra, (2009) 6 SCC 65 :
(2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 933] , in particular, para 11 of the reported decision wherein the
Court observed that it is well settled that the accused has no right to be heard at the
stage of investigation. By entrusting the investigation to CBI which, as aforesaid, was
imperative in the peculiar facts of the present case, the fact that the petitioner was
not impleaded as a party in the writ petition or for that matter, was not heard, in our
opinion, will be of no avail. That per se cannot be the basis to label the impugned
judgment as a nullity."
27. This Court in Divine Retreat Centre v. State of Kerala [Divine Retreat Centre v. State of Kerala,
(2008) 3 SCC 542 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 9] , has enunciated that the High Court in exercise of its
inherent jurisdiction cannot change the investigating officer in the midstream and appoint an
investigating officer of its own choice to investigate into a crime on whatsoever basis. The Court
made it amply clear that neither the accused nor the complainant or informant are entitled to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 28
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
choose their own investigating agency, to investigate the crime, in which they are interested. The
Court then went on to clarify that the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the
Constitution can always issue appropriate directions at the instance of the aggrieved person if the
High Court is convinced that the power of investigation has been exercised by the investigating
officer mala fide.
28. Be that as it may, it will be useful to advert to the exposition in State of W.B. v. Committee for
Protection of Democratic Rights [State of W.B. v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights,
(2010) 3 SCC 571 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 401] . In para 70 of the said decision, the Constitution Bench
observed thus: (SCC p. 602) "70. Before parting with the case, we deem it necessary to emphasise
that despite wide powers conferred by Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, while passing any
order, the courts must bear in mind certain self-imposed limitations on the exercise of these
constitutional powers. The very plenitude of the power under the said Articles requires great caution
in its exercise. Insofar as the question of issuing a direction to CBI to conduct investigation in a case
is concerned, although no inflexible guidelines can be laid down to decide whether or not such
power should be exercised but time and again it has been reiterated that such an order is not to be
passed as a matter of routine or merely because a party has levelled some allegations against the
local police. This extraordinary power must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional
situations where it becomes necessary to provide credibility and instil confidence in investigations
or where the incident may have national and international ramifications or where such an order may
be necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights. Otherwise CBI would
be flooded with a large number of cases and with limited resources, may find it difficult to properly
investigate even serious cases and in the process lose its credibility and purpose with unsatisfactory
investigations."
Later, the Apex Court in the case of ARNAB RANJAN GOSWAMI v. UNION OF INDIA7 where an
identical circumstance arose before the Apex Court and the allegation was against the local police
that they would conduct or have conducted a shoddy investigation and, therefore, the matter will
have to be referred to the CBI, the Apex Court specifically rejects the said prayer by answering as
follows:
"42. The transfer of an investigation to CBI is not a matter of routine. The precedents
of this Court emphasise that this is an "extraordinary power" to be used "sparingly"
and "in exceptional circumstances".
Speaking for a Constitution Bench in State of W.B. v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights
[State of W.B. v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, (2010) 3 SCC 571 : (2010) 2 SCC
(Cri) 401] ("CPDR, West Bengal"), D.K. Jain, J. observed: (SCC p. 602, para 70) "70. ... despite wide
powers conferred by Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, while passing any order, the courts
must bear in mind certain self-imposed limitations on the exercise of these constitutional powers.
The very plenitude of the power under the said articles requires great caution in its exercise. Insofar
as the question of issuing a direction to CBI to conduct investigation in a case is concerned, although
no inflexible guidelines can be laid down to decide whether or not such power should be exercised

or merely because a party has levelled some allegations against the local police. This extraordinary
power must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional situations where it becomes
(2020) 14 SCC 12 necessary to provide credibility and instil confidence in investigations or where
the incident may have national and international ramifications or where such an order may be
necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights. Otherwise CBI would be
flooded with a large number of cases and with limited resources, may find it difficult to properly

investigations."
(emphasis supplied)
43. This principle has been reiterated in K.V. Rajendran v. CBCID [K.V. Rajendran v. CBCID, (2013)
12 SCC 480 : (2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 578] . Dr B.S. Chauhan, J. speaking for a three-Judge Bench of this
Court held: (SCC p. 485, para
13) "13. ... This Court has time and again dealt with the issue under what circumstances the
investigation can be transferred from the State investigating agency to any other independent
investigating agency like CBI. It has been held that the power of transferring such investigation must
be in rare and exceptional cases where the court finds it necessary in order to do justice between the
parties and to instil confidence in the public mind, or where investigation by the State police lacks
credibility and it is necessary for having "a fair, honest and complete investigation", and
particularly, when it is imperative to retain public confidence in the impartial working of the State
agencies."
44. Elaborating on this principle, this Court observed:
(K.V. Rajendran case [K.V. Rajendran v. CBCID, (2013) 12 SCC 480 : (2014) 4 SCC
(Cri) 578] , SCC p. 487, para 17) "17. ... the Court could exercise its constitutional
powers for transferring an investigation from the State investigating agency to any
other independent investigating agency like CBI only in rare and exceptional cases.
Such as where high officials of State authorities are involved, or the accusation itself
is against the top officials of the investigating agency thereby allowing them to
influence the investigation, and further that it is so necessary to do justice and to
instil confidence in the investigation or where the investigation is prima facie found
to be tainted/biased."
The Court reiterated that an investigation may be transferred to CBI only in "rare and exceptional
cases". One factor that courts may consider is that such transfer is "imperative" to retain "public
confidence in the impartial working of the State agencies". This observation must be read with the
observations by the Constitution Bench in CPDR [State of W.B. v. Committee for Protection of
Democratic Rights, (2010) 3 SCC 571 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 401] , that mere allegations against the
police do not constitute a sufficient basis to transfer the investigation.

45. In Romila Thapar v. Union of India [Romila Thapar v. Union of India, (2018) 10 SCC 753 :
(2019) 1 SCC (Cri) 638] , A.M. Khanwilkar, J. speaking for a three-Judge Bench of this Court (one of
us, Dr D.Y. Chandrachud, J. dissenting) noted the dictum in a line of precedents laying down the
principle that the accused "does not have a say in the matter of appointment of investigating
agency". In reiterating this principle, this Court relied upon its earlier decisions in Narmada Bai v.
State of Gujarat [Narmada Bai v. State of Gujarat, (2011) 5 SCC 79 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 526] , Sanjiv
Rajendra Bhatt v. Union of India [Sanjiv Rajendra Bhatt v. Union of India, (2016) 1 SCC 1 : (2016) 1
SCC (Cri) 193 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 1] , E. Sivakumar v. Union of India [E. Sivakumar v. Union of
India, (2018) 7 SCC 365 : (2018) 3 SCC (Cri) 49] and Divine Retreat Centre v. State of Kerala [Divine
Retreat Centre v. State of Kerala, (2008) 3 SCC 542 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 9] . This Court observed:
(Romila Thapar case [Romila Thapar v. Union of India, (2018) 10 SCC 753 : (2019) 1 SCC (Cri) 638]
, SCC p. 776, para 30) "30. ... the consistent view of this Court is that the accused cannot ask for
changing the investigating agency or to do investigation in a particular manner including for
court-monitored investigation."
46. The principle of law that emerges from the precedents of this Court is that the power to transfer
an investigation must be used "sparingly" and only "in exceptional circumstances". In assessing the
plea urged by the petitioner that the investigation must be transferred to CBI, we are guided by the
parameters laid down by this Court for the exercise of that extraordinary power. It is necessary to
address the grounds on which the petitioner seeks a transfer of the investigation.
47. As we have observed earlier, the petitioner requested for and consented to the transfer of the
investigation of the FIR from Police Station Sadar, District Nagpur City to N.M. Joshi Marg Police
Station in Mumbai. He did so because an earlier FIR lodged by him at that police station was under
investigation. The petitioner now seeks to pre-empt an investigation by Mumbai Police. The basis on
which the petitioner seeks to achieve this is untenable. An accused person does not have a choice in
regard to the mode or manner in which the investigation should be carried out or in regard to the
investigating agency. The line of interrogation either of the petitioner or of the CFO cannot be
controlled or dictated by the persons under investigation/interrogation. In P.Chidambaram v.
Directorate of Enforcement [P. Chidambaram v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2019) 9 SCC 24:
(2019) 3 SCC (Cri) 509], R. Banumathi, J. speaking for a two-Judge Bench of this Court held that:
(SCC p. 56, para 66) "66. ... there is a well-defined and demarcated function in the field of
investigation and its subsequent adjudication. It is not the function of the court to monitor the
investigation process so long as the investigation does not violate any provision of law. It must be
left to the discretion of the investigating agency to decide the course of investigation. If the court is
to interfere in each and every stage of the investigation and the interrogation of the accused, it
would affect the normal course of investigation. It must be left to the investigating agency to proceed
in its own manner in interrogation of the accused, nature of questions put to him and the manner of
interrogation of the accused."
(emphasis supplied) This Court held that so long as the investigation does not violate any provision
of law, the investigating agency is vested with the discretion in directing the course of investigation,
which includes determining the nature of the questions and the manner of interrogation. In
adopting this view, this Court relied upon its earlier decisions in State of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma [State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 31
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 222 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 192] and Dukhishyam Benupani v.
Arun Kumar Bajoria [Dukhishyam Benupani v. Arun Kumar Bajoria, (1998) 1 SCC 52 : 1998 SCC
(Cri) 261] in which it was held that the investigating agency is entitled to decide "the venue, the
timings and the questions and the manner of putting such questions" during the course of the
investigation.
48. In CBI v. Niyamavedi [CBI v. Niyamavedi, 1995) 3 SCC 601: 1995 SCC (Cri) 558] , Sujata V.
Manohar, J., speaking for a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that the High Court [Neyamavedi
v. Ramon Srivastava, 1995 SCC OnLine Ker 15: (1995) 1 KLJ 353] should have: (Niyamavedi case
[CBI v. Niyamavedi, (1995) 3 SCC 601 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 558] , SCC p. 603, para 4) "4. ... refrained
from making any comments on the manner in which investigation was being conducted by CBI,
looking to the fact that the investigation was far from complete."
This Court observed that: (Niyamavedi case [CBI v. Niyamavedi, (1995) 3 SCC 601: 1995 SCC (Cri)
558] , SCC p. 603, para 4) "4. ... Any observations which may amount to interference in the
investigation, should not be made. Ordinarily the Court should refrain from interfering at a
premature stage of the investigation as that may derail the investigation and demoralise the
investigation. Of late, the tendency to interfere in the investigation is on the increase and courts
should be wary of its possible consequences."
This Court adopted the position that courts must refrain from passing comments on an ongoing
investigation to extend to the investigating agencies the requisite liberty and protection in
conducting a fair, transparent and just investigation.
50. The petitioner has then sought to rely upon the allegations which he has levelled against the CP,
Mumbai. The petitioner was interrogated on 27-4-2020. The allegations which he levelled against
the CP, Mumbai were in the course of a television programme on 28-4-2020 ("Poochta Hai Bharat")
relayed on R. Bharat at 1900 hrs. As we have noted earlier, this Court has, in CPDR [State of W.B. v.
Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, (2010) 3 SCC 571 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 401] held that
no transfer of investigation can be ordered "merely because a party has levelled some allegations
against the local police". Accordingly, we do not find that levelling such allegations would by and
itself constitute a sufficient ground for the transfer of the investigation."
(Emphasis supplied) Considering the entire spectrum of law, the Apex Court in a later judgment in
the case of HIMANSHU KUMAR v. STATE OF CHHATTISGARH8 has held as follows:-
"44. It is now settled law that if a citizen, who is a de facto complainant in a criminal
case alleging commission of cognizable offence affecting violation of his legal or
fundamental rights against high Government officials or influential persons, prays
before a Court for a direction of investigation of the said alleged offence by the CBI,
such prayer should not be granted on mere asking. A Constitution Bench of this
Court, in the case of the State of West Bengal v. Committee for Protection of
Democratic Rights, West Bengal, reported in (2010) 3 SCC 571, has made the
following observations pointing out the 2022 SCC OnLine SC 884 situations where
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 32
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
the prayer for investigation by the CBI should be allowed:
"70.... In so far as the question of issuing a direction to CBI to conduct investigation
in a case is concerned, although no inflexible guidelines can be laid down to decide
whether or not such powers should be exercised, but time and again it has been
reiterated that such an order is not to be passed as a matter of routine or merely
because a party has levelled some allegations against the local police. This
extraordinary power must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional
situations where it becomes necessary to provide credibility and instil confidence in
investigations or where the incident may have national and international
ramifications or where such an order may be necessary for doing complete justice
and enforcing the fundamental rights. Otherwise CBI would be flooded with a large
number of cases and with limited resources, may find it difficult to properly
investigate even serious cases and in the process lose its credibility and purpose with
unsatisfactory investigations."
(emphasis supplied)
45. In the above decision, it was also pointed out that the same court in Secretary, Minor Irrigation
& Rural Engineering Services, U.P. v. Sahngoo Ram Arya, (2002) 5 SCC 521, had said that an order
directing an enquiry by the CBI should be passed only when the High Court, after considering the
material on record, comes to the conclusion that such material does disclose a prima facie case
calling for an investigation by the CBI or any other similar agency.
46. In an appropriate case when the Court feels that the investigation by the police authorities is not
in a proper direction, and in order to do complete justice in the case and if high police officials are
involved in the alleged crime, the Court may be justified in such circumstances to handover the
investigation to an independent agency like the CBI. By now it is well-settled that even after the
filing of the charge sheet the court is empowered in an appropriate case to handover the
investigation to an independent agency like the CBI.
47. The extraordinary power of the Constitutional Courts under Articles 32 and 226 respectively of
the Constitution of India qua the issuance of directions to the CBI to conduct investigation must be
exercised with great caution as underlined by this Court in the case of Committee for Protection of
Democratic Rights, West Bengal (supra) as adverted to herein above, observing that although no
inflexible guidelines can be laid down in this regard, yet it was highlighted that such an order cannot
be passed as a matter of routine or merely because the parties have levelled some allegations against
the local police and can be invoked in exceptional situations where it becomes necessary to provide
credibility and instill confidence in the investigation or where the incident may have national or
international ramifications or where such an order may be necessary for doing complete justice and
for enforcing the fundamental rights. We are conscious of the fact that though a satisfaction of want
of proper, fair, impartial and effective investigation eroding its credence and reliability is the
precondition for a direction for further investigation or re-investigation, submission of the charge
sheet ipso facto or the pendency of the trial can, by no means, be a prohibitive impediment. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 33
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
contextual facts and the attendant circumstances have to be singularly evaluated and analyzed to
decide the needfulness of further investigation or re- investigation to unravel the truth and mete out
justice to the parties. The prime concern and the endeavour of the court of law should be to secure
justice on the basis of true facts which ought to be unearthed through a committed, resolved and a
competent investigating agency.
48. The above principle has been reiterated in K.V. Rajendran v. Superintendent of Police, CBCID
South Zone, Chennai, (2013) 12 SCC 480. Dr. B.S. Chauhan, J. speaking for a three-Judge Bench of
this Court held:
"13. ...This Court has time and again dealt with the issue under what circumstances
the investigation can be transferred from the State investigating agency to any other
independent investigating agency like CBI. It has been held that the power of
transferring such investigation must be in rare and exceptional cases where the court
finds it necessary in order to do justice between the parties and to instil confidence in
the public mind, or where investigation by the State police lacks credibility and it is
necessary for having "a fair, honest and complete investigation", and particularly,
when it is imperative to retain public confidence in the impartial working of the State
agencies. ..."
49. Elaborating on this principle, this Court further observed:
"17. ... the Court could exercise its constitutional powers for transferring an
investigation from the State investigating agency to any other independent
investigating agency like CBI only in rare and exceptional cases. Such as where high
officials of State authorities are involved, or the accusation itself is against the top
officials of the investigating agency thereby allowing them to influence the
investigation, and further that it is so necessary to do justice and to instil confidence
in the investigation or where the investigation is prima facie found to be
tainted/biased."
50. The Court reiterated that an investigation may be transferred to the CBI only in "rare and
exceptional cases". One factor that courts may consider is that such transfer is "imperative" to retain
"public confidence in the impartial working of the State agencies." This observation must be read
with the observations made by the Constitution Bench in the case of Committee for Protection of
Democratic Rights, West Bengal (supra), that mere allegations against the police do not constitute a
sufficient basis to transfer the investigation.
51. In Romila Thapar v. Union of India, (2018) 10 SCC 753, one of us, A.M. Khanwilkar, J., speaking
for a three-Judge Bench of this Court (Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. dissenting) noted the dictum in a
line of precedents laying down the principle that the accused "does not have a say in the matter of
appointment of investigating agency". In reiterating this principle, this Court relied upon its earlier
decisions in Narmada Bai v. State of Gujarat, (2011) 5 SCC 79, Sanjiv Rajendra Bhatt v. Union of
India, (2016) 1 SCC 1, E. Sivakumar v. Union of India, (2018) 7 SCC 365, and Divine Retreat Centre
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 34
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
v. State of Kerala, (2008) 3 SCC 542. This Court observed:
"30...the consistent view of this Court is that the accused cannot ask for changing the
investigating agency or to do investigation in a particular manner including for
court-monitored investigation."
52. It has been held by this Court in CBI v. Rajesh Gandhi, 1997 Cri LJ 63, that no one can insist that
an offence be investigated by a particular agency. We fully agree with the view in the aforesaid
decision. An aggrieved person can only claim that the offence he alleges be investigated properly,
but he has no right to claim that it be investigated by any particular agency of his choice.
53. The principle of law that emerges from the precedents of this Court is that the power to transfer
an investigation must be used "sparingly" and only "in exceptional circumstances". In assessing the
plea urged by the petitioner that the investigation must be transferred to the CBI, we are guided by
the parameters laid down by this Court for the exercise of that extraordinary power."
(Emphasis supplied)
18. On a coalesce of the judgments relied on by the learned senior counsel for the petitioners and the
ones that are rendered by the Apex Court as quoted hereinabove, both, referring the investigation to
CBI at whatever stage the trial or investigation was, and the ones declining to refer the issue to the
hands of the CBI, what would unmistakably emerge is that the power to transfer the investigation
must be used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances, within the parameters as laid down
by the Apex Court in the afore-quoted judgments. An investigation could be transferred to the CBI
when it becomes imperative to retain public confidence in the impartial working of Investigating
Agencies. It would also emerge that it is not for the complainant, based upon certain allegations
against the investigating agency, to choose the agency which he would want to investigate in a given
case unless such circumstances exist.
19. In the case at hand, the investigation at the outset, was sought to be conducted by the
jurisdictional police. For over a year nothing had happened. It is then the petitioner had knocked the
doors of this Court alleging that the accused who are in a position to influence the jurisdictional
police are not permitting investigation to be held into the crime. It is then, this Court directed
constitution of a Special Investigating Team. The report submitted by the team is not found favour
at the hands of the learned Magistrate.
Therefore, what becomes necessary is, consideration of the prayer of the petitioner for reference of
the matter to the CBI bearing in mind, the observations made by the Apex Court in the afore-quoted
judgments and on their touchstone, considering the facts obtaining in the case at hand or the
allegations of lacunae in the investigation. The contentions of the petitioners in support of their
prayer for entrustment of investigation to the CBI are as follows:
"43. The defects and deficiencies in the investigation of SIT in all the three case are in
short extracted as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 35
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
44(i). In respect of FIR in Crime No.89/2020 of HAL Police Station, Bangalore for
offences under Section 120B, 467, 468, 421, 474, 302, 464, 471 of Indian Penal Code:
1. This FIR was registered as per the order dated 02-03-2020 passed by the Hon'ble
XXIX Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore in PCR No. 15691/2020
under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to conduct investigation and
submit report.
2. As per the direction of this Hon'ble High Court, the SIT team ought to have
conducted thorough investigation regarding the murder of Mr. K.Raghunath
committed by respondent Nos. 10 to 14. But the SIT failed to conduct investigation in
right direction.
3. It is the fact that, on 02-05-2019 respondent No.14 secured the presence of
K.Raghunath to Vaidehi Hospital because respondent NO.10 also coming there to
talk with him, because Mr. Raghunath was planning to sell one of his property and
the registration date was fixed on 4-05-2019.
4. As per the call of respondent No.14, deceased Raghunath reached Vaidehi Hospital
on 2-05-2019 and thereafter he did not return. In Hospital respondent Nos. 10 to 13
were also present and they had put pressure for him to transfer all the properties to
the name of respondent No.10, for which he did not agree.
This information was conveyed by the deceased Raghunath to petitioner by telephonic call.
5. Since 02-05-2019, the deceased Raghunath was not allowed to go from the custody of respondent
Nos. 10 to 13 and he was in their custody till his death.
6. Respondent No.10 has planned to kill Mr. Raghunath if he was not agreeing to transfer all the
properties to his name.
7. Deceased Raghunath has given a last call at 5 a.m. on 4-05-2019 and he has informed his wife that
the problem is not being solved and it is taking serious turn and he assured that he will come back.
Then again at 7-30 a.m. since Raghunath not come, wife made call to him, then he narrated the
torture and pressure put on him to transfer property and then he had expressed threat to his life at
the hands of respondent Nos. 10 to 14 and they will not spare him. This version of deceased
Raghunath was like a dying declaration, implicating respondent Nos. 10 to 14 before petitioner No.1.
8. Immediately the petitioner No.1 sent petitioner No.2 to Guest House of respondent No.10 to
know the well being of Raghunath.
9. Accordingly, petitioner No.2 has rushed to Guest House of respondent No.10 at 8 a.m. on
4-05-2019 and found that the deceased Raghunath was hanging to ceiling fan and respondent Nos.
10 to 13 have slipped away by forcibly hanging deceased Raghunath to ceiling fan and this was told
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 36
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
by security guard to petitioner No.2.
10. The petitioner No.2 was under shock, seeing his father in hanging posture, his first concern was
to save the life of his father and immediately with the help of security person and neighbours
brought down Mr. Raghunath from ligature and taken to Vydhehi Hospital for treatment, where he
was declared as brought dead.
11. After the deceased was declared as brought dead, by then respondent Nos. 10 to 13 have also
reached the said hospital and then they took active role in quick succession as to how speedily the
dead body could be disposed off.
12. Respondent No.11 Damodar, took the active role of getting registered UDR case and formal
Inquest was completed and within short time formal Post Mortem in their own hospital i.e., Vydehi
Hospital was got conducted by putting pressure on the HAL Police and arranged the dead body to be
kept in Ambulance and not allowed the petitioners to think as to what to do but they were sent in the
Ambulance with the dead body to be buried at Chittoor District and the respondent Nos. 10 to 13
have swiftly arranged all formalities for burial of dead body. Thereby right from the beginning they
managed to screen the evidence of murder and then the petitioners were under shock and helpless
condition, thereby they could not lodge complaint at the earliest. But later petitioner No.1 lodged
complaint to police regarding the murder of her husband but the police did not take any step to
investigate the matter because of intervention of respondent No.10.
13. The Mobile telephonic conversation from 2-05-2019 till 4-05-2019 by deceased with the wife
(petitioner No.1) speaks for all the circumstances of murder i.e., conspiracy to murder, motive,
preparation, commission of the murder by forcibly hanging and then absconded and destroyed the
evidence of murder and swift action was taken to screen the offence of murder and the real
offenders.
14. The subsequent conduct of respondent No.10 was to concoct a Will in the name of deceased
Raghunath for an ante date i.e., 20-04-2018 by using counterfeited stamp papers and get registered
this Will after seven months after death of Raghunath through respondent No.11 Mr.Damodar.
15. At the time of creation of Will, other documents like memorandum of understanding,
agreements, assignments, declaration and letters in 31 documents have been fabricated to show that
deceased Raghunath has executed them in favour of respondent No.10.
16. By then it was not known to respondent Nos. 10 to 14 that the deceased Raghunath has left the
registered Will on 28-01-2016 itself.
17. Therefore, the post conduct of respondent Nos. 10 to 13 in fabrication of Will, Memorandum of
understandings and other documents, completes the link in the chain of circumstances for the
offence of murder of Mr. Raghunath.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 37
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
18. Cause of death as per post-mortem report is that the death was due to Asphyxia as a result of
hanging.
19. It was not a suicidal hanging. The deceased was forcibly hanged and made to appear as self
hanging. At that juncture the deceased Raghunath was held by respondent Nos. 10 to 13 in their
premises, this is strong circumstance pointing out towards their guilt.
20. Death of deceased was executed within short time of deceased informing his wife about threat to
his life that was at 7.30 a.m. on 4-05-2019 and the petitioner No.2 rushed to scene of occurrence by
8 a.m. and by then he was found hanging and the respondent Nos. 10 to 13 have escaped after
commission of his murder.
21. The conduct of respondent Nos. 10 to 13 in escaping from the scene of occurrence is another
strong circumstance against them.
22. Death has resulted in the premises of respondent No.10 and he was last seen alive with the
deceased along with R-11 to 13 and they have to account for the sudden death of Raghunath. Last
seen circumstance is a strong circumstance in a murder case.
23. Collection of CCTV footages to show the presence and movements of respondent Nos. 10 to 14 in
and around the place of occurrence was required, but the SIT failed to collect this important
Electronic evidence.
24. Call details of deceased mobile and of petitioner No.1 to show that the deceased Raghunath has
informed threat to his life at the hands of respondent Nos.10 to 14 on 4-05-2019 at 5 a.m. and 7.30
a.m.
25. Instead of collecting all these and many more evidence regarding murder of deceased
Raghunath, the SIT have misdirected their investigation and made every attempt to show that the
deceased Raghunath committed suicide.
26. The SIT adopted a reverse mode of investigation to rescue the real offenders and thereby the
investigation was a camouflage to cover up the guilty act of respondent Nos. 10 to 14.
27. The SIT Investigation Officer has failed to record the full statements of petitioners and not
examined many witnesses in and around the scene of occurrence regarding the presence and
movement of respondent Nos. 10 to 14.
28. The SIT has glorified the statements of A1 to A4 (respondent Nos. 10 to 13) to shield them from
the act of brutal murder of Raghunath.
29. SIT got exhumed the dead body and collected bones and subjected it for DNA, which was not
required because the identity of dead body was not in dispute but this was done only to get negative
autopsy report and also to show that SIT has done something. But in reality it is an act of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 38
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
misdirection of investigation, to cover up the act of respondent Nos. 10 to 14.
30. During SIT's further investigation, the genuine Will left by the deceased not got compared
through handwriting expert by sending admitted signatures of deceased Raghunath, which was in
many original registered sale deeds, bank cheques produced by petitioners and available in record.
Instead the SIT has sent the forged and fabricated Will dated 20-04-2018, for handwriting analysis
with the forged specimen signatures created by accused on vouchers of their Hospital, father than
sending admitted signatures of deceased Raghunath and got false report of handwriting expert,
having compared the forged signature with forged specimen. In fact the other documents like
memorandum of understanding agreements, assignment agreements, declarations and letters in all
thirty in number which are said to be executed by Raghunath are not got compared and because
they knew that they are fabricated and not tally with the signature of the deceased Raghunath, and
the genuine Will executed by deceased Raghunath has not been compared on the pretext that
original Will was not given, but actually it was agreed to be given through safe custody. But the SIT
was insisting to produce directly to him, without even mahazar being prepared and keeping in safe
custody.
31. The genuine Will dated 28-01-2016 is the material document left by deceased Raghunath in
favour of petitioners in respect of all the assets of him and the petitioners though apprehended
insecurity but agreed to produce the original Will for the purpose of comparison by handwriting
expert. But, the SIT Investigating Officer failed to collect under proper safe custody and thereby no
Investigation was done on this genuine Will.
32. Like this many incriminating evidence available are not collected. But adopted a short cut and
diverted route of investigation which could help to shield the respondent Nos. 10 to 14. Therefore
the investi-gation conducted regarding murder of deceased Raghunath is defective and unfair and
therefore, the 'B' report filed by SIT regarding murder of deceased Raghunath is a false report liable
to be rejected and in the facts and circumstances of the case, fresh investigation is to be ordered at
the hands of investigation agency like CBI (respondent No.9) otherwise justice will be buried.
... ... ... ..."
20. It is not in dispute that the learned Magistrate himself has declined to accept 'B' report filed by
the Police. Therefore, the issue before this Court is not whether to direct further investigation in the
matter, as the learned Magistrate himself has directed further investigation, but erroneously to a
different Authority. If the reasons as quoted hereinabove are noticed, inference would be that the
learned senior counsel for the petitioners is right in contending that another round of investigation
by another Special Investigating Team would be an exercise in futility. This Court had already
directed constitution of a Special Investigating Team. The report of the said team is not found favour
with the learned Magistrate. The issues pointed out by the learned senior counsel as is quoted
hereinabove can be described as follows:
20.1. On 02-05-2019 respondent No.14 had secured the presence of the deceased
K.Raghunath to Vydehi Hospital on the ground that respondent No.10 was also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186294029/ 39
Smt M Manjula vs State Of Karnataka on 3 September, 2022
coming there to hold talks with him. The ground on which the deceased was called
was the information available to respondent No.14 that deceased intends to sell one
of his properties and the registration date was fixed as 4-
05-2019. The deceased Raghunath reached Vydehi Hospital on 2- 05-2019 and never returned back.
It is therefore, contended that the deceased Raghunath was not allowed to go out from the custody
of respondents 10 to 13 till his death. The allegation is that respondent No.10 had already planned to
kill Raghunath. It is the contention of the learned senior counsel that the deceased Raghunath had
given a last call to his wife, the 1st petitioner herein at 5.00 a.m. on 04-05-2019 and alleges to have
narrated that he was not sure of coming back. The second petitioner, son of the deceased on his visit
to the Guest House of respondent No.10 sees the body of his father hanging on the ceiling fan after it
was told by the security guard to the son of the deceased. The body was hurriedly kept in an
ambulance; the petitioners were not allowed to think the reason for the death and the deceased was
hurriedly buried in Chittoor.
20.2. The learned senior counsel would emphasise upon the later events that have happened. After
the death of Raghunath a Will comes to be registered which bears the signature of the deceased, of
the property that was already subject matter of registered Will in the name of the 1st petitioner. It is
the allegation that signatures on the said Will are forged without knowing that there was already a
registered Will of the property in the name of the 1st petitioner. The learned senior counsel would
contend that conspiracy to murder, motive, preparation, commission is given a go-bye by the
investigating team. The contention is that the investigating team instead of collecting all the
aforesaid and much more evidence concerning the death of the deceased Raghunath, misdirected
the very investigation and made every attempt to show the deceased as having committed suicide.
CCTV footage would show the presence of movements of respondents 10 to 14 in and round the
place of occurrence of the incident. The SIT failed to collect this evidence even. Call record details of
the deceased with the 1st petitioner are not looked into. It is the allegation that SIT adopted a
reverse mode of investigation to rescue the real offender and made the investigation into a
camouflage to protect the guilty because of respondents 10 to 14. If what is narrated hereinabove or
what is extracted from the memorandum of petition is noticed, it becomes a case where further
investigation as is directed by the learned Magistrate stands to reason, but the issue would be
whether a further investigation should be directed to be conducted by the SIT or by the CBI, as is
prayed for in the petition.
21. In the light of the aforesaid facts and the lacunae, glaring enough they are, and the judgments
rendered by the Apex Court (supra), it becomes a case where the issue will have to be thrashed out
by conduct of a further investigation, not from the hands of the very Special Investigation Team or
direction to constitute a second Special Investigation Team, but to be conducted by an independent
agency - The Central Bureau of Investigation, as constitution of another Special Investigating Team
would be of no avail, since there is already a report of the Special Investigating Team, which is not
found favour even with the learned Magistrate, on the presence of the aforesaid lacunae in
investigation.

22. This Court is cautious of the fact that extraordinary power to hand over investigation to the CBI
is to be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional circumstances where it becomes necessary
to provide credibility and instill confidence in investigation or whether such an order would become
necessary for doing complete justice. Therefore, in the contextual facts and the attendant
circumstances as analyzed hereinabove, further investigation to unravel the truth is necessary, as
the prime concern and endeavour of a Court of law is to secure justice, on the basis of true facts,
which ought to be unearthed through a competent investigating agency. One chance was rendered to
the Investigating Team of the State which has filed a 'B' report even on a FIR being filed for offence
punishable under Section 302 of the IPC - murder. It is, therefore, the learned Magistrate has
directed further investigation into the matter.
23. It is not for the victim to claim or choose the investigating agency he wants to get it investigated
and that is not the tenor of the prayer in the case at hand. The prayer is that on two occasions
- one by the Police and one by the Special Investigating Team, there has been shoddy investigation
which did sound acceptance in the light of the aforesaid circumstances and the contextual facts, as
narrated hereinabove. Merely because a party has levelled some allegations against the local Police
of conduct of shoddy investigation would not by itself constitute a sufficient ground for transfer of
investigation to the CBI. But, the case at hand is not the one that brings about such circumstance.
Elaborate lacunae are pointed out by the learned senior counsel with regard to the investigation
conducted by the Special Investigating Team. There cannot be Special Investigating Team-1 which
has already conducted an investigation to again to move to another Special Investigating Team to
make it Special Investigating Team-2 as they form part of the local police.
24. It is trite law that Article 21 embraces both the life and liberty of the accused as well as the
interest of the victim, his or her near and dear ones, as well as of the community at large. A life is
lost in the case at hand, it is therefore the victim who have lost their breadwinner are fighting for
justice and conduct of a fair trial.
It is by now a well settled principle of law, judicially recognized, that fair trial includes, fair
investigation and these form facets, inter alia of Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India. If on
these contours the facts in a given case demands transfer of investigation, to the hands of an
impartial agency, it should be considered, in furtherance of a call to render complete justice and
protection of human rights, such reference would become imperative particularly in the wake of ever
overwhelming cause of justice. The contention of the petitioner is that the status of the accused
being so powerful, are in a position to wield abundant influence upon any investigating team of the
State, this submission would further wane out the Courts faith in directing further investigation by
SIT-1 or by constitution of a SIT-2.
25. Being guided by the parameters laid down by the Apex Court in the afore-quoted judgments to
transfer the case to the CBI, I deem it necessary and expedient to direct further investigation by
handing over such investigation to the hands of the Central Bureau of Investigation-the 9th
respondent herein.
