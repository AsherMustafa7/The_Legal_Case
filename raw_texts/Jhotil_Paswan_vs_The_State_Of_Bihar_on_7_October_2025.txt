for re-investigation or further Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.62013 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025
investigation ? Bagaha P.S.Case No.66 of 2002 was instituted against the petitioner, two other
named accused persons and other unknown persons under Section 447, 341, 342, 323, 504 and 34
of the Indian Penal Code.
4. As per the allegations made in the FIR on 08.04.2002, between 1:00 and 2:00 PM, the informant,
Shri Dayanand Dwivedi, was sitting in his drawing room when the accused, Shri Purnmasi Ram,
along with co-accused Jhotil Paswan, Amarnath Mukherjee, and several unknown persons, arrived
at his residence in a Gypsy vehicle. The informant's son, Dhananjay Kumar Dwivedi, noticed their
arrival, and the informant opened the door to greet them. The accused Purnmasi Ram questioned
the informant regarding a scam case filed before the Hon'ble High Court at Patna, to which the
informant replied that the responsible parties were ministers of the concerned department.
Thereupon, the accused Purnmasi Ram forcibly grabbed the informant's forearm, while the other
accused pushed him from behind, compelled him to enter the Gypsy vehicle, and assaulted him en
route as well as at the Bagaha assembly premises, causing serious injuries. It is alleged that the
accused acted in furtherance of a common intention motivated by ongoing opposition against them
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.62013 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025 related to scam cases and land
disputes. The incident was witnessed by numerous persons both at the informant's residence and at
the assembly hall in Bagaha. Consequently, Bagaha P.S. Case No. 66 of 2002 was registered under
Sections 447, 341, 342, 323, 504, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code against the accused persons, and
for the same occurrence petitioner has also lodged FIR against the opposite party no. 2 bearing
Bagaha P.S. Case No. 65 of 2002 registered under sections 341,323,307,504 of Indian Penal Code
and under sections 25(1-b)(A),26,27 of the SC/ST Act.
5. Today, Mr. Shailesh Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and Mr. Natraj
Verma, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the informant inform that they are associated with
the different political parties and due to political rivalries, each of them have lodged criminal case
after criminal case against each other and now both of them seek to buy peace of mind. They are
agreed to enter into a compromise outside court and settle their strained relationship.
6. It is jointly submitted by both the parties that around four months' time will be required to
complete the entire process of settlement between the parties. Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.62013 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025
7. Heard the parties.
8. Considering the nature of allegation and the fact that the injury is simple in nature, this Court
leads to conclude that the overt act attributed to the petitioners cannot bring them within the four
corners of the Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. In this regard, I find it apt to take note of the
observation made by the Apex Court recently in case of Naushey Ali & Ors. Vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh & Anr. reported in (2025) 4 SCC 78. in para-11 to 20, which is reproduced hereinafter:
"11. Before we apply this judgment to the facts, it will be worthwhile to recall the
observations of Sikri, J. in Narinder Singh (supra):-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39993620/ 2
Jhotil Paswan vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
"26. Having said so, we would hasten to add that though it is a serious offence as the
accused person(s) attempted to take the life of another person/victim, at the same
time the court cannot be oblivious to hard realities that many times whenever there is
a quarrel between the parties leading to physical commotion and sustaining of injury
by either or both the parties, there is a tendency to give it a slant of an offence under
Section 307 IPC as well..."
(Emphasis supplied)
12. Coming back to Laxmi Narayan (supra), this Court has held that mere mention of Section 307
IPC in the FIR or the charge-sheet should not be the basis for adopting a hands-off approach. It has
further held that it would be open for the court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section
307 IPC is there for the sake of it or whether there is evidence to back it. It has been held that the
courts may go by the nature of injuries sustained; as to Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.62013 of
2025 dt.07-10-2025 whether the injuries are inflicted on the vital/ delicate parts of the body and the
nature of weapon used. It has also been clarified that such an exercise would be permissible after
investigation and filing of chargesheet/framing of charges or during the trial. [See 15.4 of Laxmi
Narayan (supra)].
13. Coming to the facts of the case, admittedly, there is a settlement between the parties. The case
filed by the appellants' party which was prior in point of time and that too on the same day of
occurrence, has been settled.
14. It should be recalled that, at the outset, after investigation, the police actually closed the case in
its final report of 07.09.1991. It was the trial Court, which by its order of 05.09.1992, refused to
accept the same and summoned the appellants. The incident is of 11.08.1991, i.e. about 33Â½ years
back. No doubt, there is a reference to the firing in the FIR but admittedly there was no injury. The
allegation is that firing was done by Abdul Waris. He is since deceased. The facts, assuming to be
true, also do not make out a case of common object for the appellants under Section 149 IPC insofar
as the offence of Section 307 is concerned.
15. The role attributed to the seven members, including the five appellants is not specific. General
allegation was that they abused in filthy language and assaulted Mahmood with lathi and iron bars.
The specific individual role was only attributed to Adbul Waris, who is since deceased.
16. In any event, the police who investigated disbelieved the entire story. No recoveries have been
made of any pellets. What engaged the attention of the High Court was only the fracture of the head
of the distal phalanx of left finger of respondent No.2.
17. We have seen the injuries sustained by Mahmood (R-2) from the medical evidence collected.
From the injury report, it is clear that while the first four injuries were contusions and abrasions,
injury Nos. 5, 6 and 7 pertained to incised lacerated wound and swelling on the middle Patna High
Court CR. MISC. No.62013 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025 finger of the left hand. We have also seen the
x-ray report which shows that in the left hand there was a fracture of the head of distal phalanx of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39993620/ 3
Jhotil Paswan vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
left ring finger. Assuming that this was the result of injury with lathis or iron bar, applying the test
in Laxmi Narayan (supra), considering the injury and the nature of the weapon used, certainly no
offence under Section 307 IPC is made out.
18. Section 307 of IPC reads as under:-
"307. Attempt to murder.-
Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such
circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such
act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or to such punishment
as is hereinbefore mentioned. Attempts by life convicts.- When any person offending
under this section is under sentence of imprisonment for life, he may, if hurt is
caused, be punished with death."
19. Keeping in mind the surrounding circumstances, the nature of the weapon and the nature of the
injury, on facts, we are inclined to conclude that the overt act attributed to the appellants does not
bring the case within the four corners of the Section 307 of IPC, either on a stand-alone basis or as
held above with the aid of Section 149 of IPC.
20. We are also inclined to conclude that considering the overall circumstances, the nature of the
weapon and the nature of the injury (fracture of the head of distal phalanx of left ring finger), the
offence alleged, on facts, does not fall in that category of cases where the court should deny relief in
the event of a settlement. At the highest, the offence alleged could be one under Section 326 of IPC.
It could not be said, on facts, considering all the circumstances that this is a crime which has such an
harmful effect on the public and that it has the effect of seriously threatening the well-being of the
society. We make it clear that we are saying so Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.62013 of 2025
dt.07-10-2025 on the facts of the present case. We are also firmly of the opinion that proceeding
with the trial, when parties have amicably resolved the dispute in the present case, would be futile
and the ends of justice require that the settlement be given effect to by quashing the proceedings. It
would be a grave abuse of process to let this trial remain pending under the above circumstances,
particularly when the dispute is settled and resolved."
9. Considering the aforesaid submissions made on behalf of the parties and the nature of allegation
as alleged against the petitioner in Bagaha P.S.Case No.66 of 2002, which has been lodged
subsequent to Bagaha P.S.Case No.65 of 2002 filed by the petitioner against the informant, interim
protection for the period of four months is granted to the petitioner, so that both the parties can
resolve their dispute amicably.
10. I refer the matter back to the learned trial court to proceed in accordance with law taking into
consideration the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Naushey Ali (supra) that if any joint
petition is filed and both the parties agree to withdraw their respective cases filed against each other,

Jhotil Paswan vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
then in that case, the learned trial court on the basis of the materials available on record may pass
appropriate order and in the case of failure to arrive at a compromise, the learned district court may
proceed with the trial in accordance with law.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.62013 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025
11. Till then, the operation of order dated 02.08.2025 passed by the learned District and Additional
Sessions Judge IV, Bagaha, West Champaran in Cr. Revision Case No.78 of 2021 shall remain
stayed, subject to the result of settlement between the parties.
12. Both the parties are directed to appear before the learned district court on 31.10.2025 at 10.30
A.M. and file a joint petition of compromise for amicable settlement of their dispute.
13. Learned District Court is directed to take necessary steps to refer the matter before the learned
Mediator of the District Mediation Center.
14. Learned Mediator of the District Mediation Center concerned shall make his/her best efforts to
settle the dispute amicably and thereafter submit his/her report before the concerned learned
District Court, well within a period of four months, till then, no coercive action shall be taken
against the petitioners in connection with the aforesaid case.
15. In case of failure on the part of the petitioner to appear on 31.10.2025 before the learned District
Court or any date fixed by the learned Mediator, the interim protection granted to the petitioner and
the stay of order dated 02.08.2025 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.62013 of 2025 dt.07-10-2025
passed by the learned District and Additional Sessions Judge IV, Bagaha, West Champaran shall
automatically lose its force.
16. In case, the parties fail to reconcile, the parties may avail appropriate remedy in accordance with
law.
17. Accordingly, the present bail application stands disposed of.
