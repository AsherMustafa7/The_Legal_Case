ORDER
This criminal original petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.177 of 2016 on the
file of the learned Judicial Magistrate-I, Kancheepuram having been taken cognizance for
http://www.judis.nic.in the offences under Sections 52 and 59(i) of the Food Safety and Standards
Act, 2006 .
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the respondent did not follow the
mandatory requirement under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 before lodgement of the
complaint as against the petitioner herein. Section 77 of Food Safety and Standards Act speaks
about the limitation for prosecution and accordingly the limitation to initiate prosecution is one year
from the date of commission of offence. The present impugned complaint has been lodged after
period of 2 years since the alleged offence was committed on 31.07.2014 and the complaint was
lodged only on 04.10.2016. There is absolutely no explanation for the delay and as such the

G.Irudhayanathan vs B.Ramakrishnan on 6 August, 2020
complaint is directly hit under Section 77 of Food Safety and Standards Act.
2.1 He further submitted that under Section 42 of the said Act, certain procedures have to be
followed for launching the prosecution. Accordingly, the Food Safety Officer after scrutiny of the
http://www.judis.nic.in analysis report, he shall have to send his recommendations within 14 days
from the date of analysis report to the Commissioner for sanctioning of prosecution. In the present
case, the Food Laboratory report was received by the respondent on 18.02.2015. After receipt of the
report, the Designated Officer, Kancheepuram District by his order dated 18.08.2015, asked for
sanction to prosecute the petitioner herein. On receipt of the communication from the Designated
Officer, the sanction authority accorded sanction on 14.03.2016. Thereafter, on 28.09.2016, the
same authority accorded second sanction to prosecute the petitioner herein. Therefore, beyond the
period of 14 days from the date of receipt of analysis report, the Designating Officer requested the
Commissioner for sanction to prosecute the petitioner. Therefore, the entire complaint is vitiated
and directly hit under Sections 42 and 77 of the said Act. Therefore, he sought for quashment of the
entire proceedings.
3. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the respondent inspected the first
accused shop on 31.07.2014 and purchased Rich Roses Sherbet - Herbal Granules (Traditional
Indian http://www.judis.nic.in Item) and the samples of the said product was sent for analysis to
the Referral Food Laboratory. According to the said report, the sample has not confirmed due to the
presence of caffeine in the said product. It is also not declared on the label, and thereby the said
sample is unsafe and misbraned. After accorded sanction, the respondent filed complaint on
04.10.2016 before the learned Judicial Magistrate-I, Kancheepuram. Therefore, all the mandatory
provisions are duly followed by the respondent and lodged the complaint as against the petitioner
and two others. Further he further submitted that all the points raised by the petitioner herein
cannot be considered under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. since all are mixed question of facts and it can be
considered only before the trial court during the trial. Therefore, he sought for dismissal of the
quash petition.
4. Heard, Mr.M.Babu Muthu Meeran, the learned counsel for the petitioner, and Mr.S.Karthikeyan,
Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent.

5. There are totally three accused, in which the petitioner is arrayed as A2. According to the
respondent, they visited the shop of the first accused on 31.07.2014 and purchased Rich Roses
Sherbet - Herbal Granules (Traditional Indian Item). Thereafter, sent the sample of the said product
for analysis and found that the sample is unsafe and misbranded. After accorded sanction from the
Commissioner, complaint was lodged as against the petitioner and two others.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner raised two grounds that the complaint itself is directly
barred by limitation under Section 77 of Food Safety and Standards Act. It is relevant to extract the
provision under Section 77 of the said Act as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92211402/ 2
G.Irudhayanathan vs B.Ramakrishnan on 6 August, 2020
"77. Time limit for prosecutions.-Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, no
court shall take cognizance of an offence under this Act after the expiry of the period
of one year from the date of commission of an offence: Provided that the
Commissioner of Food Safety may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, approve
prosecution within an extended period of up to three http://www.judis.nic.in years.‚Äù
Accordingly, no court shall take cognizance of the offence under the Act after expiry
of the period of one year from the date of commission of offence. The defacto
complainant purchased the said product from the first accused shop on 31.07.2014.
Thereafter, the complaint was lodged only on 04.10.2016 after period of two years.
Further, it is also seen that there is no explanation for the delay in lodgement of the
complaint.
Therefore, the complaint itself is barred by limitation as per provision under Section
77 of the said Act.
7. Another ground raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that under Section 42 of the
said Act, the Food Safety Officer shall have to send his recommendation for prosecution within 14
days from the date of receipt of analysis report to the Commissioner. It is also relevant to extract the
provision under Section 42 (3) of the said Act as follows:
"The Designated Officer after scrutiny of the report of Food Analyst shall decide as to
whether the contravention is punishable with imprisonment or fine only and in the
case of contravention punishable with http://www.judis.nic.in imprisonment, he
shall send his recommendations within fourteen days to the Commissioner of Food
Safety for sanctioning prosecution."
As per the above provision, on receipt of the analysis report, Food Safety Officer shall have to send
his report within period of 14 days to the Commissioner of Food Safety for sanctioning prosecution
against the accused. In the case on hand, the Central Food Laboratory sent its report on 18.02.2015.
On receipt of the report, the Designated Officer / respondent sent his recommendation for
according sanction only on 18.08.2015. On receipt of the same, the Commissioner of Food Safety
accorded first sanction on 14.03.2016 and subsequently accorded second sanction on 28.09.2016.
Therefore, the respondent failed to send his recommendation within period of 14 days from the date
of receipt of food analysis report. Therefore, the respondent did not follow the mandatory provision
as contemplated under Section 42(3) of the Food Safety and Standards Act.
8. Therefore, the present complaint cannot be sustained http://www.judis.nic.in as against the
petitioner and it is liable to be quashed. Under these circumstances, the petitioner need not go for
ordeal of the trial since the entire complaint is nothing but clear abuse of process of law.
9. In view of the above discussion, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the proceedings in
C.C.No.177 of 2016 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate-I, Kancheepuram is quashed as
against the petitioner. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
