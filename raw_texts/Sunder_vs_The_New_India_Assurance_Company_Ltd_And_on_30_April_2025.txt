injuries received by him in a road accident on 04.08.2008.
It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that claimant-appellant had received grievous
injuries in the accident and has become permanent disable on account of injuries received by him. It
is further submitted that the accident was occurred on account of sole negligence of driver of Crane
bearing no. HR 38A/1369, which was driven by its driver very rashly and negligently and there was
no negligence on the part of driver of TATA bearing no. UP 11 F 3880. The Claims Tribunal while
deciding issue no. 1 has recorded the finding that it was case of head on collision in between Crane
and TATA vehicle and drivers of both the vehicles were equally negligent and responsible for the
accident. Compensation of 50% has been reduced on account of 50% negligence of driver of TATA
vehicle. The liability to pay 50% amount of compensation is fixed upon respondent-insurance
company/insurer of Crane on account of 50% negligence of driver of Crane. It is next submitted that
the appellant-claimant was travellilng in TATA vehicle as a passenger and he was not driving the
TATA vehicle and there was no negligence on his part. It was a case of composite negligence and
Claims Tribunal has erred in reducing 50% compensation on account of contributory negligence of
driver of TATA vehicle. He placed reliance on the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of Khenyei Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and others, reported in 2015 0 AIR(SC) 2261.
Lastly, it is submitted that the Claims Tribunal has also erred in not awarding any amount towards
future prospects, whereas claimant-appellant is entitled for 40% future prospects in view of law laid
down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Syed Sadiq Vs. Divisional Manager, United India Ins.
Co., reported in 2014 0 Supreme(SC) 34. No other ground has been pressed by learned counsel for
the appellant.
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent Insurance Company has not
disputed the fact that the claimant-appellant was travelling in TATA vehicle and it was a case of
composite negligence. Learned counsel for the respondent has also not disputed that the claimant-
appellant is entitled for 40% future prospects. It is further submitted that claimant-appellant had
not received grievous injuries and disability certificate was not issued by Chief Medical Officer, but
was issued by Dr. Ravindra Singh who is habitual to issue disability certificates in motor accidental
claims cases.
Considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
As per the claim petition, it is an admitted fact that the claimant-appellant was travelling in TATA
vehicle which was collided with crane, insured with respondent no. 1-insurance company. It was a
case of composite negligence and it is open to the claimant to claim compensation either from one
vehicle or from both the vehicles in view of judgement of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Khenyei
(supra). The Claims Tribunal has erred in reducing 50% compensation on account of contributory
negligence of driver of TATA vehicle. So far as future prospects is concerned, since the age of the
appellant was below 40 years at the time of accident, he is entitled for 40% future prospects in view
of judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Syed Sadiq (supra). In absence of any evidence in
respect of monthly income, the Claims Tribunal has rightly accepted the income of claimant as Rs.
3,000/- per month. Disability certificate discloses the disability of 40% and Claims Tribunal has
rightly accepted 30% functional disability and loss of earning capacity to the extent of 30%. The age

of the injured was 35 years at the time of accident as such the multiplier of 16 was also rightly
applied by the Claims Tribunal.
In view of above discussion, the compensation awarded by the Claims Tribunal is reassessed as
below:-
1) Monthly income = Rs.3,000/-
2) Annual income = Rs. 3,000/- X 12= Rs.36,000/-
3) Future prospects (40%) = Rs.14,400/-
4) Total annual income = Rs.36,000/- + Rs.14,400/- =Rs.50,400/-
5) Loss of earning capacity (30%) : Rs. 15,120/-
6) Multiplier applicable : (16) = Rs. 15,120/- x 16 = Rs. 2,41,920/-
7) Loss of future income : Rs. 2,41,920/-
8) Medical expenses : Rs. 20,000/-
9) Pain and suffering : Rs. 5,000/-
Total : Rs. 2,41,920/- + Rs. 20,000/- + Rs. 5,000/- = Rs. 2,66,920/-
The first appeal from order filed by claimant is hereby partly allowed and compensation awarded by
the Claims Tribunal is enhanced from Rs.98,900/- to Rs.2,66,920/-. The claimant-appellant is also
entitled for 6% interest on the enhanced amount from the date of judgment and award of Claims
Tribunal i.e. 24.04.2009.
The respondent-Insurance Company is directed to deposit the enhanced amount along-with
interest, within two months from today before the concerned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. The
