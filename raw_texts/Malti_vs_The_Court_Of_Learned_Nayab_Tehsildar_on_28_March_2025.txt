Code Rules, 2016 made under the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006, the mutation proceedings, being
summary in nature, ought to have been decided within 45 days if there is no dispute and if there is
dispute, then the same should preferably be decided within 90 days, however, in the instant case,
the proceedings for mutation are pending since 2024, this Court is of the view that no gainful
purpose will be served in keeping the present petition pending.
In view of above, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondent No.1/Nayab
Tehsildar, Tehsil Bikapur, District Ayodhya to consider and decide theCase No.3529 of 2024,
Computerized Case No.T202404230303529 (Mati Vs. Smt. Koyla) most expeditiously after
affording full opportunity of hearing to the parties to the litigation and without granting
unnecessary adjournment to either party preferably within a period of three months from the next
date fixed in the case, if there is no other legal impediment in this regard.
It is made clear that the Court has not examined the case of either party on merits and the Authority
concerned shall be free to decide the matter strictly in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid, the petition is disposed of.
