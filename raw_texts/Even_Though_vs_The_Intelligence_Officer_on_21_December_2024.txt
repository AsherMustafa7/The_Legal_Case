Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020
2. The case of the prosecution runs as below:
a) On 21.06.2016, A1 and A2 have checked in their baggage before boarding their flight in Malaysian
Airlines MH181 from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur. The checked-in baggages were to be passed from
the check-in counter through three levels of conveyor belt. The entry point to the check-in baggage is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62822134/ 4
Even Though vs The Intelligence Officer on 21 December, 2024
level-1 and the last point is level-3 and the luggage passes through all the three levels and were
loaded in the flight.
b) The sequence of events unfolds as follows: on 21.06.2016, the baggages which were checked in the
names of A1 and A2 were already loaded in the plane.
c) While so, PW1, a Customs Official attached to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence got a tip-off
through Ext.P1 information that certain contraband was being smuggled through the said flight by
A1 to A3. Wasting no time PW1 along with his team of officials would now intercept A1 and A2 after
these accused persons had crossed the immigration counter but before they boarded the flight. He
would then take them to the Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) room. He also required the air liner to
unload the checked-in luggages of A1 and A2. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal
Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020 They were made available to the investigating team at that AIU room.
PW1 had also made available a certain Baskar, who either is a shopkeeper or runs a shop inside the
airport as independent witness.
d) P.W.1 would then search the checked-in luggage of A1 and A2 in the presence of PW2 and PW3.
On search, the search-team did not find any contraband in the luggage of A1. However, in the
luggage of A2, PW1 found 93 packets of the two different psychotropic substance manufactured
under the three brand names. The details are as below:
Brand Name Number Content
Zolfresh 25260 Psychotropic substance -
Zolpidem
Warnax 46280 Alprazolam
Trika 1500 Alprazolam
e) These contraband was seized by P.W.1 under Ext.P2, seizure mahazar in the presence of PW3 and
one Baskar. PW1 also proceeded to record the statements of both A1 and A2 under Sec. 67 of the
NDPS Act, which came to be marked as Exts.P36 and P46 respectively.
f) Thereafter, on 16.08.2016, the officials of DRI arrested A3 and on a search PW4 conducted a
search in the premises of A3. The search yielded nothing for the prosecution. However, PW4
obtained the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020
statement from A3 under Sec. 67 of the Act and that came to be marked as Ext.P41.
g) The psychotropic-substance seized were sent for forensic chemical analysis. PW6 examined the
same and came out with her Ext.P49 report. In terms of the report, the substance recovered by PW1
from the baggage of A2 is found to contain the prohibited psychotropic substance, which falls under
entry 238 and 178 of the NDPS Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62822134/ 5
Even Though vs The Intelligence Officer on 21 December, 2024
h) PW9 is the investigating officer and she completed the investigation and laid her final report
against all the three accused persons.
i) Taking cognizance of the final report, Special Court for NDPS cases, framed separate charges
against all the three accused persons for the offences under Sections as outlined in the earlier
paragraph.
3. During trial, the prosecution examined PW1 to PW11 and marked Exts.P1 to P64 and MOs.1 to
MO.5. For the defence, one witness was examined as DW1 and produced Ext.D1. Apart from the
material evidence which have been referred to already, Ext.P56 carries some importance. It is a call
data record of the cellphone calls between PW8, Airport Security Officer and A3.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020
4. On appreciating the evidence before it, the trial court found that all the three accused persons are
guilty of the offence they were charged with and sentenced them as stated in the opening paragraph
of this judgment. The line of reasoning of the trial court is that:
a) All the three accused persons have tendered their confession statement (Exts.P36,
41 and 460 under Section 67 of the NDPS Act).
Therefore, there is a reverse burden cast on them and none of the accused persons were able to offer
a rebuttal evidence convincing enough to disprove what these statements suggested.
b) So far as A3 is concerned, notwithstanding the fact that he was not a passenger on that date on
which PW1 had seized the contraband. Besides his statement under Section 67 of the NDPS Act,
PW1 had also frantically tred to reach PW8 as could be seen from Ext.P56, details of call data which
was spoken to by PW10 & PW11 officials of the service provider, This judgement of the trial court is
now challenged in this batch of appeals. Arguments:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020
5. Heard Mr.Karunakaran, for A1, Mr.R.C.Paul Kanagaraj for A2 and Mr.B.Kumar. learned senior
counsel for A3 and also Mr.N.P.Kumar, Special Public Prosecutor for prosecution.
6. Mr.B.Kumar made the following submissions and the large part thereof was also echoed in the
submissions of the learned counsel for A1. It is as follows:
a) So far as the two pieces of the evidence which the trial court had relied on for
entering its verdict of guilt against these two accused persons is its on Exts.P36 and
P46, both statements recorded by PW1 under Section 67 of the Act. However, a
majority view of a three judges bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Tofan Singh
Vs State [(2021) 4 SCC 1)] has held that an official of the DRI while functioning to
enforce the NDPS Act, is a police official, and therefore, any confession statement
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62822134/ 6
Even Though vs The Intelligence Officer on 21 December, 2024
made before them will not pass scrutiny under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act,
1872. This judgement of Tofan Singh's decided by a majority of 2:1, was approved in a
subsequent case in Balwinder Singh and Another Vs The Narcotics Control Bureau
[(2023 SCC Online https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63
and 85 of 2020 SC 1213)] where a three Judges Bench has unanimously upheld the
majority view in Tofan Singh's case. Therefore, neither Ext.P36 nor Ext.P46 is
admissible in evidence, and therefore, no conviction can be handed over based on
these statements alone.
b) Turning to A3, on facts, even though the prosecution had examined PW10 and
PW11 and also marked Exts.P56 call data record, yet these documents were not
backed by a certificate of the service provider as required under Section 65-B of the
Evidence Act. Reliance was placed Panditrao Khotkar Vs Kailash Kushanrao
Gorantyal [(2020) 7 SCC 1)], followed in Sundar @ Sundarrajan v. State by Inspector
of Police [(2023 SCC Online SC 310)].
7. Arguing for A2, Mr.R.C.Paul Kanagaraj, made the following submissions:
a) After bringing both A1 and A2 to the AIU room in the airport, PW1, began his
interrogation of both A1 and A2. Even though both they did not admit that they were
transporting the contraband, eventually they gave up when they were enquired
persistently. And Ext. P2 further records that during this interrogation, A1 had stated
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020 that
he was carrying two check-in luggages and one hand luggage whereas A2 said he was
carrying two hand luggages and the one luggage which was checked in, which A2
claims as belonging to A1, and that he had checked-in the same as a favour to A1,
since A1 had already checked-in two luggages in his name, he could not check-in one
more luggage in an international flight, and hence he requested A2 to do him a favour
since A2 did not carry any check-
in luggage.
b) It was thereafter all the checked-in luggage of both A1 and A2 were opened in the presence of
PW1 and Baskar, and this was during this search, PW1 found psychotropic substance in the bag
checked-in in the name of A2. In essence, the baggage belonged to A1 and A2 was only an innocent
carrier, and since A2 did not possess or attempt to transport the psychotropic substance in question
consciously then he may not be mulct with criminal liability. Indeed, he himself makes a similar
statement in Ext.P46 statement recorded under Section 67. The prosecution case thus proceeds on
the basis that the baggage checked in in the name of A2 belonged to A1.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020
c) A2 has made a further statement that when he enquired A1 as to the content of the baggage, the
latter had told him that it carried certain tablets for certain common illness. Indeed, even A2 was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62822134/ 7
Even Though vs The Intelligence Officer on 21 December, 2024
carrying some tablets (not 'drugs') in his hand luggage. This apart, since these tablets carried a
brand name, A2 possibly could not know that the contents of the baggage in essence was a
psychotropic substance and the above version of A2 was spoken to by PW1 to PW4, PW7 and PW8.
Even the investigating agency initially suspected of P.W.8's involvement in the offence.
d) Based on Ext.P1 tip off, P.W.1 intercepted and collected the checked-in luggage of A1 and A2.
When the luggage which was checked-in in the name of A2 was opened, it contained 93 packets all
wrapped in newspaper which later found to contain Psychotropic substances in tablet form.
However, in his earlier statement recorded by P.W.2 vide Ext.P2, he had made a categorical
statement that he was only checked-in the luggage which he was entrusted with by A1. Where any
statement is recorded with the officials administering NDPS Act, at the time of seizure which is
incriminatory in character will be inadmissible https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal
Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020 vide ratio in Tofan Singh vs. State [(2021) 4 SCC 1)], that portion of the
statement which is not incriminatory but explanatory aiding the defence then the defence can rely
on it. Inasmuch as this is the earliest statement made by A2, which he does not disown not because
it may be considered as exculpatory, but because it explains what happened at the earliest point of
time. Hence, he is entitled to view with greater credibility.
e) The baggage in question contained only 93 packets and there is no case for the prosecution that
the said baggage also contained the personal belongings of A2 to connect the baggage to A2.
f) The significant factor which is relevant to ascertain whether the baggage in question belonged to
A1 or A2, is to ascertain who among them had the keys to the baggage becomes relevant. After all,
P.W.1 and his team had opened the said baggage containing the contraband. Here, Ext.P2 seizure
mahazar is silent as to who provided the key to the baggage, but merely says when the baggage was
opened and 93 packets were found.
g) Even P.W.1 in his testimony does not explain as to who had the keys of the black bag from which
the contraband was seized. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of
2020 Even though, this bag was seized under Ext.P2, during trial it was not produced. Therefore, on
a critical point, the prosecution case leaves a space to doubt its quality to fix criminal liability on A2.
Reliance was placed on the authority in Abdul Rashid Ibrahim Mansuri V. State of Gujarat [(2000)
2 SCC 513)].
h) This apart, both P.W.2 (Officer who arrested him) and P.W.5, who actually recorded Ext.P46
statement of A2 have testified that to the effect that A2 might not have been involved in the crime.
7. Arguing for A1, Mr.R.Karunakaran, learned counsel submitted as below:
a) The baggage apparently was checked in by A2 and it is he who is liable for the
offence and he is attempting to deflect his criminal liability on A1.
b) So far as A1 is concerned, except Ext.P31 statement recorded by P.W.1 under
Section 67 of NDPS Act and a self serving statement of the Investigating Agency in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62822134/ 8
Even Though vs The Intelligence Officer on 21 December, 2024
Ext.P2, seizure mahazar, there is nothing to fasten criminal liability on A1. Indeed, A1
had retracted Ext.P31, statement.
c) This apart, A1 was detained by P.W.1 immediately after the seizure
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020 on
22.06.2016 and he was remanded to judicial custody on the same date at 07.30 p.m.,
and during the time when A1 was in the custody of P.W.1, he was physically ill
treated. This is borne out by the evidence of D.W.1, the prison doctor and Ext.D1, the
medical record prepared by D.W.1. This implies that Ext.P.36 statement was obtained
by torturing A1.
8. The learned Prosecutor made the following submissions:
a) It is not in dispute that P.W.1 received an intimation Ext.P1. While A3 was not
physically present, he indeed was the mastermind for whom A1 and A2 were working
for smuggling contraband seized, from India to Malaysia. True to intimation so
received P.W.1 and his team intercepted a black bag which was checked-in in the
name of A2 and it did contain psychotropic drugs. It may be that in a subsequent
search made nothing was seized from A3, but that by itself will not be adequate to
doubt his involvement.
b) Turning to statements of A1 and A2 recorded by P.W.1, as disclosed in Ext.P2, they
are incriminatory in character but they were recorded before their arrest which
implied that those statements cannot be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal
Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020 affected by Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act.
A1 has indeed admitted that the consignment of psychotropic substances belonged to
him and since this statement was made before his arrest and since this statement is
not hit by Section 25 of Evidence Act, necessarily he must be found guilty, which the
trial Court has found rightly.
c) Turning to A2, admittedly the baggage was checked-in in his name, unlike, the
facts of the case in Abdul Rashid Ibrahim Mansuri Vs State of Gujarat [(2000) 2 SCC
513)], A2 does not claim himself to be involved in some kind of courier activities,
therefore he cannot escape merely through his exculpatory statement in Ext.P2.
Discussion & Decision:
9. The reasoning of the trial court having been founded fundamentally on the admissibility of the
statements of the accused persons recorded under Sec.67 of the NDPS Act, the ratio of the
judgements of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Tofan Singh case [(2021) 4 SCC 1)] (which was delivered
after the trial court judgement), followed by Balwinder Singh case [(2023 SCC Online SC 1213)] to
the effect that such statements of the accused made even to a DRI official will be rendered
inadmissible under Sec.25 of the Act, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296,
63 and 85 of 2020 the core basis of judgment the trial court is lost. Its immediate effect is that A3
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62822134/ 9
Even Though vs The Intelligence Officer on 21 December, 2024
cannot be convicted for the charges framed against him since (i) he was not even physically present
at the SOC on the date when the prosecution claims to have busted the crime at the airport; (ii) the
search of his premises yielded nothing for the prosecution; and (iii) except the Sec.67 statement
there is no other evidence to connect him to the crime.
10. So far as A1 is concerned, unlike A3, he was physically present, as he was travelling in the same
plane along with A2 to Malaysia. P.W.1 did not recover anything from the check-in luggage of A1,
but he was convicted on the solitary foundation of Sec.67 Statement. In that sense his case is
identical to that of A3.
11. However, he faces one challenge from A2. The contraband seized by P.W.2 was recovered
exclusively from the baggage checked-in the the name of A2. He in his statement would disown it
and would allege that it belonged to A1, and that he was merely was doing a favour on his request.
The issue now would be whether the uncorroborated statement of A2 is adequate to fasten liability
of A1?
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020
12. That the baggage from which the contraband was recovered belonged to A1 was A2's exculpatory
statement, and unless there are other material which can either independently or in combination
with others establishes the same, this Court may not act on it. Necessarily the plea of A2 has to fail,
and A1 will now join A3.
13. Turning to A2, his route to liberty is tightly closed since the entire recovery of the psychotropic
substances are made only from the baggage which was checked in his name. He made a valiant
effort to distant himself from the crime when he raised a contention that neither Ext.P2 nor P.W.1
could expoain who held the key of the said baggage and how it was opened. It is true. But the
baggage admittedly checked in his name. His obligation to rebut the evidence against him cannot be
ignored. Here, except attempting to shift the blame on A1, he plainly has no defence. Therefore, A2
may not share company with A1 and A3 for the reminder of the prison- term.
14. To conclude, Crl.A.No.296 of 2020 and Crl.A.No.85 of 2020 are
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal Nos.296, 63 and 85 of 2020 allowed and the
judgement of the trial court in Spl C.C.No.73 of 2016, dated 19.12.2019, on the file of the Special
Judge, II Additional Special Court for Exclusive Trial of cases under NDPS Act, Chennai convicting
and sentencing A1 and A3 is set aside and they are set free. So far as Crl.A.No.63 of 2020 is
concerned, it is dismissed and the conviction of A2 and the sentence imposed on him by the trial
court is confirmed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closd.
