(THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE)
THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 &
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO QUASH
THE IMPUGNED TRANSFER ORDERS DATED 24.03.2020,
ISSUED BY THE R-4 IS HEREWITH PRODUCED AT
ANNEXURE-E, AND LATER MODIFIED ORDER DATED
09.04.2020 ISSUED BY THE R-5 IS HEREWITH PRODUCED
AT ANNEXURE-F & ETC.,
THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR
ORDER, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT THIS DAY, THE
COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
1. The petitioner is an Assistant Commissioner who was posted to work as Assistant Commissioner,
Bengaluru North Division, Bengaluru, by an order dated 12.07.2019.
2. The petitioner during this posting was promoted to the post of Assistant Commissioner (Senior
Scale) and he was continued in the same post of Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North, by an
order dated 20.09.2019. In fact, by the very same order, the said post was also upgraded as a K.A.S.
(Senior Scale) post.
3. Thereafter, in the month of March, 2020 i.e., within a period of six months, the petitioner, by an
order dated 24.03.2020 (Annexure-E to the Writ Petition), was transferred as Chief Administrative
Officer, Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project (hereinafter referred to as 'KSHIP').
4. Thereafter, by an order dated 09.04.2020 (Annexure-F to the Writ Petition), the order dated
24.03.2020 was modified and instead of being posted as the Chief Administrative Officer, KSHIP,
the petitioner was posted as Secretary to the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission
(hereinafter referred to as 'KERC').
5. The petitioner, as a consequence, filed this writ petition challenging not only the order dated
24.03.2020 by which he was transferred to KSHIP, but also the subsequent order dated 09.04.2020
by which the earlier order of transfer was modified and he was posted as Secretary to KERC.
6. The petitioner, being a Government servant, in the normal circumstances, was required to have
availed the remedy of approaching the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter
referred to as 'the Tribunal'), under the Administrative Tribunals Act, to impugn the orders of
transfer passed against him.
7. However, on 08.05.2020, when the matter was posted before this Court and the bar to entertain
the present writ petition was raised by the State and the 6th respondent, the learned Senior Counsel
for the petitioner Sri. S.S. Naganand submitted that the Tribunal was non functional due to the lock
down declared by the Government and thus the normal remedy available to the petitioner became
unavailable to him.

Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
8. This Court, thereafter, directed the Registry to ascertain from the Tribunal whether the Tribunal
was entertaining Applications through video conferencing during the lockdown. On being contacted
telephonically by the Registry, the Registry of the Tribunal informed the Registry of this Court that
the Tribunal had no option of video conferencing and that the physical filing of Applications was a
must.
9. In view of the said fact, this Court came to the conclusion that compelling the Counsel for the
petitioner to physically appear and to physically file an Application, in the present scenario, was not
desirable and it was therefore a fit case to entertain the Writ Petition.
10. As against this order, it was stated at the Bar, that the 6th respondent had preferred a Writ
Appeal in W.A.No.284/2020 but the same was dismissed as withdrawn.
11. Thus, the order dated 08.05.2020 passed in this Writ Petition, to entertain the writ petition has
become final and the writ petition is therefore required to be considered on merits. Accordingly on
19.05.2020, the writ petition was heard on merits.
12. Sri S.S. Naganand, learned Senior Counsel appearing for petitioner, the learned Additional
Advocate General for the State and Sri M.S. Bhagawat, learned counsel for the sixth respondent
were heard through video conferencing.
13. In order to ensure that there was no misapprehension caused to the learned counsel regarding
the arguments that they advanced through video conferencing, they were permitted to file the
written submissions within a period of seven days and the judgment was reserved.
14. Pursuant to the order dated 19.05.2020, the State e-filed their statement of objections on
22.05.2020 and the Learned counsel for the petitioner e-filed his written submissions on
20.05.2020.
15. Thereafter on 26.05.2020, the State moved a memo for posting the matter for 'Being Spoken To'
on 28.5.2020. In the said memo, it was stated that since the sixth respondent had been posted in the
place of petitioner to the post of Assistant Commissioner due to the prevailing situation arising out
of the pandemic, the learned Advocate General himself intended to make submissions in the matter.
This request was acceded to and the matter was accordingly posted "For Being spoken to" on
28.5.2020.
16. On 28.05.2020, the learned Advocate General addressed arguments on the merits of the matter
and after arguing for a while sought for time to get further instructions. The said request was
acceded to and the matter was adjourned to 01.06.2020.
17. On 30.05.2020, the State passed an order withdrawing both the order of transfer dated
24.03.2020 and the order dated 9.4.2020, by which the earlier posting was modified.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 4
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
18. By virtue of this withdrawal of the transfer order, in the normal circumstances, the prayers
sought for in the writ petition would have been rendered infructuous.
19. However, in the very same order, by which, the impugned order of transfer was withdrawn, the
State proceeded to pass another order by which the petitioner was once again transferred as
Secretary KERC and sixth respondent was ordered to be posted in his place. In other words, while
withdrawing the impugned order of transfer, the State proceeded to issue another order of transfer,
reiterating the earlier transfer order passed on 24.03.2020 and as modified on 9.4.2020.
20. In this order dated 30.05.2020, it was stated that due to the prevailing situation arising out of
the pandemic crisis, it was necessary to have an officer who had knowledge about the local area to
manage the situation and it was therefore necessary to transfer the sixth respondent in the place of
the petitioner. It was stated in the said order that the sixth respondent was being transferred in the
place of petitioner as the Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North Taluk and that he was being
posted as the Nodal Officer for Covid-19 of the Bengaluru North Division under S. 14, 18 and S. 72 of
the Disaster Management Act (hereinafter referred to as 'DMA').
21. The petitioner, while being transferred as Secretary, KERC was also directed to work as per the
directions of Sri M. Maheshwar Rao, the Special Officer of B.B.M.P. (West), Rajarajeshwarinagar
Division.
22. On 01.06.2020, when the matter was re-listed, the petitioner filed an application seeking to
amend the writ petition whereby he sought to impugn the order of transfer dated 30.05.2020. The
State sought for time to respond to the said application and accordingly, a week's time was granted
to the State to file a response. The State was also directed to produce the entire original files
pertaining to the transfer order dated 30.05.2020.
23. The matter was thereafter posted on 11.06.2020, on which day both the learned Advocate
General as well as the learned Senior Counsel Sri S.S. Naganand appearing for the petitioner were
heard on the merits of the entire matter including the merits of the order of transfer dated
30.05.2020 which had been passed after the judgment had been reserved in the writ petition.
24. On the same day, the application for amendment was also allowed and the State was permitted
to file additional statement of objections and also to state as to who was the competent authority as
envisaged in paragraph 3(1) of the Government Order dated 07.06.2013 in relation to the petitioner.
25. In compliance of the said order, the State e-filed its Additional Statement of Objections. In these
objections, the State stated that the competent authority contemplated under para 3 (a) of the
Guidelines was the Chief Minister.
26. In response, the petitioner has filed a memo contending that the Chief Minister cannot be
considered as the competent authority since the Rules referred to by the State in its additional
statement of objections related to merely the procedure that was required to be followed for
submission of certain matters to the Chief Minister under the Transaction of Business Rules.

Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
27. The Learned Advocate General, in continuation of the arguments advanced by the Learned AAG,
sought to argue that physical hearing of the matters had begun before the Tribunal and since a fresh
order of transfer was made on 30.05.2020, the petitioner was required to approach the Tribunal. It
was argued that the earlier prevailing situation had changed and therefore, the petitioner was to be
relegated to the remedy of approaching the Tribunal.
28. On the other hand, the learned Senior Counsel Sri S.S. Naganand contended that this Court had
already held that compelling the physical appearance of Counsel before the Tribunal, which even as
of now, did not provide for an option of arguing through video conferencing, was not permissible in
view of the decision of the Apex Court in suo moto W.P.(Civil) No.1/2020.
29. In the light of the above submission, it would be necessary to consider the preliminary objection
raised by the Learned Advocate General, before proceeding further.
30. It cannot be in dispute that in view of the directions of the Apex Court in the afore mentioned
writ petition stated supra, compelling the physical appearance of Counsel before the Tribunal was
not desirable. In fact, it was for this very reason, this Court thought it fit to entertain the writ
petition and the challenge to the said order was not made by the State and the challenge made by the
6th respondent was withdrawn.
31. Admittedly, even as of today, the Tribunal has not provided hearing through video conferencing
as an option, and as a consequence, the reasons stated in the order dated 08.05.2020 passed in this
petition would still prevail and subsist. In this view of the matter, the preliminary objection raised
by the Learned Advocate General regarding jurisdiction is overruled.
32. As a consequence, the only question that remains to be considered in this petition is whether the
order dated 30.05.2020, by which the earlier orders of transfer were reiterated, is legal and valid.
33. The Learned Advocate General, during the course of his arguments, very fairly admitted that the
transfer of the petitioner was indeed a premature transfer as contemplated in the Government
Order dated 07.06.2013 (hereinafter referred to as Guidelines). The Learned Advocate General also
admitted that a transfer of a government servant would necessarily have to be governed by the
Guidelines. He, however, contended that having regard to the fact that the State was forced to draw
officers from various places solely to meet the situation arising due to the prevailing pandemic to
discharge its functions under the Disaster Management Act, adherence to the stipulations in
Guidelines regarding transfers should not be insisted upon or construed literally.
34. In other words, he sought to contend that the Guidelines would govern the Transfers only during
normal times and during times of a crisis such as the prevailing one arising out the pandemic, the
State should not be compelled to abide by the guidelines dated 07.06.2013.
35. The Learned Advocate General also contended that having regard to the fact that in several
decisions of the Supreme Court, the State had an unfettered liberty to exercise its discretion during
emergencies, the State should have the maximum possible discretion in the matter of posting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 6
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
officers of its choice to tackle the emergent situation and the State ought not be compelled to
continue the petitioner in the post of Assistant Commissioner of Bengaluru North. He stated that
interests of the public would be better served by utilizing the services of the sixth respondent due to
his earlier posting and his knowledge of the local conditions.
36. The Learned Advocate General also stated that though the Guidelines was an executive order
issued under Article 162 of the Constitution of India, it had nevertheless, acquired the force of a
statute in view of the decision of the Full Bench of this Court rendered in the case of Sri S.N.
Gangadharaiah, K.A.S., VS. The State of Karnataka - ILR 2015 KAR 1955 and ILR 2011 KAR 1585.
37. In view of the further statement of the learned Advocate General that the guidelines had
acquired the force of a statute, pursuant to the Full Bench decision of this Court and were thus
enforceable in a Court of law, it cannot be in serious dispute that the impugned order of transfer
passed by the State would have to satisfy the terms stipulated in the guidelines.
38. The Learned Advocate General lastly contended that the order of transfer was basically made to
ensure that the measures taken to mitigate the crisis arising out of Covid- 19 as envisaged under the
Disaster Management Act and having regard to the fact that the provisions of Disaster Management
Act had an overriding effect under Section 72, it would be improper and unfair to force the State to
abide by the Government guidelines dated 07.06.2013. In other words, the Learned Advocate
General sought to contend that having regard to the fact that there was a disaster as contemplated
under the Disaster Management Act prevailing in the country, the State should be granted liberty to
take such measures which it deemed necessary and its endeavors should not be hampered by
interfering with an order of transfer.
39. Learned Senior Counsel Sri S.S. Naganand, on the other hand, contended that in view of the
candid admission of the Learned Advocate General that the impugned order was indeed a
premature transfer and the transfer would have to be in adherence to the guidelines dated
07.06.2013 and the State was obliged to abide by every stipulation in the Government Order dated
07.06.2013. He contended that the State cannot wriggle out of its own guidelines by raising the
bogey of a pandemic crisis engulfing the State. He submitted that the petitioner himself was
assigned as a Frontline officer for discharge of Covid-19 duties, as could be seen in the very order of
transfer dated 30.05.2020, and therefore it did not lie in the mouth of the State to say that the
petitioner would not be suitable to discharge his duties as Assistant Commissioner Bengaluru North.
40. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that in the first order of transfer dated 24.03.2020, there
were absolutely no reasons assigned in the transfer and the same was a contravention of the
Government Order dated 07.06.2013. He submitted that the present order of transfer dated
30.05.2020 passed nearly after two months after the first order also did not contain any reason as to
why the continuance of the petitioner as the Assistant Commissioner, Bengalur North was not
desirable. He contended that the order of transfer dated 30.5.2020 was in no way relatable to the
pandemic and the State was merely using the pandemic as a ruse to reiterate and justify its transfer.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 7
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
41. The Learned Senior Counsel contended that the State cannot resort to any of the provisions of
Disaster Management Act, since none of the provisions of the Act enabled the authorities stipulated
under the Act to possess any control or superintendence over any Government employee. He
submitted that authorities contemplated under the Disaster Management Act would operate in a
completely different field which was in no way relatable to the discharge of the functions of a
Government servant and the authorities under the said Act possessed no power to direct the State to
place a particular official at a particular post.
42. In the light of these submissions, the principal question to be decided in this writ petition is as to
whether the order of transfer dated 30.05.2020 was justified and is in accordance with law.
43. In the light of the clear statement by the Learned Advocate General that the Guidelines would
govern the transfer of Government servants and that the impugned order of transfer dated
30.05.2020 was indeed a premature transfer as contemplated under the Guidelines, the
applicability of the Guidelines cannot be in serious doubt.
44. If the Guidelines are to be applicable to the instant transfer, then it will have to be examined
whether the State had adhered to the terms stipulated in the guidelines before passing the order of
transfer.
45. Before proceeding further, it would be necessary to briefly state the parameters prescribed for a
premature transfer in the Guidelines.
46. Para 9(a) and 9(b) of the Guidelines read as follows:-
"9. Premature/delayed Transfer a. Generally there should be no premature transfers.
The tenure of posting of Government servant may be extended or reduced by the
competent Authority in the following cases after recording the reasons for the same
in writing. The minimum period of stay at a place as prescribed in Para 8 can be
reduced and the concerned Government Servant transferred prematurely if the
competent authority feels that he or she is not suitable for discharging the duties at
the present place and the reasons are recorded to this effect in writing:
i. The employee due for transfer after completion of tenure at a place or posting or
post has less than two years of service for retirement;
ii. The employee possesses special technical qualification or experience for the
particular job for which a suitable replacement is not immediately available;
iii. The employees working on a project or Flagship programmes of Government of
India which are in the crucial stage of implementation and his withdrawal will
seriously jeopardize timely completion of such projects;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 8
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
iv. Where both the spouses are Government servants and if one of the spouses is
transferred, then the other spouse may also be transferred to the same place or
nearby place depending upon the availability of the vacancy even if one of them has
not completed the minimum period of stay;
v. Where a female Government servant is a widow/spinster/unmarried divorcee, she
may be transferred and in case she is appointed for the first time, may be posted to a
place of her choice subject to availability of vacancy;
vi. Where a servant is an office-bearer of the Karnataka State Government Employees
association only, such Government servant shall not be transferred until the
completion of the term for which he has been elected. In case no elections are held
within three months of the completion of the said term, he may be transferred. In
case he is re-elected, he may be continued in the same place until the completion of
the second term only.
vii. Where a Government servant is physically/ handicapped/ challenged or disabled
subject to the certification of Medical Board;
viii. Where a Government servant or his/ her spouse or children are suffering from
serious terminal ailments, depending upon the availability of the facility of medical
treatment, the requested place subject to certification by the Medical Board;
b. However, before effecting any premature transfers and for making any transfer
after the transfer period and also for extending the tenure of a Government servant
for the reasons stated above, prior approval of the Hon'ble Chief Minister must be
obtained without the concerned Administration Department of the Secretariat. The
Principal Secretaries to Government should not under any circumstances issue
transfer orders later seek ratification/ post facto approval of the Chief Minister.
[emphasis supplied]
47. As could be seen from Para 9(a) of the Guidelines, there is a general embargo on premature
transfers. However, two exceptions are provided in Para 9 (a).
48. The first exception for effecting a premature transfer is when the competent authority, records
in writing, that any one or more of the eight situations stated therein have arisen in the case of a
particular Government servant.
49. The second exception for effecting a premature transfer is when the competent authority feels
that a particular Government servant is not suitable for discharging his duties at the present place,
he can record reasons to that effect in writing and reduce the minimum period of stay prescribed in
Para 8 and effect a premature transfer.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 9
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
50. Thus, whenever the competent authority is of the view that a situation as stipulated in Para 9(a)
(i) to (viii) has arisen or he is of the view that a Government Servant is not suitable for discharging
his duties at his present place, a premature transfer of the Government servant can be effected.
51. The common feature, however, in both the cases is that the competent authority is obliged to
record his reasons in writing.
52. Para 9 (b) lays down a further safeguard against premature transfers and this is obviously to
ensure that a Competent Authority does not misuse the option available to him in effecting a
premature transfer. Para 9 (b) mandates that no premature transfer can be effected without
obtaining the prior approval of the Chief Minister, the highest functionary of the Government.
53. Thus, whenever a premature transfer is to be effected, firstly, reasons are to be recorded by the
competent authority in writing for the premature transfer and before that is given effect to, the prior
approval of the Chief Minister must be obtained.
54. It is also to be noticed that Para 9 (b) expressly forbids the practice of effecting the premature
transfer of a Government servant and thereafter seeking its ratification by the Chief Minister.
55. This is, obviously because, the Chief Minister before he grants his approval to the premature
transfer must have the benefit of considering the reasons recorded in writing by the Competent
Authority and satisfying himself that a premature transfer was warranted. In other words, it is only
on the consideration of the written reasoning of the Competent Authority, can the Chief Minister
apply his mind and proceed to either grant or refuse his approval for effecting the premature
transfer.
56. Having regard to the manner in which a double safeguard is ensconced in Para 9 of the
Guidelines for a premature transfer, it is clear that adherence to all clauses of Para 9 is mandatory
and can never be construed as directory.
57. In the instant case, however, the State states that the competent authority envisaged in the
Guidelines is the Chief Minister himself and the State contends that if the Chief Minister, the highest
functionary of the State, himself was of the view that there were strong and compelling reasons to
transfer the petitioner, the same cannot be said to be either arbitrary or in contravention of the
Guidelines.
58. Without going into the debatable question as to who the competent authority as envisaged in
para 3 (a) of the guidelines is, it would be necessary that the legality of the impugned order of
transfer be considered on the assumption that the Chief Minister himself is the competent authority.
59. In order to ascertain the legality of the transfer order, it would be relevant to consider the noting
in the original file relating to the order of transfer dated 30.05.2020. The noting reads as follows:

60. As could be seen from the above, the noting emanated from the Chief Minister himself and it
was not preceded by the recording of any reasons for the transfer by any other authority. It will have
to be therefore seen if the order of the Chief Minister satisfies the requirement of the second portion
of para 9 (a) of the Guidelines.
61. A bare reading of the noting would indicate that the Chief Minister was of the view that the
posting of the 6th respondent to the post of Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North was desirable
because he had local knowledge of the area. Thus, the Chief Minister was only recording the reason
as why the 6th respondent's posting as the Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North was desirable
and he was not recording any reason as to why the petitioner was not suitable for being continued as
the Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North.

Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
62. In order to satisfy the stipulation found in Para 9 (a), however, it was essential for the Chief
Minister to record reasons as to why the petitioner was not suitable to be continued as the Assistant
Commissioner, Bengaluru North, as contemplated in Para 9 (a) of the Guidelines. Unless, the Chief
Minister recorded specific reasons for coming to the conclusion that the petitioner was not suitable
to be continued as the Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North, it was not permissible for him to
order the premature transfer of the petitioner from the post of Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru
North.
63. It is to be borne in mind that a premature transfer is an exception to the general embargo on
premature transfers and is permissible only under the circumstances available under para 9 (a) of
the Guidelines and a premature transfer cannot be resorted to lightly or casually. In other words,
unless, there are justifiable reasons for not continuing a Government Servant in a particular post,
the State cannot resort to invoke its exceptional power to prematurely transfer the Government
Servant.
64. In the instant case, since there are absolutely no reasons recorded regarding the non-suitability
of the petitioner to continue as the Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North, the premature
transfer of the petitioner is in clear contravention of the mandate of Para 9 (a) of the Guidelines and
cannot be therefore sustained.
65. It is to be noted that the petitioner is entitled to the tenure prescribed in the Guidelines. Since
the Guidelines have acquired the force of a statute, the tenure prescribed therein would also have
acquired the force of a statute and would be enforceable in law, in view of the law declared by the
Full Bench in the case stated above. This vested right of the petitioner to have the benefit of a
prescribed tenure under the Guidelines cannot be divested unless the procedure stipulated therein is
scrupulously adhered to. The order of transfer, therefore, does not clearly satisfy the requirement of
the Guidelines.
66. Since the Learned Advocate General has advanced an argument regarding the need to have the
6th respondent to work as an Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru North in the light of the prevailing
pandemic and the overriding provisions of the Disaster Management Act, is concerned, it would
have to be examined whether the order of transfer of a Government Servant can be traced to or
actually related to any of the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, so as to enable the
bypassing the Guidelines.
67. The Disaster Management Act has been enacted for the purpose of having a law to provide for
the effective management of disasters and for matter connected therein and the said Act provides
for establishment of three authorities, one at the National Level, one at the State Level and one at
the District Level as envisaged in Chapter II, III and IV of the Disaster Management Act.
68. The National Disaster Management Authority (hereinafter referred as the NDMA) at the
National Level is entrusted with the responsibility for laying down the policies, plans and guidelines
for disaster management for ensuring timely and effective response to a disaster.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 12
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
69. The NDMA is empowered to constitute an Advisory committee consisting of experts in the filed
of management and having practical experience of disaster management at the National. State or
District level to make recommendations on different aspects of the disaster management.
70. On the constitution of the NDMA, the Central Government is obliged to constitute a National
Executive Committee to assist the NDMA in the performance of its functions under the Disaster
Management Act and this Executive Committee is required to assist the NDMA and is entrusted
with the responsibility of implementing the policies and plans of the NDMA and ensure the
compliance of the directions issued by the Central Government. This National Executive Committee
is tasked with the drawing up of a plan for disaster management for the whole of the country called
the National plan.
71. Chapter III of the DMA envisages the setting up a State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA)
immediately on the constitution of the NDMA for the State and the said authority shall be headed by
the Chief Minister and comprise of a maximum of 9 persons to be nominated by the Chief Minister
including the chairperson of the State Executive Committee. The SDMA is empowered to constitute
an Advisory Committee in the same manner as the NDMA and the SDMA is entrusted with the
responsibility of laying down policies and plans for disaster management in the State.
72. The State Government, immediately, on the constitution of the SDMA is also required to
constitute a State Executive Committee to assist the SDMA in the performance of its functions and
to coordinate action in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the SDMA. This State Executive
Committee is given the responsibility of implementing the National and State Plan and act as the
coordinating and monitoring body for the management of disaster in the State. The State Executive
Committee is also given the task of preparing the State Plan.
73. The State Executive Committee, for the purpose of assisting and protecting the community
affected by the disaster or for providing relief to such community or for preventing or combating
disruption or dealing with the effects of any threatening disaster situation, take the steps
enumerated in S. 24 of the Disaster Management Act.
74. Chapter IV of the Disaster Management Act contemplates the constitution of a District
Management Authority and since for the purposes of this petition, the order of transfer is not
traceable to the District Management Authority, the same are not being discussed.
75. Thus, the scheme of the Act is to basically provide for establishment of Disaster Management
Authorities for laying down policies and plans for disaster management and at the same time
provide for establishment of an Executive Committees to assist the Disaster Management
Authorities in the performance of its functions and for coordinating action in accordance with the
guidelines laid down by them and also to ensure compliance of directions issued by the
Governments.
76. The provisions of the Disaster Management Act, however, does not contemplate or provide for
the Authorities envisaged therein to in any way step into the shoes of the Government or for that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 13
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
matter act as the Government itself and to take decisions as if it was the Government. The
Authorities, contemplated under the Disaster Management Act, cannot therefore decide on the
postings of Government servants to mitigate and manage a situation arising out a disaster.
77. The Authorities under the Disaster Management Act are empowered to prepare Plans in
anticipation of a Disaster and the measures that are required to be taken to mitigate the effects of
any Disaster. In other words, the law enjoins the preparation of a Plan in advance to combat a
situation arising out of a Disaster and the Authorities are empowered to ensure coordination and
implementation of the Policies and Plans, which are prepared in advance and they are also expected
to take such further steps as are necessary to mitigate the disaster.
78. The Act does not however empower the Management Authorities or the Executive Committees
to exercise any control or superintendence over the Government servants. Thus, it follows, that the
Chief Minister cannot fall back on the provisions of the Disaster Management Act to exercise powers
of transfer of Government servants and the Chief Minister cannot in the face of a Disaster override
the Guidelines prescribed for transfer of a Government Servant. The reliance placed on S. 14, 18 of
the Disaster Management Act cited in the impugned order of transfer cannot therefore validate the
order of transfer as one being made to mitigate or to take effective steps to tackle a Disaster as
contemplated under the Disaster Management Act.
79. It is to be stated here that the recording of reasons, prescribed in the Guidelines, even in the face
of a disaster, for finding a particular Government servant as not being suitable for discharge of
duties in a particular post, cannot be said to an onerous or an impossible task. The argument of the
State that strict adherence to the Guidelines should not be insisted in the face of a Disaster cannot
be accepted.
80. If the argument of the State that in an emergent situation, such as the prevailing pandemic,
adherence to the Guidelines should not be insisted upon were to be accepted, then, the decision of
the Full Bench that the Guidelines have the force of a statute and can be enforced would be rendered
nugatory and this is clearly impermissible.
81. The argument that S. 72 of the Disaster Management Act has an overriding effect and therefore
the transfer made in the face of a disaster would have the effect of overriding the Guidelines cannot
also be accepted, because, as narrated above, the scheme of the Disaster Management Act does not
provide for even the Authorities envisaged therein to exercise control or superintendence over
Government employees of various departments. There is nothing in the Act, which confers upon the
Authorities therein the power to decide on the posting of the employees of various Government
Departments for S. 72 to be invoked and to say that the Guidelines are in contradiction of the
powers of the Authorities under the Act and thus the overriding effect of the Act would apply to a
transfer of a Government servant. This argument of the overriding power under S. 72 of the Disaster
Management Act cannot therefore sustain.
82. The argument of the Learned Advocate General that in the prevailing situation, the Government
should be given the maximum possible discretion and the transfer order should not be disturbed in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121165566/ 14
Sri Dayanand Bhandari vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 June, 2020
view of the emergent situation cannot also be accepted because the discretion to prematurely a
transfer has already been provided in the Guidelines and all that the Government is required to do is
to adhere to the terms stipulated therein.
83. It is not even the argument of the petitioner's counsel that the Government does not have the
discretion to make a premature transfer and all that was argued by the petitioner was that the
requisite procedure that was required to be followed before effecting the premature transfer was not
complied with.
84. In the instant case, as stated above, the procedure prescribed in the guidelines for effecting a
premature transfer has not been adhered to and consequently the order of transfer dated 30.5.2020,
Annexure N, is required to be quashed and it is accordingly quashed. Consequently, writ petition
stands allowed.
85. The petitioner as a consequence would be entitled to continue in the post of the Assistant
Commissioner, Bangalore North for the remaining period of his tenure as prescribed in the
Guidelines dated 7.6.2013.
86. The 6th respondent is directed to hand over charge to the petitioner.
87. It is needless to state that this order will not come in the way of the State, if it so desires, to
invoke the power available under the Guidelines to prematurely transfer the petitioner, subject of
course, to strict adherence to the stipulations made in the Guidelines dated 7.6.2013.
88. The Registry is directed to return the original files to the Office of the Advocate General, under
due acknowledgment.
