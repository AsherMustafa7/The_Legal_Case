S.S. Mishra, J.
The CRLMC No.3237 of 2017 has been filed by Shri Narayan Chandra Nayak seeking quashing of
the entire criminal proceeding in Bhubaneswar EOW P.S. Case No.18 of 2013 corresponding to C.T.
Case No.2133 of 2013 pending in the court of the learned Presiding Officer, Designated Court under
the OPID Act, Cuttack.
The CRLMC No. 937 of 2018 has been filed by M/s. Umamani Home Creation Private Limited and
Mrs. Sunita Narendra Singh Director of accused M/s. Umamani Homes Creation Private Limited,
seeking quashing of the entire criminal proceeding in Bhubaneswar EOW P.S. Case No.18 of 2013,
corresponding to C.T. Case No.2133 of 2013 (C.T. Case No.04 of 2015), pending in the Court of the
learned Presiding Officer, Designated Court under the OPID Act, Cuttack.
The instant Criminal Appeal has been filed by Shri Narayan Chandra Nayak, challenging the validity
of the judgment dated 08.09.2016 passed by the learned Presiding Officer, Designated Court under
the OPID Act, Cuttack in I.A. No.01 of 2015, whereby the interim attachment order dated
04.12.2014 passed by the Government has been confirmed and made absolute.
Since all three petitions are based on the same factual foundation, therefore, all the petitions have
been heard analogously and are being decided by this common judgment.
2. Common factual foundation is that one M/s. Umamani Home Creation Pvt. Ltd. was incorporated
on 23.05.2008 under the Companies Act, 1956, with its registered office in Odisha, Cuttack. The
company was engaged in real estate business activities and was primarily involved in developing
residential plots and housing projects. The Managing Director of the company was Narayan
Chandra Nayak (the Petitioner), and Sunita Narendra Singh was one of the Directors. The company
advertised various housing projects, including "Chikun Garden," "Prava Paradise," and "Limoon
City House Site Complex," through brochures, leaflets, and other promotional materials, attracting a
large number of prospective buyers.
3. The case originated from a complaint filed by one Sachidananda Mohapatra, who lodged an FIR
on 03.06.2013 at Bhubaneswar Economic Offences Wing (EOW) Police Station. According to the
complainant, he came across advertisements by M/s. Umamani Home Creation Pvt. Ltd. regarding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 2
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
its housing project "Chikun Garden" in Bhubaneswar. Persuaded by the promotional materials and
representations made by the accused persons, he entered into an agreement to purchase 10
residential plots. On 28.11.2011, he deposited (cid:128)20,00,000 as a booking amount and received a
money receipt bearing No. 3531, signed by the Petitioner and his wife.
4. Despite multiple requests, the Petitioner and his company neither registered the plots in the
complainant(cid:129)s name nor refunded the full amount. Initially, Rs.4,00,000/- was refunded in cash,
and the remaining amount was promised through cheques. However, upon presenting the cheques,
the complainant found that the company had insufficient funds in the bank, leading to their
dishonor. Upon further inquiry, the complainant discovered that several other buyers were in a
similar situation, as they had also paid significant sums for plots that were never delivered.
5. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) initiated an investigation into the allegations, during which
several investors and witnesses were examined. Documents such as agreement papers, money
receipts, brochures, computer hard disks, and other related records were seized. The investigation
revealed that the Petitioner and his company had entered into multiple agreements with intending
buyers despite knowing that they did not possess clear, marketable, or transferable ownership rights
over the land in question and therefore, Section 6 of Odisha Protection of Interests of Depositors
Act, 2011 was added besides other panel of offences in the course of Investigation. Additionally,
financial records showed that as of 31.03.2013, the company owed Rs.13,10,89,455/- to 998
investors. It was also found that the company required approximately 45.83 acres of land to fulfill its
commitments but possessed only 8.82 acres across all its projects.
6. The investigation further revealed that a significant portion of the funds collected from investors
had been diverted to the Odia film industry and other non-real estate-related activities. A total of
Rs.47,77,960/- was found in 23 bank accounts operated by the company and its Directors, which
were subsequently frozen. Additionally, the Petitioner had availed a loan of Rs.43,74,700/- from
Odisha Gramya Bank.
7. Based on the findings, the Investigating Officer submitted a charge sheet on 04.05.2015,
implicating the Petitioner and his wife under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of
trust), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged documents as
genuine), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code,
along with Section 6 of the Odisha Protection of Interests of Depositors (in Financial
Establishments) Act, 2011.
8. The learned Presiding Officer of the Designated Court under the OPID Act, Cuttack, took
cognizance of the offences and framed charges against the accused. The prosecution examined 19
charge-sheeted witnesses, including 14 investors and the Investigating Officer, all of whom provided
evidence linking the Petitioner to the alleged fraud. Additionally, the movable and immovable
properties of the Petitioner and the company were attached under Section 3 of the OPID Act.
9. Heard Mr. Suresh Chandra Tripathy, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Bibekananda
Bhuyan, learned Senior Counsel for the OPID.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 3
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
10. Mr. Tripathy, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the Odisha Protection of Interests
of Depositors (OPID) Act, 2011, came into force on 17.08.2013, whereas the transactions in question
took place prior to that date. Since the alleged acts of fraud and misrepresentation occurred before
the enactment of the OPID Act, the Petitioners contended that the law could not be applied
retrospectively to their case. He also submits that any liability should be examined under the laws
applicable at the time of the transactions, and not under a statute that came into effect later.
11. It was further submitted by Mr. Tripathy, that M/s. Umamani Home Creation Pvt. Ltd. was
engaged in the real estate business and was not a "financial establishment" as defined under Section
2(d) of the O.P.I.D. Act. He contended that the company did not accept deposits from the public for
financial investment purposes but merely received consideration for the sale of land under
agreements for sale. Since the business involved real estate transactions and not deposit-taking
activities, the provisions of the OPID Act were not applicable. He further argued that the amount
received from the complainant and other investors did not constitute a â€ždeposit(cid:129) under Section 2(b)
of the OPID Act. The payments were made under agreements for sale of residential plots, which
were contractual transactions under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and not deposit-taking activities.
It was submitted that the complainant had voluntarily entered into agreements and were well aware
that they were making payments for acquiring immovable property. Therefore, the Petitioners
contended that the case did not attract the provisions of the OPID Act.
12. Mr. Tripathy, learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the case was purely civil
in nature and did not constitute criminal offences under Sections 420/406/467/468/
471/506/120-B of the I.P.C. It was contended that there was no dishonest intention (mens rea) from
the beginning, as the company had genuinely intended to provide the plots. The Petitioners
maintained that financial difficulties and legal impediments in land acquisition had caused the delay
in delivering the plots. He further submitted that the partial refund of Rs.4,00,000/- to the
complainant showed bona fide efforts to resolve the matter.
13. Mr. Tripathy, learned counsel for the Petitioners further contended that the criminal
proceedings were initiated with mala fide intent to harass him and the charge sheet was filed
mechanically without proper judicial application of mind. Since the company(cid:129)s activities were
already regulated under civil and contractual laws, criminal liability should not be imposed.
Therefore, the Petitioners are seeking quashing of the entire criminal proceedings under Section
482 CrPC, arguing that continuation of the case would result in a gross miscarriage of justice.
14. Mr. Bhuyan, learned Senior Counsel for the OPID on contrary submitted that the Petitioners and
his associates had fraudulently collected substantial sums from investors by falsely promising to
provide land. Despite repeated assurances, neither the land was allotted nor the full amount was
refunded, establishing a prima facie case under the OPID Act and relevant I.P.C. provisions. He
further submitted that the accused had a dishonest intent from the outset, as they induced investors
with misleading representations while lacking the resources to fulfill their commitments. The failure
to return the full amount despite persistent demands further substantiated this claim.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 4
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
15. It was further submitted by the learned counsel for the Petitioners that engaged in forgery and
fraudulent documentation to deceive investors, attracting offenses under Sections 467, 468, and 471
of IPC. The investigation revealed bank transactions, investor complaints, and documentary
evidence confirming the fraudulent nature of the scheme. The prosecution emphasized that a partial
refund of Rs.4,00,000/- could not absolve the Petitioners to the criminal liability, as the wrongful
gain was much higher, and mere repayment did not negate the fraudulent conduct.
16. Mr. Bhuyan, learned Senior Counsel also defended the legality of the investigation and
subsequent charge sheet, asserting that the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) had gathered strong
evidence justifying the prosecution. The attachment of properties under Section 3 of the OPID Act
was necessary to safeguard investors(cid:129) interest. Given the scale of the fraud, the authorities acted
well within their jurisdiction in prosecuting the Petitioners.
17. In conclusion, learned counsel for the OPID argued that the petition seeking quashing of
proceedings was baseless, as sufficient material existed for trial. Premature interference by the court
would frustrate the objectives of the OPID Act, which aims to protect depositors from financial
fraud. Therefore, he prayed for the dismissal of the petition, allowing the trial to proceed in the
interest of justice.
18. Dealing with the contentions with regards to penal offences, as raised on behalf of the
Petitioners, it can be safely held that the same cannot be entertained at this stage by invoking
inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. as that would amount to appreciation of evidence
in the midst of on-going trial. The Hon(cid:129)ble Apex Court in catena of judgements have time and again
reminded that the inherent jurisdiction of High Courts enshrined under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is to
be exercised very sparingly and should not be invoked for the purpose of venturing into appreciation
and qualitative evaluation of evidence relied upon by the prosecution, particularly when the trial has
proceeded substantially, as the same would amount to interference in trial which is in sole domain
of the learned trial Court. Abruptly shutting trial at the belated stage of proceeding is completely
forbidden by law under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
19. This Court finds merit with the arguments advanced on behalf of the prosecution that the trial
has already proceeded substantially, with 19 witnesses having been examined including 14 investors
and the Investigating Officer and any intervention by this Court at this stage would not meet the end
of justice.
20. Thus, the contentions and the grounds agitated on behalf of the Petitioners with regard to
probative value of the evidence and allegations made in the charge-sheet cannot be gone into at this
stage by this Court. Hence, this Court will refrain from commenting upon the qualitative and
evidentiary value of the evidence that has been collected in course of investigation and leave the
same to be tested and evaluated by the learned trial Court, independently, in course of the trial.
21. The O.P.I.D. Act has been brought into force on 17.08.2013, while the F.I.R. in the present case
has been lodged on 03.06.2013 with regard to acts of commissions of crime, alleged to have been
committed prior to the date of F.I.R. Therefore, at the first glance, it seems that, this is a case, where
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 5
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
there has been retrospective invocation of criminal and penal statutes. However, little scratching on
the surface would reveal that this argument is not valid. The offence punishable under Section 6 of
the OPID Act does not get completed by simply taking deposits from the general public, rather it is
the very beginning and starting point of commission of the said offence and offence continuous as
long as the investors do not get their promised return. In other words, offence punishable under
Section 6 of the O.P.I.D. Act is a continuing offence, which continues till the point the investors get
back their promised returns.
22. In the present case, charge-sheet reveals that as far as the informant is concerned a balance of
INR 16,00,000/- is still outstanding against the accused person after alleged return of cash of
Rs.4,00,000/-. However, the charge-sheet reveals that as on 31.03.2013, total outstanding dues
towards 998 intending buyers and against the Petitioners is about INR 13,10,89,445/-, which by any
stretch of imagination is a huge amount of public money. Therefore, contention raised on behalf of
the Petitioners that the OPID Act, despite being penal provisions have been invoked retrospectively
does not hold merit and deserves to be rejected. Specifically noting the fact that the accused persons
have been alleged to have entered into large number of agreements with the innocent buyers and
collected deposit of more than Fourteen Crores Rupees from such innocent buyers, despite the fact
that the accused persons did not own sufficient land with legally marketable ownership or title. Over
and above the allegation of funds having been diverted to business other than real estate is also to be
looked into.
23. The Hon(cid:129)ble Apex Court in case of State Of Bihar vs Deokaran Nenshi, reported in (1972) 2 SCC
890 has lucidly differentiated the difference between and instantaneous offence in following terms:-
"A continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is
distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all. It is one of those
offences which arises out of a failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement
and which involves a penalty, the liability for which continues until the rule or its
requirement is obeyed or complied with. On every occasion that such disobedience or
non-compliance, occurs and recurs, there is the offence committed. The distinction
between the two kinds of offences is between an act or omission which constitutes an
offence once and for all and an act or omission which continues and therefore.
constitutes a fresh offence every time or occasion on which it continues. In the case of
a continuing offence, there is thus the ingredient of continuance of the offence which
is absent in the case of an offence which takes place when an act or omission is
committed once and for all."
A few illustrative cases would help to bring out the distinction between the two types of offences. In
England the Trade Union Act, 1871 by S.12 provided that if any officer, member or other person
being or representing himself to be a member of a trade union, by false representation or imposition
obtained possession of any moneys books etc. of such trade union, or, having the same in his
possession wilfully withheld or fraudulently misapplied the same, a court of summary jurisdiction
would order such person to be imprisoned. The offence of withholding the money referred to in this
section was' held to be a continuing offence, presumably because every day that the moneys were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 6
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
wilfully withheld an offence within the meaning of s. 12 was committed. (Best v. Butler and
Fitzgibbon(1)]."
24. Relying upon the aforesaid judgment in the case of Deokaran Nenshi (supra), the Hon(cid:129)ble
Supreme Court in the case of Gokak Patel Volkart Ltd. vs Dundayya Gurushiddaiah Hiremath and
Ors. 1991 (2) SCC 141 has held that as long as the property of a company is wrongfully retained by
the officer or employee of a company, the offence under Section 630 of the Companies Act would
continue. The relevant portion of the aforesaid judgment in the case of Gokak Patel Volkart Ltd.
(supra.) is extracted herein below:-
"Applying the law enunciated above to the provisions of section 630 of the
Companies Act, we are of the view that the offence under this section is not such as
can be said to have consummated once for all. Wrongful withholding, or wrongfully
obtaining possession and wrongful application of the company's property, that is, for
purposes other than those expressed or directed in the articles of the company and
authorised by the Company Act, cannot be said to be terminated by a single act or
fact but would subsist for the period until the property in the offender's possession is
delivered up or refunded. It is an offence committed over a span of time and the last
act of the offence will control the commencement of the period of limitation and need
be alleged. The offence consists of a course of conduct arising from a singleness of
thought, purpose of refusal to deliver up or refund which may be deemed a single
impulse. Considered from another angle, it consists of a continuous series of acts
which endures after the period of consummation on refusal to deliver up or refund
the property. It is not an instantaneous offence and limitation begins with the
cessation of the criminal act, i.e. with the delivering up or refund of the property It
will be a recurring or continuing offence until the wrongful possession, wrongful
withholding or wrongful application is vacated or put an end to. The offence
continues until the property wrongfully obtained or wrongfully withheld or
knowingly mis-applied is delivered up or refunded to the company. For failure to do
so sub- section (2) prescribes the punishment. This, in our view, is sufficient ground
for holding that the offence under section 630 of the Companies Act is not one time
but a continuing offence and the period of limitation must be computed accordingly,
and when so done, the instant complaints could not be said to have been barred by
limitation. The submission that when the first respondent upon his retirement failed
to vacate and deliver possession of the company's quarter to the company the offence
must be taken to have been complete, has, therefore, to be rejected."
25. The Hon(cid:129)ble Supreme Court in their judgment in Bhagirath Kanoria & Ors. Etc vs State Of M.P.
& Ors. Etc., reported in 1984 (4) SCC 222, has specifically pointed out that while deciding as to
whether any offence is a "continuing offence" the object and purpose of the provision has to be
looked into. In this case, the Hon(cid:129)ble Supreme Court has held that withholding the employer(cid:129)s
contribution to the provident fund of the employee, is a continuing offence as long as the same is
withhold by the employer, the relevant postulation of law is extracted herein below:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 7
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
"The question whether a particular offence is a continuing offence must necessarily
depend upon the language of the statute which creates that offence, the nature of the
offence and, above all, the purpose which is intended to be achieved by constituting
the particular act as an offence. Turning to the matters before us, the offence of which
the appellants are charged is the failure to pay the employer's contribution before the
due date. Considering the object and purpose of this provision, which is to ensure the
welfare of workers, we find it impossible to hold that the offence is not of a
continuing nature. The appellants were unquestionably liable to pay their
contribution to the Provident Fund before the due date and it was within their power
to pay it, as soon after the due date had expired as they willed. The late payment
could not have absolved them of their original guilt but it would have snapped the
recurrence. Each day that they failed to comply with the obligation to pay their
contribution to the fund, they committed a fresh offence. It is putting an incredible
premium on lack of concern for the welfare of workers to hold that the employer who
has not paid contribution or the contribution of the employees to the Provident Fund
can successfully evade the penal consequences of his act by pleading the law of
limitation. Such offences must be regarded as continuing offences, to which the law
of limitation cannot apply."
26. In the light of aforesaid authorities of law, rendered by the Hon(cid:129)ble Supreme Court, the purpose
and object of the OPID Act and the intent of the legislature behind the enactment has to be
considered. The object and purpose of the OPID Act is to secure and protect the interest of innocent
depositors, who are fraudulently entrapped by financial institutions by making false promise. In this
regard the Section 7 of the OPID Act acquires significance which makes the offence punishable
under Section 6 of the O.P.I.D. Act, compoundable on payment of entire amount due to the
depositors with or without interest. Moreover, under the scheme of the OPID Act, the purpose of
attachment and sale of the attached property of the accused person is to restore the losses of the
depositors in equitable manner. Conjoint reading of Section 3, Section 6 and Section 7 of the OPID
Act leaves no room for speculation that purpose and object of the OPID Act is two folds, first to
protect the interest of depositors prior to commission of offence and second to restore the losses of
the depositors at hands of defaulting institutions in equitable manner.
27. Thus, it is crystal clear that considering the object and purpose of the OPID Act and the
legislative intent behind the enactment, the offence punishable under Section 6 of the OPID Act is a
continuing offence as long as the defaulter financial institution is withholding the deposits of the
investors.
28. Learned counsel for the Petitioners has relied upon the ratio of law laid down in the case of Soni
Devrajbhai Babubhai V. State of Gujurat & Ors, by the Hon(cid:129)ble Apex Court in Criminal Appeal
No.533/1991 wherein the Hon(cid:129)ble Apex Court has held that the offence punishable under Section
304-B of I.P.C. cannot be invoked when the dowry death had occurred, prior to the insertion of
Section 304-B in the statute book and therefore, presumption against the accused under Section
113-B of the Indian Evidence Act cannot be drawn. The aforesaid ratio laid down by the Hon(cid:129)ble
Apex Court does not have any application in the facts of the present case, simply for the reason that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 8
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
offence punishable U/s.304-B of IPC is not a continuing offence and the same is completed as soon
as the deceased takes her last breath, in contrast offence punishable under Section 6 of the OPID Act
continues until the investor is paid back the promised returns.
29. To buttress his argument, Mr. Tripathy, learned counsel for the petitioners have further relied
upon the judgement of High Court of Delhi in the case of Mahanivesh oils & food Pvt Ltd V.
Directorate of Enforcement, wherein the learned Single Bench has held that offence of money
laundering cannot penalise the acts of commission of schedule offence under the PMLA Act prior to
01.07.2005 i.e. when the PMLA was brought in force. The said relied upon judgement is under
challenge before the Division Bench of High Court of Delhi, in LPA 144 of 2016 and the learned
Division Bench in the interrogation has passed the following orders:-
"Re-notify on 16.03.2017 under the same caption for hearing.
We have observed that while allowing the writ petition by the order under appeal
certain findings were recorded by the Ld. Single Judge with regard to enforcement of
the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 on interpretation of the provisions of
the said Act.
We make it clear that the findings so recorded by the Ld. Single Judge shall not be
construed as conclusive and binding precedent until further orders"
Thus, the ratio laid down by the learned Single bench does not enure to the benefit of Petitioners.
Moreover, factually the ratio is very much distinguishable with the facts of the present case and
cannot be applied in facts scenario of present case.
30. Learned counsel for the Petitioners have also contended that in view of stipulations made in
Section 3 of the OPID Act, more than one complainant is required for the purpose of invocation of
Section 6 of the OPID Act. This contention of the Petitioners is nothing but a misplaced confidence
as during the course of investigation names of as many as 998 intending buyers, who have either not
been sold the land or have not been returned their deposits, have come into light and many of the
intending buyers have also made statements before the I.O. disclosing that how they have been
cheated by the accused persons. Therefore, it is not a single instance of commission of offence
punishable under Section 6 of the OPID Act. Hence, this ground also deserves rejection.
31. The petitioners have challenged the invocation of Section 6 of the OPID Act on the ground that
real estate transactions have already been declared to be beyond the purview of the OPID Act vide
judgement of the coordinate bench of this Court in the case of Rashmita Patra V. State of Odisha &
Ors. CRLMC No.1296 of 2021. However, Mr. Bhuyan on behalf of respondent-State, has strongly
opposed the contention of the petitioners and has relied upon the judgment of another co-ordinate
bench of this Court in the case of Dusmanta Kumar Muduli v. State of Odisha, to submit that the
judgment passed in the case of Rashmita Patra (supra) has been held to be per-incuriam. Mr.
Bhuyan has strenuously relied upon the following observation of the co- ordinate bench in the case
of Dusmanta Kumar Muduli (supra) in support of his contention:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123856042/ 9
Narayan Chandra Nayak vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 10 April, 2025
"8. Referring to the Apex Court decision in Ripa Sharma (supra) and other decisions
cited herein above laying down the principles of binding precedence and that if a
conflicting view is taken by a Co-ordinate Bench of the same Court in ignorance of
earlier decisions, it shall have no binding effect and said to be a judgment per
incuriam, Mr. Bhuyan, learned counsel for the OPID State submits that the earlier
view of the Benches of equal strength was to be followed by the subsequent Bench of
co-equal strength while dealing with similar matter. It is claimed that since the
Co-ordinate Benches of this Court confirmed the orders of charge and initiation of
criminal proceeding, the subsequent judgment in CRLMC No.1296 of 2021 without
taking note of said decisions has lost its binding effect. However, it is argued by Mr.
Das, learned Senior Advocate that the judgment in CRLMC No.2781 of 2019 is a
non-speaking one which simply followed the judgment in CRLA No.32 of 2020 which
was related to an order under Section 239 Cr.P.C. seeking discharge. It is contended
by Mr. Das that RERA governs the field which is a complete Code in itself and
therefore, the doctrine of occupied field squarely applies. On a reading of the
judgment in CRLA No.32 of 2020, it is made to understand that the charge under
Section 6 of the OPID Act was under challenge therein and the same did not find
favour with this Court which was also followed in CRLMC No.2781 of 2019 and
therefore, the only option which is now left open to conclude that the prosecution
against the petitioner for the said offence shall have to continue, however, its fate
being dependent on the final decision of the Apex Court in SLP (Crl.) No. 2107 of
2022 and SLP (Crl.) No.4910 of 2022 and as a necessary corollary, the decision in
CRLMC No. 1296 of 2021 has to be held as a judgment per incuriam. Whether for
other IPC offences, a prima facie case is made out against the petitioner or otherwise,
in the considered view of the Court, it should be left for the decision of the learned
court below during enquiry."
32. In that view of the matter, the ratio laid down in the case of Rashmita Patra (supra) does not
come to rescue the accused/ Petitioners. Hence, the contention raised by the learned counsel for the
Petitioners that real estate transactions are beyond the purview of the OPID Act is not sustainable.
33. In the light of discussions and analysis made in the preceding paragraphs, all the three petitions
fail and accordingly, CRLA No.532 of 2016, CRLMC No.3237 of 2017 and CRLMC No.937 of 2018
stand dismissed.
