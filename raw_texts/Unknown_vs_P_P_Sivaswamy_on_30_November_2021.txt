-----
ORDER
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in C.C. No.38 of 2017,
pending on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Mettupalayam.
2. Brief facts of the case in a nutshell are as follows:-
The learned Judicial Magistrate, Mettupalayam, took cognizance of the private
complaint filed by the respondent/Genesis Society, registered in the year 2014. The
first accused is the Trust and the other accused are trustees, Page No:3/23
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and purchasers, lessees, attestors of the documents
and Bank official, who have sanctioned the loan in respect of immovable property
originally owned by the Trust, subsequently purchased by some of the accused
herein. The private complaint was lodged, as if there were several sale deeds and
lease deeds executed among relatives, thereby, they caused breach of trust. Hence
they committed an offence punishable under Sections 107 to 109, 120B, 405, 406,
409 and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code.
3. Though the private complaint runs to about 28 pages, just like a civil Suit, the main allegation
pressed into service with regard to the sale of certain properties, dated 21.06.1977 and 21.12.1981,
and lease deeds of the years 1994 and 1996, the main contention of the learned counsel appearing
for the petitioners is that the private complaint itself is motivated and the result of a civil litigation
which went against one of the daughters of the second accused and his son in law.
4. It is his further contention that the trust deed itself authorised by the trustees to deal with the
properties and the Civil litigations filed by the daughter Page No:4/23
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and of second accused went against her and ultimately concluded
in S.L.P.Nos.15105 and 15106 of 2018.
5. It is his further contention that the so called society has been formed in the year 2014. The
relationship between one of the daughters of the second accused and her husband on one side and
second accused on the other side was marred due to several acrimonious litigation between
daughter against father, who is arrayed as second accused in private complaint. This prosecution
itself is the result of hatredness and rancour exhibited by daughter and son-in-law of second
accused. It is further submitted that civil litigation initiated by daughter of second accused went
upto Apex Court and dismissed not stopping with, several petitions were filed in the form of Trust
O.P before Principal District Judge, Coimbatore which were also dismissed by Civil Court.
6. On 18.02.2010, one Jayashree Jayanth, daughter of second accused and two others had filed
Trust O.P.108 of 2010, before the Principal District Judge, Coimbatore, for seeking removal of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177458629/ 3
Unknown vs P.P.Sivaswamy on 30 November, 2021
respondents 2 to 4 therein, from the office of the Trustees in P.B.Nanjaiah Lingammal Charities
Trust. Page No:5/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and Subsequently, the above Original
Petition was dismissed as not pressed on 12.02.2013 before the Principal District Judge,
Coimbatore. Besides she also filed an application along with two others, in I.A.No.2199 of 2011 in
O.S.C.F.R.No.26110 of 2011, on the file of the Principal District Judge, Coimbatore, to grant leave to
the petitioner, therein to file a suit to settle the scheme for administration of the Trust and to
remove the respondents/defendants 2 to 6 from the office of the Trustees in the Trust, and to
appoint new trustees and directing accounts and inquiries and restraining the respondents from
interfering with the affairs of the Trust, which was also subsequently dismissed.
7. In the meanwhile, when the matters are pending, suddenly, the Society was formed on 11/3/2014
with its object to espouse the interest of the Public Charitable Endowment. Thereafter, they have
also filed an application to implead as a party in the pending leave Application filed by Jayashree on
04.01.2016. Thereafter, the above applications were dismissed and impleading application filed by
the society, in I.A.No.540 of 2016 in O.S.CFR.No.26110 of 2011 was also dismissed and thereafter,
leave application filed by Jayashree Page No:6/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and was also
dismissed. Hence, it is his contention that the entire litigation is engineered by the daughter of the
second accused and her husband viz., Jayanth Balakrishnan (Party-in-Person). Therefore, in the
name of the society, now criminal Complaint has been given by the son in law of the second accused,
who is arguing on behalf of respondent as party-in-person.
8. It is his further contention that entire compliant is motivated and abuse of process of law and the
alleged offences has not been made out. It is only to harass the entire family members of A2 and
even the bank officials are also not spared in the complaint. When the very complaint itself is
motivated and initiated only to vindicate the personal right, the same should be quashed by this
Court.
9. To substantiate the case of the petitioners, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has
cited the following citations:-

Court 878.

10. Mr.Jayanth Balakrishna, Party in Person appeared for Genesis Society. Its main object is to
espouse the cause of religious trust. One of the aims of the society as could be seen in the bylaws
reads as follows:
to undertake, establish, aid or take over any religious or charitable institution or
endowment, temple, church, mutt etc., subject to the existing law.
Page No:8/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and
11. Further aims of the society is to take up the functions of other charitable trusts on as needed
basis for the benefit of the public beneficiary. For example, in the case of mis managed public trusts,
Genesis Society shall endeavour to litigate and seek direction from the Court for court supervised
administration and to establish a scheme of administration and/or removal of Trustees. The Society
shall apply to the Court seeking direction to place its key members as trustees in the case of
mismanaged trusts, for the benefit of the public beneficiaries.
12. It is his contention that Society's aim and object is to preserve the public trusts. There were
serious mis management and the properties have been sold contrary to the object of the trust, the
respondent Society has rightly lodged the complaint. In the instant case, properties have been sold
among the family members and thereby, offence under Sections 107 to 109, 120 (B), 405, 406 and
409 of the Indian Penal Code would be attracted. All offences are cognizable in nature. The Court
cannot interfere with the same while exercising the same under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
Page No:9/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and
13. It is his further contention that he is also interested in litigating the public rights interest
particularly in the trust properties. Therefore it is his contention that the allegations in the
complaint has been made since the properties have been dealt by them among the family members.
Therefore, the same cannot be quashed. Further his contention that locus standi to file complaint or
initiate criminal action is unknown to criminal jurisprudence. Though several allegation also made
in the form of written submissions, the crux of the allegation that was able to cull out his main
submission were as above. He also relied on the following judgments.
1. Sri Mudaliambal Trust Vs. The Anna University and Ors. (2003) 4 L.W. 322.
2. The Secretary, The Coimbatore Vasavi Trust Vs. K.Karuppasamy and Ors 2011 (3) CTC 321

14. Even though the private complaint runs into 28 pages, the gist of the allegations can be culled
out as follows:-
Accused with an intention of converting the Trust properties as separate properties
have made alienations in the form of sale deeds dated 29/6/1778 and 21/2/1981.
Transferees in turn sold the property to one partnership firm and the said firm also
availed Bank loan, thereby Bank officials also made as an accused. Further
allegations were made to the effect that lease deed dated 27/7/1990 was also
executed in respect of partition of Trust property. Similarly partition deed dated
27/1/2004 also deals with Trust properties. Main allegation in the complaint is that
the above transactions were done without the permission of Court.
Page No:11/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and
15. The accused Nos.2 to 4 are the present Trustees of the first accused/Trust. The other accused are
either family members or purchasers, attestators for Bank official etc. Though it appears to be a
private complaint dealing with the criminal aspect, the fact that the daughter has filed a suit against
her own father, which was dismissed by the trial court and the same was confirmed by this Court in
A.S.No.573 of 2011 and later, it was confirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in S.L.P.No.15105 and
15106 of 2018 and the fact that the filing of the Trust O.P.No.108 of 2010 by the wife of the
party-in-person Mr.Jayanth Balakrishnan, who represented society before this Court is not
disputed. Similarly, the filing of the impleading petitions in the Trust O.P.s by the society is also not
disputed and dismissal of all the applications is also not disputed by other side.
16. Undisputed facts placed before the Court which was recorded in earlier paragraph was never
whispered in the criminal complaint which is the subject matter of present quash petition. It is
relevant to note that the Society has already filed scheme suit in the year 2015. In I.A.No.224 of 2015
in Page No:12/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and O.S.C.F.R.No.2583 of 2015 before the
Principal District Judge, Coimbatore, as could be seen from the typed sets annexed here which is
also not disputed, same was dismissed as not pressed. Filing of the suit to frame scheme itself
suppressed in the private complaint. It is also to be noted that one another suit filed to frame
scheme was filed by Mrs.Jeyashree Jayanth, W/o.Jayanth Balakrishnan argued was pending before
Coimbatore Principal District Court in the above proceedings. The respondent Society has filed
petition in I.A.No.540 of 2016 for impleading them as parties which was dismissed by the learned
Principal District Judge after full contest on 24/4/2019. Court has recorded the finding that above
petition was filed only to drag on the petition filed by the wife of Jayanth Balakrishnan. Thereafter,
Leave Application was filed to frame Scheme in I.A.No.2199 of 2011 in OS.C.F.R.No.26116 of 2011
was dismissed by Principal District Judge, holding that there was a long standing dispute between
third petitioner, thereon, viz., daughter of second accused (father) only with a view to score out her
personal vengeance only above petition has been filed. Besides, Court also recorded finding that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177458629/ 6
Unknown vs P.P.Sivaswamy on 30 November, 2021
Trust is first accused is doing charity in consonance with the object of the Trust. Accordingly,
dismissed leave Application. The party-in-person who argued on Page No:13/23
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and behalf of the respondent Society now claims to be the
President of Society and was authorised to appear on behalf of Society. The fact remains that he is
none other than son-in-law of Managing Trustee N.Krishnasamy second accused. Against whom his
wife Jayshree Balakrishnan has filed Civil Suit as Trust O.P., all went against her. In fact, one such
Civil Suit went upto the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.L.P.Nos.15105 and 15106 which were also
dismissed against her.
17. From these facts, it is very clear that the present private complaint is the brain child of the
daughter and son-in-law who lost the battle in civil proceedings against A.2 Krishnaswamy. It is also
to be noted that even assuming that there was any violation in the administration of the Trust
property, the proper remedy is to set right the same in suit being filed under Section 92 of the Code
of Civil Procedure. Even when the suits are filed for the interest of the Trusts, when the Court finds
that such litigation is only to vindicate the personal rights, the Court would not permit such
litigation and leave normally would be rejected on the threshold. Therefore, having lost all the civil
litigations, the respondent now wants to achieve, what could not be Page No:14/23
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and achieved in Civil Suit, by way of a criminal prosecution, by
instituting the complaint before the Magistrate Court, implicating the entire family members even
not sparing the bank officials.
18. It is relevant to note that the trust deed itself authorizes the trustees to deal with the property
and mode of sale is provided in the deed itself. Therefore, at no stretch of imagination those sales
which impugned and challenged almost after three or four decades could be construed as an offence,
particularly, Civil Court itself recorded the finding that Trust is doing its charitable activities in
consonance with the object of the Trust.
19. Complaint runs to about several pages. The entire complaint itself indicate that the main
grievance of the parties, viz., defacto complainant is to take over the Trust. Introducing the
ingredients to fit into the offence to give criminal colour is not an easy task to the persons who
wanted to wreck vengeance against family members due to acrimonial atmosphere prevailing
between them in view of loosing final battle over valuable immovable properties. Merely because
some clever averments have been made, so as to Page No:15/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
and attract the criminal colour, which does not mean that such complaints should reach its logical
end and people should face the ordeal of trial and harassment in criminal trial.
20. From the facts narrated, this Court satisfies itself that initiation of entire prosecution is nothing
but motivated and initiated only with a motive to vindicate personal rights of daughter and
son-in-law as against A.2 in that process also the other accused made as an accused. When the
entire criminal prosecution is a result of malafide only in order to wreck vengeance on the accused
and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge, same has to be nibbed in the bud.
21. In 1992 SUPP (1) SUPREME COURT CASES – 335 STATE OF HARYANA AND OTHERS Vs.
BHAJAN LAL AND OTHERS, the Hon'ble Apex Court has set out the following guidelines for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177458629/ 7
Unknown vs P.P.Sivaswamy on 30 November, 2021
quashing the complaint.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they Page No:16/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and are taken at their face
value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make
out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or Page No:17/23
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge.”
22. In Satish Mehru Vs. State (N.C.T of Delhi) and another 2012 (13) SCC 614 -, the Hon'ble Apex
Court in para 21 has held as follows:-
Page No:18/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and “A Criminal trial Court cannot
be allowed to assume the character of fishing and roving enquiry. It would not be
permissible in law to permit a prosecution to linger, limp and continue on the basis of
a mere hope and expectation that in the trial some material may be found to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177458629/ 8
Unknown vs P.P.Sivaswamy on 30 November, 2021
implicate and the accused. Such a course of action is not contemplated in the system
of criminal jurisprudence that has evolved by the Courts over the years. A criminal
trial, on the contrary is contemplated only on defiinte allegation, prima facie,
establishing the commission of offence by the accused which fact has to be proved by
leading unimpeachable and acceptable evidence in the course of trial against accused.
23. Therefore, this Court is of the view that what could not be achieved in civil proceedings cannot
be permitted to be achieved in criminal proceedings. If such thing is allowed, it may even amount to
over turn the Page No:19/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court where civil litigation fought for property reached finality.
24. From the materials available on record, this Court is also placed on the records the conduct of
party-in-person in the matter. He has filed memo before the Court on 29/9/2021 claims to be the
degree holder in L.L.M.FICA and President of respondent Society. The tenor of language used in
memo indicate that he is bent upon making accusation against Principal District Judge, who
dismissed petition seeking leave to file suit to frame scheme. Further written submission filed before
the Court also indicate that he has targeted predecessor Judge for his question as to the locus of
party-in-person. Similarly, he has not spared the other side lawyers who conducted all civil litigation
against his wife and made several accusations without any basis. Tenor of language and accusation
against Judges and other side lawyer is highly deprecated. This Court hope that such thing will not
recur hereafter.
25. Though several authorities have been cited by the Party-in-Person, Page No:20/23
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and much emphasis was made on the decision reported in
A.R.Antulay Vs. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak and Ors AIR 1984 SC 718, wherein it is held that
punishment of the offender in the interest of Society being one of the objects behind penal statutes
enacted for larger good of the Society, right to initiate proceedings cannot be whittled down,
circumscribed or fettered by putting it into a strait-jacket formula of locus standi unknown to
criminal jurisprudence, save and except specific statutory exception. Further, there is no dispute to
the proposition laid down in several authorities relied on by him before the Court. But the fact
remains that this Court satisfies itself the entire prosecution is initiated in order to wreck vengeance
against Trust member due to civil disputes.
26. Learned Judicial Magistrate also mechanically took cognisance of the private complaint merely
on the sworn statement without application of mind. Taking cognisance mechanically makes it clear
that the learned Magistrate abdicated his judicial duties and issued summons to all the accused Page
No:21/23 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and to face the harassment and to undergo the ordeal of
criminal trial.
27. In view of the above, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed. C.C.No.38 of 2017, pending on
the file of the Judicial Magistrate, Mettupalayam, is quashed. Consequently, connected Criminal
Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
