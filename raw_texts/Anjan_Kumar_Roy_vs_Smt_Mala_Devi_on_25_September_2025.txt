learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Bhagalpur in
Matrimonial Case No. 12 of 2008, whereby the petition

1955 is that marriage of the appellant with the respondent
was solemnized on 29.06.2006 according to the Hindu
rights and rituals and after marriage the respondent came at
her Sasural and stayed there for about a week and
thereafter, her brother came and took her to her parents'
house. During her stay, the appellant tried to cohibit with
her but she frequently denied. After staying for sometimes,
the respondent-wife returned to her Sasural. The appellant
again tried to establish physical relation with the respondent
but due to similar type of excuse by her, the physical
relationship could not be established. The appellant, time
and again, tried to cohibit with the respondent, but every
time, she denied to cohibit with him, as a result of which,
the appellant could not establish physical relation with the
respondent even a single time. Hence, the appellant claimed
that the marriage cold not be consummated owing to the
impotency of the respondent. The respondent has been
exercising frequent mental as well as physical cruelty
against the appellant and other in-laws family members
since 30-06-2006.
4. The respondent has completely failed to

discharge her matrimonial obligation towards her husband

and other in-laws members. The actions/misdeeds of the
appellant have caused great torture and harassment in the
mind of the appellant. This causes enormous pain and grief
in the mind of the appellant. The appellant, therefore prayed
to annul the marriage by a decree of nullity of marriage.
5. After filing of the Matrimonial Case, summons
were issued to the opposite party/respondent. She appeared
and filed her written statement in which she has stated that
all the allegations made by the appellant against the conduct
and behaviour of the respondent was false and it has been
averred that the respondent was mentally and physically
tortured by the appellant for non-fulfillment of dowry
demand for which the respondent-wife has filed Complaint
Case No. 2231 of 2008 against the appellant and other in-
laws family members. Thereafter, this Divorce case is said
to have been filed on false and concocted grounds only to
oust the respondent from the matrimonial life of the
appellant. The respondent, therefore, prayed that divorce
petition filed by the appellant is fit to be dismissed.
6. After framing of the issue and material

evidences available on record, learned Principal Judge,
Family Court, Bhagalpur held that the appellant-husband
has failed to prove his case. Accordingly, the divorce
petition was dismissed. The appellant-husband, being

aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned Family Court

herself), O.P. W-2 Pankaj Kumar Singh (brother of the
respondent), O.P.W. 3 Bipin Kumar Roy.
10. Learned counsel for the appellant-husband
submits that the learned Family Court has erred in law and
facts both in dismissing the divorce petition filed by the
appellant-husband. Learned counsel has further submitted
that the impugned order has been passed without
considering the evidences as well as material fact produced
by the appellant and it was supported by a Medical expert
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114717328/ 4
Anjan Kumar Roy vs Smt. Mala Devi on 25 September, 2025
as well as pathological reports. The respondent-wife as well
as her family members have concealed this fact that
respondent is a barren woman and she cannot perform
matrimonial obligation with any person.
11. It is submitted by learned counsel for the
respondent that learned Family Court has rightly
appreciated the materials available on record and dismissed
the divorce petition filed on behalf of the appellant. The
respondent further submitted that appellant and other in-
laws family members, soon after the marriage, started
torturing the respondent-wife for non-fulfillment of dowry
demand. The respondent and her family members made all

efforts to fulfill their demands but when their greediness
started increasing day by day, the respondent has filed
Complaint Case No. 2231 of 2008 against the appellant and
other in-laws family members. Thereafter, in order to put
pressure upon the respondent, the present divorce petition
was filed on behalf of the appellant-husband. It is further
submitted that appellant has performed second marriage and
there is a child out of the second marriage.
12. We have heard learned counsel for the
appellant as well respondent and perused the concerned
record of Family Court as well as the impugned judgment.
13. Before we part with, it is relevant to extract

Anjan Kumar Roy vs Smt. Mala Devi on 25 September, 2025
Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act which is reproduced
hereinbelow:-
"12. Voidable marriages.-(1) Any marriage
solemnized, whether before or after the
commencement of this Act, shall be voidable
and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on
any of the following grounds, namely:-
(a) that the marriage has not been
consummated owing to the impotence of the
respondent; or
(b) that the marriage is in contravention of
Patna High Court MA No.778 of 2019 dt.25-09-2025
7/10
the condition specified in clause (ii) of section
5; or
(c) that the consent of the petitioner, or
where the consent of the guardian in marriage
of the petitioner "[was required under section 5,
as it stood immediately before the
commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint
(Amendment) Act, 1978], the consent of such
guardian was obtained by force [ or by fraud as
to the nature of the ceremony or as to any
material fact or circumstance concerning the
respondent]; or
(d) that the respondent was at the time of
the marriage pregnant by some person other
than the petitioner.
2) Notwithstanding anything contained in
sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a
marriage-
(a) on the ground specified in clause (c) of
sub-section (1), shall be entertained if-
(i) the petition is presented more than one
year after the force had ceased to operate or, as
the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;
or
(ii) the petitioner has, with his or her full
consent, lived with the other party to the
marriage as husband or wife after the force had
ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the
fraud had been discovered;
(b) on the ground specified in clause (d) of
Patna High Court MA No.778 of 2019 dt.25-09-2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114717328/ 6

sub-section (1), shall be entertained unless the
Court is satisfied-
(i) that the petitioner was at the time of the
marriage ignorant of the facts alleged;
(ii) that proceedings have been instituted in
the case of a marriage solemnized before the
commencement of this Act within one year of
such commencement and in the case of
marriages solemnized after such
commencement within one year from the date of
the marriage; and
(iii) that marital intercourse with the
consent of the petitioner has not taken place
since the discovery by the petitioner of the
existence of [the said ground)."
14. From perusal of the case records, it appears
that the divorce petition has been filed only on the ground
of infertility (barrenness) of the respondent-wife and in
order to prove his case, the appellant has also exhibited
some documentary evidences. The O.P.W. 3 has clearly
stated in his evidence that respondent-wife has been living
at her parents' house since 2008. The brother of the
respondent, who has been examined as O.P.W 2 has also
claimed that appellant has performed second marriage with

one Kajal Devi without divorce to his first wife
(respondent) and a child was also born out of the second
marriage.
15. The learned Principal Judge, Family Court, did
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114717328/ 7
Anjan Kumar Roy vs Smt. Mala Devi on 25 September, 2025
not take a pain to examine those facts and the materials
exhibited on behalf of the appellant-husband regarding their
genuineness/authentication and concentrated its findings
only on the fact that barrenness is not a ground for taking
divorce within the purview of Hindu Marriage Act. The
learned Family Court ought to have examined these
material facts before coming to any conclusion.
16. In the impugned judgment, it was held by the
learned Principal Judge that Exhibits 1 to 5 which are
medical prescriptions, Ultrasound report and Pathological
reports from which it is not clear that whether the opposite
party was Barrenness or not ?. And no any conclusive proof
of Barrenness of opposite party is on the record.
17. The learned counsel for the appellant has
further argued that the appellant wants to produce the
concerned Doctor and Pathologist to get the reports legally
proved which were issued by them.

18. Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated
29.06.2019

19. The matter is remanded back to the Principal Judge, Family Court, Bhagalpur to decide the case
on merits after examining Exhibits 1 to 5 as exhibited by the appellant-husband in support of his
case and after granting opportunity to both the parties to adduce their evidences within a period of
three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. Parties are directed to co-operate in the
