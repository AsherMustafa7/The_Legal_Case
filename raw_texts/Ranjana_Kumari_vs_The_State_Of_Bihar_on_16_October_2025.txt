Ranjana Kumari vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
as contained in Memo No. 545 dated
22.10.2018
by which the Private
Respondent namely Nitish Kumar
Sharma has been selected for grant of license of Public Distribution System Shop for Rajopur
Panchayat under Dandari Block in the District of Begusarai against the General Vacancy.
(ii) For issuance of an
appropriate Writ in the nature of
Mandamus commanding the
Respondents to bring on record the said order of license granted in favour of the Respondent No. 6
and after production of the same, a writ in the nature of certiorari be issued quashing the same as
the decision taken by the selection committee for selection of the private respondent for PDS shop
against General category in Rajopur Panchayat under Dandari block in the district of Begusarai is
wholly illegal, arbitrary, in teeth of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
and ignoring the merit list.
(iii) For issuance of an
appropriate Writ in the nature of
Mandamus commanding the
Patna High Court CWJC No.17124 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 Respondents to produce the Merit list,
Publication List as prepared by the Respondents for selection of PDS shop against General category
in Rajopur Panchayat under Dandari block in the district of Begusarai.
(iv) For issuance of an
appropriate writ in the nature of
Mandamus commanding the
Respondents to grant license for Public Distribution Shop for Rajopur Panchayat under Dandarai
Block in the District of Begusarai in favour of the petitioner, as the petitioner is higher in the Merit
than the Respondent No. 6.
(v) For any other relief/s for which the petitioner is entitled in the eye of law in the facts and
circumstances of the case."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17124 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as
follows:

32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the issue
or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the license
may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of the order
and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal within a
period of sixty days.
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the
order under appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider
necessary for giving a reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4)
or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Patna High Court CWJC No.17124
of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 Commissioner. The revision shall be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17124 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within two months from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority
concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within three months from the date of filing of
the same.
7. With the above said observations, the Writ petition shall stand disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
