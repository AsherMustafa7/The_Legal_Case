DUE DATE WITH ALL CONSEQUENTIAL BENEFITS, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO EXTENSION OF PAY AND ARREARS OF PAY AND
ALL OTHER ALLOWANCES ON PAR WITH THE REGULAR
EMPLOYEES WORKING IN THE R2 UNIVERSITY.
THESE WRIT PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
The petitioners in the cluster of these petitions call in question an order dated 01-02-2016 which
denies the benefit of regularization to the petitioners and have consequentially sought a direction for
consideration of their claims for regularization. Since all the employees are working in different
Departments of the Bangalore University ('the University' for short) and the challenge and direction
sought being common, these petitions are taken up together and considered in this common order.
2. Adumbrated in brief, the factual background as projected by the petitioners are as follows:
Writ Petition No.9310 of 2016:
(a) The petitioners 20 in number were all appointed between 28-12-1996 and
09-06-2000 in a Group-D cadre. The qualifications that the petitioners possess range
from 6th standard to Graduation. These petitioners were appointed in the University
Library, Finance department, Hostels run by the University, Estate Section, Students
Welfare Department, Garden Section and in several other places. One Sri
H.B.Ramaswamy - petitioner No.7 discontinued and petitioner No.17 - Ramesha is
dead. Barring these two petitioners, all the other petitioners are working in the
University without any break from the dates of their initial engagement.
Writ Petition No.36565 of 2013:
(b) This petition consists of two employees who were engaged on 2-07-1998 and
1-01-1999 respectively as Group-D employees and are working in the services of the
University right from their initial engagement without any break and continued to
work in different departments even as on date.
Writ Petition No.22964 of 2015:
(c) This petition concerns with one employee. The petitioner in this writ petition was
appointed on 13-01-1998 as a Group-D employee. The petitioner does possess a
post-graduate qualification in Master of Arts. It is the claim of the University that the
petitioner worked from 13-01-1998 and his services are discontinued from
29-05-2019 after about 22 years of service.

Writ Petition No.16373 of 2016:
(d) This petition concerns 9 employees who were all appointed between 15-11-1996
and 1-08-1999. Two of the petitioners possess the qualification of M.Phil and post-
graduation in Master of Arts and others are 4th, 5th, 7th or 10th standard. All these petitioners
except one Sri Shankare Gowda.K.N. whom the University claims to have discharged are working
from the dates of their initial engagement and continued to work even as on date.
Writ Petition No.62411 of 2016:
(e) This petition concerns 14 employees who are all engaged between the dates
17-02-1997 and 2-11-1999 as Group-D employees. All the petitioners in this petition
are working without any break from the dates of their initial engagement and
continued to work even as on date in different Departments of the University and are
all qualified to work in Group-D cadre.
Writ Petition No.12439 of 2021:
(f) This petition concerns 5 employees engaged between the dates 02-10-1996 and
08-02-2000 in a Group-D cadre.
Petitioner No.5 possesses a post-graduation in Master of Arts. The petitioners are working in the
University without any break from the dates of their initial engagement and continued to work even
as on date in different Departments of the University.
3. All the petitioners thus, in terms of what is narrated hereinabove, have completed service in the
University ranging from 20 to 25 years and are all aged between 43 and 57 years. During subsistence
of engagement of their services, all the petitioners, most of whom had completed 10 years of service,
The Apex Court rendered its judgment in the case of SECRETARY, STATE OF KARNATAKA &
OTHERS v.
UMADEVI(3) & OTHERS1 on 10-04-2006. The entire spectrum of nuances of engagement to posts -
irregular, illegal or back door were all considered by the Apex Court and certain parameters for the
purpose of regularization of such employees were laid down. Certain proceedings also took place in
the respondent/University pursuant to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI.
The process of regularization was sought to be initiated by the University of several daily-wage and
monthly rated employees working in the University. The University made a proposal for release of
block grant from the hands of the Government towards regularization of 85 employees who had
completed 10 years of service as on 10-04-2006. The communication was made on 06-08-2007. On
receipt of the said letter, the State Government again directed furnishing of (2006) 4 SCC 1 complete
details regarding expenditure that would be incurred by the University for the proposed
regularization. In reply the University by its communication dated 14-11-2007 replied stating that
the expenditure for such regularization would be made out of regular grants received from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 17
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
Government. While doing so the University added 46 employees who were working on daily wages
wherein the names of some of the petitioners in these petitions also figure. By a communication
dated 15.03.2008 the Government accorded its approval for regularization of 85 persons who had
completed 10 years of service and not the remaining 46 persons who were included in the later
communication.
4. The aforesaid action resulted in another communication dated 08-04-2008 being sent to
Government seeking approval of regularization of 46 employees with 12 more who had completed 10
years of service by then. Pursuant to the approval accorded by resolution of the Syndicate dated
05-04-2008, 44 daily wage employees were regularized by order dated 11-04-2008. On 06-03-2010
the University again addressed a letter drawing the attention of Government that there were several
sanctioned posts in the University which needed to be filled up on immediate basis and sought
approval for regularization of 91 personnel working in the University who had by that time
completed requisite number of years of service for such regularization. The number was 91 which
included the petitioners in all these petitions. Representations from all these petitioners were being
submitted on regular basis seeking regularization from the hands of the University. The University,
on receipt of such representations, communicated on several occasions seeking approval for
regularization of the services of the petitioners in the light of the fact that they had by then
completed close to 15 years of service.
5. The State Government did not reply to those communications sent by the University but went on
seeking clarifications with regard to availability of posts and financial burden. On 23-12-2011 the
University brought to the notice of Government that about 197 posts of Group-D employees were
lying vacant which needed to be filled up in the light of increase of courses in the University. When
no action was taken upon correspondences between Government and the University, the petitioners
along with other similarly situated employees approached this Court in Writ Petition
Nos.35145-35210/2013 seeking a direction to the hands of the University to regularize their services.
By then, two other writ petitions were filed for similar reliefs. All the petitions were disposed of by
an order dated 28-04-2015 directing consideration of cases of the petitioners therein along with
other similarly situated employees in terms of the recommendation made by the University on
08.04.2008.
6. This decision led to certain correspondences between the University and the Government. What
was projected by the Government was financial burden of close to rupees one crore that would come
about for regularization of employees which included all the petitioners and the same should be
borne out by the University itself and no funds would be allotted by the State Government for
regularization. This communication led the University doing a volte-face. Recommendations for
regularization, communications for approval of regularization which were earlier sent by the
University were all given a go-bye and a direction was issued to the University to take action to
consider cases of the petitioners under the provisions of the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees
Welfare Act, 2012 and all other circulars prevailing at the relevant point of time. It is after this
communication, the University withdrew the earlier resolution of the Syndicate which had resolved
to regularize the services of the petitioners on 27.02.2016. It is the aforesaid action that is called in
question in all these writ petitions. Submissions of the petitioners:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 18
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
7. Heard the learned Senior Counsel Sri V.Lakshminarayana appearing for the petitioners in
W.P.No.36565 of 2013; learned counsel Sri D.R.Ravishankar appearing for the petitioners in
W.P.No.9310 of 2016; learned counsel Sri M.S.Bhagwat appearing for petitioners in W.P.No.62411
of 2016; learned counsel Sri Prithveesh M.K. appearing for the petitioners in W.P.No.12439 of 2021;
learned counsel Sri D. Ashwathappa representing the University in all these cases and the learned
Additional Government Advocate Smt.M.C.Nagashree appearing for the State.
8. The learned senior counsel Sri V. Lakshminarayana and all the aforementioned counsel would in
unison contend that the petitioners are entitled to be considered for regularization of their services
as the University has not once but close to eight times communicated to the State Government with
regard to the need of the petitioners and necessity for regularization of the services of the
petitioners. The learned senior counsel would further submit that identically placed employees who
were appointed as Computer Operators and Computer Programmers on daily wages have been
granted the benefit of regularization pursuant to an order passed by this Court in Writ Petition
No.9959/2011 and on parity seeks that the petitioners also ought to have been regularized, more so,
in the light of the fact that the order in Writ Petition No.9959/2011 has been affirmed by the
Division Bench and has attained finality.
9. The other respective learned counsel representing the petitioners in all the other petitions would
submit that the University having utilized the services of the petitioners for close to 20 to 24 years
cannot now turn its blind eye towards the claim of the petitioners for regularization. They would
emphasize on the fact that it is not the University that wants to deny the benefit of regularization but
the direction of the State Government that the University has to bear financial burden which has led
to the denial of such claim of the petitioners.
10. All of them, in unison, would again contend that financial burden can hardly be a circumstance
that can deny the petitioners benefit of regularization of their services that too on the direction of
the State Government which has no jurisdiction to interfere with the affairs of the University, as the
University is an autonomous body which has to take its own decisions in administrative matters.
Submissions of the University:
11. The learned counsel representing the University Sri D. Ashwathappa would vehemently refute all
these submissions and would strenuously contend that the petitioners are all back- door entrants
and they are all illegal appointees. Merely because they have served the University for over 20 to 24
years, that will not give them any benefit of claim for regularization, unless they are appointed
against sanctioned vacant posts at the outset. He would submit that the petitioners at best could be
considered under the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012 and on coming into force
of the said Act the claim of the petitioners for regularization would cease to operate, but would
admit that the University needs their services and had accordingly communicated to the
Government on several occasions seeking regularization of services of the petitioners.
12. In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that the case of the petitioners for
regularization by the University is not effaced even as on date, as in the year 2019 the University has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 19
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
again communicated to the Government seeking regularization of services of the petitioners. In this
regard a communication is also sent on 12-09-2019 during the pendency of these petitions.
Therefore, the submission of the University that the petitioners are not entitled to claim
regularization is contrary to records.
Submissions of the State:
13. The learned Additional Government Advocate would toe the lines of the learned counsel for the
University and would add that the petitioners have no right to seek regularization once the
Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012 has been brought into force. The case of the
petitioners can only be considered under the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012,
that too if they fulfill the conditions stipulated under the provisions of the Act. Both the learned
Counsel would refer to the latest judgment of the Apex Court in the case of UNION OF INDIA &
OTHERS v. ILMODEVI AND ANOTHER.
14. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the learned senior counsel
and the other respective learned counsel for the parties and have perused the material on record. In
furtherance whereof, the issue that requires consideration is, whether in the facts of the case on
hand the petitioners would be entitled to claim consideration of their cases for regularisation?
Consideration:
15. The afore-quoted facts, dates of engagement of the services of the petitioners, communications
and correspondences exchanged between the University and the State Government are not in
dispute and are, therefore, not reiterated. The issue that needs to be considered in the cases at hand
is, whether petitioners are entitled to seek regularization of their services in the teeth of judgments
rendered by the Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI (supra) and later judgments. The dates of
engagement of the petitioners begin close to 24 years ago. The Apex Court rendered its judgment in
the case of UMADEVI (supra) on 10-04-2006. It is germane to notice paragraph 53 of the said
judgment and it reads as follows:
"53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where irregular
appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1
SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N. Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR
799] and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937]
and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant
posts might have been made and the employees have continued to work for ten years
or more but without the intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The
question of regularisation of the services of such employees may have to be
considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the cases
above referred to and in the light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of
India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to
regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who
have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of
orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure that regular
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 20
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be
filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now
employed. The process must be set in motion within six months from this date. We
also clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice, need not be
reopened based on this judgment, but there should be no further by passing of the
constitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent, those not duly
appointed as per the constitutional scheme."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court in the afore-quoted judgment devised illegal and irregular
appointments and directed that illegal appointments cannot be regularised while irregular
appointments can be regularised. Four conditions that can be discerned from paragraph 53 (supra)
are that employment of the petitioners should be against a vacant post. The employees should
possess the requisite qualification and should have completed 10 years of service as on 10.04.2006
and continuation of the petitioners in employment should not be litigious. The communications of
the University begins after the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI.
Those communications are germane to be noticed. The University on 06-08-2007 communicates to
the Government with regard to employees working in various Departments of the University and
their entitlement for regularization and seeks release of block grant for consideration of cases of
such employees for regularization. The communication dated 06.08.2007 reads as follows:

"Shri K.Narahari, Syndicate Member and also the Chairman of the Sub-Committee
which has submitted a report in this regard, explained that the Sub-Committee had
recommended that 87 persons who are employed on daily wages could be regularized
by creating supernumerary posts. Before doing so, once again the Registrar
(academic) will have to get the certificates from all concerned Heads of Departments
in respect of each of these 87 daily wagers who have put in 10 years of continuous
service.
After detailed discussion, the Syndicate directed that individual files of each of the 87
persons should be operated by the Establishment Section, which contains the order
of initial appointment, renewal of temporary terms ever year, acquittance rolls for
payments made to them through bank and or through cash registers in the hostels
etc., These have to be verified individually to see that they have put in 10 years of
continuous service subject to certification by the concerned HOD about the fact of
having completed 10 years satisfactory service for this purpose. When the individual
files get completed candidate-wise, it can be put up by the Establishment Section for
approval by the Registrar/Vice-Chancellor and orders will be placed for those
candidates who complete the criteria, before the next Syndicate meeting.
Further, with regard to the Sub-Committee's inference that in respect of the daily
wagers who have put in less than 10 years of service, their services will have to be
terminated as per the 'Supreme Court's decision etc., The Syndicate resolved that
decision will be taken only after finalization of these 87 cases."

"2. as regards various other posts sanctioned from time to time and the vacancies
remaining unfilled so far, the University should take most expeditious action to fill
them up by following the prescribed rules of recruitment strictly in accordance with
directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.
3. In case the University administration were to find it difficult to create those many
supernumerary posts to regularize the 87 persons who have reported have completed
10 years of service, the Committee suggests that the matter be left to the Syndicate to
decide, if necessary with the previous approval of the Government.
4. the Committee is given to understand that there are a number of other daily
wagers who have put in less than 10 years of service. Their number is also quite
substantial. However, since as per the judgment of the Supreme Court only such of
those persons who have put in 10 years of continuous service as daily wagers is to be
considered for regularization, the Committee infers that their services will have to be
terminated, OR in the laternative, such cases may be referred to the Government for
seeking further directions from the Government as to what decision is to b taken to
regularize their services or to terminate their services. However, when Direct
Recruitments are made for the vacant posts which are intended to be recruited by due
process of law, such persons who have got the necessary qualification and experience
among these daily wages who have put in less than 10 years of experience may be
given a chance o complete with relaxation o age in appointment while they apply
against notified vacancies. These details will have to be worked out by the
administrative wing of the University."

The figure sought in this communication was increased from 91 to 99. This communication was in
the light of 197 posts of Group-D employees remaining vacant in the University. No orders of
regularization were passed in their cases. This led to writ petitions being filed before this Court. All
the employees who claim to be working as Computer Operators and Computer Programmers
approached this Court in Writ Petition Nos.9959- 9960 of 2011. This Court by its order dated
24-05-2012 allowed the writ petitions and directed the University to regularize the services of the
petitioners therein. The order passed by this Court reads as follows:
"11. In identical circumstances, in respect of two employees by name Govindappa and
Nagaraju in the respondent University, this court in W.P.No.8300/2002 vide order
dated 15.9.2006 held that when an employee worked in a particular category and if
he possess the requisite qualification and experience then he is to be regularised in
that category. In implementation of the order of this court in W.P.No.8300/2002, the
respondent University regularised the services of two employees in Group - C. Then
there is no justification for the respondent University to deny the identical benefit to
the petitioners herein. Even on this ground the petitioners are entitled for
regularisation in the cadre of Group - C.
12. The contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that they are entitled for
regularisation with effect from their initial entry into service in the year 1994 is not
acceptable to me. Though the petitioners entered services as temporary employees in
the year 1994, their services came to be regularised on 11.04.2008 as per Annexure -
F. The subsequent correspondence between the petitioners and the respondent
University was only with regard to the regularisation in Group - C cadre. Petitioners
have not agitated the grievance relating to retrospective regularisation. At this length
of time, it will be too harsh on the respondent University to give effect to ther
retrospective regularisation. Therefore I decline to extend the benefit of retrospective
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 29
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
regularisation to the petitioners.
For the reasons stated above, the following:
ORDER i. Writ petitions are hereby allowed.
ii. The impugned endorsements dated 3/8.2.2011, Annexures - T and U issued by the
first respondents are hereby quashed.
iii. It is declared that petitioners are entitled to be regularised in Group - C cadre as
computer operator and computer programmer w.e.f.11.04.2008 and to extend the
consequential benefits to them as expeditiously as possible and in any event not later
than three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
iv. Ordered accordingly."
The said decision was called in question by the University before the Division Bench in Writ Appeal
No.5577/2012 & connected case which also came to be dismissed by order of the Division Bench
dated 01-04-2013. The Division Bench observes as follows while declining to entertain the writ
appeal:
"4. Firstly, in identical circumstances, other employees who were similarly situated
were granted the relief of regularisation in Group-C category. Reference was made to
the order passed in W.P.No.8300/2002, wherein the respondent-University has
regularised the services of the other employees in Group-C category and on the
ground of parity, the petitioners would be entitled for the same relief. However, in
the statement of objections filed by the respondents, they have specifically stated that
regularizing the services of all the temporary employees was from the date of their
initial appointment. However, so far as the respondents 1 and 2 are concerned, the
regularization was from the date of regularization of their services as Group-D
employees.
5. Under these circumstances, we are of the considered view that there is no error
committed by the learned single Judge which calls for interference. Respondents 1
and 2 have been working in the same category ever since the date of appointment
without any break. It is not in dispute that the computer operator and computer
programmer would not come under Group-D category. They would come under
Group-C category. Therefore, the respondents 1 and 2 are entitled for regularization
in Group-C category.
6. In this view of the matter, there is no ground to entertain the appeals.
Consequently, the appeals being devoid of merit, are dismissed."

Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
The services of the petitioners therein were regularised. Another set of writ petitions were filed by
few of the petitioners in these petitions in W.P.Nos.35145-35210/2013 which came to be disposed of
by an order of this Court dated 28-04-2015 by the following order:
"The case of the petitioner is that they have been working as Group C and D
employees in the cadre of First Division Assistants, Second Division Assistants,
Managers and Supervisors in Hostels, Library Assistants, Drivers, Cooks, Attendants
and Peons in the Bangalore University and have put in not more than ten years of
service.13 It is specifically contended that all the petitioners have been given
appointment or had been engaged against sanctioned posts.
Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that after the decision of the Apex
Court in the case of State of Karnataka & Ors Vs Umadevi - (2006) 4 SCC 1, their
cases for regularization were considered by the University in terms of paragraph 53 of
the said judgment. As the petitioners were all found to be duly qualified and working
against duly sanctioned posts, the University after considering the cases of the
petitioners along with other similarly situated employees, on 4.8.2008, forwarded a
list of 112 employees (including all the 66 petitioners) who all had put in at least 10
years of service to the State Government seeking approval for regularization. When
no orders were passed on the said recommendation made by the University to the
State Government, the petitioners have filed these writ petitions with a prayer for
regularization in service of the respondent University.
Despite time having been granted to the learned counsel for the State on several
occasions, he states that he has not received instructions even though communication
has been sent to respondent No.1. Learned counsel for respondents 2 to 4 supports
the case of the petitioners to the extent that the University had made
recommendation for regularization of the petitioners.
In my view, no useful purpose will be served by keeping these writ petitions pending
any further as the State Government has yet to take a decision on the
recommendation made by the University on 8.4.2008 with regard to regularization of
the petitioners along with other similarly situate employees.
In such view of the matter, without going into the merits of the claim of the
petitioners, I dispose of these writ petitions, with a direction that the cases of the
petitioners for regularization be considered and decided by the State Government on
the basis of the recommendation made by the University on 8.4.2008, in accordance
with law, by a reasoned and speaking order, as expeditiously as possible, but not later
than three months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order along with
the copy of the copy of the communication dated 8.4.2008 made by the University to
the State Government. Learned counsel for the petitioners states that the case of the
petitioners would be covered by the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Malathi
Das (Retd.) now P B Mahishy & Ors Vs Suresh & Ors - Civil Appeal 3338/2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 31
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
decided on 7.3.2014 as well as the Division Bench of this Court in the case of C G
Jagadeesh Vs State of Karnataka - WP 54284/2013 decided on 23.4.2014. While
deciding the cases of the petitioners, the Officer of the State Government shall
consider these decisions, copies of which shall also be provided by the petitioners.
With the aforesaid observations and direction, these petitions stand disposed of."
This Court while disposing of the aforesaid writ petitions directed the respondents to consider
recommendations dated 08.04.2008 which contained the names of the petitioners in these writ
petitions. Again correspondences between the University and the Government continued after
disposal of the writ petitions as aforesaid. The Syndicate of the University met to consider cases of
the petitioners. This was in the wake of telephonic instructions given by the State Government to
consider cases of the petitioners under the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012.
This resolution of the Syndicate dated 28-04-2015 reads as follows:
"Item No.: To consider Order dated 28.04.2015 of the Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka in Writ Petition No.35210/2013 (S-Res), filed by 66 Consolidated Wages
-regarding.
AGENDA NOTE:
The above matter was placed before the Syndicate in its meeting held on 29th
December, 2015. The Syndicate resolved to approve the regularization of 66 daily
wage employees in Group - D posts. However, before implementing the resolution of
the Syndicate, the Additional Chief Secretary to Govt., Higher Education Department
has telephoned the Vice Chancellor on the evening of 30th December 2015 saying
that while implementing the Government's letter dated 25/11/2015, the University
should not use the word 'regularization' or 'permanent' and the University should
issue orders in terms of The Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012 (
Karnataka Act No.19 of 2013). This Act contemplates, inter- alia, that "...the daily
wage employees in the establishments whose names are notified by the Government
under this Act, shall be continued on daily wage basis till they complete the age of
sixty years. ...The pay of a daily wage employee shall be the minimum of the time
scale of pay of the posts in which he is continued in service. He shall also be paid
admissible Dearness Allowance and House Rent Allowance as may be determined by
the Government by order, from time to time. A daily wage employee shall be entitled
for all General Holidays, Casual Leave of fifteen days and Earned Leave of thirty days
per year. A daily wage employee may be given an increase in his pay at such interval
of time as may be determined by the Government, by order. ... The Daily Wage
Employee shall be entitled for such terminal benefits or ex-gratia, on his
discontinuous after attaining the age of Sixty years, as may be determined and
notified by the Government from time to time."

Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
Sensing this, the daily wage employees resorted to strike, sat Dharana in the Vice Chancellor's room
on 31st December 2015 and protested against the move of the University to follow the instructions of
the Addl. Chief Secretary and demanded regularization of the services of these employees in terms
of the Hon'ble High Court order dated 28th April 2015.
In the light of this, Vice-Chancellor has addressed a letter on 31.12.2015 seeking specific clarification
from the State Government in this matter.
Copies of the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012 and the letter of the
Vice-Chancellor addressed to the Addl. Chief Secretary to Government, Higher Education
Department, are attached this note for perusal of the Syndicate.
The matter is placed before the Syndicate for kind consideration.

(Emphasis added) Therefore, what would unmistakably emerge from the afore- quoted
communications and the recommendations upto 2019 and particularly of 2019 is that the University
recognizes their services rendered for close to 2 decades on the basis of need in the University and
also acknowledges their claim for regularization. It is the financial burden that becomes the bone of
contention with the State Government. The University who had time and again communicated that
it would bear financial burden out of the grants given by the State Government also does a
volte-face. Therefore, the entitlement of the petitioners in the teeth of the judgments rendered by
the Apex Court is required to be considered. The afore-narrated communications being facts, and
the facts being stubborn, only the law is required to be noticed.
UMADEVI and its aftermath:
17. As observed hereinabove, the Apex Court rendered its judgment in the case of
UMADEVI on 10-04-2006. Relevant paragraphs are already quoted hereinabove.
Subsequent to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI, considering
the case of UMADEVI the Apex Court in several judgments held and affirmed the
right of several employees for regularization under several circumstances. The Apex
Court in the case of NARENDRA KUMAR TIWARI v. STATE OF JHARKHAND2,
holds as follows:
"7. The purpose and intent of the decision in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.
Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] was therefore twofold, namely, to
prevent irregular or illegal appointments in the future and secondly, to confer a
benefit on those who had been irregularly appointed in the past. The fact that the
State of Jharkhand continued with the irregular appointments for almost a decade
after the decision in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1:
2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is a clear indication that it believes that it was all right to
continue with irregular appointments, and whenever required, terminate the services
of the irregularly appointed employees on the ground that they were irregularly
appointed. This is nothing but a form of exploitation of the employees by not giving
them the benefits of regularisation and by placing (2018) 8 SCC 238 the sword of
Damocles over their head. This is precisely what Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.
Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and Kesari [State of Karnataka v.
M.L. Kesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247: (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] sought to avoid.
8. If a strict and literal interpretation, forgetting the spirit of the decision of the
Constitution Bench in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC
1:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 37
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
2006 SCC (L&S) 753], is to be taken into consideration then no irregularly appointed
employee of the State of Jharkhand could ever be regularised since that State came
into existence only on 15-11-2000 and the cut-off date was fixed as 10-4-2006. In
other words, in this manner the pernicious practice of indefinitely continuing
irregularly appointed employees would be perpetuated contrary to the intent of the
Constitution Bench.
9. The High Court as well as the State of Jharkhand ought to have considered the entire issue in a
contextual perspective and not only from the point of view of the interest of the State, financial or
otherwise - the interest of the employees is also required to be kept in mind. What has eventually
been achieved by the State of Jharkhand is to short circuit the process of regular appointments and
instead make appointments on an irregular basis. This is hardly good governance.
10. Under the circumstances, we are of the view that the Regularisation Rules must be given a
pragmatic interpretation and the appellants, if they have completed 10 years of service on the date of
promulgation of the Regularisation Rules, ought to be given the benefit of the service rendered by
them. If they have completed 10 years of service they should be regularised unless there is some
valid objection to their regularisation like misconduct, etc.
11. The impugned judgment and order [Anil Kumar Sinha v. State of Jharkhand, 2016 SCC
OnLineJhar 2904] passed by the High Court is set aside in view of our conclusions. The State should
take a decision within four months from today on regularisation of the status of the appellants. The
appeals are accordingly disposed of."
(Emphasis supplied) Later, the Apex Court in the case of SHEO NARAIN NAGAR v. STATE OF
U.P.3, holds as follows:
"6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has relied upon para
44 of the decision in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC
1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753], so as to contend that it was not the case of irregular
appointment but of illegal appointment; there was no post available on which the
services of the appellants could have been regularised and appointment were in
contravention of the reservation policy also; thus, termination order was rightly
issued and, in no case, the appellants were entitled for regularisation of their services.
7. When we consider the prevailing scenario, it is painful to note that the decision in
Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S)
753] has not been properly understood and rather wrongly applied by various State
Governments. We have called for the data in the instant case to ensure as to how
many employees were working on contract basis or ad hoc basis or daily-wage basis
in different State departments. We can take judicial notice that widely aforesaid
practice is being continued. Though this Court has emphasised that incumbents
should be appointed on regular basis as per rules but new devise of making
appointment on contract basis has been adopted, employment is offered on daily-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 38
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
(2018) 13 SCC 432 wage basis, etc. in exploitative forms. This situation was not
envisaged by Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006
SCC (L&S) 753]. The prime intendment of the decision was that the employment
process should be by fair means and not by back door entry and in the available pay
scale. That spirit of the Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi(3), (2006) 4 SCC
1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has been ignored and conveniently overlooked by various
State Governments/authorities. We regretfully make the observation that Umadevi
(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has not
been implemented in its true spirit and has not been followed in its pith and
substance. It is being used only as a tool for not regularising the services of
incumbents. They are being continued in service without payment of due salary for
which they are entitled on the basis of Articles 14, 16 read with Article 34(1)(d) of the
Constitution of India as if they have no constitutional protection as envisaged in D.S.
Nakara v. Union of India [D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, (1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983 SCC
(L&S) 145 : AIR 1983 SC 130] , from cradle to grave. In heydays of life they are
serving on exploitative terms with no guarantee of livelihood to be continued and in
old age they are going to be destituted, there being no provision for pension, retiral
benefits, etc. There is clear contravention of constitutional provisions and aspiration
of downtrodden class. They do have equal rights and to make them equals they
require protection and cannot be dealt with arbitrarily. The kind of treatment meted
out is not only bad but equally unconstitutional and is denial of rights. We have to
strike a balance to really implement the ideology of Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka
v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . Thus, the time has come to
stop the situation where Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4
SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] can be permitted to be flouted, whereas, this Court has
interdicted such employment way back in the year 2006. The employment cannot be
on exploitative terms, whereas Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3),
(2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] laid down that there should not be back door
entry and every post should be filled by regular employment, but a new device has
been adopted for making appointment on payment of paltry system on contract/ad
hoc basis or otherwise. This kind of action is not permissible when we consider the
pith and substance of true spirit in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3),
(2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753].
8. Coming to the facts of the instant case, there was a direction issued way back in the
year 1999, to consider the regularisation of the appellants. However, regularisation
was not done. The respondents chose to give minimum of the pay scale, which was
available to the regular employees, way back in the year 2000 and by passing an
order, the appellants were also conferred temporary status in the year 2006, with
retrospective effect on 2-10-2002. As the respondents have themselves chosen to
confer a temporary status to the employees, as such there was requirement at work
and posts were also available at the particular point of time when order was passed.
Thus, the submission raised by the learned counsel for the respondent that posts
were not available, is belied by their own action. Obviously, the order was passed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 39
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
considering the long period of services rendered by the appellants, which were taken
on exploitative terms.
9. The High Court dismissed the writ application relying on the decision in Umadevi
(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. But
the appellants were employed basically in the year 1993; they had rendered service
for three years, when they were offered the service on contract basis; it was not the
case of back door entry; and there were no Rules in place for offering such kind of
appointment. Thus, the appointment could not be said to be illegal and in
contravention of Rules, as there were no such Rules available at the relevant point of
time, when their temporary status was conferred w.e.f. 2-10-2002. The appellants
were required to be appointed on regular basis as a one- time measure, as laid down
in para 53 of Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006
SCC (L&S) 753] . Since the appellants had completed 10 years of service and
temporary status had been given by the respondents with retrospective effect from
2-10-2002, we direct that the services of the appellants be regularised from the said
date i.e. 2.10.2002, consequential benefits and the arrears of pay also to be paid to
the appellants within a period of three months from today."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court in the case of CHANDER MOHAN NEGI v. STATE OF H.P.4,
holds as follows:
"11. At the outset, it is to be noted that the schemes in question were notified in the
years 2001 and 2003 under which appointments were made with regard to Primary
Assistant Teachers and Teachers in other categories. At the relevant point of time,
nobody has questioned either the schemes or the appointments. It is the specific case
of the respondent State that such appointments have not affected the writ petitioners
and the Department was not in a position to leave the schools, Teachers deficient for
long since it would have affected the studies of the students very badly. Therefore, it
was the case of the State that Teachers had been appointed under various schemes at
that point of time and such appointments have been made up to the year 2007 and
(2020)5 SCC 732 have no impact on the appellants since they have completed their
two-year JBT training in the year 2011. As is evident from the order [Pankaj Kumar v.
State of H.P., 2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944] under appeal passed by the Division Bench
of the High Court, the appellant-writ petitioners have not even chosen to file
rejoinder and the stand taken by the State thus has remained uncontroverted.
Further, it is also to be noted that when such appointments were made during the
years 2001 and 2003 the writ petitions came to be filed in the years 2012 and 2013.
As the writ petitioners have claimed interest for their appointment, the Division
Bench of the High Court has rightly held [Pankaj Kumar v. State of H.P., 2014 SCC
OnLine HP 5944] that such petitions cannot be considered as the public interest
litigation. Such a writ petition which was filed by the petitioners who came to be
qualified only in the year 2011 are not entitled for any relief on the ground of
unexplained laches and inordinate delay of about more than 10 years in approaching
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 40
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
the court for questioning the appointments. Though relief was sought against the
State to deny the benefit of regularisation to the appointed Teachers, they were not
even impleaded as party respondents. An association was impleaded as third
respondent but without furnishing any material to show that at least majority of
appointees are members of such association. So far as Primary Assistant Teachers
Scheme of 2003, which was the subject-matter of letters patent appeal arising out of
CWP No. 3303 of 2012-A filed by Chander Mohan Negi and others, is concerned, the
appellants in Civil Appeal No. 2813 of 2017 except Appellants 1, 2 and 4 have
withdrawn [Chander Mohan Negi v. State of H.P., 2020 SCC OnLine SC 459] the
appeal and Appellants 1 and 4 are already appointed as JBTs.
Insofar as the only appellant viz. Appellant 2, Rajiv Chauhan is concerned, it is stated that he is
qualified and there are vacant posts and he can be considered if he applies to any of the existing
vacancies. So far as the Primary Assistant Teacher Scheme is concerned, same was notified as early
as on 27-8-2003. As is evident from the Scheme itself, the object of the Scheme appears to be to
compulsorily enrol children in schools for elementary and primary education in the remote areas to
achieve the goals as set by the Government while enacting the Himachal Pradesh Compulsory
Primary Education Act, 1997 with a view to achieve the target of 100% enrolment to children. As per
the Scheme, the eligibility was 10+2 from a recognised Board/University and the candidates with
higher qualifications were also eligible and candidates with professional qualifications were to be
preferred. As per the regular Recruitment Rules the requisite qualification for the post of JBT
Teacher during the relevant time was 10+2 with 50% marks and JBT certificate. As submitted by the
learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State that initially though 3500 odd Teachers were
appointed, as of now there are only a total of 3294 Teachers working in this category and out of this
about 1866 had the qualification of 10+2 with more than 50% marks at the relevant point of
engagement. Out of the balance, 1015 had 10+2 with less than 50% marks, but they had higher
qualification such as BA/MA/MSc or BEd, etc. Further, it is also brought to our notice that out of all
the candidates, 3294 candidates who are presently working have acquired the professional
qualification of diploma in elementary education or have undergone Professional Development
Programme for Elementary Teachers. In that view of the matter, we are of the view that when the
appointees appointed under the scheme have completed more than almost 15 years of service now
and also have acquired the professional qualifications, they cannot be denied regularisation at this
point of time. As the appointments were made as per the schemes notified by the Government such
appointments cannot be treated as illegal, if at all they can be considered irregular. When it is the
plea of the State that in view of the hard topography/tribal areas in the State, large number of
vacancies were there even in single teacher schools and to achieve the object of the Himachal
Pradesh Primary Education Act, 1997 such steps were taken, there is no reason to disbelieve the
same, more so, in absence of any affidavit by way of rejoinder by the writ petitioners before the High
Court controverting the allegations in the reply filed on behalf of the State.
12. Even with regard to the Para Teachers Policy under which various category of Teachers were
appointed in the year 2003 pursuant to policy notified on 17-9-2003 it is clear from the record
placed before this Court that all the persons who were recruited as Para Teachers were fully
qualified as per the Recruitment and Promotion Rules i.e. the Himachal Pradesh Education
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 41
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
Department Class III (School and Inspection Cadre) Service Rules, 1973. In view of the stand of the
State that such policy was necessitated due to large number of vacant posts which have arisen year
after year and which could not be filled since the State Selection Subordinate Board, Hamirpur,
which was responsible for the selection of Teachers had come under a cloud and the selection
process had come to a halt, such appointments cannot be rendered as illegal. Such aspect is also
evident from the policy itself. Even in other category of the Grant-in-Aid to Parent Teacher
Association Rules, all Teachers appointed under the Scheme fulfil the educational qualifications
prescribed in the Rules. For such kind of Teachers, the Cabinet has taken decision to take over the
Teachers on contract basis after completion of eight years of service which period was later reduced
to seven years. It is also brought to our notice during the course of arguments that out of the total
6799 Teachers, 5017 Teachers were already taken over on contract basis by the State Government
and only 1782 could not be taken over in view of the interim orders passed by this Court.
13. It is true that in the initial schemes notified by the Government, there was a condition that such
appointees should not seek regularisation/absorption but at the same time for no fault of them, they
cannot be denied regularisation/absorption. It is in view of the requirement of the State, their
services were extended from time to time and now all the appointees have completed more than 15
years of service. For majority of the appointed Teachers under the various schemes, benefit was
already extended and some left over candidates were denied on account of interim orders passed by
this Court. With regard to Primary Assistant Teachers, it is stated that all the candidates have
completed Special Teacher Training Qualifying Condensed Course and also had obtained special
JBT certificate after 5 years' continuous service in terms of the Himachal Pradesh Education Code,
1985. The judgments relied on by learned counsel Shri Prashant Bhushan also would not render any
assistance to the case of the appellants herein for the reason that there was unexplained and
inordinate delay on the part of the appellants in approaching the High Court and further having
regard to explanation offered by the State about the need of framing such policies to meet the
immediate requirement to fill up single teacher schools which were vacant for a very long time,
having regard to topographical conditions, which is not even controverted by way of any rejoinder
before the High Court. In such view of the matter, taking the totality of peculiar circumstances of
these cases, we are of the view that the view expressed by this Court in the judgments relied on
cannot be applied to the facts of the case on hand. All the appointed candidates are working for the
meagre salaries pursuant to schemes notified by the Government. Except the vague submission that
such schemes were framed only to make backdoor entries, there is no material placed on record to
buttress such submission. Further it is also to be noted that though such schemes were notified as
early as in 2003, nobody has questioned such policies and appointments up to 2012 and 2013. The
writ petition i.e. CWP No. 3303 of 2012-A was filed in the year 2012 without even impleading the
appointees as party respondents. In the writ petition, there was no rejoinder filed by the writ
petitioners disputing the averments of the State as stated in the reply-affidavit. Having regard to the
nature of such appointments, appointments made as per policies cannot be termed as illegal. Having
regard to material placed before this Court and having regard to reasons recorded in the impugned
order [Pankaj Kumar v. State of H.P., 2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944] by the High Court, we are of the
view that no case is made out to interfere with the impugned judgment [Pankaj Kumar v. State of
H.P., 2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944] of the High Court."

(Emphasis supplied) Earlier to the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the afore- quoted
judgment, the Apex Court in the case of AMARENDRA KUMAR MOHAPATRA v. STATE OF
ORISSA5, had held as follows:
"42. The decision in Umadevi (3) case [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4
SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , as noticed earlier, permitted regularisation of regular
appointments and not illegal appointments. Question, however, is whether the
appointments in the instant case could be described as illegal and if they were not,
whether the State could be directed to regularise the services of the degree-holder
Junior Engineers who have worked as ad hoc Assistant Engineers for such a long
period, not only on the analogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation but also
on the principle underlying para 53 of the decision in Umadevi (3) case [State of
Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753].
(2014) 4 SCC 583
43. As to what would constitute an irregular appointment is no longer res integra.
The decision of this Court in State of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari [(2010) 9 SCC 247:
(2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826], has examined that question and explained the principle
regarding regularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3) case [State of Karnataka v.
Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. The decision in that case
summed up the following three essentials for regularisation: (1) the employees have
worked for ten years or more, (2) that they have so worked in a duly sanctioned post
without the benefit or protection of the interim order of any court or tribunal, and (3)
they should have possessed the minimum qualification stipulated for the
appointment. Subject to these three requirements being satisfied, even if the
appointment process did not involve open competitive selection, the appointment
would be treated irregular and not illegal and thereby qualify for regularisation. Para
7 in this regard is apposite and may be extracted at this stage: (M.L. Kesari case
[(2010) 9 SCC 247: (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826], SCC p. 250) "7. It is evident from the
above that there is an exception to the general principles against 'regularisation'
enunciated in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006
SCC (L&S) 753], if the following conditions are fulfilled:
(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or more in a duly
sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the interim order of any court or
tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its instrumentality should have
employed the employee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously
for more than ten years.
(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if irregular. Where
the appointments are not made or continued against sanctioned posts or where the
persons appointed do not possess the prescribed minimum qualifications, the
appointments will be considered to be illegal. But where the person employed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 43
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
possessed the prescribed qualifications and was working against sanctioned posts,
but had been selected without undergoing the process of open competitive selection,
such appointments are considered to be irregular."
44. It is nobody's case that the degree-holder Junior Engineers were not qualified for appointment
as Assistant Engineers as even they possess degrees from recognised institutions. It is also nobody's
case that they were not appointed against the sanctioned post. There was some debate as to the
actual number of vacancies available from time to time but we have no hesitation in holding that the
appointments made were at all relevant points of time against sanctioned posts. The information
provided by Mr Nageswara Rao, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for the State of
Orissa, in fact, suggests that the number of vacancies was at all points of time more than the number
of appointments made on ad hoc basis. It is also clear that each one of the degree-holders has
worked for more than 10 years ever since his appointment as ad hoc Assistant Engineer. It is in that
view difficult to describe these appointments of the Stipendiary Engineers on ad hoc basis to be
illegal so as to fall beyond the purview of the scheme envisaged in Umadevi (3) case [State of
Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753].
45. The upshot of the above discussion is that not only because in Umadevi (3) case [State of
Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] this Court did not disturb the
appointments already made or regularisation granted, but also because the decision itself permitted
regularisation in case of irregular appointments, the legislative enactment granting such
regularisation does not call for interference at this late stage when those appointed or regularised
have already started retiring having served their respective departments, in some cases for as long as
22 years."
(Emphasis supplied) A three Judge Bench of the Apex Court considering the case of UMADEVI and
subsequent judgments in the case of PREM SINGH v. STATE OF U.P.6, holds as follows:
"36. There are some of the employees who have not been regularised in spite of
having rendered the services for 30-40 or more years whereas they have been
superannuated. As they have worked in the work-charged establishment, not against
any particular project, their services ought to have been regularised under the
Government instructions and even as per the decision of this Court in State of
Karnataka v. Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006
SCC (L&S) 753]. This Court in the said decision has laid down that in case services
have been rendered for more than ten years without the cover of the Court's order, as
one-time measure, the services be regularised of such employees. In the facts of the
case, those employees who have worked for ten years or more should have been
regularised. It would not be proper to regulate them for consideration of
regularisation as others have been regularised, we direct that their services be treated
as a regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to claiming
any dues of (2019) 10 SCC 516 difference in wages had they been continued in service
regularly before attaining the age of superannuation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 44
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
They shall be entitled to receive the pension as if they have retired from the regular establishment
and the services rendered by them right from the day they entered the work-charged establishment
shall be counted as qualifying service for purpose of pension.
37. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that
services rendered in the work-charged establishment shall be treated as qualifying service under the
aforesaid rule for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three years only
before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid accordingly within three months.
Resultantly, the appeals filed by the employees are allowed and filed by the State are dismissed."
(Emphasis supplied) On a coalesce of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court in the
afore-extracted cases which were in the aftermath of the judgment in the case of UMADEVI would
in unmistakable terms indicate that regularization of employees is not a concept that is obliterated,
but could be considered on several parameters laid down in the said judgments. One unmistakable
stream that runs through judicial thinking of judgments of the Apex Court is that regularization of
employees engaged to work for the State for long years should be considered, failing which it would
amount to violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
18. In my considered view, if the claim of the petitioners for regularization is not considered, it
would be leaving such employees in the lurch after having extracted work from them for close to 24
years. The services of these petitioners have been utilized in their energetic youth, have travelled this
far and are at this age, if they are not now considered for regularization, it would amount to
exploitation of such labour from the hands of the University, a State under Article 12 of the
Constitution of India. Such action would not behove the status of a State under the Constitution of
India. It is not the University that is now wanting to deny the benefit of regularization, but it is the
State Government which is declining to accept their claim on an irrelevant plea of financial burden
of rupees one crore thirty six lakhs.
Parity:
19. It is trite law that there is no concept of negative equality, so to say, that if a mistake is
committed by regularizing illegal appointments, the same cannot be directed to be done at the
hands of this Court. It is the case of neither that it is a mistake, several employees of the very
University have been correctly regularised. They were all appointees like that of the petitioners.
They were all regularised following the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI. The
same treatment is not meted to the petitioners. Parity in such regularization is also a concept that is
considered by the Apex Court in several cases. To quote a few, are in the cases of DHANANJOY
KARMAKAR v. STATE OF W.B.7, wherein the Apex Court holds as follows:
"7. We are told by the learned counsel appearing for the State of West Bengal that in
terms of the order dated 12-3-2002 what is important is that the name of the
appellant did not appear in the report of DLIT, therefore, his services could not be
regularised. As noted by the learned Single Judge and we have also been shown a
photocopy of the report of DLIT, the name of the appellant does appear in the report
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 45
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
of DLIT. As far as the appellant not being an organising teacher is concerned, it is
explained by the learned counsel for the State that an organising teacher ought to
have been a teacher when the School was established. The report of DLIT indicates
that all the persons whose services have been regularised, as mentioned above, were
appointed after the School was established. Therefore, there is no reason for keeping
the appellant out of the scope of regularisation when similarly placed teachers were
regularised by the State.
(2015) 17 SCC 504
8. We find no substance in any of the reasons brought out for denying regularisation
to the appellant. Under the circumstances, we set aside the impugned judgment
[State of W.B. v. DhananjoyKarmakar, FMA No. 276 of 2008, order dated 4-3-2008
(Cal)] passed by the High Court and uphold the order of the learned Single Judge.
The civil appeal is accordingly allowed with no order as to costs."
(Emphasis supplied) Later, the Apex Court in the case of JIVANLAL v. PRAVIN KRISHNA8, has
held as follows:
"2. The learned counsel for the respondents has vehemently contended that all the
regularisation orders passed in the case of those pointed out by the appellants are
illegal since the State, in principle, had decided to discontinue the appointment to the
post of Sweepers by order dated 10-12-1997. However, the fact remains that after the
said order also, many similarly situated persons have been granted regularisation
with effect from the date of completion of 10 years of service.
3. In that view of the matter, we do not find any justification in discriminating against
the appellants herein. The policy had been violated in many cases. There cannot be
any pick and choose policy; it would certainly lead to corruption. Hence, the appeals
are allowed with a direction to the respondents to grant similar treatment to the
appellants herein as well and grant regularisation to them with effect from the date of
completion of 10 years of service."
(Emphasis supplied) (2016) 15 SCC 747 Declining to accept the plea of the State that it can choose
its employees for regularization, the Apex Court in the case of UNION OF INDIA v. CENTRAL
ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL9, has held as follows:
"20. The judgment of this Court in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :
2006 SCC (L&S) 753] does not preclude the claims of employees who seek regularisation after the
exercise has been undertaken with respect to some employees, provided that the said employees
have completed the years of service as mandated by Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . The ruling casts an obligation on the State and its
instrumentalities to grant a fair opportunity of regularisation to all such employees which are
entitled according to the mandate under Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 46
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
SCC 1 :
2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and ensure that the benefit is not conferred on a limited few.
The subsequent regularisation of employees who have completed the requisite period
of service is to be considered as a continuation of the one-time exercise.
21. The decisions of this Court in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :
2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and M.L. Kesari [State of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010)
2 SCC (L&S) 826] were considered by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Narendra Kumar Tiwari v.
State of Jharkhand [Narendra Kumar Tiwari v. State of Jharkhand, (2018) 8 SCC 238 : (2018) 2 SCC
(L&S) 472] . Madan Lokur, J., construed the decision in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.
Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] in the following terms:
[Umadevi (3) case [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2019) 4 SCC 290 (2006) 4
SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , SCC p. 241, para 7] "7. The purpose and intent of the
decision in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
SCC (L&S) 753] was therefore twofold, namely, to prevent irregular or illegal
appointments in the future and secondly, to confer a benefit on those irregularly
appointed in the past."
22. The Court noted in the above judgment that if a strict and literal interpretation was given to the
decision in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] ,
no employee from the State of Jharkhand appointed on an irregular basis could ever be regularised
as the State was formed on 15-11-2000 and the cut-off date had been fixed as 10-4-2006. The intent
of the Court was to grant similarly-placed employees who had put the requisite years of service as
mandated by Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)
753] , the benefit of regularisation. The Court thus held that the Jharkhand Sarkar ke Adhinasth
Aniyamit Rup se Niyukt Ewam Karyarat Karmiko ki Sewa Niyamitikaran Niyamawali, 2015 ("the
Regularsation Rules") must be interpreted in a pragmatic manner and employees of the State who
had completed 10 years of service on the date of promulgation of the rules, ought to be regularised.
In doing so, the Court ensured that employees in the State of Jharkhand who had completed the
same years of service as employees from other States, are granted parity in terms of regularisation.
The spirit of non-discrimination and equity runs through the decisions in Umadevi (3) [State of
Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , M.L. Kesari [State of Karnataka
v. M.L. Kesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] and Narendra Kumar Tiwari [Narendra
Kumar Tiwari v. State of Jharkhand, (2018) 8 SCC 238 : (2018) 2 SCC (L&S) 472] .
23. In this background, the issue which now arises before this Court is in regard to the effective
direction which would govern the present case. The High Court has directed the Union of India to
absorb the casual workmen, if it is not possible at the Institute in question, then in any other
establishment. The latter part of the direction, as we have already noted, cannot be sustained.
Equally, in our opinion, the authorities cannot be heard to throw their hands in despair by
submitting that there are no vacancies and that it had already regularised such of the persons in the
seniority list, who reported for work. The Tribunal has entered a finding of fact that this defence is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 47
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
clearly not borne out of the record. Accordingly, we are of the view that having decided to implement
the decision of the Tribunal, which was affirmed by the High Court, the Union of India must follow a
rational principle and abide strictly by the seniority list in proceeding to regularise the workmen
concerned.
24. Accordingly, we direct that the case for regularisation shall be considered strictly in accordance
with the seniority list in pursuance of the directions which were issued by the Tribunal and
confirmed by the High Court and such of the persons, who are available for regularisation on the
basis of vacancies existing at present, shall be considered in accordance with law. The Tribunal has
denied back wages but has ordered a notional fixation of pay and allowances. While affirming that
direction, we also direct that persons who have crossed the age of superannuation will be entitled to
the computation and payment of their retiral dues on that basis. This exercise shall be carried out
within a period of three months from the receipt of a copy of the judgment. If it becomes necessary
to grant age relaxation to the workmen concerned, the appellants shall do so."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court in the afore-extracted judgments has deprecated the action of
the State adopting such policy that denies regularization. The Apex Court in the case of CENTRAL
ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL holds that employees who had completed 10 years of service on the
date of promulgation of such Rules had to be regularised on the ground of parity. Therefore, the
concept of parity is also recognized by the Apex Court in the cases of regularization of employees as
quoted hereinabove. In the facts of the cases as narrated hereinabove and the judgments referred to
(supra), the petitioners are entitled to claim the benefit of regularization and the University is
obliged to consider the same in accordance with law.
20. The learned counsel representing the University has referred to certain judgments of the Apex
Court which have denied the benefit of regularization in the cases of STATE OF RAJASTHAN AND
OTHERS v. DAYA LAL & OTHERS - (2011) 2 SCC 429, SCHOOL EDUCATION DEPTT., CHENNAI
v. R. GOVINDASWAMY - (2014) 4 SCC 769, UNION OF INDIA v. ALL INDIA TRADE UNION
CONGRESS - (2019) 5 SCC 773, SATYA PRAKASH V. STATE OF BIHAR - (2010) 4 SCC 179 and
above all, to the latest judgment of the Apex Court in the case of UNION OF INDIA & OTHERS v.
ILMODEVI AND ANOTHER10. The judgment in the case of ILMODEVI considers all the other
judgments that the learned counsel for the University has placed reliance on. The judgment in the
case of ILMODEVI is distinguishable on the facts obtaining in the case at hand without much ado.
The employees in the said case were working as part-time sweepers having been appointed on such
contingencies and had completed 20 years of contractual service, as part-time daily wagers. The
Central Administrative Tribunal had allowed the applications of those Safaiwalas who were working
for less than 5 hours in a day and directed consideration of their cases for regularization which was
affirmed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana which led the Union of India to knock the doors
of the Apex Court. It is on those facts the Apex Court holds as follows:
Civil Appeal Nos.5689-5690/2021 disposed on 07.10.2021 "8. At the outset, it is
required to be noted that the respondents-original applicants were working as
contingent paid part-time sweepers (Safai Karamcharies working for less than five
hours a day) in a Post Office at Chandigarh. It is not in dispute and cannot be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 48
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
disputed that there are no sanctioned posts of Safaiwalas in the Post Office in which
the respondents were working. There is no documentary evidence on record to
establish and prove that the respondents were working continuously. Even otherwise
as observed hereinabove, they were working as contingent paid part-
time sweepers. Even it is not the case on behalf of the respondents that their appointment was done
after following due procedure of selection and to that extent, it cannot be said that their
appointments were irregular. As such in the absence of any sanctioned posts in the Post Office in
which the respondents were working, there was no question of appointing the respondents after
following due procedure. In light of the above, the directions issued by the High Court in the
impugned judgment and order are required to be considered.
8.1. In the present case, pursuant to the order passed by the learned Tribunal and the order passed
in the contempt proceedings, the appellants came out with a regularization policy dated 30.06.2014.
In the said regularization policy, it has been provided as under: -
"(i) Regularization of all the Casual
Labourers, who have been irregularly
appointed, but are duly qualified persons in terms of statutory requirement rules for the post and
was engaged against a sanctioned post, shall be done if they have worked for 10 years or more but
not under the covers of orders of courts or tribunals as on the date of Hon'ble Apex Court's ibid
judgment, i.e.,10.04.2006.
(ii) A temporary contractual, casual or daily wageworker shall not have a legal right to be made
permanent unless he/she fulfills the above criteria.
(iii) A Casual Labourer engaged without following the due process or the rules relating to
appointment and does not meet the above criteria shall not be considered for their absorption,
regularization, permanency in the Department.
(iv) If a Casual Labourer was engaged in infraction of the rules or if his engagement is in violation of
the provisions of the Constitution, the said illegal engagement shall not be regularized."
The afore-quoted paragraphs are the facts and at paragraphs 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 the Apex Court accepts
the claim of Union of India and sets aside orders rendered by the Tribunal and the High Court. The
said paragraphs read as follows:
"8.7 Thus, as per the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions part-time
employees are not entitled to seek regularization as they are not working against any
sanctioned post and there cannot be any permanent continuance of part-time
temporary employees as held. Part-time temporary employees in a Government run
institution cannot claim parity in salary with regular employees of the Government
on the principle of equal pay for equal work.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 49
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
8.8 Applying the law laid down by this court in the aforesaid decisions, the directions
issued by the High Court in the impugned judgment and order, more particularly,
directions in paragraphs 22 and 23 are unsustainable and beyond the power of the
judicial review of the High Court in exercise of the power under Article 226 of the
Constitution. Even otherwise, it is required to be noted that in the present case, the
Union of India/Department subsequently came out with a regularization policy dated
30.06.2014, which is absolutely in consonance with the law laid down by this Court in
the case of Umadevi (supra), which does not apply to the part- time workers who do
not work on the sanctioned post. As per the settled preposition of law, the
regularization can be only as per the regularization policy declared by the
State/Government and nobody can claim the regularization as a matter of right
dehors the regularization policy. Therefore, in absence of any sanctioned post and
considering the fact that the respondents were serving as a contingent paid part-time
Safai Karamcharies, even otherwise, they were not entitled for the benefit of
regularization under the regularization policy dated 30.06.2014.
8.9 Though, we are of the opinion that even the direction contained in paragraph 23
for granting minimum basic pay of Group 'D' posts from a particular date to those,
who have completed 20 years of part-time daily wage service also is unsustainable as
the part-time wagers, who are working for four to five hours a day and cannot claim
the parity with other Group 'D' posts. However, in view of the order passed by this
Court dated 22.07.2016 while issuing notice in the present appeals, we are not
quashing and setting aside the directions contained in paragraph 23 in the impugned
judgment and order so far as the respondents' employees are concerned."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court holds that regularization can only be as per the regularization
policy declared by the State/Government and nobody can claim regularization dehors the
regularization policy. The Apex Court also holds that the employees were not entitled to minimum
basic pay even from a particular date. These are not the facts in the case at hand.
21. It is not in dispute that the University right from 2008 upto 2019, has been communicating to
the State Government seeking approval for regularization of services of the employees as one time
measure, which is akin to a policy as is observed by the Apex Court in the afore-quoted paragraphs
of ILMODEVI. Therefore, it is not a case where the Apex Court denies regularization of the
employees of the State but leaves it to the entities to formulate a policy in the event they want to
regularise any of the services of its respective employees.
22. Scores and scores of employees who were appointed on daily wage basis have been regularised
by the State even in the post UMADEVI era. Merely because the State Government has notified the
Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012, the claim of the petitioners in these cases, for
regularization, cannot vanish into thin air, as by the time the Act was promulgated all the petitioners
herein had completed 14 to 16 years of service. The contention of the State Government or the
University that with the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012 coming into force, no
employee can claim regularization falls foul of the interpretation of the Apex Court in the case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 50
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
STATE OF KARNATAKA v. REVANNA.S11 wherein the Apex Court holds as follows:
"The Appellants rejected the request of the Respondent for regularization on the
ground that he did not complete 10 years of continued service without the aid of the
interim order passed by the High Court.
The Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012 (Act of 2012) was notified
on 15.02.2013. Certain benefits pertaining to the continuance of daily wage
employees on completion of 10 years and the payment of minimum time scale along
with other benefits were provided in the said Act. The above Act does not
contemplate regularization of daily wagers.
Aggrieved by the rejection of his request for regularization, the Respondent filed
application Nos.5168- 5169 of 2013 which was allowed by the Karnataka
Administrative Tribunal. A direction was issued to the Appellants to consider the
regularization of the service of the Respondent. Dissatisfied with the direction to
consider his case for regularization, the Respondent filed a Writ Petition in the High
Court of Karnataka. On a consideration Civil Appeal No.5292 of 2019 disposed of on
09-07-2019 of the history of the case, the High Court issued a positive mandamus to
the Appellants to regularize the service of the Respondent.
Mr. Basava Prabhu Patil, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellants
submitted that the Respondent does not have a right for regularization, especially
after the Act of 2012 was brought into existence. According to him, the Respondent is
entitled to be considered only for the benefits flowing from the Act.
In its judgment dated 09.03.2012, the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal held that
the Respondent worked for more than 10 years in a duly sanctioned post without the
benefit or protection of an interim order passed by any Court or Tribunal. While
holding so, the Tribunal observed that the rejection of Respondent's request for
regularization on the ground that he does not comply with the requirements of
paragraph 53 of the judgment in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others
Vs. Umadevi and Others1 was erroneous. The said judgment of the Tribunal has
become final as it was not challenged by the Appellants. In view thereof, the
Respondent had a right to be considered for regularization of his service in
accordance with the judgment in Umadevi's case on the basis of the findings recorded
by the Tribunal in its judgment dated 09.03.2012.
The rejection of the request of the Respondent for regularization of his service in the
light of the Act of 2012 is not correct. It is relevant to note that the Act of 2012 does
not deal with the judgments which were passed earlier granting the benefit of
regularization to daily wage employees. Therefore, the judgments of the Tribunal 1
(2006) 4 SCC 1 and the High Court on regularization remain unaffected. In view of
the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we do not see any reason to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172627876/ 51
Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
interfere with the direction issued by the High Court to regularize the service of the
Respondent.
Eight weeks' time is granted to comply with the order. The Civil Appeal and pending
applications stand dispose of accordingly."
(Emphasis supplied) Therefore, in the light of the judgment of the Apex Court (supra), the State
cannot now direct the University to consider the cases of the petitioners under the Daily Wage
Welfare Act. Therefore, such orders communicated to the University by the State will run counter to
the judgment in the case of REVANNA (supra).
23. It is now germane to notice in the journey of the order to consider the result of such
regularization. Granting arrears of wages to the petitioners in the event of their regularization will
mulct either the State or the University and then place the State or the University under financial
stress. Therefore, the petitioners shall not be entitled to any back-wages once the benefit of
regularization is granted to the petitioners in terms of the recommendations/proposals made by the
University from time to time, but such service rendered by each of the petitioners after 10 years of
their initial appointment shall count for the purpose of determination of every other service
condition and all terminal benefits.
24. Ergo, on a coalesce of the afore-narrated facts; the law laid down in the case of UMADEVI and
its aftermath; the correspondences/recommendation/proposal of the University to the State, would
all lead to an unmistakable inference that the petitioners who were all appointed by the University
close to 20 years ago, have continued to work, in and for the University without any break, and
never on the strength of any interim order granted by any judicial fora. In their heydays these
petitioners have toiled to serve the University on receiving even paltry sums as salary. The need of
these employees by the University is time and again recognised in the communications/proposals
for such regularization. If their cases are not considered at this juncture, it would be an arbitrary
action, violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and would result in leaving the employees
in the lurch. The buoyancy of hope that the petitioners have all along carried with them should not
again be turned by the respondents into a fatigue of despair. The State and the University cannot
display a hands-off to their obligation, to consider the cases of the petitioners.
25. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) The Writ Petitions are allowed.
(ii) The orders impugned in all these writ petitions stand quashed.
(iii) The State Government shall consider the proposal of the University sent on
12.09.2019 or any other proposal/recommendation sent hitherto, to 12.09.2019 and
pass appropriate orders in accordance with law, bearing in mind the observations

Komala M vs The State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2022
made in the course of the order.
(iv) The University shall not shirk its responsibility of considering the cases of the petitioners for
regularization of their services in the event the State Government would leave it to the discretion of
the University to consider the cases of the petitioners for regularization.
(v) In the event the orders of regularization are passed by the University, the petitioners shall not be
entitled to any arrears of salary, but would become entitled to count their services after completion
of 10 years from the respective dates of their initial engagement for the purpose of determination of
all other service conditions and every terminal benefit.
(vi) The University and the State Government, in unison, shall consider the claim of the petitioners
in terms of directions (iii) and (iv) within four months, from the date of receipt of a copy of this
order.
