Shri Navneet Verma, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri A.S.Parihar, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.
Heard through video conferencing.
This is first bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of the applicant. The applicant
is in custody since 2.02.2021 in connection with Crime No.001/2021 registered at P.S., Makdon,
District Ujjain for the offence punishable under Sections 302, 304-B and 201 of IPC.
As per prosecution story, the applicant was married to deceased Jyoti three years ago. On 14.6.2020
while applicant and Jyoti were going on a motorcycle, an accident allegedly took place. Thereafter
100 number was dialed and both the applicant and the deceased were taken to the hospital where
Jyoti(deceased) was declared dead and applicant has undergone the treatment of fracture etc.. The
postmortem was conducted on the body of the deceased, according to which it was an accidental
death. Thereafter FSL report was also requisitioned. The said report also suggested that it was an
accidental death. However, lateron on 1.1.2021 the instant FIR has been lodged on an allegation as
reflected from the statement of the brother of the deceased Hoshiyarsingh that he had visited the
spot of accident on the following day of the accident and he found the suspicious circumstances and
therefore the instant FIR has been lodged alleging demand of dowry and murder. Accordingly case
has been registered.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant is innocent and has been falsely
implicated. Investigation is complete and therefore no custodial interrogation is required. As a
matter of fact earlier there was a case under section 498-A IPC and other sections were registered
against him at crime No. 40/2020. The case was compromised on 24.2.2020. Thereafter KOUSHAL
Date: 2021.07.09 18:15:54 IST 2 MCRC-20798-2021 applicant and deceased have been living
together happily. On the fateful day on 14.6.2020 she died in the accident while both of them were
going on motorcycle. The postmortem report and FSL report have opined that it was an accidental
death. After a gap of almost 6 months new FIR has been lodged at the instance of brother of the
deceased on 1.1.2021 alleging that he found suspicious circumstances while he visited the spot on
15.6.2020, therefore it is a case of murder and dowry death.

Learned counsel further submits that there is no incriminating material against the applicant except
the statement of brother of the deceased. Applicant is in jail since 2.2.2021. He has no criminal
antecedents. No plausible explanation has been given as to why the FIR was lodged after 6 months.
Moreso, looking to prevailing Covid-19 situation, trial is not likely to conclude early in the near
future. Hence, under such circumstances, the applicant may be enlarged on bail on such terms and
conditions this Court deems fit and proper.
P e r contra, learned Panel Lawyer opposes the bail application supporting the order impugned with
the submission that in terms of statement of brother of the deceased, Hoshiyarsingh, a case is made
out under sections 302, 304-B and 201 of IPC.
Upon hearing counsel for the parties but without touching merits of the contentions so advanced,
regard being had to the obtaining facts and circumstances narrated above coupled with the fact that
applicant is in jail since 2.2.2021 having no criminal antecedents, not required for custodial
investigation. Moreso, due to Covid-19 pandemic, possibility of delay in conclusion of trial cannot be
ruled out. Hence, he is held entitled for enlargement on bail.
Consequently, the application of the applicant filed under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure
Code, 1973 is hereby allowed. It is directed that the applicant be released on bail furnishing personal
bond in the sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- (rupees three lakhs only) with one solvent surety in the like
amount KOUSHAL Date: 2021.07.09 18:15:54 IST 3 MCRC-20798-2021 to the satisfaction of the
