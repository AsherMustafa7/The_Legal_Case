case for grant of bail is made out.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case coupled with the fact that trial is not likely to
conclude in near future and prolonged pre-trial detention being anathema to the concept of liberty,
this Court is inclined to extend the benefit of bail to the applicant.
Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, this application is allowed and it
is directed that the applicant namely- Smt. Usha Rarwat be released on bail on furnishing a personal
bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) with one solvent surety of the like
amount to the satisfaction of the concerned trial Court/committal Court.
This order will remain operative subject to compliance of the following conditions by the applicant :
1. The applicant will comply with all the terms and conditions of the bond executed
by her;
2. The applicant will cooperate in the investigation/trial, as the case may be;
3. The applicant will not indulge herself in extending inducement, threat or promise
to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him/her from
disclosing such facts to the Court or to the Police Officer, as the case may be;
4. The applicant shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which she is
accused;
5. The applicant will not seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial; and
6. The applicant will not leave India without previous permission of the trial
Court/Investigating Officer, as the case may be.
