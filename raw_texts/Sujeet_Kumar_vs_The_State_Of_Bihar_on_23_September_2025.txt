3. As per complaint case, the complainant, Sujeet Kumar, entered into a negotiation for the sale of
35 decimal of land situated in plot no. 19, belonging to the land owners Nagendra Nath son of
Brajesh Rai and Dhananjay Rai alias Munna Rai son of Rambilash Rai, located at village-Latmara.
The total consideration amount was settled at Rs. 32,00,000/ (Thirty two lakh)-. Pursuant to this

agreement, two sale deeds were executed on 15.05.2018 in favour of the accused persons, namely
Harendra Kumar, Manju Kumar and Nitesh Kumar. However, in the sale deed, the consideration
amount was mentioned as only Rs. 16,10,000/- (Sixteen lakh ten thousand) in place of the actual
agreed sum of Rs. 32,00,000/(Thirty two lakh), and it was recorded therein that the amount had
been fully received by the vendors. As per oral negotiation, an amount of Rs. 15,90,000/-(Fifteen
lakh ninety thousand) remained due, which was to be paid after the purchasers received the receipts
from the Registration Office, Hajipur. It is further stated in complaint petition that the complainant
collected the original sale deeds from registration office and kept it with him and same would be
handed over to the purchasers only upon payment of outstanding dues. Despite repeated demands
by complainant, the accused persons failed to pay the balance Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ)
No.1511 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 amount of Rs.15,90,000/-. It is further alleged that the accused
persons abused the complainant by using caste name, assaulted him with slaps and fists, pointed a
pistol at him, and attempted to snatch the original sale deeds. Thereafter, Hajipur SC/ST P.S. Case
No.44 of 2019 was registered.
4. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that after submission of the final form by the I.O, the
protest petition was filed by the informant which was converted as complaint petition on
09.02.2021 bearing protest cum complaint case No. as C.I 56 of 2021 and enquiry was initiated
under Section 202 Cr.P.C by the concerned court. Complainant gave S.A under Section 202 Cr. P.C
and thereafter E.W 1 Sonu Kumar, E.W. 2 Dharmendra Kumar and E.W 3 Mahendra Paswan were
examined on solemn affirmation and they have supported the case of the complainant. It is further
submitted that without appreciating the fact of the case regarding agreement to sale dated
14.11.2017 and sale deed dated 12.05.2018, the concerned court has dismissed the complaint
petition even though remaining unpaid consideration amount of Rs. 15,90,000/- was never paid to
complainant. In the light of aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the complainant has
adduced all the enquiry witnesses in support of the complaint. The concerned Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.1511 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 court while recording the dismissal order has recorded
that the oral evidence are not given preferential treatment in the light of the documentary evidence,
which is totally uncalled for. In the light of aforesaid facts and circumstance, the order passed by the
concerned court is without justification and without application of mind and same is liable to be
dismissed.
5. Learned counsel for the State and respondent no.2 have submitted that the concerned court has
discussed the complaint petition and the examination of the complaint on S.A and enquiry witnesses
1, 2 and other documentary evidence. Agreement to sale deed dated 11.11.2017 and xerox of sale
deeds no. 3186 dated 12.05.2018 and 3185 dated 12.05.2018 clearly reflects that land was negotiated
for sale of consideration money of Rs. 32 lakh while value of the property including plot no. 17, 18
and 19 total area 23 katha is recorded as 2 lakh in agreement to sale deed dated 14.12.2017. There
was not a single whispering on both sale deeds that there was any dues against purchaser and it has
also been recoded in the finding of the concerned court that no dues receipt were issued by the
registration office and there is no any dues remained against purchaser and also there is no ground
to demand any amount from purchaser by mediator. It has also been recorded that Patna High
Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1511 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 complainant has intention to realize surplus
amount beyond the consideration money. In the light of said finding, the concerned court has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107762289/ 2
Sujeet Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 23 September, 2025
conclusively observed that no case is made out against the accused persons and there is no ground
to proceed further in the case and instant complaint case is dismissed under Section 203 Cr.P.C. The
concerned court has recorded that initially FIR vide Hajipur P.S. Case No. 44 of 2019 dated
21.11.2019 was instituted against the respondents, who were made accused therein. However, after
due investigation, the police submitted final form. The concerned court has given due opportunity to
the complainant to produce all the enquiry witnesses and court has not denied the opportunity
regarding producing enquiry witness by the complainant.
6. From perusal of the order dated 30.01.2024, it appears that trial court has explained the reason
for which complaint petition has been dismissed and there is nothing in impugned order where it is
found that the complainant has not given due opportunity for adducing the evidence. The learned
trial court has found that there is no sufficient material to proceed further and in the light of the
facts and circumstances of the case, the complaint petition has been dismissed under Section 203 of
Cr.P.C.

7. After hearing the parties concerned and the material available on record, the concerned court
treated the protest petition as complaint petition as earlier Hajipur P.S. Case No. 44 of 2019 was
registered and police has submitted final form and thereafter protest petition was filed. The court
has taken decision to convert the protest petition into complaint petition and allow all the enquiry
witnesses to be examined. The concerned court has given reasoning that no dues remained against
purchaser and it has also been recorded that no dues receipt issued by the registration office. There
is also no ground to demand any amount from purchaser by mediator and the reasoning recorded by
the trial court is on the basis of material available on record and the concerned court has accordingly
dismissed the complaint petition. There is nothing on record which entails that opportunity of
complainant has been denied, rather the record reflects that all the enquiry witnesses have been
produced in support of the complaint petition.
8. Keeping in view aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and the reasoning recorded by the
concerned court as discussed above, the order passed by the concerned court is justified and legal in
the light of the facts and circumstances of the case and I find no reason to differ from the impugned
order Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1511 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 dated 30.01.2024.
9. Accordingly, the present appeal stands dismissed at the stage of admission itself.
