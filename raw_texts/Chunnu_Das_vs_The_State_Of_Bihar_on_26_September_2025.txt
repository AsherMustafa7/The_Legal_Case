Prosecution Story :
4. The informant, Yogendra Das, who is the father
of the deceased, alleged that his daughter, namely Dhanita
Kumari, aged 18 years, was married to Chunnu Das (appellant),
who is a resident of Village Korma, P.S.- Ghosi, District

Jehanabad, and that the second marriage (Gauna) Duragman of
his daughter had not taken place. On 05.12.2010, his son-in-law
(appellant), along with his cousin Lailun Das, came to Hilsa
market and made a call to his daughter's mobile No.
9162241955 using his mobile No. 8521346603. By making that
call, he asked his daughter to come to Hilsa market and told her
that he would get anklets for her. Using the same mobile
number, his son-in-law (appellant) also talked with him and his
wife. The informant further alleged that his daughter Dhanita
Kumari went to Hilsa market but did not return by night. Then
he became anxious and called his daughter's mobile number, but
it was found switched off. Thereafter, the next day, he went to
the village of his son-in-law but did not find any information
about his daughter, and his son-in-law was also not found. In the
meanwhile, the deceased was searched for at the places of his
relatives. On 15.12.2010, his brother-in-law Govind Das
informed him that on the southern side of Korma village, on the
bank of the Falgu river, at Thakhta Khanda, the dead body of a
woman had been found in a buried condition. It is clarified that
the said appellant is a resident of Korma Village. After receiving
the information, he went to the bank of the Falgu river with his
family members and saw the dead body of a woman in a buried

condition. In the presence of the Block Development Officer
(BDO), Dhobi, the police exhumed the dead body and found it
to be headless. Both legs had been eaten by some animal. Near
the dead body, a blue-coloured slipper of size four (left foot), a
packet of Super Vasmol-33 hair oil, a broken mala (garland)
made of yellow and red colours, two old broken silver anklets, a
yellow ribbon used for tying hair, pink bangles (some of which
were broken), and a blue small bag with the name "Vijay
Kumar, Manish Kumar Verma Jeweller, Pitambarpur Hilsa"
written on it were found. Upon opening the bag, two currency
notes of (cid:128)10 each, one small paper dated 23.09.2010, a small
knife with the word 'Lord' written on the butt, and one toe ring
(bichhiya) were found. As per the informant, he and his family
members identified the said articles as belonging to his daughter
and, on that basis, identified the dead body as that of his
daughter, Dhanita Kumari. The informant further alleged that he
got the information that his son-in-law (appellant) and Lailun
Das first brought the deceased to Korma village and, with the
help of Tulsi Das, Munna Das, Maheshwari Devi, Sushama
Devi, and Soni Devi (appellant's relatives), killed his daughter
by beheading her using a sharp-edged weapon and then buried
the body beneath the earth, concealing the head somewhere else,

which could not be found even after exhaustive search. As per
the informant, the deceased was of dark complexion, due to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 4
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
which the appellant and his family members did not like her and
had been demanding Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Five
Thousand) as dowry. The informant further alleged that the
appellant and his family members killed his daughter by
beheading her and thereafter concealed the head to destroy
evidence and buried the corpse on the bank of the Falgu river.
5. On 15.12.2010 at 11:30 A.M., the fardbeyan of
the informant (PW-10) was recorded at the place of recovery of
the dead body and the same was recorded by Kameshwar Singh,
who was the then Sub-Inspector-cum-SHO of Ghosi police
station at that time. On that basis, Ghosi P.S. Case No. 257 of
2010 was registered for the offences under Sections 364, 304B,
201, and 34 of the IPC against the appellant and six others,
which set the criminal law in motion.
6. After completion of the investigation, the
Investigating Officer submitted chargesheet bearing No.
43/2011 dated 25.03.2011 against the appellant and co-accused
Lailun Das under Sections 364, 304B, and 201/34 of the IPC.
However, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the
offences under Sections 364, 304B, and 201/34 of IPC only
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025

against Lailun Das vide order dated 28.03.2011. The
Investigating Officer submitted final form bearing No. 165/2011
dated 30.06.2011 against the co-accused persons, namely, Tulsi
Das, Munna Das, Maheshwari Devi, Sushama Devi, and Soni

Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
Devi, showing them as not sent up for trial in the absence of any
evidence against them. However, the learned Magistrate rejected
the final form and took cognizance vide order dated 27.08.2011
under Sections 364, 304B, and 201/34 of the IPC against all
seven accused persons, including the appellant. Thereafter, the
case of the appellant was split, and the same was committed to
the Court of Sessions. Subsequently, the learned trial court
commenced the trial of the appellant after framing charges
against him.

the learned trial court recorded the statement of the appellant
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
8/50
under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in short
'Cr.P.C.'), giving him sufficient opportunity to explain all the
incriminating circumstances appearing against him from the
prosecution's evidence, which were denied by him, and he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 7
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
claimed himself to be innocent. Here, it is important to mention
that in respect of the alleged mobile communication between the
appellant and the victim, the incriminating circumstance
appearing from the prosecution's evidence relating to call details
and mobile numbers was put before the appellant; he accepted
that he had called the victim but stated that he did not know
what would be done by them. The appellant did not take any
specific defence except claiming himself to be innocent while
answering the incriminating circumstances, though he stated
that the investigation was faulty.
11. In defence, the appellant did not produce or
examine any person as his witness and also did not provide any
documentary evidence.
12. After appreciating the prosecution's evidence,
the learned trial court observed that the recovered dead body
was in a condition to be identified, and the deceased's family
members identified the dead body as that of the victim on the
basis of body structure and complexion, along with the articles
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
9/50
recovered with the dead body. The trial court also took into
account the fact that there were no details of the whereabouts of
the victim for last five years. The learned trial court believed the
prosecution story narrated in the fardbeyan of the informant and
deemed Ext.-9, showing call details concerning the alleged
communication between the deceased and the appellant during
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 8
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
the relevant time, as a corroborative piece of evidence.
13. Learned senior counsel appearing for the
appellant has argued that an inordinate delay of 10 days
occurred on the part of the informant in lodging the FIR without
providing any explanation. Though some prosecution witnesses
stated that after the victim went missing, they approached the
police station and filed a case in the court, no documentary
evidence was produced by the prosecution in support of this
claim. Therefore, the said delay remained unexplained, which is
fatal to the prosecution. The police actually recovered a
skeleton, which was not in the form of a dead body, and
important prosecution witnesses such as the doctor who
conducted the postmortem examination, the investigating
officer, and the Block Development Officer, before whom the
inquest report was prepared, admitted in their evidence that the
so-called body was not in a condition to be identified as that of a
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
10/50
human being. Thus, the prosecution failed to prove the
identification of the recovered body as that of the informant's
missing daughter. Regarding identification of the dead body,
PW-6 introduced a new fact that the dead body was identified
by a burn mark seen on the hand of the body, but in this regard,
the close relatives of the victim did not mention anything while
giving details of the identification of the dead body. Learned
counsel has further argued that the prosecution failed to prove
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 9
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
the charge under Section 304B of the IPC against the appellant;
hence, he was acquitted of the said offence. As far as the
offences of murder and abduction for murder, punishable under
Sections 302 and 364 of the IPC, are concerned, the prosecution
also failed to prove the appellant's motive for killing the victim,
even if the prosecution story is believed to be true. In the
absence of such motive, the appellant cannot be held liable for
the alleged offences. It has further been argued that Ext.-9,
which contains the call details of the concerned mobile
numbers, is not admissible in evidence under the provisions of
the Indian Evidence Act, as no certificate was issued by a
competent authority of the mobile service provider to
authenticate the call detail records. Therefore, the same ought
not to have been considered by the trial court. In this regard, a
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
11/50
serious error was committed by the trial court in placing reliance
on Ext.-9. Moreover, Ext.-9 does not show the tower location of
the appellant's mobile number during the relevant time, so the
appellant's presence at or near Hilsa Market at the alleged time
when he supposedly called the victim has not been established.
Nevertheless, the learned trial court believed the prosecution's
story without any proper basis. It has been lastly argued that all
the circumstances pointed out by the prosecution are incomplete
and inconclusive to lead to only one inference -- that of the
appellant's guilt in the alleged crime. Accordingly, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 10
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
impugned judgment suffers from the above-mentioned
infirmities, and therefore, the conviction of the appellant for the
alleged offences is not sustainable and is liable to be set aside.
14. On the other hand, learned APP appearing for
the State has vehemently argued that the recovered dead body
was sufficiently identified by the victim's close relatives based
on the articles found with the body, and these were sufficient to
establish identity. The dead body was found near the village of
the appellant, and this circumstance could not be explained by
the appellant. The learned APP further argued that the appellant,
in his statement recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C.,
admitted to making a phone call to the deceased during the
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
12/50
relevant period using his mobile number. This communication
was made on 05.12.2010. However, from 06.12.2010 until the
recovery of the dead body on 15.12.2010, no further attempt
was made by the appellant to communicate with the victim
using his mobile number. This circumstance suggests that the
appellant was aware of the victim's death. Secondly, the
appellant and his family members were found absconding from
their house when the informant arrived there while searching for
the victim. This subsequent conduct of the appellant and his
family members, just after the commission of the alleged
occurrence, goes against the appellant and is sufficient to show
his involvement in the alleged crime. The learned APP further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 11
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
argued that the victim went missing on 05.12.2010, and
thereafter, neither the appellant nor his family members
attempted to contact the informant or his family members to
inquire about the victim's well-being. This conduct also goes
against the appellant. All the incriminating circumstances
appearing from the prosecution's evidence form a complete
chain with no missing links. In respect of the motive behind the
killing, all the prosecution witnesses consistently deposed that
due to the victim's dark complexion, she was not liked by the
appellant, and a demand of (cid:128)25,000 was also made by the
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
13/50
appellant and his family members, which had not been fulfilled.
As such, the learned trial court rightly convicted the appellant
for the alleged offences, and there is no merit in this appeal,
which is liable to be dismissed.
15. We have heard both sides and gone through the
evidences available on the record of the trial court, and have
taken into account the appellant's statement recorded under
Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. We have also given our thoughtful
consideration to the aforesaid submissions advanced by both
sides.
16. In the instant matter, the prosecution case is
based on circumstantial evidence. So, at first, we would like to
mention the relevant circumstances emerging from the
prosecution's evidences, which, according to the prosecution,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 12
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
show the commission of the alleged offences by the appellant.
The relevant circumstances are as follows:-
(i) The deceased was not liked by the appellant on
account of her dark complexion, and the appellant also
demanded Rs. 25,000/- from the victim as dowry.
(ii) The appellant and the victim had mobile phones
and used the same for communication.
(iii) On 05.12.2010, the appellant came to Hilsa
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
14/50
market with his cousin and made communication with the
victim on her mobile number using his mobile number, the
details of which are mentioned in the FIR. He thereby persuaded
the victim to come to Hilsa market on the pretext of purchasing
anklets for her. At the same time, the appellant also spoke
through his mobile number with the informant and his wife.
(iv) On 05.12.2010, the victim went to Hilsa market
after receiving a phone call from the appellant and thereafter
went missing and never returned.
(v) The informant started searching for the victim
since the morning of 06.12.2010, i.e., the day after the victim
had gone to Hilsa market. During the course of the search, he
and his family members first went to the village of the appellant.
(vi) The appellant and his family members were not
found at their house when the informant went there while
searching for the victim.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 13
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
(vii) A headless human body was found in a buried
condition on the bank of the Falgu river, and the appellant's
village is situated on the southern side of the said river, as per
the site map (Ext.-7).
(viii) Several articles, which are generally used by a
rural married woman, were found with the dead body. Mainly
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
15/50
on that basis, the informant and his relatives claimed to have
identified the dead body as that of the victim.
(ix) After 05.12.2010 and between 06.12.2010 and
till recovery of the dead body on 15.12.2010, the appellant did
not make any attempt either by using his mobile phone or
otherwise to contact the victim or her parental family members,
while he used to talk with the victim.
Discussion of evidences :-
17. Now, we would like to discuss the evidence of
the prosecution's witnesses in a brief manner to determine
whether the above-mentioned circumstances stand proved and
whether the same are of such a nature so as to form a complete
chain of the entire prosecution story, indicating the guilt of the
appellant in the alleged crime, leaving no room to draw any
other presumption or inference except that of the appellant's
guilt.
18. Prosecution witness Sudhir Ravidas (PW-1),
son of the informant and brother of the victim, deposed in his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 14
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
examination-in-chief that the appellant and one person, namely
Lailun Das, called his sister Dhanita Kumari on her mobile
phone and asked her to come to Hilsa Market, saying that they
would get ornaments prepared for her and would give the same
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
16/50
to her. At that time, both also talked with him, his parents, his
younger brother Niraj Kumar, and his sister Namita Kumari. He
further deposed that mobile number 9162241955 was in the
name of his sister, and the appellant's mobile number was
8521346603. He further deposed that his sister (deceased) went
to Hilsa market, saying that she would return after 2 hours, but
she did not return till late at night. Then they became anxious
and tried to call the appellant on his mobile phone, but the same
was found switched off. On the next morning, he, his parents,
his siblings, and maternal grandfather went to Korma village,
i.e., the sasural of the victim, but his sister was not there and
even the appellant was not found. Thereafter, they enquired
from their relatives and villagers about the victim but did not
find her location. On 15.12.2010, Ghosi police station exhumed
a dead body from the bank of the Falgu river on the southern
side of Korma village, and this was informed by Ghosi police to
his maternal uncle Govind Ravidas (PW-5), from whom they
got the information about the said recovery of a dead body. He
further stated that after getting the information from his uncle,
he and his family members went to the bank of the Falgu river
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 15
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
and saw a beheaded dead body, of which the legs had been eaten
by some animals, and they identified the body as that of his
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
17/50
sister Dhanita Kumari. This witness, in paragraph no. 10 of his
examination-in-chief, gave the details of the articles found with
the dead body as detailed by the informant in his fardbeyan, and
according to him, they were able to identify the dead body as
being that of his sister mainly on the basis of said articles. He
further stated in paragraph no. 12 of his examination-in-chief
that his sister was of dark complexion, for which her in-laws
used to taunt her, and a sum of Rs. 25,000/- had been demanded
by her in-laws. He stated in paragraph no. 14 of his cross-
examination that when his sister received the call on her mobile
phone, he, his parents, his brother Niraj Kumar, and sister
Namita Kumari were all present in the house, and when his
sister started going to Hilsa market, none of his family members
went with her. They did not give any information to the police
station when his sister did not return till evening on that day. He
further stated in paragraphs nos. 15 & 16 of his cross-
examination that no prior information was given to the police
station regarding the accused's treatment with his sister on
account of her dark complexion and the accused's demand of
Rs. 25,000/- from his sister. Even in this regard, no panchayat
meeting took place, nor was any information given to the
Chowkidar. They did not find the appellant and his family

members at their village (sasural of the victim) when they
reached there upon receiving the information. He further stated
in paragraphs nos. 17 & 18 of his cross-examination that he had
given information to the police station before the dead body of
his sister was recovered, though he remembered that his uncle
had also given information regarding the disappearance of his
sister, just 5 to 6 days after her going missing, to Ghosi police.
He stated in repeated paragraph no. 24 of his cross-examination
that upon seeing the dead body, he found a human skeleton with
only some flesh on it, and it was without a head. At that time,
his father, mother, uncle Govind Ravidas, co-villagers
Rampravesh Ravidas and Sanjay Ravidas, and others were also
present with him. He further stated in paragraph no. 29 of his
cross-examination that the appellant was engaged in the
profession of driving a tractor at Madras (now Chennai) and
used to talk with his sister on the mobile phone from Madras.
19. Prosecution witness Guna Devi (PW-2), mother
of the deceased/victim, deposed in her examination-in-chief that
her daughter was of dark complexion, owing to which her in-
laws used to taunt her and also used to demand a sum of Rs.
25,000/- from her. As the said demand could not be fulfilled, her
son-in-law (appellant) phoned and asked her to send her

daughter to Hilsa market, saying that he would get an anklet and
a gold chain prepared for her daughter. Thereafter, her daughter
went to Hilsa market but did not return till evening, and then her
son Sudhir Ravidas (PW-1) tried to contact the appellant on his
mobile phone, but the same was found switched off. She further
deposed in her examination-in-chief that she went to the
appellant's house on the next day of the incident but found the
house locked, and the appellant and his family members were
found to be absconding; her daughter was not found. Thereafter,
she learned about the recovery of a dead body buried on the
bank of the Falgu river, and upon getting the information, she
went there. After exhumation, it was found to be that of her
daughter, and she identified the dead body. She recorded her
statement before the police, giving the aforesaid details. In the
cross-examination, she stated that no complaint had been lodged
by her with the police regarding the appellant's demand of Rs.
25,000/-. When her son-in-law (appellant) phoned, she, her
husband, and her daughter were present in the house. When her
daughter did not return, no complaint was made to the
Chowkidar, and no attempt was made at night to search for the
victim. On the next day, she, her husband, son, and her father
Ram Lagan Das all started searching for the victim and also

Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
home, and thereafter, an oral information regarding her
daughter's missing was given to Ghosi police station. She
further stated in paragraphs nos. 16, 17, 18, and 19 of her cross-
examination that her daughter went alone to Hilsa Market. Her
son-in-law (appellant) had called her daughter on her mobile
phone, due to which she became suspicious that her son-in-law
had killed her daughter. Regarding recovery of the dead body,
her brother Govind Ravidas informed her, and her brother got
the information from the police. She, her daughter Namita
Kumari, her brother, and other family members were among
those who saw the dead body. She further deposed in paragraphs
nos. 21, 22, and 23 of her cross-examination that none of her
family members went with her daughter to Hilsa market, her
daughter used to talk with her husband on her mobile phone,
and her son-in-law (appellant) worked as a tractor driver in
Madras.
20. Prosecution witness Ram Pravesh Ravidas (PW-
3), is the uncle (in village relation) of the informant, who
deposed in his examination-in-chief that he went to the place of
occurrence and saw the beheaded body of the victim. The dead
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
21/50
body was found buried on the bank of the Falgu river and was
recovered by the police. He, his wife Devanti Devi, Bhajju
Ravidas, Chandradev Ravidas, Raj Kumar Ravidas, and others
also went to the place of occurrence. He further stated in his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 19
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
examination-in-chief that the recovered dead body was
identified as being that of Dhanita Kumari on the basis of a
small purse used for keeping jewelry. One toe ring, mangalsutra,
one pair of slippers of Lakhani company, and a broken pair of
silver anklets (payal) were also found near the dead body. He
further stated that the victim was of dark complexion, due to
which the appellant wanted to kill her. He further stated that the
information regarding the murder of the victim was received by
him two days after the occurrence from the informant and his
wife Munni Devi. Thereafter, immediately on that day,
information was given in written form to Ghosi police station by
the informant and his wife, and he was also with them. He stated
in paragraphs nos. 13 and 14 of his cross-examination that the
dead body was recovered ten days after the information of
murder of the victim had been given. There were no marks on
the recovered mangalsutra, anklets, or slippers. He further
deposed that the dead body was identified after seeing the
recovered articles, such as the purse, toe ring (bichhiya),
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
22/50
mangalsutra, slippers, and he also stated that the deceased was
of dark complexion and a sum of Rs. 25,000/- was demanded
from her, which could not be fulfilled, due to which she was
killed.
21. Prosecution witness Arun Bind (PW-4) is a formal
witness and he has proved the seizure list concerning the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 20
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
recovery of the articles with beheaded dead body and also
proved the recovery of the dead body. He has identified his
signature on the photocopy of the seizure list, which has been
marked as 'X'. He stated in his cross-examination that the
beheaded dead body was recovered in his presence and only the
skeleton of that body was recovered, so it was not possible to
determine whether the recovered skeleton was of a human
being.
22. Prosecution witness Govind Ravidas (PW-5),
maternal uncle of the victim, deposed in his examination-in-
chief that on 05.12.2010, the appellant and his cousin brother,
namely Lailun Ravidas, came to Hilsa Market and called his
niece Dhanita Kumari on her mobile phone and asked her to
come to Hilsa Market, saying that they would get ornaments
such as anklets, mangalsutra, chain, etc., prepared and would
give the same to her. Then his niece came to Hilsa Market to
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
23/50
meet her husband (appellant), and the appellant was contacted
on the mobile phone, upon which he assured them that he would
send the victim before evening to Bhatbhigha (victim's parental
village), but till evening, the appellant did not send her. When
his brother-in-law Yogendra Ravidas (informant) called the
victim, her mobile phone was found switched off. After that, he
got the information of the incident at night with regard to the
appellant's conduct and victim's disappearance and the fact that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 21
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
she did not return home. After that, they all started searching for
the victim. In that course, they also went to the victim's sasural,
Korma, but they did not find any trace of the victim. He further
stated in his examination-in-chief that after their attempts to
search for the victim, the incident was informed to Ghosi police
station. On 15.12.2010, the Officer-in-Charge (Bada babu) of
Ghosi police station phoned him, giving details of the recovery
of a female dead body on the bank of the Falgu River near
Korma village, and they were asked to come to identify the
body. Then they went to the place of recovery and saw the
victim's blue colour slipper (size 4) of Lakhani company, her
anklet, and a small garland having yellow and red pearls, pink
coloured bangles, yellow coloured hairband, a toe ring, and a
blue coloured small purse bearing the name Vijay Kumar-
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
24/50
Manish Kumar Verma Jewelers, Pitambarpur, and also a knife
with the dead body. These articles were recovered, and a seizure
list was prepared before him. The witness identified his
signature on the photocopy of the seizure list, which was
marked as 'X' for identification. He further stated that the
inquest report of the dead body was prepared before him, and he
identified his signature on the said inquest report, which was
marked as 'X/1' for identification. He further stated in
paragraph no. 11 of his cross-examination that the victim's body
was headless, and only on the basis of the articles found with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 22
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
the body they could have identified it as that of his niece
Dhanita Kumari. He also signed the fardbeyan of the informant
and identified his signature on the said fardbeyan, which was
marked as 'X/3'. Regarding the cause of the murder of the
victim, he stated the same reason as the other witnesses stated.
In his cross-examination, he stated that the factum of phone
communication made by the appellant with the victim was
informed to him by his brother-in-law Yogendra Ravidas on
05.12.2010
. When the victim was not found, he went to Ghosi police station to inform about the incident, but
his written application regarding the incident was not accepted by the police; rather, his mobile
number was taken. When the police Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
did not accept his written application, he went to the DSP, Hilsa, and gave a written application to
him, a copy of which he would produce before the court. He further stated that the complaint to the
DSP, Hilsa, was made on 10.12.2010, but the same was not registered, and thereafter, an application
was given to Hilsa Court on 10.12.2010. The witness was cross-examined at length regarding all
relevant facts stated by him in his examination-in- chief as well as on other aspects, and we do not
find any serious contradiction between the facts stated by him in his cross- examination and those in
his examination-in-chief as well as those stated by other witnesses.
23. Prosecution witness Devanti Devi (PW-6), the cousin sister-in-law of the deceased, testified
during her examination-in-chief that the victim, Dhanita Kumari, had passed away three years prior
to her testimony. She explained that the victim had been asked by her husband (the appellant) to
come to Hilsa market to buy an anklet and chain. The victim informed her mother, Munni Devi,
about the appellant's phone call. However, because the victim's second marriage (Rukhshadi Gauna)
had not yet been performed, her mother was initially reluctant to let her go. Despite this, PW-6 and
other villagers convinced the victim's mother to allow her to go, citing that the Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 victim had stayed at her in-laws' place on two or three
occasions in the past. PW-6 further stated that when the victim was preparing to leave for Hilsa
market, she offered to accompany her, but the victim declined, saying that the appellant had
specifically asked her to come alone. Later, when the victim did not return by evening, the victim's
mother called the appellant on his mobile phone, who claimed that the victim was not with him. The
next day, the victim's parents began searching for her and went to the appellant's village, Korma,
where his parents informed them that the victim had not arrived there. PW-6 continued that the
victim had gone to Hilsa market on the 5th, and on the 15th, Govind Ravidas (the victim's maternal
uncle) called the victim's mother to inform her that a dead body had been found on the banks of the
Falgu river. They were asked to come and identify the body. The witness's husband arranged for a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 23
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
vehicle, and victim's parents, along with Sanjay Ravidas and others, went to the riverbank at Korma,
where they identified the headless body as that of Dhanita Kumari based on a burn mark on the
hand. She also described the articles found with the body as detailed by other witnesses. In her
cross-examination, PW-6 confirmed that she had been present at the location where the body was
recovered, along with the victim's family. She also Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015
dt.26-09-2025 reiterated her earlier statement made to the police, wherein she had mentioned that
the appellant had called the victim and asked her to come to Hilsa market for the purpose of
purchasing an anklet and chain.
24. Prosecution witness Dr. Dinesh Kumar (PW-7) conducted the postmortem examination of the
recovered body. Upon external examination, he made the following observations:
(i) Rigor mortis was absent.
(ii) The postmortem was performed on a body that lacked both the head and neck.
(iii) Both legs had been amputated at the mid-thigh level.
(iv) Fine blisters were present on the skin.
During internal examination, he found that:
(i) Both chambers of the heart were empty.
(ii) The urinary bladder and stomach were also empty.
(iii) The lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys appeared pale He opined that death had
occurred due to injuries inflicted by a sharp cutting instrument. Regarding the
estimated time since death, he stated it was "more than 36 hours." He identified his
signature on the postmortem report, which was marked as Exhibit-1. In
cross-examination, he stated that visual identification of the body was difficult due to
the absence of the head, neck, and both legs from the mid-thigh level.
25. Prosecution witness Narendra Kumar Tiwari (PW- Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of
2015 dt.26-09-2025
8), who was the Block Development Officer (in short 'BDO') of Ghosi Circle, Jehanabad, testified
that on 15.12.2010 at approximately 8:30 A.M., he received a phone call from the Station House
Officer of Ghosi Police Station regarding the recovery of a partially buried body on the bank of the
Falgu River near Korma village. He immediately proceeded to the location, where he saw a crowd
and police personnel. Upon arrival, he observed the legs of a body, partially eaten by animals. The
body was exhumed in his presence and found to be headless. Near the body, a slipper and a small
purse containing various items were recovered. Upon examining these items, the relatives of the
deceased identified the body as that of Dhanita Kumari. The inquest report was then prepared in his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 24
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
presence, and a carbon copy was also made. He identified his signature on the carbon copy, which
was marked as Exhibit-2. During cross- examination, he stated that the body itself was
unidentifiable by appearance, but some individuals present identified it based on the recovered
articles.
26. Prosecution witness Kameshwar Singh (PW-9), the first Investigating Officer, deposed that he
recorded the fardbeyan of the informant on 15.12.2010 at around 11:30 A.M. on the bank of the
Falgu River near Korma village. He Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
identified and confirmed his signature on the fardbeyan, which was marked as Exhibit-3. Following
this, he himself took charge of the investigation. He stated that the body was found buried, with the
legs exposed but without flesh, possibly eaten by animals. Near the body, he recovered a
blue-colored money bag, bangles, a slipper, and a small purse bearing the name of "Vijay Kumar
Manish Kumar, Jewellers, Pitambarpur, Hilsa." The purse contained two (cid:128)10 currency notes, a
paper dated 23.09.2010, five pink bangles, red and yellow hair bands, and two broken silver anklets.
He informed the BDO of the recovery via mobile phone. Once the BDO arrived, the body was
exhumed in the presence of witnesses and was found to be headless. An inquest report was prepared
by him and signed by the BDO and two witnesses, namely Govind Ravidas and Arun Bind. He
identified his signature on the carbon copy of the inquest report, marked as Exhibit-4. He also
stated that several individuals, including the informant Yogendra Ravidas and others, identified the
body as that of Dhanita Kumari based on the articles found. He prepared a seizure list in the
presence of Govind Ravidas and Arun Bind, which was signed by them and marked as Exhibit-5. He
visited the scene of the occurrence, which was on the southern bank of the Falgu River near Korma
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 village, and prepared a site plan
marked as Exhibit-9. In cross- examination, he confirmed that although the body was headless,
identification was made based on its structure and the articles found. He further clarified that no
witness had seen the incident occur. He added that witness Rampravesh had stated that the body
was identified through recovered articles, which was also confirmed by Muna Devi. He also deposed
that the victim's brother (PW-1), son of the informant, had mentioned that the victim's in-laws were
found to be absconding. Additionally, he admitted that no missing report regarding the victim was
filed at Ghosi Police Station before 15.12.2010.
27. Prosecution witness Yogendra Ravidas (PW-10), the father of the deceased, supported the
prosecution's case in his examination-in-chief and was extensively cross-examined. In paragraphs 7,
10, and 11 of his cross-examination, he stated that when his daughter Dhanita Kumari did not return
from Hilsa market, no immediate report was lodged with Ghosi Police. The next day, when she was
still not found despite visiting the appellant's village, they went to Ghosi Police Station, but no case
was registered. He deposed that no complaint was made to senior police officers regarding this. He
explained that the victim had gone alone to Hilsa market at the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 appellant's request, as he had assured her that she would be sent to
her parental home that day. This led PW-10 to not feel any suspicion. He added that a case was
eventually filed at Hilsa Court 2-3 days prior to the recovery of the body. In paragraphs 17 and 19, he
stated that the recovered body was identified as that of Dhanita Kumari based on its structure, color,
and the items recovered. During the exhumation, villagers such as Ram Pravesh Ravidas (PW-3),
Devanti Devi (PW-6), and other family members were also present. In paragraph 25, he testified
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 25
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
that the victim's in-laws were not present at their residence (sasural), and inquiries made to
neighbors yielded no helpful information about their whereabouts. In paragraph 26, he stated that
he had accepted the demand of (cid:128)25,000 from the appellant but was unable to pay the amount due
to his poor financial condition.
28. Prosecution witness Umesh Kumar Singh (PW-
11), the second Investigating Officer, testified that he obtained six pages of call detail records
pertaining to the mobile numbers mentioned in the FIR. These records were procured from the
office of the Superintendent of Police, Jehanabad. He proved the call detail report, which was
marked as Exhibit-9.
Consideration and analysis :-
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
29. As per the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of judgments, the conviction
can be based solely on circumstantial evidence if the circumstances so established are consistent
only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and also conclusive in nature leaving no room of
any hypothesis of innocence of the accused in the alleged crime and the entire chain of
circumstances, is complete. In this regard, we would like to refer to the judgment rendered by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of SK. Yusuf vs. State of West Bengal, reported in (2011) 11 SCC 754
and the relevant paragraph No. 32 of this Judgment is being reproduced as under : -
"32. Undoubtedly, conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence.
However, the court must bear in mind while deciding the case involving the
commission of serious offence based on circumstantial evidence that the prosecution
case must stand or fall on its own legs and cannot derive any strength from the
weakness of the defence case. The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is
to be drawn should be fully established. The facts so established should be consistent
only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and they should not be
explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty. The
circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency. There must be a chain
of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion
consistent Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 with the
innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability that the act
must have been done by the accused."
30. In the present matter, the case of the prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence, so, we
would examine whether the crucial circumstances as they appear from the prosecution story
discussed in paragraph No. 3, are sufficient to establish the guilt of the appellant in connection with
the alleged crime and would further see whether all the alleged circumstances have been proved by
cogent and sufficient evidence of the prosecution and whether the same are so complete as to
removing any hypothesis of the appellant's innocence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 26
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
31. In a criminal case based on circumstantial evidence, motive assumes great significance as the
motive is considered to be a crucial link for establishing the prosecution's allegation. All the
prosecution's witnesses PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5, PW-6 and PW-10 have deposed that the
victim was of dark complexion, due to which, she was not liked by the appellant and his family
members and the accused also used to demand Rs. 25,000/- from the victim. Against this allegation,
the appellant did not succeed to elicit any fact/contradiction from the prosecution witnesses in their
cross-examination, as Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 such, we find
that the prosecution's allegation that the appellant did not like his wife (victim) on account of her
dark complexion can be deemed to be the main motive of the appellant to get rid of his wife. The
second important circumstance appearing from the prosecution story is that the appellant and his
cousin brother Lailun Das came to Hilsa market on 05.12.2010 and from there the appellant made a
mobile call on victim's phone and asked her to come to Hilsa market while saying that they would
get anklet prepared for her and would give it to her, and at that time, the appellant also talked to
victim's parents on mobile phone, thereafter, the victim went to Hilsa market but did not return
back till late evening. This part of the story shows four relevant circumstances, first, the appellant's
calling on mobile phone of the victim and persuading her to come to Hilsa market on the pretext of
buying anklet for her, secondly, the conversation between the appellant and the victim on mobile
phones during the relevant time, thirdly, the victim's going to Hilsa market within some hours of
receiving the appellant's call and fourthly, disappearance of the victim from the Hilsa market.
Regarding these circumstances, the prosecution's material witnesses PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, and
PW-10 remained firm to their stand and their evidence also remained consistent in their Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 examination-in-chief as well as
cross-examination, although they were cross-examined at length by the defence. It has transpired
from the evidence of prosecution's witnesses that the appellant used to talk with victim on her
mobile phone, hence the victim and her parental family members had no reason to disbelieve the
appellant, thus, a newly married wife going to the market at the instruction of her husband for
taking jewellery, like the victim of the present matter, is a probable conduct.
32. The victim's parents, father (PW-10), mother (PW-2) and her brother (PW-1) deposed that upon
getting call from the appellant on mobile phone of the victim, they allowed the victim to go to Hilsa
market. Though in this regard Devanti Devi( PW-6) stated that initially the victim's mother was
having some hesitation to send the victim to Hilsa market as at that time, Gauna (post ceremonial
marriage) had not taken place but after her persuasion and convincing her as also upon giving two
instances of victim having visited her sasural on earlier occasions, the victim's mother finally
became ready to send her. This witness has further deposed that when the victim was preparing to
go to Hilsa market, she proposed to go with her but the victim stated that the appellant had asked
her to come alone. Though these facts do not find place in the evidence of the Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 victim's parents and brother but upon these facts, these
witnesses were not cross-examined and it appears that PW-6 gave the details in depth regarding the
discussion which took place in the victim's parents' house after receiving the appellant's phone call
which is a natural conduct and also seems to be believable. The evidence of these witnesses is
sufficient to establish the appellant's phone call, the victim's preparation to go to Hilsa market, her
going to Hilsa market and thereafter, not returning back from the said market.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 27
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
A relevant fact can be proved by direct evidence and also by an indirect evidence, though direct
evidence has greater importance than the indirect evidence but an indirect evidence can also be
relevant and useful in establishing a crucial fact especially when an offense has been committed in a
premeditated or planned manner. As far as conversation between the appellant and the victim on
their mobile phones on 05.12.2010 is concerned, in this regard the details of their mobile phone
numbers was given in the FIR and the prosecution produced the call detail record (in short 'CDR')
pertaining to communication by mobile phones between them on 05.12.2010 and the same was
marked as Ext.-9 before the trial court.
33. The learned senior counsel appearing for the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015
dt.26-09-2025 appellant has vehemently argued that exhibit-9 is not admissible in evidence as it
comes in the purview of secondary electronic evidence, which can not be taken into consideration in
absence of required certificate which is mandatory under section 65(B) of the Indian Evidence Act.
Though the said submission is important but the facts of the present matter are entirely different as
firstly, the appellant did not raise any objection when Ext-9 was being marked as exhibit before the
trial court, thus if an objection on his part was raised at that time then definitely the prosecution
could have tried to remove the curable lacuna on its part by getting the required certificate from the
concerned mobile provider company. Secondly, the purpose of requirement of a certificate under
section 65(B) of the Indian Evidence Act in respect of a secondary electronic evidence, is only to
make such secondary evidence authentic and reliable but when the material fact relating to such
electronic evidence has been accepted by the concerned party then such evidence can not be thrown
out merely due to absence of required certificate. In the present matter, the main circumstance
relating to conversation by mobile phones between the appellant and the victim allegedly made
during the relevant time on 05.12.2010 appearing from the prosecution's evidences, was put before
the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 appellant while recording his
statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C., in which he accepted that communication. So, in view of
this admission as well as no objection being raised at the time of marking the CDR details on the
part of the appellant before the trial court, exhibit-9 showing details of communication by using
mobile phones can be taken into consideration and the same goes in favour of the prosecution to
establish the alleged conversation between the appellant and the victim. Furthermore, the ocular
evidence given by PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-6 and PW-10 is completely supportive and
consistent to the said communication. As such, there is sufficient material to establish the
communication.
34. All the material witnesses of the prosecution, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, have
deposed that the victim went alone to Hilsa market in the day time to meet her husband (appellant)
when he asked her to come to Hilsa market while saying that he would give her anklet and
thereafter, the victim did not return back. In this regard, all these witnesses were cross-examined at
length by the appellant before the trial court but they remained firm to their stand and their
credibility to the said circumstance could not be shaken by the appellant. The prosecution's evidence
clearly suggests that the victim was Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
lastly in the company of the appellant before she went missing. Though, to establish the victim's last
company with the appellant, there is no direct evidence but in view of the aforesaid discussed
circumstances, the factum of victim being in the company of appellant on 05.12.2010 seems to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 28
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
reliable and we are of the view that in the instant matter, there is sufficient material to presume the
circumstance as to the victim being in the company of appellant on 05.12.2010 at Hilsa market,
before she went missing, with the help of the provision contained in section 114 of the Indian
Evidence Act as the victim's going to Hilsa market at the direction/persuasion of the appellant to
meet him, was a normal and presumable conduct on her part and the same would have happened.
Accordingly, the circumstance as to the victim being with the appellant on 05.12.2010 and
thereafter, having gone missing, which is an important link in the alleged circumstances, can be
deemed to have been established in the present matter.
Though in the instant matter, there is no direct evidence to show the factum of last seen of the
victim with the appellant but as discussed above, as regards the victim's company with the appellant
in her last days particularly before she went missing, there is sufficient indirect evidence, so, in such
a situation, the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 appellant should
have offered his explanation before the trial court as to how and when he parted company from the
victim as also he should have furnished explanation to prove his separation from the victim after the
victim had met with him at Hilsa market but he failed to offer any explanation on this aspect and
further failed to discharge the burden cast upon him by section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act. It is
a settled principle of law that in a case mainly based on circumstantial evidence if the accused fails
to offer a reasonable explanation for not discharging the burden placed on him, that itself provides
an additional link in the chain of circumstances proved against him. In this regard, we would like to
refer to the observation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan vs. Kashi
Ram, reported in (2006) 12 SCC 254. and the relevant paragraph No. 23 of the said Judgment is
being reproduced as under : -
"23. It is not necessary to multiply with authorities. The principle is well settled. The
provisions of Section 106 of the Evidence Act itself are unambiguous and categoric in
laying down that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of a person, the
burden of proving that fact is upon him. Thus, if a person is last seen with the
deceased, he must offer an explanation as to how and when he parted company. He
must furnish an explanation which appears to the court to be probable and
satisfactory. If he does so he must be held to have discharged his burden. If he Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 fails to offer an explanation
on the basis of facts within his special knowledge, he fails to discharge the burden
cast upon him by Section 106 of the Evidence Act. In a case resting on circumstantial
evidence if the accused fails to offer a reasonable explanation in discharge of the
burden placed on him, that itself provides an additional link in the chain of
circumstances proved against him. Section 106 does not shift the burden of proof in a
criminal trial, which is always upon the prosecution. It lays down the rule that when
the accused does not throw any light upon facts which are specially within his
knowledge and which could not support any theory or hypothesis compatible with his
innocence, the court can consider his failure to adduce any explanation, as an
additional link which completes the chain. The principle has been succinctly stated in
Naina Mohd."

Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
Learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the appellant used to work in Madras (Chennai)
during the relevant period and Exhibit-9 does not show the tower location of the appellant's phone
being at Hilsa market on 05.12.2010. We do not find any force in the said contention as the factum
of appellant's presence at Madras on 05.12.2010 was in his special knowledge so the said defence
ought to have been proved by him in view of the provisions of section 106 of the Indian Evidence
Act, which could have been proved if there was any substance in his defence but the appellant
remained silent on this aspect.
35. The second circumstance relates to subsequent Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015
dt.26-09-2025 conduct of the appellant and his family members after disappearance of the victim.
As per the prosecution story narrated in the FIR and also in the light of the evidence given by the
prosecution witnesses, the parents of the victim as well as her some other relatives went to
appellant's village Korma on the next day of missing of the victim but neither the appellant nor his
family members were found in their house. Though in this regard, there is some contradiction in the
evidence of PW-6 but on this aspect, the said witness appears to be hearsay as she has deposed that
when the victim did not return back, the victim's parents started searching for her and visited the
relatives and also went to the appellant's village Korma. However, the other witnesses remained
consistent to the fact with regard to the appellant and his family members being found absconding
from their house when the victim's parents reached their house at Korma village and their evidence
appears to be reliable and the contradiction appearing from the evidence of PW-6 does not seem to
be material.
Although mere absconding of an accused after commission of the alleged crime can not establish his
guilt or his guilty conscience but in certain cases the same can constitute a relevant piece of
evidence, evidentiary value whereof depends Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015
dt.26-09-2025 upon the surrounding circumstances. In this regard, we would like to refer to the
observation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sekaran vs. State of Tamil Nadu reported
in (2024) 2 SCC 176 and relevant paragraph No. 30 is being reproduced as under :-
"30. Although not brought to our notice in course of arguments, it is revealed from
the oral testimony of PW 11 that the appellant could be apprehended 3 (three) years
after the incident from Puliyur road junction in (1 km away from Ambalakalai) in
Kerala after vigorous search. However, abscondence by a person against whom an
FIR has been lodged and who is under expectation of being apprehended is not very
unnatural. Mere absconding by the appellant after alleged commission of crime and
remaining untraceable for such a long time itself cannot establish his guilt or his
guilty conscience. Abscondence, in certain cases, could constitute a relevant piece of
evidence, but its evidentiary value depends upon the surrounding circumstances.
This sole circumstance, therefore, does not enure to the benefit of the prosecution."
36. Now, we come to the identification of the dead body. In the present matter, as per prosecution, a
headless human dead body was found in semi-buried condition on the bank of Falgu river near the
appellant's village. The body was exhumed before the BDO (PW-8) and victim's parents and other
relatives, including PW-6, who had also arrived at the place of recovery and witnessed the exhuming

Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
process.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025
37. In the case of recovery of torso (headless body), the identification of the body becomes very
difficult and in such a situation, the DNA profiling between the DNA samples of the recovered body
and from potential relatives can be the most scientific method to ascertain the identification
however, in the case of a woman, who was married 2 or 3 years back, for establishing her
identification, the articles particularly the ornaments and routine wearing apparel may be relevant
when the same are put before the close relatives of such women. In the present matter, though the
police did not proceed for DNA profiling, nonetheless several articles such as silver anklet, small
garland made of pearls, bangles, toe ring and a ladies purse, etc. were recovered with the dead body.
As the victim had been married 2 to 3 years back of the alleged occurrence and she had gone to meet
her husband on his call, so, it was natural for her to adorn herself by wearing bangles, anklet, toe
ring, etc. and by these articles, a married lady can be identified by her close relatives like parents
and her brother. As such, the articles detailed in the seizure list (Ext-5) which has been proved by
the investigating officer and PW-4 were completely helpful for PW- 1, PW-2 and PW-10, who
happen to be parents and brother of the deceased, to identify the dead body as being that of the
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 deceased Dhanita Kumari.
38. By referring to the evidence of PW-7, who conducted the postmortem examination, learned
counsel appearing for the appellant has argued that the recovered body was only a skeleton and also
headless, so, it will not be safe to assume it as being of a human and of the victim. Though PW-4,
before whom the seizure memo and inquest report were prepared, deposed that only a skeleton was
recovered from the recovery place but PW-7, who conducted postmortem examination, deposed that
on dissection, he found the vital organs being present in the body, such as, heart, lungs, urinary
bladder, spleen, liver, kidney, etc, and according to him, the time since death was 'more than 36
hours', so, in view of the finding given by PW-7, it can not be said that the recovered dead body was
merely a skeleton. As PW-4 is a rustic villager, hence, by seeing some leg bones of the recovered
body as also finding that some flesh of the body had been eaten by animals, he termed the body as
mere skeleton and in this regard, the evidence of PW-7 is reliable as he is a medical expert.
Furthermore, for establishing the identification of the recovered body, the seized articles detailed in
the exhibit-5 were more significant for the prosecution witnesses PW-1, PW-2 and PW-10 to identify
the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 body and the same appears to be
sufficient to establish the identification. Accordingly, the prosecution's plea that the recovered body
was that of the victim, seems to be reliable and on this aspect, we deem the trial court's finding to be
correct.
39. Now, we come to some other circumstances which are also relevant in the present matter. The
victim's parental village is situated in Nalanda district while the appellant's village Korma is situated
in Jehanabad district. As we have deemed that the human body recovered on the banks of Falgu
river was that of the victim, so, in view of this fact, we find that the said recovery was made near the
appellant's village and there was no reason for the victim to come alone at the said place while on
the other hand, the appellant had sufficient opportunity to bring the victim from Hilsa market to his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32949725/ 31
Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
village Korma for executing his plan at a secluded place on the banks of Falgu river. The other
circumstance is that the appellant used to talk with victim on her mobile phone and on 05.12.2010,
he talked with victim several times as also the victim herself made calls on the appellant's phone and
as per the prosecution case, the victim went to Hilsa market on 05.12.2010 and thereafter, went
missing. If the appellant was not present at Hilsa market during the relevant Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 period of time or had never asked the victim to come at
Hilsa market, then he should have made attempts to contact the victim by making phone calls on the
victim's mobile phone after she had gone missing but after 05.12.2010, till the recovery of the dead
body, he did not make any attempt in this regard as it reflected from the call details report (Ext-9),
which was possible only when the appellant had knowledge of the victim's location or about her
killing. Thus, the appellant's inaction in making further contact with victim in- between 06.12.2010
and 15.12.2010 on her mobile phone, goes against him and makes his subsequent conduct, after the
commission of the alleged occurrence, to be highly suspicious and makes the prosecution's case
strong.
40. The appellant's counsel has vehemently argued that between 05.12.2010 and 15.12.2010, no
attempt was made by the victim's father and other relatives to lodge a complaint at the police station
regarding missing of the victim and in this regard, reliance has been placed on the evidence of the
investigating officer (PW-9), thus the said unexplained long delay in lodging the FIR creates a
serious doubt about the prosecution's case. We find no force in the said contention as it has come in
the evidence of the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 prosecution's
witnesses that the victim's parents, brother and other relatives remained busy in searching for the
victim for some days after her disappearance and an attempt was also made to lodge a case at the
police station concerned which is sufficient to explain the delay which took place in lodging the FIR
by the informant. Further, it has come in the evidence of Govind Ravidas (PW-5) that an
information had been given to the Ghosi police station after disappearance of the victim and all the
material witnesses have deposed that after the recovery of the dead body, the police had first
informed the said Govind Ravidas who brought the factum of recovery of the said dead body in the
knowledge of the victim's parents. If the police had not received any information about the missing
of the victim then why did the police need to inform the victim's relative (uncle) about the recovery
of a headless body, suspecting it to be that of the victim and the said circumstance in itself shows
that the police had got information about the missing of the victim prior to recovery of the dead
body.
Conclusion : -
41. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and the evidence which has been
brought on Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.653 of 2015 dt.26-09-2025 record to prove the
allegations levelled against the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt, we are of the considered view
that though the instant matter is based on circumstantial evidence, however all the material
circumstances, right from the motive of the appellant to commit the alleged crime and
disappearance of victim till recovery of her dead body (torso), have been successfully established by
the prosecution before the trial court and the entire chain of the relevant circumstances is complete
without any missing crucial link. The above discussed circumstances clearly indicate the guilt of the

Chunnu Das vs The State Of Bihar on 26 September, 2025
appellant in the alleged crime of abduction of the victim, her disappearance and murder and dispel
any hypothesis of innocence of the appellant in the alleged offences, hence, we find no merit in this
appeal, consequently we do not find any reason to interfere with the conclusion and finding of the
trial court, leading to conviction of the appellant for the offences punishable under sections 364, 302
and 201 of the IPC and the ensuing sentence, by the impugned judgment of conviction dated
09.06.2015 and order of sentence dated 16.06.2015. In result, the instant appeal stands dismissed.

42. Let the judgment's copy be sent to the trial court along with the LCR forthwith for needful
information and compliance.
