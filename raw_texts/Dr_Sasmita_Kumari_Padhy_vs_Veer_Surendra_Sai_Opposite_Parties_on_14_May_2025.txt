effect.

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
Application for a period of three (3) years vide Office Order dt.22.07.2022 under Annexure-1 so
issued by the Registrar of the University-
Opp. Party No.3
3. It is contended that on receipt of the order so issued under Annexure-1, Petitioner though time
and again by making necessary application prayed for regularization of all relevant and important
documents/Registers prior to her taking over the charge of H.O.D of the Department of Computer
Application, but the same was never considered on the face of the applications made by the
Petitioner under Annexure-2.
// 3 // 3.1. On the face of such request made by the Petitioner, when vide another letter issued on
08.08.2022 under Annexure-3, Petitioner was again asked to take over the charge of H.O.D,
Department of Computer Application, Petitioner again reiterated her prayer for regularization of all
the documents/records prior to her taking over the charge of the Department on 10.08.2022 under
Annexure-4.
3.2. It is contended that without proper appreciation of the request made by the Petitioner under
Annexures-2 & 4, Petitioner vide letter dt.21.10.2022 under Annexure-5 was directed to explain in
writing as to why on the face of the letter issued by the University on 22.07.2022 under Annexure-1
and further letter issued on 08.08.2022 under Annexure-3, Petitioner has failed to take over the
charge of H.O.D, Department of Computer Application.
3.3. It is contended that on receipt of the show-cause issued under Annexure-5, Petitioner also gave
a detailed reply on 26.10.2022 under Annexure-6 inter alia indicating therein the ground for her not
taking over the charge. However, without proper appreciation of the difficulties pointed out by the
// 4 // Petitioner in her reply under Annexure-6 and so also the earlier request made under
Annexures-2 & 4, a proceeding was initiated against the Petitioner vide memorandum
dt.27.04.2023 under Annexure-7 inter alia with the following charge.
Article of Charges The statement of imputation of misconduct in respect of which the inquiry is
proposal to be held is set out in the statement of article of charges.
Charge No.-1 Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy, Associate Professor in the department of Computer
Application with approval of the competent authority vide office order No.VSSUT/OOR/301 dated
22.07.2022 was appointed as HOD in the department of Computer Application w.e.f 01.08.0222
with a tenure posting of 03 years. Also it was directed thereunder to take /handover charge by
31.07.2002. Dr. Padhy neithr complied the office order No.VSSUT/OOR/301 dated 22.07.2022 nor
took over charge of HOD, Computer Application.
Charge No.-2 Dr. Padhy instead of complying with office order No.VSSUT/OOR/301 dated
22.07.2022 remained complainant and did not cooperate with the administration. She wa again
directed vide letter No.VSSUT/Estt/2215 dated 08.08.2022 to takeover charge and report
compliance on or before 12.08.2022. However, she did not comply the instruction.

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
Dr. Padhy neither complied the office order NO.VSSUT/OOR/301 dated 22.07.2022 nor took over
charge. Again Dr. Padhy was intimated to comply vide letter No.VSSUT/Estt/2313 dated 19.08.2022
to comply the office order NO.VSSUT/OOR/301 dated 22.07.2022 positively on or before
22.08.2022. But she did not pay any heed. Dr. Padhy neither complied the office order // 5 //
No.VSSUT/OOR/301 dated 22.07.2022 nor took over charge.
Charge No.-3
Dr. Padhy in spite of receipt of letter
NO.VSSUT/Estt/2215 dated 08.08.2022 and
No.VSSUT/Estt/2313 dated 19.08.2022 with direction to take over charge as HOD of Computer
Application Department did not comply the order for which she was called upon to explain her
conduct/failure vide letter NO.VSSUT/Estt/2783 dated 21.10.2022 and to submit a written reply
within 07 days. In reply as her written explanation, she has taken plea to justify her inaction vide her
reply dated 26.10.2022 which was found to be not satisfactory.
3.4. It is contended that such a proceeding was initiated against the Petitioner in terms of the
provisions contained under Rule 15 of the OCS (CC & A ) Rules, 1962 (in short, "Rules"). Learned
Counsel appearing for the Petitioner contended that on receipt of the charges, so framed against the
Petitioner vide memorandum dt.27.04.2023 under Annexure-7, Petitioner vide letter dt.30.04.2023
when sought for various documents in order to enable her to file the written statement of defence
under Annexure-8 as well as under Annexure-9 series, but Petitioner was never provided with such
documents as prayed for. Instead vide Office order dt.04.07.2023 under Annexure-10, Opp. Party
No.3 appointed the Inquiry Officer to proceed with the inquiry in the proceeding so initiated against
the Petitioner.
// 6 // 3.5. It is contended that Petitioner vide another representation dt.07.07.2023 under
Annexure-11 though raised objection with regard to appointment of the Inquiry Officer as well as
Marshalling Officer, but no action was taken either to supply the documents in order to enable the
Petitioner to submit her written statement of defence or for change of Inquiry Officer as well as the
Marshalling Officer. In the alternate, Petitioner was issued with a notice on 14.07.2023 under
Annexure-12 asking her to participate in the inquiry.
3.6. Learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner contended that since Petitioner was never
provided with the documents as requested, nor any action was taken to change the Inquiry Officer as
well as the Marshalling Officer as prayed for, Petitioner could not participate in the proceeding by
taking her defence. However, vide another letter issued on 04.08.2023 under Annexure-14,
Petitioner when was again asked to participate in the inquiry, Petitioner taking into account the
conduct of the University, did not participate in the proceeding.
But vide letter dt.05.09.2023 under Annexure-15, Petitioner was issued with the 1st show-cause
along with the inquiry // 7 // report as provided under Rule 15 (10)(i)(a) of the Rules. The Inquiry
Officer in his report enclosed to Annexure-15 gave the following finding :

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
12. Conglomerating the analysis and findings as discussed above it is now clearly
established that the CSE by her conduct has not carried out the orders or acted
according to the instruction of her superior authorities so far as her official duties are
concerned and thereby has violated Rule 3 of OGS Conduct Rule-1959. She has also
filed to maintain absolute integrity decorum of conduct and devotion to duty and
failed to discharge duty properly amount to violation of Rule 3(b) of OGS Conduct
Rule-1959. In addition, CSE has committed misconduct by disobedience to the order
of superior by not carrying out their orders and not acting to the instruction of her
superior Authority resulting in violation of Rule 4 OGS Conduct Rule-1959. Hence
the charges on all count are established and To Sum up -

3. Disobedience of order of Rule 4 Established
higher Authority and failing

3.7. It is contended that in the meantime, challenging the proceeding as well as
appointment of the Inquiry Officer with submission of the inquiry report, Petitioner
though // 8 // approached this Court in W.P.(C ) No.31857 of 2023, but the same was
permitted to be withdrawn vide order dt.29.09.2023 under Annexure-16. Petitioner
thereafter vide letter dt.02.10.2023 under Annexure-17, submitted her reply to the
inquiry report with a prayer to withdraw the charge-sheet so initiated against her
vide memorandum dt.27.04.2023.
However, it is contended that without issuing the 2nd show-
cause as provided under Rule 15(10) (i)(b) of the Rules, Petitioner was imposed with the impugned
order of punishment vide Office order dt.03.10.2023 of Opp. Party No.2, by imposing the
punishment of compulsory retirement with immediate effect.
3.8. Learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner vehemently contended that since the proceeding
under Annexure-7 was initiated under Rule-15 of the Rules, without issuing a 2nd show-cause,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 4
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
proposing the punishment to be imposed in terms of the provision contained under Rule
15(10)(i)(b) of the Rules, no order of punishment could have been imposed and that too imposing
the punishment of compulsory retirement, which is a major punishment // 9 // 3.9. It is contended
that since prior to such imposition of punishment, Petitioner was never issued with the 2nd show-
cause, the same is a nullity in the eye of law. In support of the same, reliance was placed to a
decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (1991) 1 SCC 588, Union of India and Others Vs.
Mohd. Ramzan Khan. Hon'ble Apex Court in para 13,14 & 15 has held as follows:
13. Several pronouncements of this Court dealing with Article 311(2) of the
Constitution have laid down the test of natural justice in the matter of meeting the
charges. This Court on one occasion has stated that two phases of the inquiry
contemplated under Article 311(2) prior to the Forty-second Amendment were
judicial. That perhaps was a little stretching the position. Even if it does not become a
judicial proceeding, there can be no dispute that it is a quasi-judicial one. There is a
charge and a denial followed by an inquiry at which evidence is led and assessment of
the material before conclusion is reached. These facets do make the matter quasi-
judicial and attract the principles of natural justice. As this Court rightly pointed out in the Gujarat
case [(1969) 2 SCC 128 : (1970) 1 SCR 251] , the disciplinary authority is very often influenced by the
conclusions of the Inquiry Officer and even by the recommendations relating to the nature of
punishment to be inflicted. With the Forty-second Amendment, the delinquent officer is not
associated with the disciplinary inquiry beyond the recording of evidence and the submissions made
on the basis of the material to assist the Inquiry Officer to come to his conclusions. In case his
conclusions are kept away from the delinquent officer and the Inquiry Officer submits his
conclusions with or without recommendation as to punishment, the delinquent is precluded from
knowing the contents thereof although such material is used against him by the disciplinary
authority. The report is an adverse material if the Inquiry Officer records a finding of guilt and
proposes a punishment so far as the delinquent is concerned. In a quasi- judicial matter, if the
delinquent is being deprived of knowledge of the material against him though the same is made
available to the punishing authority in the matter of reaching his conclusion, rules of natural justice
would be // 10 // affected. Prof. Wade has pointed out: [ Administrative Law, 6th edn., p. 10] "The
concept of natural justice has existed for many centuries and it has crystallised into two rules: that
no man should be judge in his own cause; and that no man should suffer without first being given a
fair hearing.... They (the courts) have been developing and extending the principles of natural justice
so as to build up a kind of code of fair administrative procedure, to be obeyed by authorities of all
kinds. They have done this once again, by assuming that Parliament always intends powers to be
exercised fairly."
14. This Court in Mazharul Islam Hashmi v. State of U.P. [(1979) 4 SCC 537 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 54]
pointed out:
"Every person must know what he is to meet and he must have opportunity of
meeting that case. The legislature, however, can exclude operation of these principles
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 5
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
expressly or implicitly. But in the absence of any such exclusion, the principle of
natural justice will have to be proved."
15. Deletion of the second opportunity from the scheme of Article 311(2) of the Constitution has
nothing to do with providing of a copy of the report to the delinquent in the matter of making his
representation. Even though the second stage of the inquiry in Article 311(2) has been abolished by
amendment, the delinquent is still entitled to represent against the conclusion of the Inquiry Officer
holding that the charges or some of the charges are established and holding the delinquent guilty of
such charges. For doing away with the effect of the enquiry report or to meet the recommendations
of the Inquiry Officer in the matter of imposition of punishment, furnishing a copy of the report
becomes necessary and to have the proceeding completed by using some material behind the back of
the delinquent is a position not countenanced by fair procedure. While by law application of natural
justice could be totally ruled out or truncated, nothing has been done here which could be taken as
keeping natural justice out of the proceedings and the series of pronouncements of this Court
making rules of natural justice applicable to such an inquiry are not affected by the Forty-second
Amendment. We, therefore, come to the conclusion that supply of a copy of the inquiry report along
with recommendation, if any, in the matter of proposed punishment to be inflicted would be within
the rules of natural justice and the delinquent would, therefore, be entitled to the supply of a copy
thereof. The Forty-second Amendment has not brought about any change in this position.
// 11 // 3.10. A further submission was also made that since Petitioner by the time the proceeding
was initiated against her was working as against the post of Associate Professor, in terms of the
provisions contained under Section 20(ix) of the VSSUT Act, 2008 (in short, "Act"), the proceeding
in question should have been initiated by the Board of Management of the University. Section 20(ix)
of the Act reads as follows:
20(ix) To suspend, discharge, dismiss or otherwise take disciplinary action against
teachers and officers of and above the rank of Assistant Registrar.
3.11. A further submission was also made that since the Petitioner after being asked
to take over the charge of H.O.D of the Department of Computer Application,
Petitioner raised a genuine grievance for her to take over the charge under
Annexures-2 & 4, without taking a decision on such prayer made by the Petitioner,
Petitioner should not have been proceeded with, in the proceeding initiated vide
memorandum dtd.27.04.2023.
3.12. It is also contended that taking into account the nature of charges framed
against the Petitioner vide memorandum dt.27.04.2023 under Annexure-7,
punishment of // 12 // compulsory retirement from service is also disproportionate
to the alleged mis-conduct, if any. In support of the same, reliance was placed to the
following decisions.

to 16)

(para-23).
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Bhagat Ram, in para 13 to 16 has held as follows:
xxx xxx xxx
13. That conclusion poses another question as to what relief we should give in this appeal. Ordinarily
where the disciplinary enquiry is shown to have been held in violation of principle of natural justice,
the enquiry would be vitiated and the order based on such enquiry would be quashed by issuance of
a writ of certiorari. It is well settled that in such a situation, it would be open to the Disciplinary
Authority to hold the enquiry afresh. That would be the normal consequence.
14. We invited Mr Talukdar, learned counsel for the respondent State to address us on the question
whether the game of holding // 13 // the fresh enquiry is worth the battle. Moreso looking to the fact
that there is a very minor infraction of duty leading to a trivial charge of negligence in performance
of duty which has caused no loss to the Government, we are of the opinion that it would not be fair
to this low-paid Class IV government servant to face the hazards of a fresh enquiry.
15. The question is once we quash the order, is it open to us to give any direction which would not
permit a fresh enquiry to be held? After all what is the purpose of holding a fresh enquiry?
Obviously, it must be to impose some penalty. It is equally true that the penalty imposed must be
commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct, and that any penalty disproportionate to the
gravity of the misconduct would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Having been
influenced by all these relevant considerations, we are of the opinion that no useful purpose would
be served by a fresh enquiry. What option is open to us in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article
136 to make an appropriate order. We believe that justice and fairplay demand that we make an
order of minor penalty here and now without being unduly technical apart jurisdiction, we are
fortified in this view by the decision of this Court in Hindustan Steels Ltd., Rourkela v.A.K. Roy
[(1969) 3 SCC 513 : AIR 1970 SC 1401 :
(1970) 3 SCR 343 : (1970) 1 LLJ 228] where this Court after quashing the order of
reinstatement proceeded to examine whether the party should be left to pursue
further remedy. Other alternative was to remand the matter that being a case of an
industrial dispute to the Tribunal. It is possible that on such a remand, this Court
further observed, that the Tribunal may pass an appropriate order but that would
mean prolonging the dispute which would hardly be fair to or conducive to the
interest of the parties. This Court in such circumstances proceeded to make an
appropriate order by awarding compensation. We may adopt the same approach.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 7
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
Keeping in view the nature of misconduct, gravity of charge and no consequential
loss, a penalty of withholding his increments with future effect will meet the ends of
justice. Accordingly, two increments with future effect of the appellant be withheld
and he must be paid 50 percent of the arrears from the date of termination till the
date of reinstatement.
16. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. The Order dated May 6, 1977 removing the appellant from
service and the Order dated January 31, 1978 of the Chief Conservator of Forest, Himachal Pradesh,
Simla dismissing his appeal and the Order of the High Court dismissing his petition in limine are
quashed and set aside. The appellant is reinstated in service. His two increments with future effect
shall be withheld. He should be paid 50 per cent of the arrears of salary from the date of termination
till the date of reinstatement. The period between the date of termination of service and
reinstatement shall be treated for other purposes as on duty. The Order reinstating the appellant in
service must be carried out within four weeks from today and the arrears shall be paid within four
weeks thereafter.
// 14 // Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Ranjit Thakur in para 9 & 10 has held as follows:

9. The proceedings do not indicate -- this was not disputed at the hearing -- that appellant was asked
whether he objects to be tried by any officer, sitting at the court-martial. This, in our opinion,
imparts a basic infirmity to the proceedings and militates against and detracts from the concept of a
fair trial.
10. The "Act" constitutes a special law in force conferring a special jurisdiction on the court-martial
prescribing a special procedure for the trial of the offences under the "Act" Chapter VI of the "Act"
comprising of Sections 34 to 68 specifies and defines the various offences under the "Act". Sections
71 to 89 of Chapter VII specify the various punishments. Rules 106 to 133 of the Army Rules, 1954
prescribe the procedure of, and before, the summary court- martial. The Act and the Rules
constitute a self-contained code, specifying offences and the procedure for detention, custody and
trial of the offenders by the courts martial.
Xxx xxx xxx This Court in case of Jogeswar Bagh, in para 9 to 31 has held as follows:
9. Admittedly, the process required under Rule 15 (10)(i)(a) of the Rules, 1962 to
serve the copy of the inquiry report along with proposed punishment had not been
complied with. More so, the question of taking into consideration his past conduct
was unwarranted and impermissible as it had never been a part of the so called show
cause/charge sheet. The non-issuance of second show cause along with inquiry report
may not be fatal in every case if it is established that no prejudice has been caused to
the delinquent employee. But in a case like instant, where inquiry had been
concluded merely taking into consideration the explanation furnished by the
delinquent employee to the show cause/charge-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 8
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
sheet it may be fatal. In such a fact-situation, it was unwarranted for the Inquiring Officer to make
comment that delinquent employee had threatened the Presiding Officer, he was arrogant and
caused a great problem for the department. More so, the Disciplinary Authority could not have
considered his past conduct as such a course would violates the principles of natural justice as the
Petitioner had no opportunity to furnish any explanation on those issues. It is for the Opposite
Parties to establish that non-compliance of the statutory requirements has not caused any prejudice
at all. Proof of prejudice is unnecessary where requirement of statutory provision is mandatory. "It
will come from a person who has denied justice that the person who has been denied justice is not
prejudiced." (Vide S.L.Kapoor v. Jagmohan and Ors.
// 15 // MANU/SC/0036/1980: [1981]1SCR746; and State of U.P. v. Shatrughan Lal and Anr.
MANU/SC/0554/1998: [1998]3SCR939.)
10. Against the order of the Disciplinary Authority, Petitioner preferred an appeal before the
Appellate Committee of this Court, but the same has been dismissed by the Committee without
11. The alleged show cause/charge sheet seems to be only a notice of holding a preliminary inquiry
and the purpose of holding the preliminary inquiry is only to have a finding of fact as to whether
regular disciplinary proceedings are required to be held, and no punishment can be imposed on
that. A preliminary Inquiry has nothing to do with the inquiry conducted after issue of charge-sheet,
unless it is to be relied upon in regular inquiry, (vide Amlendu Ghosh v. District Traffic
Superintendent, North-Eastern Railway, Katiyar MANU/SC/0318/1960:
(1960) IILLJ61SC; Champak Lal Chiman La Shah v. Union of India
MANU/SC/0274/1963: (1964)ILLJ752SC; Government of India Ministry of Home
Affairs and Ors. v. Tarak Nath Ghosh, MANU/SC/0691/1971:
(1971)ILLJ299SC; and Narayan Dattaraya Ramteerathakhar v. State of Maharashtra
and Ors. MANU/SC/0526/1997: AIR1997SC2148).
12. The scope of judicial review in such matter is limited to the process of decision making and not
against the decision itself as it lies to correct the errors of law or fundamental procedural
requirements which may lead to manifest injustice. The Court can interfere with the impugned
order in exceptional, circumstances. In exercise of such a power, the High Court cannot trench on
the jurisdiction of the statutory authority to re-appreciate the evidence and to arrive at its own
conclusion. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which the
decision is made. When the conclusion of the authority is based on evidence, the Court is devoid of
power to re-appreciate the evidence. Interference is permissible provided the Court comes to the
conclusion that the finding of fact recorded by the authority is not based on facts or authority falls to
take into consideration the relevant facts. (Vide Rae Bareli Kshetriya Gramin Bank v. Bhola Nath
Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0455/1997: (1999)ILLJ947SC The General Court Marti] and Ors. v. Col.
Aniltej Singh Dhaliwal MANU/SC/0902/1998 1998CriLJ1402; N.R. Nair and Ors., v. Union of India
and rs. MANU/SC/0284/2001 [2001]3SCR353; and S.J.S. Business Enterprises (P) Ltd., v. State of
Bihar and Ors., MANU/SC/0236/2004: AIR2004SC2421).

13. It is equally well settled that where a quasi-judicial authority record findings based on no legal
evidence and the findings are either his ipse dixit or based on conjectures and surmises, the order
suffers from the infirmity of non-application of mind and stands vitiated, and such a finding can be
held to be perverse and hence unsustainable (vide Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Administration
MANU/SC/0285/1984).
14. In Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay & Rs., v. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., and Ors.
MANU/SC/0181/1983:
[1983]1441TR225(SC), the Apex Court held as under:
// 16 // It must act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations,
must not be swayed by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes
allen to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act,and must
not act arbitrarily or capriciously.
15. In Smt. Shalini Soni v. Union of India MANU/SC/0227/1980:
1980CriLJ1487, the Supreme Court held:
It is an unwritten rule of the law, constitutional and administrative, that whenever a
decision making function is entrusted to the subjective satisfaction of a statutory
functionary, there is an implicit obligation to apply his mind to pertinent and
proximate matters only, eschewing the irrelevant and the remote.
16. The ground for interference may be where the Court comes to the conclusion that exercise of
power is manifestly arbitrary unreasonably or there is manifest error in the exercise of such power
or in isolation of the statutory provision or error of law apparent the face of the record. (Vide State
of U.P. & Os. v. Renusagar Power Co. and Ors.

17. In CIT (Central), Calcutta v. Daulat Ram Rawatmull MANU/SC/0290/1972:
[1973]871TR349(SC), the Supreme Court held as under:
There should, in our opinion, be direct nexus between the conclusion of fact arrived
at by the authority concerned and the primary facts upon which that conclusion is
based. The use of extraneous and irrelevant material in arriving at that conclusion
would vitiate the conclusion of fact because it is difficult to predicate as to what
extent the extraneous and irrelevant material has influenced the authority in arriving

at the conclusion of fact.
18. In H.B. Gandhi, Excise and Taxation Officer-cum-Assessing Authority, Karnal and Ors. 1992
Supp. (2) SCC 312, the Supreme Court held that "if a finding of fact is arrived at by Ignoring or
excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration irrelevant material or if the findings so
outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality incurring the blame of being
perverse, then the findings are rendered infirm in law."
19. The scope of judicial review against quantum of punishment is also very limited. The issue has
been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court time and again and it has been held that if the
punishment awarded is disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct, it would be arbitrary and
would violate the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution. (Vide Bhagat Ram v. State of // 17 //
Himachal Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/0322/1983:

MANU/SC/0118/1996: (1996)ILL)1231SC).
20. In Ranjeet Thakur (supra), the Apex Court observed as under
But the sentence has to suit the offence and the offender. It should not be vindictive
or unduly harsh. It should not be so disproportionate to the offence as to shock the
conscience and amount in itself to conclusive evidence of bias. The doctrine of
proportionality, as part of the concept of judicial review, would ensure that even on
the aspect, which is otherwise, within the exclusive province of the Court Martial, if
the decision of the Court even" as to sentence is an outrageous defiance of logic, then
the sentence would not be immune from correction. In the present case, the
punishment is so stringently disproportionate as to call for and justify interference. It
cannot be allowed to remain uncorrected in judicial review.
21. The said Judgment has been approved and followed by the Apex Court in Union of India and
Ors. v. G. Ganayutham MANU/SC/0834/1997: (2000) IILLJ648SC, and after examining
elaborately the concept of reasonableness, rationality and proportionality, the same view has been
reiterated.
22. In B.C. Chaturvedi (supra), after examining various earlier decisions of Supreme Court, the
Court observed that in exercise of the powers of judicial review, the court cannot "normally"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 11
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
substitute its own conclusion or penalty. However, if the Court penalty imposed by an Authority
"shocks the conscience" of the Court, it would appropriately mould the relief either directing the
Authority to reconsider the penalty imposed and in exceptional and rare cases, in order to shorten
the litigation, itself, impose appropriate punishment with cogent reasons in support thereof. While
examining the issue of proportionality, Court can also consider the circumstances under which the
misconduct was committed. In a given case, the prevailing circumstances might have forced him to
do so, though he had no intention to do so. (Vide Giriraj Sharma (supra). The Court may further
examine the effect, if order is set aside or substituted by some other penalty.
23. In G. Ganayutham (supra), the Apex Court has considered the entire law on the subject and
compared the Indian Law with English, Australian and Canadian Laws, and held that in case the
Court comes to the conclusion that the punishment awarded is disproportionate or the Disciplinary
Authority was irrational in // 18 // imposing the punishment, the punishment cannot be quashed as
even then the matter has to be remitted back to the appropriate authority for reconsideration and it
is only in very rare cases that the Court might to shorten the litigation-think of substituting its own
view as to the quantum of punishment in place of punishment awarded by the Competent Authority.
In Aniltej Singh Dhaliwal (supra); U.P.S.R.T.C. and Ors. v. A.K. Paru MANU/SC/0030/1999:
AIR1999SC1552; and Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd. v. U.T., Chandigarh and Ors.
MANU/SC/1098/2003: (2004)2SCC130, the Apex Court has taker the same view.
24. In v. Ramana v. A.P.S.R.T.C. and Ors. MANU/SC/0539/2005:
(2005)1IILLJ725SC the Supreme Court reconsidered the whole issue, compared the
Indian Law with English Law on judicial review and after placing reliance on large
number of Judgments, came to the conclusion that every administrative order should
be rational and reasonable and the order should not suffer from any arbitrariness.
The scope of judicial review as to the quantum of punishment is permissible only if it
is found that it is not commensurate with the gravity of the charges and if the Court
comes to the conclusion that the scope of judicial review as to the quantum of
punishment is permissible only if it is found to be "shocking to the conscious of the
Court, in the sense that it was in defiance of logic or moral standards." In a normal
course, if the punishment imposed is shockingly disproportionate, it would be
appropriate to direct the Disciplinary Authority to reconsider the penalty imposed.
However, in order to shorten the litigation, it may, in exceptional and rare cases,
itself can impose appropriate punishment by recording cogent reasons in support
thereof.
25. In the case of State of Meghalaya and Ors. v. Mecken Singh N. MarakAIR 2008 SC 4726, the
Supreme Court has observed that a Court or a tribunal while dealing with the quantum of
punishment has to record reasons as to why it is felt that the punishment is not commensurate with
the proved charges. In the matter of imposition of sentence, the scope for interference is very limited
and restricted to exceptional cases. The jurisdiction of High Court to interfere with the quantum of
punishment is limited and cannot be exercised without sufficient reasons. The High Court, although
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 12
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
has jurisdiction in appropriate case, to consider the question in regard to the quantum of
punishment, but it has a limited role to play. It is now well settled that the High Courts, in exercise
of powers under Article 226, do not interfere with the quantum of punishment unless there exist
sufficient reasons therefore. The punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the Appellate
Authority unless shocking to the conscience of the Court, cannot be subjected to judicial review.
26. in State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. v. Hazarilal MANU/SC/0870/2008: (2008)IILLJ715SC,
the Apex Court held that issue of proportionality may always be determined by the Court and Court
is clear with the order of determination. While // 19 // deciding the said case, Apex Court placed
reliance on its earlier Judgments in Coimbatore District Central Cooperative Bank v. Coimbatore
District Central Co-operative Bank Employees Association and Anr. MANU/SC/2117/2007
(2007)IILLJ724SC and M.P. Gangadharan and Anr. v. State of Kerala and Ors.
MANU/SC/8167/2006: AIR2006SC2360.
27. In Bharat Forge Co. Ltd. v. Uttam Manohar Nakate MANU/SC/0043/2005: (2005)ILLJ738SC
the Apex Court placing reliance upon its earlier Judgments in Colour-Chem Ltd. v. A.L. Alaspurkar
and Ors. MANU/SC/0096/1998: [1998]1SCR663 and Regional Manager, Rajasthan Road Transport
Corporation v. Sohan Lal MANU/SC/0841/2004: (2004) IIILLJ1078SC held that in case the past
conduct is not: part of the charge-sheet, punishment should not be awarded considering the same, it
would amounts to violation of principle of natural justice.
28. Similar view has been reiterated by the Apex Court in Indra Bhanu v. Committee, Management
of M.M. Degree College and Ors.MANU/SC/0894/2003.
29. Thus, it is evident that scope of judicial review is limited to the extent that Court may examine
whether inquiry has been conducted in consonance with the statutory requirement and authority
has given strict adherence to the principles of natural justice, the decision has been taken relying
upon relevant materials and order is not perverse being based on irrelevant materials and the
delinquent had been given a fair opportunity to meet the charge and punishment is not
disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct. In exceptional circumstances, where the
punishment imposed is disproportionate to the delinquency to the extent that it shocks the
conscience of the Court, the Court may interfere with the quantum of punishment also.
30. If the instant case is examined in the light of the aforesaid settled legal propositions, we are of
the view that the Disciplinary Proceedings have been conducted and concluded in utter disregard to
the statutory provisions. The alleged show cause/charge-sheet seems to be basically to find out a fact
as to whether there was sufficient material against the delinquent on the basis of which a regular
inquiry could be held. The Registrar-cum-Presiding Officer treated the reply to the said show cause
as a confession/admission of guilt and recommended severe punishment so that other employees
may also learn a lesson. It was further observed by him that the delinquent employee had
threatened the Presiding Officer concerned and he caused a problem for the department. The said
remarks in his report were unwarranted and uncalled for and could not have been made as the same
has not been the case of any person nor these allegations have been mentioned in the alleged show
cause/charge sheet. He made unwarranted observations without any basis and foundation. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 13
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
Disciplinary Authority went further // 20 // taking into consideration the past conduct of the
employee though it was not permissible for him to do so and imposed the punishment of removal
basing on the same though it has never been disclosed to the Petitioner. Copy of the Inquiry Report
along with second show cause notice had never been served upon the Petitioner/delinquent. Had it
been served upon him, he could have furnished explanation for the same. Thus it is not a case in
which it can be safely held that cause of the Petitioner had not been prejudiced. As the inquiry had
been concluded relying upon the admission of the delinquent employee and that too taking into
consideration the explanation furnished by the Petitioner to the so called show cause/charge-sheet
the punishment so imposed is disproportionate to the extent that it shocks the conscience of the
Court.
31. In view of the above, the Writ Petition succeeds and is allowed. The order of punishment is
hereby set aside. The Petitioner be reinstated in service with consequential benefits. In view of the
fact that Petitioner had been out of service for a long time, he might be in gainful employment,
therefore the issue of grant of back wages is considered. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner fairly
conceded that he would be satisfied if 20% of the back wages are awarded to the Petitioner. In view
of thereof, we direct the Opposite Parties- authorities to make the payment of 20% of the back wages
from the date of removal till the date of joining. The same shall be paid within a period of three
months from the date of joining. No costs.

23. However, it is well known that except the cases where the punishment is shockingly
disproportionate, the superior courts would not ordinarily interfere with the quantum of
punishment. In State Bank of Hyderabad v. P. Kata Rao [(2008) 15 SCC 657 :
(2008) 6 Scale 575] this Court held:
"There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the jurisdiction of superior courts in
interfering with a finding of fact arrived at by the enquiry officer is limited. The High
Court, it is trite, would also ordinarily not interfere with the quantum of
punishment...."

3.13. It is accordingly contended that since prior to imposing the order of
punishment, no 2nd show-
cause was issued which is a mandatory requirement as provided under Rule
15(10)(i)(b)of the Rules and the punishment of compulsory retirement from service is
shockingly disproportionate to the alleged charges, the impugned order of
punishment passed vide the impugned order dt.03.10.2023 under Annexure-18 is
liable for interference of this Court.
4. Mr. N.K. Sahu, learned counsel appearing for the University on the other hand
made his submission basing on the stand taken in the counter affidavit so filed by the
University.
4.1. It is the main contention of the learned counsel appearing for the University that
since as provided under Clause-107(2) of the VSSUT Statute, there is a remedy of
appeal to the Chancellor against any order passed by the Board or the
Vice-Chancellor, Petitioner since has not availed the alternative remedy of appeal so
available to her, the Writ Petition is not // 22 // maintainable. In support of the
same, reliance was placed on the following decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court
1. State of U.P. Vs. Mohd. Nooh, AIR 1958 S.C page 86
2. Baburam Prakash Chandra Maheshwari v.
AntarimZila Parish Ad Now ZilaParishad, AIR 1969 S.C 556 (Para-3).
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mohd. Nooh in Para 19 has held as follows:
19. I think it is elementary that, save in exceptional cases, the courts will not interfere
under Article 226 until all normal remedies available to a petitioner have been
exhausted. The normal remedies in a case of this kind are appeal and revision. It is
true that on a matter of jurisdiction, or on a question that goes to the root of the case,
the High Courts can entertain a petition at an earlier stage but they are not bound to
do so and a petition would not be thrown out because the petitioner had done that
which the Courts usually direct him to do, namely, to exhaust his normal remedies
before invoking an extraordinary jurisdiction. Therefore, if this order of dismissal
had been made after the Constitution, the petitioner would have been expected to
pursue his remedies of appeal and revision first and could not have come to the High
Court in the ordinary way until he had exhausted them; and having come at that
stage he could not have been turned away unheard on the ground that he was out of
time because his grievance was against the original order. The very decisions to which
my Lord has referred establish that for these purposes, at any rate, the earlier orders
would merge in the final one. But I am not basing on technicalities. What is plain to
me is that if this order of dismissal had been made after the Constitution, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 15
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
petitioner would have been entitled to wait for the final order (and in the ordinary
way would have been bound to wait) before coming to the High Court. Why is the
position any different because he has done before the Constitution exactly what he
would have been expected, and in the ordinary course bound, to do after it?
// 23 // Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Baburam Prakash Chandra
Maheshwari, in Para 3 has held as follows:
3. It is a well-established proposition of law that when an alternative and equally
efficacious remedy is open to a litigant he should be required to pursue that remedy
and not to invoke the special jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a prerogative
writ. It is true that the existence of a statutory remedy does not affect the jurisdiction
of the High Court to issue a writ. But, as observed by this Court in Rashid Ahmed v.
Municipal Board, Kairana [1950 SCC 221 : 1950 SCR 566] "the existence of an
adequate legal remedy is a thing to be taken into consideration in the matter of
granting writs" and where such a remedy exists it will be a sound exercise of
discretion to refuse to interfere in a writ petition unless there are good grounds
therefor. But it should be remembered that the rule of exhaustion of statutory
remedies before a writ is granted is a rule of self imposed limitation, a rule of policy,
and discretion rather than a rule of law and the court may therefore in exceptional
cases issue a writ such as a writ of certiorari notwithstanding the fact that the
statutory remedies have not been exhausted. In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Mohammad
Nooh [1958 SCR 595, 605] , S.R. Das, C.J., speaking for the Court, observed:
"In the next place it must be borne in mind that there is no rule, with regard to
certiorari as there is with mandamus, that it will lie only where there is no other
equally effective remedy. It is well established that, provided the requisite grounds
exist, certiorari will lie although a right of appeal has been conferred by statute.
(Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Edn. Vol. II, p. 130 and the cases cited there). The
fact that the aggrieved party has another and adequate remedy may be taken into
consideration by the superior court in arriving at a conclusion as to whether it
should, in exercise of its discretion, issue a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings
and decisions of inferior courts subordinate to it and ordinarily the superior court
will decline to interfere until the aggrieved party has exhausted his other statutory
remedies, if any. But this rule requiring the exhaustion of statutory remedies before
the writ will be granted is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion rather than a
rule of law and instances are numerous where a writ of certiorari has been issued
inspite of the fact that the aggrieved party had other adequate legal remedies. In King
v. Postmaster-General Ex parte Carmichael, [1928 (1) KB 291] a certiorari was issued
although the aggrieved party had an // 24 // alternative remedy by way of appeal. It
has been held that the superior court will readily issue a certiorari in a case where
there has been a denial of natural justice before a court of summary jurisdiction. The
case of Rex v. Wandsworth Justices Ex parte Read, [1942 (1) KB 281] is an authority
in point. In that case a man had been convicted in a court of summary jurisdiction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 16
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
without giving him an opportunity of being heard. It was held that his remedy was
not by a case stated or by an appeal before the quarter sessions but by application to
the High Court for an order of certiorari to remove and quash the conviction."
There are at least two well-recognised exceptions to the doctrine with regard to the exhaustion of
statutory remedies. In the first place, it is well-settled that where proceedings are taken before a
Tribunal under a provision of law, which is ultra vires it is open to a party aggrieved thereby to move
the High Court under Article 226 for issuing appropriate writs for quashing them on the ground that
they are incompetent, without his being obliged to wait until those proceedings run their full course.
-- (See the decisions of this Court in Carl Still G.m.b.H. v. State Bihar [AIR 1961 SC 1615] . and
Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar [(1955) 2 SCR 603] . In the second place, the doctrine
has no application in a case where the impugned order has been made in violation of the principles
of natural justice (See State of Uttar Pradesh v. Mohammad Nooh [1958 SCR 595, 605] ).
4.2. With regard to the challenge made by the Petitioner that the proceeding since has not been
initiated by the Board and accordingly it is not maintainable, learned counsel appearing for the
University contended that vide the proceeding of the 43rd meeting dt.21.11.2022, so conducted by
the Board of Management under Annexure-
E/3 to the counter affidavit, the Board of Management authorized the Vice-Chancellor-Opp. Party
No.2 to initiate the proceeding against the Petitioner.
// 25 // 4.3. It is contended that since in terms of the decision taken by the Board under
Annexure-E/3, the proceeding in question was initiated against the Petitioner by Opp.
Party No.2, no illegality or irregularity can be found with such action of the University. It is also
contended that as provided under Section 12 of the Act read with Clause 15(iv) and clause 15(x) of
the VSSUT 1st Statute, 2010, Vice-Chancellor is also empowered to start disciplinary proceeding
against any delinquent employee.
4.4. It is also contended that in terms of the decision taken by the Board of Management in its 45th
meeting held on 30.09.2023 under Annexure-H/3, the Board permitted the Vice-Chancellor to pass
appropriate order in the proceeding initiated against the Petitioner. In terms of such authority given
by the Board, the impugned order of punishment was imposed by Opp.
party No.2 vide Office order dt.03.10.2023 under Annexure-18. It is accordingly contended that the
impugned punishment has been imposed in conformity // 26 // with the provisions of the Act and
the Statute and it cannot be called in question.
4.5. With regard to second non-issuance of the 2nd show-
cause as contemplated by the Writ Petitioner, learned counsel appearing for the University
contended that there is no such mandatory requirement to issue the 2nd show-

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
cause, as in terms of the 42nd amendment to the Constitution of India, the only requirement is to
send a copy of the inquiry report to the delinquent employee to meet the principle of natural justice.
In support of the same, reliance was placed to the following decisions.
1. ShyamLal Vs. State of U.P., 1954 SCC 369
2. ECIL. v. B. Karunakar, (1993) 4 SCC 727
3. SBI v. Mohd.Badruddin, 2019(16) SCC 69 Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of ShyamLal in para 17
& 19 has held as follows:
17. Under Article 353 of the Civil Service Regulations, no pension may be granted to
an officer dismissed or removed for misconduct, insolvency or inefficiency, but to
officers so dismissed or removed compassionate allowances may be granted when
they are deserving of special consideration, provided that such allowance // 27 //
shall not exceed two-thirds of the pension which would have been admissible to him
if he had retired on medical certificate.
Then came the Government of India Act, 1935. Section 240 is important for our purpose. The
relevant portions of that section were as follows:
"240. Tenure of office of persons employed in civil capacities in India.-- (1) Except as
expressly provided by this Act, every person who is a member of a civil service of the
Crown in India, or holds any civil post under the Crown in India, holds office during
His Majesty's pleasure.
(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed from the service of His Majesty by
any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed.
(3) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or reduced in rank until he has
been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to
be taken in regard to him."
The rest of the section is not material for the present discussion. In short, sub-section (1) reiterated
the English constitutional theory, sub-section (2) reproduced the restriction introduced by Section
96- B(1) of the 1919 Act and sub-section (3) gave statutory protection to the rights conferred by Rule
55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules but which prior to this Act of 1935
had been held by the Privy Council in the two last cited cases to be ineffective against the Crown's
plenary power of dismissal. It will, however, be noticed that in sub-section (3) the word "removed"
was not used, although that word occurred in Rule 55 and the other rules quoted above. It was,
however, held in I.M. Lal case [High Commr. for India v. I.M. Lall, 1948 SCC OnLine PC 25 :
(1947-48) 75 IA 225 : AIR 1948 PC 121] that removal was within Section 240(3), which conclusion
implies that removal is comprised within dismissal. The position, therefore, is that both under the
rules and according to the last mentioned decision of the Judicial Committee there is no distinction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 18
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
between a dismissal and a removal except that the former disqualifies from future employment
while the latter does not.
19. The foregoing discussion necessarily leads us to the conclusion that a compulsory retirement
does not amount to dismissal or removal and therefore, does not attract the provisions of Article 311
of the Constitution or of Rule 55 and that, therefore, the order of the President cannot be challenged
on the ground that the appellant had not been afforded full opportunity of showing cause against the
action sought to be taken in regard to him. Both the questions under consideration must also be
answered against the appellant.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of ECIL in para 19,25,29 & 30 has held as follows:
// 28 //
19.InMohd. Ramzan Khan case [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 612 : (1991) 16
ATC 505] the question squarely fell for consideration before a Bench of three learned
Judges of this Court, viz., that although on account of the Forty-second Amendment
of the Constitution, it was no longer necessary to issue a notice to the delinquent
employee to show cause against the punishment proposed and, therefore, to furnish a
copy of the enquiry officer's report along with the notice to make representation
against the penalty, whether it was still necessary to furnish a copy of the report to
him to enable him to make representation against the findings recorded against him
in the report before the disciplinary authority took its own decision with regard to the
guilt or otherwise of the employee by taking into consideration the said report. The
Court held that whenever the enquiry officer is other than the disciplinary authority
and the report of the enquiry officer holds the employee guilty of all or any of the
charges with proposal for any punishment or not, the delinquent employee is entitled
to a copy of the report to enable him to make a representation to the disciplinary
authority against it and the non-furnishing of the report amounts to a violation of the
rules of natural justice.
However, after taking this view, the Court directed that the law laid down there shall have
prospective application and the punishment which is already imposed shall not be open to challenge
on that ground. Unfortunately, the Court by mistake allowed all the appeals which were before it
and thus set aside the disciplinary action in every case, by failing to notice that the actions in those
cases were prior to the said decision. This anomaly was noticed at a later stage but before the final
order could be reviewed and rectified, the present reference was already made, as stated above, by a
Bench of three learned Judges. The anomaly has thus lent another dimension to the question to be
resolved in the present case.
xxx xxx xxx
25. While the right to represent against the findings in the report is part of the reasonable
opportunity available during the first stage of the inquiry viz., before the disciplinary authority takes
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 19
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
into consideration the findings in the report, the right to show cause against the penalty proposed
belongs to the second stage when the disciplinary authority has considered the findings in the report
and has come to the conclusion with regard to the guilt of the employee and proposes to award
penalty on the basis of its conclusions. The first right is the right to prove innocence. The second
right is to plead for either no penalty or a lesser penalty although the conclusion regarding the guilt
is accepted. It is the second right exercisable at the second stage which was taken away by the
Forty-second Amendment.
29. Hence it has to be held that when the enquiry officer is not the disciplinary authority, the
delinquent employee has a right to receive a copy of the enquiry officer's report before the
disciplinary authority arrives at its conclusions with regard to the guilt or innocence of the employee
with regard to the charges levelled against him. That right is a part of the employee's right to defend
// 29 // himself against the charges levelled against him. A denial of the enquiry officer's report
before the disciplinary authority takes its decision on the charges, is a denial of reasonable
opportunity to the employee to prove his innocence and is a breach of the principles of natural
justice.
30. Hence the incidental questions raised above may be answered as follows:
[i] Since the denial of the report of the enquiry officer is a denial of reasonable
opportunity and a breach of the principles of natural justice, it follows that the
statutory rules, if any, which deny the report to the employee are against the
principles of natural justice and, therefore, invalid. The delinquent employee will,
therefore, be entitled to a copy of the report even if the statutory rules do not permit
the furnishing of the report or are silent on the subject.
[ii] The relevant portion of Article 311(2) of the Constitution is as follows:
"(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank
except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him and
given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges."
Thus the article makes it obligatory to hold an inquiry before the employee is dismissed or removed
or reduced in rank. The article, however, cannot be construed to mean that it prevents or prohibits
the inquiry when punishment other than that of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank is awarded.
The procedure to be followed in awarding other punishments is laid down in the service rules
governing the employee. What is further, Article 311(2) applies only to members of the civil services
of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State or to the holders of the civil posts
under the Union or a State. In the matter of all punishments both Government servants and others
are governed by their service rules. Whenever, therefore, the service rules contemplate an inquiry
before a punishment is awarded and when the enquiry officer is not the disciplinary authority the
delinquent employee will have the right to receive the enquiry officer's report notwithstanding the
nature of the punishment.

[iii] Since it is the right of the employee to have the report to defend himself effectively and he would
not know in advance whether the report is in his favour or against him, it will not be proper to
construe his failure to ask for the report, as the waiver of his right. Whether, therefore, the employee
asks for the report or not, the report has to be furnished to him.
[iv] In the view that we have taken, viz., that the right to make representation to the disciplinary
authority against the findings recorded in the enquiry report is an integral part of the opportunity of
defence against the charges and is a breach of principles of natural justice to deny the said right, it is
only appropriate that the law laid down in Mohd. Ramzan case should apply to employees in all
establishments whether Government or non-Government, public or // 30 // private. This will be the
case whether there are rules governing the disciplinary proceeding or not and whether they
expressly prohibit the furnishing of the copy of the report or are silent on the subject. Whatever the
nature of punishment, further, whenever the rules require an inquiry to be held, for inflicting the
punishment in question, the delinquent employee should have the benefit of the report of the
enquiry officer before the disciplinary authority records its findings on the charges levelled against
him. Hence question (iv) is answered accordingly.
[v] The next question to be answered is what is the effect on the order of punishment when the
report of the enquiry officer is not furnished to the employee and what relief should be granted to
him in such cases. The answer to this question has to be relative to the punishment awarded. When
the employee is dismissed or removed from service and the inquiry is set aside because the report is
not furnished to him, in some cases the non-furnishing of the report may have prejudiced him
gravely while in other cases it may have made no difference to the ultimate punishment awarded to
him. Hence to direct reinstatement of the employee with back-wages in all cases is to reduce the
rules of justice to a mechanical ritual. The theory of reasonable opportunity and the principles of
natural justice have been evolved to uphold the rule of law and to assist the individual to vindicate
his just rights. They are not incantations to be invoked nor rites to be performed on all and sundry
occasions. Whether in fact, prejudice has been caused to the employee or not on account of the
denial to him of the report, has to be considered on the facts and circumstances of each case. Where,
therefore, even after the furnishing of the report, no different consequence would have followed, it
would be a perversion of justice to permit the employee to resume duty and to get all the
consequential benefits. It amounts to rewarding the dishonest and the guilty and thus to stretching
the concept of justice to illogical and exasperating limits. It amounts to an "unnatural expansion of
natural justice" which in itself is antithetical to justice.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Mohd.Badruddin in para 23 has held as follows:
23. The previous punishments could not be subject-matter of the charge-sheet as it is
beyond the scope of inquiry to be conducted by the inquiry officer as such
punishments have attained finality in the proceedings. The requirement of second
show-cause notice stands specifically omitted by the 42nd Amendment. Therefore,
the only requirement now is to send a copy of Inquiry Report to the delinquent to
meet the principle of natural justice being the adverse material against the
delinquent. There is no mandatory requirement of communicating the proposed

punishment. Therefore, there cannot be any bar to take into consideration previous
punishments in the constitutional scheme as interpreted by this Court. Thus, the
non-
// 31 // communication of the previous punishments in the show-cause notice will not vitiate the
punishment imposed.
4.6. Learned counsel appearing for the University also contended that since the impugned order of
punishment has been passed basing on the findings arrived at by the Inquiry Officer in his report
dt.01.09.2023 and on the face of the initiation of the proceeding with issuance of the notice by the
Inquiry Officer, Petitioner never participated in the inquiry, this Court has got no jurisdiction to
interfere with the order of punishment. In support of the same, reliance was placed to the following
decisions:
1. State of Orissa Vs. Bidyabhushan Mohapatra, AIR 1963 SC 779,
2. SBI v. Mohd.Badruddin, 2019(16) SCC 69 Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Bidyabhushan Mohpapatra in para 9 has held as follows:
9. The High Court has held that there was evidence to support the findings on heads
(c) and (d) of Charge (1) and on Charge (2). In respect of Charge 1(b) the respondent
was acquitted by the Tribunal and it did not fall to be considered by the Governor. In
respect of Charges 1(a) and 1(e) in the view of the High Court "the rules of natural
justice had not been observed". The recommendation of the Tribunal was
undoubtedly // 32 // founded on its findings on Charges 1(a), 1(e), 1(c), 1(d) and
Charge (2). The High Court was of the opinion that the findings on two of the heads
under Charge (1) could not be sustained, because in arriving at the findings the
Tribunal had violated rules of natural justice. The High Court therefore directed that
the Government of the State of Orissa should decide whether "on the basis of those
charges, the punishment of dimissal should be maintained or else whether a lesser
punishment would suffice". It is not necessary for us to consider whether the High
Court was right in holding that the findings of the Tribunal on Charges 1(a) and 1(e)
were vitiated for reasons set out by it, because in our judgment the order of the High
Court directing the Government to reconsider the question of punishment cannot, for
reasons we will presently set out, be sustained. If the order of dismissal was based on
the findings on Charges 1(a) and 1(e) alone the Court would have jurisdiction to
declare the order of dismissal illegal but when the findings of the Tribunal relating to
the two out of five heads of the first charge and the second charge was found not
liable to be interfered with by the High Court and those findings established that the
respondent was prima facie guilty of grave delinquency, in our view the High Court
had no power to direct the Governor of Orissa to reconsider the order of dismissal.
The constitutional guarantee afforded to a public servant is that he shall not be
dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed,
and that he shall not be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be
taken in regard to him. The reasonable opportunity contemplated has manifestly to
be in accordance with the rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution. But the
Court in a case in which an order of dismissal of a public servant is impugned, is not
concerned to decide whether the sentence imposed, provided it is justified by the
rules, is appropriate having regard to the gravity of the misdemeanour established.
The reasons which induce the punishing authority, if there has been an enquiry
consistent with the prescribed rules, is not justiciable : nor is the penalty open to
review by the Court. If the High Court is satisfied that if some but not all of the
findings of the Tribunal were "unassailable", the order of the Governor on whose
powers by the rules no restrictions in determining the appropriate punishment are
placed, was final, and the High Court had no jurisdiction to direct the Governor to
review the penalty for as we have already observed the order of dismissal passed by a
competent authority on a public servant, if the conditions of the constitutional
protection have been complied with, is not justiciable. Therefore if the order may be
supported on any // 33 // finding as to substantial misdemeanour for which the
punishment can lawfully be imposed, it is not for the Court to consider whether that
ground alone would have weighed with the authority in dismissing the public servant.
The Court has no jurisdiction if the findings of the enquiry officer or the Tribunal
prima facie make out a case of misdemeanour, to direct the authority to reconsider
that order because in respect of some of the findings but not all it appears that there
had been violation of the rules of natural justice. The High court was, in our
judgment, in error in directing the Governor of Orissa to reconsider the question.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Mohd.Badruddin in para 28 has held as follows:
28. In view of the said judgment, the findings recorded by the Division Bench that the
order of punishment passed on the basis of uncommunicated reasons of
disagreement recorded in respect of Charges 1 and 5 cannot be faulted with. In fact,
the argument of Mr Viswanathan is that Charge 4 alone is sufficient to maintain the
order of punishment of removal from service. Though, Charge 4 may be sufficient to
inflict punishment but it is not necessary that Charge 4 alone will entail punishment
of removal from service. While exercising the power of judicial review, it will not be
within our jurisdiction to maintain the order of punishment of removal from service
in view of findings recorded on Charge 4 itself. It is for the disciplinary authority to
inflict punishment as it may consider appropriate after finding Charge 4 proved
against the delinquent 4.7. It is also contended that since on the face of the letter
issued under Annexures-1 & 3, Petitioner never took over the charge of the
Department as its H.O.D and disobeyed direction of the University, the punishment
imposed against the Petitioner is not disproportionate to the alleged mis-conduct.
Reliance was placed to a decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in the case of

486, Hon'ble Apex Court in para 18,19 & 20 has held as follows:

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
18. On the question of judicial review and interference of the courts in matters of
disciplinary proceedings and on the test of proportionality, a few decisions of this
Court are required to be referred to.
19. In Om Kumar [Om Kumar v. Union of India, (2001) 2 SCC 386 :
2001 SCC (L&S) 1039] , this Court, after considering the Wednesbury principles and
the doctrine of proportionality, has observed and held that the question of the
quantum of punishment in disciplinary matters is primarily for the disciplinary
authority to order and the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 of the
Constitution or of the Administrative Tribunals is limited and is confined to the
applicability of one or other of the well-known principles known as "Wednesbury
principles". In Wednesbury Case [Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v.
WednesburyCorpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] , it was said that when a statute gave
discretion to an administrator to take a decision, the scope of judicial review would
remain limited. Lord Greene further said that interference was not permissible unless
one or the other of the following conditions was satisfied, namely, the order was
contrary to law, or relevant factors were not considered, or irrelevant factors were
considered, or the decision was one which no reasonable person could have taken.
20. In B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India [B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India, (1995) 6
SCC 749 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 80] , in para 18, this Court observed and held as under :
(SCC p. 762) "18. A review of the above legal position would establish that the
disciplinary authority, and on appeal the appellate authority, being fact-finding
authorities have exclusive power to consider the evidence with a view to maintain
discipline. They are invested with the discretion to impose appropriate punishment
keeping in view the magnitude or gravity of the misconduct. The High
Court/Tribunal, while exercising the power of judicial review, cannot normally
substitute its own conclusion on penalty and impose some other penalty. If the
punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority shocks
the conscience of the High Court/Tribunal, it would appropriately mould the relief,
either directing the disciplinary/appellate authority to reconsider the penalty
imposed, or to shorten the litigation, it may itself, in exceptional and rare cases,
impose appropriate punishment with cogent reasons in support thereof."
// 35 // 4.8. Making all these submissions, learned counsel appearing for the University contended
that taking into account the nature of charges framed against the Petitioner and non-participation of
the Petitioner in the proceeding in spite of due opportunity being given to her, no illegality or
irregularity can be found with the impugned order of punishment. Accordingly, it is contended that
the Writ Petition is liable for dismissal.
5. To the stand taken by the University, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner made further
submissions taking into account the stand taken in the rejoinder affidavit.

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
5.1. With regard to availability of the alternative remedy to which the Petitioner has not availed,
learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner contended that existence of alternative remedy is not
always a bar for this Court to issue a Writ, while exercising the power under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. In support of his submission, reliance was placed to the following decisions:
// 36 //
1. A.V. Venkateswaran v. Ramchand Sobhraj Wadhwani AIR 1961 S.C 1506.
2. Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1 Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of A.V. Venkateswaran in para 8 to 20 has held as follows:
8. The only point, therefore, requiring to be considered is whether the High Court
should have rejected the writ petition of the respondent in limine because he had not
exhausted all the statutory remedies open to him for having his grievance redressed.
The contention of the learned Solicitor-General was that the existence of an
alternative remedy was a bar to the entertainment of a petition under Article 226 of
the Constitution unless (1) there was a complete lack of jurisdiction in the officer or
authority to take the action impugned, or (2) where the order prejudicial to the writ
petitioner has been passed in violation of the principles of natural justice and could,
therefore, be treated as void or non est. In all other cases, he submitted, Courts
should not entertain petitions under Article 226, or in any event not grant any relief
to such petitioners. In the present case, he urged, the High Court in appeal had
expressly dissented from the reasoning of the learned Single Judge as regards the
lack of jurisdiction of the Customs officers to adjudicate regarding the item under
which the article imported fell and the duty leviable thereon. Nor was there any
complaint in this case that the order had been passed without an opportunity to the
importer to be heard, so as to be in violation of the principles of natural justice. The
learned Solicitor-General questioned the correctness of the reasoning of the learned
Chief Justice in condoning the conduct of the respondent in not moving the
Government in revision by taking into account the time that had elapsed between the
date of the impugned order and that on which the appeal was heard. The submission
was that if this were a proper test, the Rule as to a petitioner under Article 226 having
to exhaust his remedies before he approached the Court would be practically a dead
letter because in most cases by the date the petition comes on for hearing, the time
for appealing or for applying in revision to the departmental authorities would have
lapsed.
// 37 //
9. We see considerable force in the argument of the learned Solicitor-General. We must, however,
point out that the Rule that the party who applies for the issue of a high prerogative writ should,
before he approaches the Court, have exhausted other remedies open to him under the law, is not
one which bars the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain the petition or to deal with it, but is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 25
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
rather a Rule which Courts have laid down for the exercise of their discretion. The law on this matter
has been enunciated in several decisions of this Court but it is sufficient to refer to two cases : In
Union of India v.
T.R. Varma [(1958) SCR 499 at pp. 503-504] VenkataramaAyyar speaking for the Court said:
"It is well settled that when an alternative and equally efficacious remedy is open to a
litigant, he should be required to pursue that remedy and not invoke the special
jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ. It is true that the existence
of another remedy does not affect the jurisdiction of the Court to issue a writ; but, as
observed by this Court in Rashid Ahmed v. Municipal Board, Kairana 'the existence
of an adequate legal remedy is a thing to be taken into consideration in the matter of
granting writs'. Vide also K.S. Rashid and Son v. Income Tax Investigation
Commission. And where such remedy exists, it will be a sound exercise of discretion
to refuse to interfere in a petition under Article 226, unless there are good grounds
therefor."
There is no difference between the above and the formulation by Das, C.J., in State of Uttar Pradesh
v. Mohammad Nooh [(1958) SCR 595 at pp. 605-607] where he observed;
"... It must be borne in mind that there is no Rule, with regard to certiorari as there is
with mandamus, that it will lie only where there is no other equally effective remedy.
It is well established that, provided the requisite grounds exist, certiorari will lie
although a right of appeal has been conferred by statute. The fact that the aggrieved
party has another and adequate remedy may be taken into consideration by the
superior court in arriving at a conclusion as to whether it should, in exercise of its
discretion, issue a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings and decisions of inferior
courts subordinate to it and ordinarily the superior court will decline to interfere
until the aggrieved party has exhausted his other statutory remedies, if any. But this
Rule requiring the exhaustion of statutory remedies before the writ will be granted is
a Rule of policy, convenience and discretion rather than a Rule of law and instances
are numerous where a writ // 38 // of certiorari has been issued in spite of the fact
that the aggrieved party had other adequate legal remedies."
After referring to a few cases in which the existence of an alternative remedy had been held not to
bar the issue of a prerogative writ, the learned Chief Justice added:
"It has also been held that a litigant who has lost his right of appeal or has failed to
perfect an appeal by no fault of his own may in a proper case obtain a review by
certiorari."
In the result this Court held that the existence of other legal remedies was not per se a bar to the
issue of a writ of certiorari and that the Court was not bound to relegate the petitioner to the other
legal remedies available to him.

10. The passages in the judgments of this Court we have extracted would indicate (1) that the two
exceptions which the learned Solicitor-General formulated to the normal Rule as to the effect of the
existence of an adequate alternative remedy were by no means exhaustive, and (2) that even beyond
them a discretion vested in the High Court to have entertained the petition and granted the
petitioner relief notwithstanding the existence of an alternative remedy. We need only add that the
broad lines of the general principles on which the Court should act having been clearly laid down,
their application to the facts of each particular case must necessarily be dependent on a variety of
individual facts which must govern the proper exercise of the discretion of the Court, and that in a
matter which is thus pre-eminently one of discretion, it is not possible or even if it were, it would not
be desirable to lay down inflexible Rules which should be applied with rigidity in every case which
comes up before the Court.
11. The question that we have now to consider is has the discretion which undoubtedly vested in the
Court been so improperly exercised as to call for our interference with that order. We might premise
this discussion by expressing our opinion on two matters merely to prevent any misunderstanding.
First we entirely agree with Chagla, C.J. that the order of the Assistant Collector of Customs in
assessing duty at 78¾ per cent or of the Collector of Customs in confirming the same, was not void
for lack of jurisdiction. The interpretation they put on the relevant items in the Tariff Schedule
might be erroneous, even grossly erroneous, but this error was one committed in the exercise of
their jurisdiction and had not the effect of placing the resulting order beyond their jurisdiction.
Secondly, as we have already indicated, we // 39 // must express our dissent from the reasoning by
which the learned Judges of the High Court held that the writ petitioner was absolved from the
normal obligation to exhaust his statutory remedies before invoking the jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. If a petitioner has disabled himself from availing
himself of the statutory remedy by his own fault in not doing so within the prescribed time, he
cannot certainly be permitted to urge that as a ground for the Court dealing with his petition under
Article 226 to exercise its discretion in his favour. Indeed, the second passage extracted from the
judgment of the learned C.J. in Mohammed Nooh case [(1958) SCR 595 at pp. 605-607] with its
reference to the right to appeal being lost "through no fault of his own" emphasizes this aspect of the
Rule.
12. The question, however, still remains whether in the circumstances of this case we should
interfere with the decision of the High Court. In considering this, we cannot lose sight of three
matters : (1) that the levy of the duty at 78¾ per cent was manifestly erroneous and cannot be
supported on any reasonable construction of the items in the Tariff Schedule, (2) it was stated by the
Customs authorities in answer to the writ petition, in the grounds of appeal to the High Court under
the Letters Patent, as also in the statement of case before us, that the Central Board of Revenue had
issued a ruling to the effect that fountain-pens with nibs or caps which were gold-plated fell within
Item 61(8). This might be some indication that the adjudication by the Assistant Collector of
Customs and by the Customs Collector on appeal was in pursuance of a settled policy of the entire
heirarchy of the department. Without going so far as to say that a Revision to the Central
Government might in the circumstances be a mere futility, we consider that this is not a matter
which would be wholly irrelevant for being taken into account in disposing of the appeal before us.
After all, the basis of the Rule by which Courts insist upon a person exhausting his remedies before
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 27
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
making application for the issue of a prerogative writ is that the Court's jurisdiction ought not to be
lightly invoked when the subject can have justice done to him by resorting to the remedies
prescribed by statutes. (3) Lastly, the learned Solicitor-General does not dispute the correctness of
the principle of law as enunciated by Chagla, C.J., his complaint is that the law as laid down by the
learned Chief Justice has not been properly applied to the facts of the case before him. If the
challenge to the judgment of the High Court were of the former type, this Court might have to
interfere to lay down the law correctly lest error creep into the administration of justice.
// 40 // But where the error is only in the application of the law correctly understood to the facts of
a particular case, we should be persuaded that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the case
before us before being invited to interfere; and this the learned Solicitor-General has not succeeded
in doing. It would be remembered that the question is not whether if the respondent's application
were before us, we should have directed the writ to issue, but whether the learned Judges of the
High Court having in their discretion which they admittedly possessed made an order, there is
justification for our interfering with it. The two matters set out earlier should suffice to show that no
interference could be called for in this appeal.
13. We consider, therefore, on the whole and taking into account the peculiar circumstances of this
case that the High Court has not exercised its discretion improperly in entertaining the writ
application or granting the relief prayed for by the respondent and that no case for interference by
us in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution has been made out. The appeal fails and is
dismissed with costs.
14. A.K. Sarkar, J.-- In this case the respondent had imported a certain number of fountain-pens
plated with gold. The goods were assessed to import duty by an assessing officer of the Indian
Customs under Item 61(8) of the first schedule to the Customs Tariff which dealt with "Articles,
other than cutlery and surgical instruments, plated with gold or silver" and provided for a duty of
78¾ per cent ad valorem. The respondent appealed from this assessment to the Collector of
Customs under Section 188 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, on the ground that the assessment should
have been under Item 45(3) of that schedule which dealt with "Fountain-pens, complete" and
provided for a duty of 30 percent, ad valorem. He did not dispute that the fountain-pens imported
by him were gold-plated. His appeal was dismissed. The respondent then moved the High Court at
Bombay for a writ to quash the order of assessment under Item 61(8). The application was allowed
by Tendolkar, J. who issued a writ of mandamus directing the Collector of Customs to release the
goods upon payment of the duty specified in Item 45(3). The appeal by the Collector of Customs
from the order of Tendolkar, J. to an Appellate Bench of the High Court was dismissed. The
Collector has therefore filed the present appeal.
15. The first question is, whether the writ should have been refused on the ground that the
respondent had another remedy, namely, an application to the Central Government under Section
191 of the Sea Customs Act to revise the order // 41 // of the Collector. Tendolkar, J. held that the
writ could issue though the other remedy had not been pursued, as the order of assessment under
Item 51(8) was without jurisdiction. This was clearly wrong. The Collector had ample jurisdiction to
decide under which item in the schedule the fountain-pens had to be assessed to duty, and if he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 28
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
made a mistake in his decision that did not make his order one without jurisdiction :
cp. Gulabdas& Co. v. Assistant Collector of Customs [AIR 1957 SC 733] . The learned
Judges of the appellant Bench held that the writ was properly issued, not because the
assessing authority had no jurisdiction to assess the goods under Item 61(8), but
because at the date the matter had come before them, the other remedy had become
barred. This again is, in my view, plainly erroneous for a party who by his own
conduct deprives himself of the remedy available to him, cannot have a better right to
a writ than a party who has not so deprived himself. Normally -- and the present has
not been shown to be other than a normal case -- a writ of mandamus is not issued if
other remedies are available. There would be stronger reason for following this Rule
where the obligation sought to be enforced by the writ is created by a statute and that
statute itself provides the remedy for its breach. It should be the duty of the courts to
see that the statutory provisions are observed and, therefore, that the statutory
authorities are given the opportunity to decide the question which the statute
requires them to decide.
16. The fact that the Central Government had on a prior occasion decided, as appears in this case to
have happened, that fountain-pens of the kind which the respondent had imported, were liable to
duty under Item 61(8) cannot furnish any reason justifying a departure from the normal Rule or the
issue of a writ without that Government having been moved under Section 191. This prior decision
of the Central Government could be a reason for such departure only on the presumption that it
would not change its view even if that view was shown to be incorrect. I cannot imagine that a court
can ever make such a presumption. Therefore, it seems to me that it would have been proper to
refuse the writ on the ground that the respondent had another remedy available to him which he
had not pursued. On the present occasion, however, I do not wish to decide the case on that ground.
17. Next, I feel the gravest doubt if the case is one for the issue of a writ of mandamus. It is of
interest to observe that the respondent had in his petition to the High Court himself asked for a writ
of certiorari. A writ of mandamus issues in respect of a ministerial duty imposed by a statute; it
cannot issue where the duty to be performed is of a judicial nature, // 42 // except for the purpose of
directing that the judicial duty should be performed, that is, a decision should be given on the
question raised. In John Shortt's book on Informations, Mandamus and Prohibition it is stated at p.
256:
"If the duty be of a judicial character a mandamus will be granted only where there is
a refusal to perform it in any way; not where it is done in one way rather than
another, erroneously instead of properly. In other words, the Court will only insist
that the person who is the judge shall act as such; but it will not dictate in any way
what his judgment should be.
If, however, the public act to be performed is of a purely ministerial kind, the Court
will by mandamus compel the specific act to be done in the manner which to it seems
lawful."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 29
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
18. It does not seem to me that the duty which the Sea Customs Act created and the performance of
which was sought to be enforced by a writ in the present case, can properly be said to be a
ministerial duty. That duty was to decide which item in the Customs Tariff was applicable to the
respondent's goods and to realise the customs duty specified in that item. Insofar as the statute
required the officer to realise the Customs levy, I find it difficult to see how it can be said to be a
public duty to the performance of which the respondent had a legal right and without this right he
was not entitled to the mandamus : see Ex party Napier [1852 18 QB 692] . Insofar again, as the Act
required the Customs officer to choose the proper item in the Customs Tariff for assessment of the
customs levy on goods, it in my view involves performance of work of a quasi-judicial nature. The
observation of Das, J. in Province of Bombay v. K.S. Advani [1950 SCC 551 : (1950) SCR 621, 725]
which I am about to read, fully fits this case:"If a statutory authority has power to do any act which
will prejudicially affect the subject, then, although there are not two parties apart from the authority
and the contest is between the authority proposing to do the act and the subject opposing it, the final
determination of the authority will yet be a quasi-judicial act provided the authority is required by
the statute to act judicially". Now the Sea Customs Act empowers the Customs authorities to impose
a certain duty on goods imported and this no doubt prejudicially affects the importer. The Act
further clearly requires the authorities to proceed judicially in imposing that duty when a dispute
arises, that is, after giving a hearing to the party affected : see Sections 29, 31 and 32 of the Act. In
this case a hearing was in fact given to the respondent. This // 43 // taken with the provisions as to a
right of appeal from the decision of the first assessing officer and as to the right to move the
Government in revision from the decision in the appeal, would clearly indicate that the authorities
have to act judicially. In Gulabdas& Co. v. Assistant Collector [AIR 1957 SC 733] this Court
proceeded on the basis that the duty of assessing the customs levy was of a judicial nature. Therefore
I feel the gravest doubt, if the present is a case where a mandamus could at all issue.
19. No doubt if a mandamus could not issue because the act which the statute required to be
performed was not a ministerial one but judicial in its character, the case might be a fit one for the
issue of a writ of certiorari. But that writ cannot, in any event, issue unless the proceedings disclosed
an error apparent on their face. In issuing a certiorari again, the Court does not examine the judicial
act questioned as if it was hearing an appeal in respect of it : see SatyanarayanLaxminarayanHegde
v.
MallikarjunBhavanappaTirumale [(1960) 1 SCR 890, 901] . I do not propose to discuss this question
further in the present case, for it was not considered by the High Court nor raised at our Bar. I
proceed on the basis that it was a case where an application for a mandamus lay.
20. The respondent, in substance, asked for and obtained a writ directing the Customs authorities to
release the goods on payment of duty at the rate of 30 per cent ad valorem as prescribed by Item
45(3). This was on the basis that the duty should have been levied under that item and not under
Item 61(8) as the Customs authorities had done.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Whirlpool Corpn. In para 14 to 21 and 28 to 30 has held as
follows:

Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is
plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This
power can be exercised by the High Court not only for issuing writs in the nature of
habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for the
enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the
Constitution but also for "any other purpose".
15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts
of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But the
High Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which is that if an
effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court would not normally
exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been consistently held // 44
// by this Court not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely, where
the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights
or where there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or where the
order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is
challenged.
There is a plethora of case-law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic whirlpool, we
would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they still hold
the field.
16.Rashid Ahmed v. Municipal Board, Kairana [1950 SCC 221 : AIR 1950 SC 163 : 1950 SCR 566]
laid down that existence of an adequate legal remedy was a factor to be taken into consideration in
the matter of granting writs. This was followed by another Rashid case, namely, K.S. Rashid & Son v.
Income Tax Investigation Commission [AIR 1954 SC 207 : (1954) 25 ITR 167] which reiterated the
above proposition and held that where alternative remedy existed, it would be a sound exercise of
discretion to refuse to interfere in a petition under Article 226. This proposition was, however,
qualified by the significant words, "unless there are good grounds therefor", which indicated that
alternative remedy would not operate as an absolute bar and that writ petition under Article 226
could still be entertained in exceptional circumstances.
17. A specific and clear rule was laid down in State of U.P. v. Mohd. Nooh [AIR 1958 SC 86 : 1958
SCR 595] as under:
"But this rule requiring the exhaustion of statutory remedies before the writ will be
granted is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law and
instances are numerous where a writ of certiorari has been issued in spite of the fact
that the aggrieved party had other adequate legal remedies."
18. This proposition was considered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in A.V. Venkateswaran,
Collector of Customs v. RamchandSobhrajWadhwani [AIR 1961 SC 1506 : (1962) 1 SCR 753] and
was affirmed and followed in the following words:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 31
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
"The passages in the judgments of this Court we have extracted would indicate (1)
that the two exceptions which the learned Solicitor General formulated to the normal
rule as to the effect of the existence of an adequate alternative remedy were by no
means exhaustive, and (2) that even beyond them a discretion vested in the High
Court to have entertained the petition and granted the petitioner relief
notwithstanding the existence of an alternative remedy. We need only add that the
broad lines of the general principles on which the Court should act having been
clearly laid down, their application to the facts of each particular case must
necessarily be dependent on a variety of individual facts which must govern the
proper exercise of the discretion of the Court, and that in a matter which is thus
pre-eminently one of discretion, it is not possible or even if it were, it would not be
desirable to lay down inflexible rules which should be applied with rigidity in every
case which comes up before the Court."
// 45 //
19. Another Constitution Bench decision in Calcutta Discount Co. Ltd. v. ITO, Companies Distt. I
[AIR 1961 SC 372 : (1961) 41 ITR 191] laid down:
"Though the writ of prohibition or certiorari will not issue against an executive
authority, the High Courts have power to issue in a fit case an order prohibiting an
executive authority from acting without jurisdiction. Where such action of an
executive authority acting without jurisdiction subjects or is likely to subject a person
to lengthy proceedings and unnecessary harassment, the High Courts will issue
appropriate orders or directions to prevent such consequences. Writ of certiorari and
prohibition can issue against the Income Tax Officer acting without jurisdiction
under Section 34, Income Tax Act."
20. Much water has since flown under the bridge, but there has been no corrosive effect on these
decisions which, though old, continue to hold the field with the result that law as to the jurisdiction
of the High Court in entertaining a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, in spite of the
alternative statutory remedies, is not affected, specially in a case where the authority against whom
the writ is filed is shown to have had no jurisdiction or had purported to usurp jurisdiction without
any legal foundation.
21. That being so, the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petition at the initial stage
without examining the contention that the show-cause notice issued to the appellant was wholly
without jurisdiction and that the Registrar, in the circumstances of the case, was not justified in
acting as the "Tribunal".
Xxx xxx xxx
28. Now, the principle is that all statutory definitions have to be read subject to the qualification
variously expressed in the definition clauses which created them and it may be that even where the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 32
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
definition is exhaustive inasmuch as the word defined is said to mean a certain thing, it is possible
for the word to have a somewhat different meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon
the subject or context. That is why all definitions in statutes generally begin with the qualifying
words, similar to the words used in the present case, namely "unless there is anything repugnant in
the subject or context". Thus there may be sections in the Act where the meaning may have to be
departed from on account of the subject or context in which the word had been used and that will be
giving effect to the opening sentence in the definition section, namely "unless there is anything
repugnant in the subject or context". In view of this qualification, the court has not only to look at
the words but also to look at the context, the collocation and the object of such words relating to
such matter and interpret the meaning intended to be conveyed by the use of the words "under
those circumstances". (see Vanguard Fire and General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Fraser & Ross [AIR
1960 SC 971 : (1960) 3 SCR 857] )
29. Before considering the contextual aspect of the definition of "Tribunal", we may first consider its
ordinary and simple meaning. A bare look at the definition indicates that the High Court and the
Registrar, on their own, are not "Tribunal". They // 46 // become "Tribunal" if "the proceeding
concerned" comes to be pending before either of them. In other words, if "the proceeding
concerned" is pending before the High Court, it will be treated as "Tribunal". If, on the contrary, "the
proceeding concerned" is pending before the Registrar, the latter will be treated as "Tribunal".
30. Since "Tribunal" is defined in Section 2 which, in its opening part, uses the phrase "Unless the
context otherwise requires", the definition, obviously, cannot be read in isolation. The phrase
"Unless the context otherwise requires" is meant to prevent a person from falling into the whirlpool
of "definitions" and not to look to other provisions of the Act which, necessarily, has to be done as
the meaning ascribed to a "definition" can be adopted only if the context does not otherwise require.
5.2. It is contended that since it is not disputed by the university that on the face of the application
made by the Petitioner under Annexures-2 & 4, no action was ever taken and Petitioner was never
provided with the documents in order to enable her to file her written statement of defence and no
2nd show-cause was ever issued to the Petitioner as provided under Rule 15(10)(i)
(b) of the Rules, in view of such non-compliance of the statutory provisions so contained under Rule
15 of the Rules, the impugned order of punishment is liable for interference of this Court.
5.3. It is also contended that since the proceeding under Annexure-7 was initiated under Rule-15 of
the Rules, the // 47 // University is required to follow the provisions contained under Rule-15. But
as found and which is not disputed as provided under Rule 15(3) of the Rules, Petitioner was never
provided with the documents. Secondly as provided under Rule 15(10(i)(b) of the Rules, Petitioner
was never issued with the 2nd show-cause, proposing the punishment to be imposed. Therefore, in
view of such non-compliance of the statutory provisions, contained under Rule 15(3) and 15(10(i)(b)
of the Rules, the impugned order of punishment is not sustainable in the eye of law.
5.4. It is also contended that taking into account the nature of charges framed against the Petitioner
under Annexure-7, punishment of compulsory retirement from service is completely
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 33
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
disproportionate to the alleged misconduct.
5.5. Making all these submissions, it is contended that the impugned order of punishment is not
sustainable in the eye of law and liable to be set aside by this Court in exercise of the power of
judicial review in matters involving // 48 // judicial proceedings. In support of the power of judicial
review, reliance was placed on the following decisions:
1. State of Andhra Pradesh V. S. Sree Rama Rao, 1963 SCC Online SC 6
2. B.C. Chaturvedi V. Union of India & Others, (1995) 6 SCC 749
3. Deputy General Manager(Appellate Authority) & Others V. Ajai Kumar Srivastava,

case of S. Sree Rama Rao In para 7 has held as follows:

7. The High Court may undoubtedly interfere where the departmental authorities
have held the proceedings against the delinquent in a manner inconsistent with the
rules of natural justice or in violation of the statutory rules prescribing the mode of
enquiry or where the authorities have disabled themselves from reaching a fair
decision by some considerations extraneous to the evidence and the merits of the
case or by allowing themselves to be influenced by irrelevant considerations or where
the conclusion on the very face of it is so wholly arbitrary and capricious that no
reasonable person could ever have arrived at that conclusion, or on similar grounds.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of B.C. Chaturvedi in para 12 has held as follows:
12. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in
which the decision is made. Power of judicial review is meant to ensure that the
individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the conclusion which the
authority reaches is necessarily correct in the eye of the court.
// 49 // When an inquiry is conducted on charges of misconduct by a public servant, the
Court/Tribunal is concerned to determine whether the inquiry was held by a competent officer or
whether rules of natural justice are complied with. Whether the findings or conclusions are based on
some evidence, the authority entrusted with the power to hold inquiry has jurisdiction, power and
authority to reach a finding of fact or conclusion. But that finding must be based on some evidence.
Neither the technical rules of Evidence Act nor of proof of fact or evidence as defined therein, apply
to disciplinary proceeding. When the authority accepts that evidence and conclusion receives
support therefrom, the disciplinary authority is entitled to hold that the delinquent officer is guilty
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 34
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
of the charge. The Court/Tribunal in its power of judicial review does not act as appellate authority
to reappreciate the evidence and to arrive at its own independent findings on the evidence. The
Court/Tribunal may interfere where the authority held the proceedings against the delinquent
officer in a manner inconsistent with the rules of natural justice or in violation of statutory rules
prescribing the mode of inquiry or where the conclusion or finding reached by the disciplinary
authority is based on no evidence. If the conclusion or finding be such as no reasonable person
would have ever reached, the Court/Tribunal may interfere with the conclusion or the finding, and
mould the relief so as to make it appropriate to the facts of each case.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Ajai Kumar Srivastava in para 24 has held as follows:
24.The court/tribunal may interfere in the proceedings held against the delinquent if
it is, in any manner, inconsistent with the rules of natural justice or in violation of the
statutory rules prescribing the mode of enquiry or where the conclusion or finding
reached by the disciplinary authority is based on no evidence.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Umesh In para 22 has held as follows:
xxx xxx xxx
22. The Court in the exercise of judicial review, the Court does not act as an appellate forum over the
findings of the disciplinary authority. The court does not reappreciate the evidence on the basis of
which the finding of misconduct has been arrived at in the course of a discipline ary enquiry. The
Court in the exercise of judicial review must restrict its review to determine whether:
(i) the rules of natural justice have been complied with;
(ii) the finding of misconduct is based on some evidence;
// 50 //
(iii) the statutory rules governing the conduct of the disciplinary enquiry have been observed; and
(iv) whether the findings of the disciplinary authority suffer from perversity; and
(v) the penalty is disproportionate to the proven misconduct.
6. I have heard Mr. S. Roy, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner and Mr. N.K. Sahu, learned
counsel appearing for the University. On consent of the learned counsel appearing for the parties
and with due exchange of the pleadings, the matter was heard at the stage of admission and dispose
of by the present order.
7. Having heard learned counsel appearing for the parties, considering the submission made and the
materials available on record, this Court finds that the Petitioner while continuing as an Associate

Professor in the Department of Computer Application, vide Office Order dt.22.07.2022 under
Annexure-1, she was directed to take over the charge of H.O.D of the Department of Computer
Application.
7.1. As found, petitioner on being communicated with the order dt.22.07.2022, she filed a
representation on 25.07.2022 before Opp. Party No.3 under Annexure-2 with // 51 // a prayer to
regularize the records and documents of the Deptt. prior to her taking over the charges of the
Department as its H.O.D. However, on the face of such representation made by the Petitioner under
Anexure-2 vide letter dt.08.08.2022 under Annexure-3, Petitioner when once again was directed to
take over the charge, Petitioner made a representation on 10.08.2022 under Annexure-4, with a
request to the previous H.O.D of the Department to apprise her on various aspects, prior to her
taking over the charge. Copy of the said representation was also provided to Opp. party No.3.
7.2. As found, without taking a decision on the request made by the Petitioner under Annexures-2 &
4, Petitioner when was issued with a show-cause on 21.10.2022 under Anneuxre-5 by Opp. Party
No.3 vide order of Opp. Party No.1, Petitioner again submitted a reply to the show-cause reiterating
her prayer to regularize the records and documents for her to take over the charge on 26.10.2022
under Annexure-6. However, without taking a decision either way on the request made by the
Petitioner under // 52 // Annexures-2,4 & 6, the proceeding in question was initiated against the
Petitioner vide memorandum dt.27.04.2023 under Annexure-7. As found, the said proceeding was
initiated under Rule-15 of the OCS (CC& A ) Rules, 1962.
7.3. On such initiation of the proceeding, Petitioner vide letter dt.30.04.2023 under Annexure-8
though requested Opp. party No.3 for supply of the documents in order to enable her to file her
written statement of defence and further request was also made on 02.05.2023, 05.05.2023 and
10.05.2023 under Annexure-9 series, but without providing the Petitioner with the documents as
prayed for, Inquiry Officer was appointed vide Office order dt.04.07.2023 under Annexure-10,
Petitioner though raised her objection to such appointment of the Inquiry Officer by making a
representation before Opp. party No.1 on 07.07.2023 under Annexure-11, but no decision was taken
on such request of the Petitioner.
7.4. As found without taking any decision with regard to supply of documents and change of the
Inquiry Officer, // 53 // Petitioner vide notice dt.14.07.2023 under Annexure-12 and further notice
issued on 02.08.2023 under Annexure-13 was asked to participate in the proceeding. Thereafter,
Petitioner was issued with the 1st show-cause along with the inquiry report dt.01.09.2023 as
provided under Rule 15(10(1)(a) of the Rules on 05.09.2023 under Annexure-15.
7.5. Petitioner though submitted a reply to the 1st show-
cause on 02.10.2023 before Opp. Party No.1 under Annexure-17, but without issuance of the 2nd
show-cause notices provided under Rule 15(10)(i)(b) of the Rules, the impugned order of
punishment was passed, by imposing the punishment of compulsory retirement from service vide
Order dt.03.10.2023 under Annexure-18.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52828324/ 36
Dr. Sasmita Kumari Padhy vs Veer Surendra Sai .... Opposite Parties on 14 May, 2025
7.6. Since it is not disputed that without issuance 2nd show cause as provided under Rule
15(10)(i)(b) of the Rules, the impugned order of punishment has been passed, placing reliance on
the decision in the case of Whirlpool Corporation as cited (supra) it is the view of this Court that
alternate remedy of appeal is not a bar for this Court to interfere with the order of punishment, as
the impugned order of // 54 // punishment has been passed in total non-compliance of the principle
of natural justice.
7.7. This Court on the face of the decision in the case of Mohd. Ramzan Khan as cited ( supra), is
also of the view that without issuing the 2nd show-cause notice proposing the punishment to be
imposed, no order of punishment could have been imposed against the Petitioner.
This Court is unable to accept the decisions relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the
University with regard to availability of alternative remedy and non-issuance of the 2nd show-cause
notice.
7.8. This court after going through the records and taking into account the nature of charge framed
against the Petitioner in the memorandum and placing reliance in the case of Bhagat Ram as well as
Ranjit Thakur, is also of the view that punishment of compulsory retirement from service is
shockingly disproportionate to the alleged charges.
7.9. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid analysis, this Court while exercising the power of review in
matters // 55 // relating to disciplinary proceedings and placing reliance on the decisions in the case
of S.Sree Rama Rao, B.C. Chaturvedi, A.K. Srivastav and Umesh as cited (supra) is inclined to quash
the order of punishment so passed against the Petitioner vide order dt.03.10.2023 under
Annexure-18.
While quashing the said order, this Court directs Opp. Party No.1 to re-instate the Petitioner in her
services with passing of an appropriate order within a period of two (2) weeks from the date of
receipt of this order.
7.10. However, this Court taking into account the nature of order passed by the University under
Annexures-1 & 3 directs the Petitioner to take over the charge of the Department as and when the
University will comply her request so made under Annexures-2 & 4.
7.11. The Writ Petition accordingly stands disposed of with the aforesaid observation and direction.
