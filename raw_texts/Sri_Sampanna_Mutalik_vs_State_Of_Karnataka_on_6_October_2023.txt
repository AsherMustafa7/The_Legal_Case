THESE CRIMINAL PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS ON 18.08.2023, COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
Batch of these petitions are preferred by the accused in a solitary crime. Different petitions are
preferred by different accused. Criminal Petition No.5952 of 2023 is preferred by accused Nos.1 and
2; Criminal Petition No.5788 of 2023 is preferred by accused No.4 and Criminal Petition No.5741 of
2023 is preferred by accused No.7. They are all accused in Criminal Case No.2319 of 2023 pending
before the II Additional Civil Judge and JMFC, Davanagere. Since facts that trigger registration of
the crime are common, these petitions are taken up together and considered by this order.
2. Facts, in brief, adumbrated are as follows:
(I) Criminal Petition No.5952 of 2023:
(a) It is the case of the prosecution that it received credible information that an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 4
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
unknown person by name Senthil was standing in front of S.V. Complex, No.19,
Bellary Road, Bengaluru and was found selling skin, antlers and teeth of wild
animals. On such information being received, the sleuths of Hebbala Police Station
with panchas apprehended Senthil and seized items mentioned supra. The
jurisdictional police then registered a Forest Offence Crime ('FOC') in FOC No.1 of
2022 for offences punishable under Sections 39, 40, 48(a), 49(b), 50, 51, 55(b) of the
Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act' for short).
(b) Mr. Senthil was interrogated and thereafter, he was arrayed as accused No.1. He
tenders his voluntary statement that he was rearing wild animals on instructions of
the owner of Kalleshwar Rice Mills located in Anekonda, Davanagere District.
Based on the said information, the Women Protection Wing of the CCB along with staff and panchas
searched Kalleshwar Rice Mill and drew up a mahazar. The search was conducted on 21-12-2022.
The product of the search was communicated to the Assistant Conservator of Forests, Davanagere
for further action. The Range Forest Officer then files a written complaint before the Judicial
Magistrate First Class, Davanagere under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. against three persons viz.,
Sampanna, G.M. Karibasaiah and Senthil. Sampanna and G.M. Karibasaiah are petitioners in the
subject petition. The offences alleged in the said private complaint are the ones punishable under
Sections 9, 39, 44, 48(a) and 51 of the Act. The crux of the complaint was that, on 21-12-2022 the
complainant along with his staff members had visited the godown behind Samson Distilleries
located in Anekonda Village, Davanagere Taluk wherein, the complainant found items specified,
that were illegally kept in unlawful possession of the said accused. The learned Magistrate on filing
of the complaint, acting under Section 190(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C. takes cognizance of the offence under
Section 51 of the Act. A direction was issued to investigate into the offence acting under Section
202(1) of the Cr.P.C., to the Assistant Conservator of Forests, Davanagere to conduct investigation
and submit a report on or before 21.02.2023. The Investigating Officer then seeks all the documents
pertaining to FOC No.1 of 2022, which was registered at Bangalore from the office of the CCB, which
had conducted a search at Davanagere. After the said investigation, the Assistant Conservator of
Forests registers a FIR under Rule 65(1) of the Karnataka Forest Manual for offences punishable
under Sections 9, 40, 42, 42(a), 44, 48(a), 51 and 57 of the Act. Accused No.4 is added into these
proceedings. Accused No.4 is the petitioner in the companion petition. On 29-04-2023, the Deputy
Conservator of Forests seeks details of the investigation undertaken by the Investigating Officer
along with statements of the accused recorded during investigation. As directed by the learned
Magistrate, final report was filed before the Court on 08-05-2023. On 08-05-2023, on perusal of the
final report, the learned Magistrate takes cognizance yet again against all the accused - accused
Nos.1 to 7, who were named in the final report for offences punishable under Section 51 of the Act.
Apart from the said provision of the Act, the learned Magistrate opined that there was sufficient
material to take cognizance for the offences punishable under Sections 465 and 201 of the IPC as
well and registers a criminal case in C.C.No.2319 of 2023 against seven accused. The seven accused
are as follows:
(i) Sampanna, (ii) G.M. Karibasappa, (iii) Senthil V,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 5

(iv) S.S.Mallikarjun, (v) Kadu Junjappa @ Kadu Junja,
(vi) Anjinappa C and (vii) S.S. Ganesh.
(II) Criminal Petition No.5788 of 2023:
The petitioner in this petition is accused No.4 in C.C.No.2319 of 2023 and how this
accused gets roped into the web of crime is already narrated hereinabove as the facts
that led to arraigning of accused No.4 are similar to what is narrated supra.
(III) Criminal Petition No.5741 of 2023:
This petition is preferred by accused No.7 in C.C.No.2319 of 2023. This accused is
roped into the web of crime, facts of which are as narrated while narrating the facts in
Criminal Petition No.5952 of 2023. Therefore, the subject criminal petitions are
preferred by accused Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 7.
3. Heard learned senior counsel Sri Sandesh J. Chouta, appearing for the petitioner in Criminal
Petition No.5788 of 2023; learned counsel Ms. Keerthana Nagaraj appearing for petitioners in
Criminal Petition No.5952 of 2023 and Criminal Petition No.5741 of 2023 and the learned
Additional State Public Prosecutor Sri B.N. Jagadeesha, representing the respondents in all the
cases.
4. The learned senior counsel Sri Sandesh J. Chouta would contend that the procedure in which the
investigation on the complaint was to be done under the Wildlife Offence Report No.1/2022 should
have been completed therein as it is a complete code by itself. The registration of second FIR in FOC
No.20 of 2022 in the teeth of the first FIR in FOC/WLOR No.1 of 2022 is clearly barred in law as
there can be one crime registered for one offence. It is his submission that the entire procedure that
is required for conduct of search and seizure are all thrown to the winds in the cases at hand. The
learned Magistrate has taken up proceedings completely contrary to law. He would, therefore, seek
quashment of the entire proceedings on the aforesaid procedural aberrations. Apart from the
aforesaid fact, he would also emphasise on the fact that entire proceedings are hit by mala fides and
political vendetta as the charge sheet is filed on 08-05-2023 and elections to the Karnataka State
Legislative Assembly were to take place on 10-05-2023 in which accused No.4 was to contest from
Davanagere North constituency.
5. Ms. Keerthana Nagaraj, learned counsel for petitioners in the companion petitions taking this
Court through the documents appended to the petitions would seek to contend that there are
procedural violations in registration of the case and order of, taking cognizance. They are incurable
illegalities. She would rely on the Wildlife Crime Investigation Handbook, which is followed as being
a complete codified procedure for investigation of wildlife offences and would further submit that
Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. under which power is exercised by the learned Magistrate should have
been taken to its logical conclusion and there was no question of reference being made under
Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. It is her further contention that taking of dual cognizance is contrary to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 6
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
law. Likewise, hybrid investigation or trial is impermissible in law. Both the learned counsel
appearing for the petitioners would place reliance upon the following judgments of the Apex Court
and this Court : (i) T.T. ANTHONY v. STATE OF KERALA1; (ii) B.V. BYRE GOWDA v. NISAR
AHMED2; (iii) KAPIL AGARWAL v. SANJAY SHARMA3; (iv) STATE OF HARYANA v. BHAJAN
LAL4;
(v) KAILASH VIJAYVARGIYA v. RAJLAKSHMI CHAUDHURI AND OTHERS5; (vi) BIRLA
CORPORATION LIMITED v. ADVENTZ INVESTMENTS AND HOLDINGS LIMITED6; (vii)
NATIONAL BANK OF OMAN v. BARAKARA ABDUL AZIZ7 and
(viii) D. LAKSHMINARAYANA REDDY v. V. NARAYANA REDDY8.
(2001) 6 SCC 181 Crl.P.No.3171 of 2018 decided on 20-09-2021 (2021) 5 SCC 524 1992 Supp (1) SCC
335 2023 SCC OnLine SC 569 (2019) 16 SCC 610 (2013) 2 SCC 488 AIR 1976 SC 1672
6. The learned Additional State Public Prosecutor Sri.B.N.Jagadeesha would refute the submissions
to contend that a prima facie case is made out against the petitioners. None of the procedural
violations that are projected by the petitioners would vitiate the proceedings. Prima facie, the
petitioners have been found guilty of the offences and, therefore, further proceedings ought to be
continued against these petitioners. The petitioners have committed serious offences which are
punishable under the provisions of the Act and, therefore, there should be no interdiction or
quashment of proceedings merely because there are some trivial procedural violations. He would
seek dismissal of the petitions.
7. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
and have perused the material on record.
8. The afore-narrated facts, dates and link in the chain of events are all a matter of record and,
therefore, they would not require any reiteration. The offences alleged against these petitioners are
the ones punishable under Sections 9, 39, 40, 48A, 49B, 50, 51, 55(b) and 57 of the Act. For offences
punishable under the aforesaid provisions of the Act, if investigation has to be conducted, it has to
be in terms of the Wildlife Crime Investigation Handbook. This is an admitted fact. Therefore, I
deem it appropriate to notice the procedure stipulated for investigating the offences under the Act.
Chapter-3 deals with registration of FOC which is akin to FIR, which also is sometimes named as
Wildlife Offence Report ('WLOR'). Clauses 3.1 to 3.3 thereof read as follows:
"3.1. In conventional crimes, investigation starts with registration of the case as First
Information Report (FIR). Recovery of material evidence (stolen property, weapons,
vehicles etc) takes place only after registration of the case. However, in wildlife crime
cases, the seizure of the wildlife/ wildlife article or apprehension of the
accused/suspect may take place before registration of the case. In other words, in
wildlife offences, investigation may start with lodging of a seizure / apprehension
report or the offence report, in the jurisdictional court, by an authorised officer, who
makes such seizure or arrest in different States this report is known by different
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 7
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
names such as the Preliminary Offence Report (POR), H-2 Case, Offence Report.
First Information Report (FIR), Seizure Intimation etc. However, it has been
observed that some of the judicial officers who are new to wildlife crime cases doubt
the legitimacy of such reports and insist on FIR/POR. There are some incidents
where the jurisdictional magistrates refused to accept such reports as they are not on
par with the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the police. In order to avoid such
technical problems and to bring uniformity in practice, it is suggested that the first
report submitted in the jurisdictional court in wildlife crime cases may be named as
Wildlife Offence Report (WLOR). The Wildlife Offence Report should be prepared
under Section 50(4) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. A standard format for
Wildlife Offence Report is given at Annexure-III.
3.2 Check list for preparing Wildlife Offence Report (WLOR):
(i) Every WLOR should be assigned a serial number maintained year wise eg: WLOR
No. 1/2012 of _____, dated _____,Forest Range, Division/TRs)
(ii) Date and time of receipt of information at the Forest Range or detection of the
offence should be mentioned in the WLOR.
(ii) WLOR should be prepared only on the standard format.
(iv) All columns in the WLOR should be duly filled.
(v) Correct Sections of law should be applied.
(vi) Address, present and permanent, parentage, age, sex etc of all the known
accused/ suspects are to be mentioned in the WLOR.
(vii) If the accused/suspects are not known, the same should be mentioned in the
WLOR.
(vii) In case of involvement of unknown accused, the words "and other unknown
accused"
should be mentioned after the list of the known accused.
(ix) Information part of the WLOR should be in simple language and without any ambiguity. It
should provide sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused
(x) Details of the wildlife involved, both common name and scientific name, Schedule under which
the animal is listed in the WL (Protection) Act, quantum of punishment for the offence etc., should
be incorporated in the information part.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 8
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
(xi) Name and rank of the Investigating Officer, officer who made the seizure and the officer who
wrote the WLOR should be mentioned in the WLOR
(xii) Delay in lodging of the WLOR should be avoided. In exceptional circumstances, if delay occurs,
reasons for the same should be explained in the WLOR.
(xiii) Copy of the WLOR should be sent to the immediate supervisory officer and CWLW or officer
authorised by him, without delay. This is needed so that immediate supervisory officer is aware of
the commission of the offense under his jurisdiction and also enables him to advise/ monitor the
progress in its investigation. 3.3. Registration of FIR and investigation of offences under the Wild
Life (Protection) Act, 1972, by police officer - Violations of the provisions of the Act are not specified
as cognizable offence, therefore, police officers are often unwilling to lodge FIR and investigate
offences reported under the provisions of the Act. It is clarified that under Part-II of Schedule-1 of
the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, offences against other laws, if punishable with imprisonment for
3 years and upwards are classified as cognizable. Most of the offences under the Act are punishable
with imprisonment for 3 or more years. Therefore, an Officer In charge of a Police Station is bound
to lodge an FIR and investigate the case like any other cognizable offence. However, courts shall take
cognizance of any offence against the Act only on the complaint submitted by any person specified
under Section 55 of the Act. Therefore, if Police officers in the State concerned are not authorized to
file complaints under Section 55 of the Act, the Police report is to be submitted in the Court as
complaint through an authorized forest officer. Once a complaint is filed in court, no further
investigation will be conducted without the direction of the Court Further, there is no provision for
filing supplementary complaint once a complaint is filed. Therefore, any subsequent discovery,
seizure, arrest etc. will be treated as fresh case and separate complaint filed in the Court."
(Emphasis supplied) Chapter-6 deals with investigation and complaint. Clauses 6.1, 6.4, 6.5, 6.45,
6.47, 6.51, 6.52, 6.54 and 6.55 are germane to be noticed and they read as follows:
"6.1 The word investigation has been defined in Section 2(h) of the Criminal
Procedure Code 1973 as;
"Investigation includes all the proceedings under this Code (Criminal Procedure
Code) for the collection of evidence, conducted by a police officer or by any person
(other than a Magistrate) who is authorised by a Magistrate in this behalf". A
criminal investigation is a patient, step by step process of discovering collecting,
preparing, identifying and presenting evidence within the legal frame work.
6.4. As per Section 50 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the Director of Wildlife
Preservation or any other officer authorised by him in this behalf or the Chief Wildlife
Warden or the authorised officer or any Forest Officer or any Police Officer not below
the rank of Sub Inspector are empowered to enter into any place where the wildlife
materials are suspected to be kept, conduct search for such wildlife materials and
seize the same, arrest and detain the accused or the suspect. It is to be understood
that all the actions together constitute investigation within the legal frame work of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 9
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
6.5. In a typical case of wildlife crime, the investigating officer should plan
investigation in the following manner:
(i) Investigation at the scene of crime/scene of occurrence/Post Mortem of Carcass
(ii) Interrogation of the accused(s)/suspect(s)
(iii) Examination of the witness (es)
iv) Collection of documentary evidence(s)/samples for expert opinion.
(v) Collection of scientific/forensic evidence/digital evidence(s)
(vi) Collection and analysis of the evidence(s)
(vii) Filing complaint u/s 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
6.45. Competence of an officer to file the complaint under section 55 of Wild Life (Protection) Act,
1972, is a matter of prime importance. The complaint has to be filed primarily by the Director of
Wildlife Preservation or by any officer authorised by the Central Government or by the Chief
Wildlife Warden or by any other officer authorised by the State Government. Therefore, before filing
the complaint, the officer filing the complaint should ensure that he is authorised to file the
complaint as envisaged under section 55 of the Act.
6.47. The complaint filed under section 55 of the Act, is to be treated as a complaint filed by public
servant acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties as mentioned in section
200(a) of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C).
6.51. Statements of all the witnesses, including the official witnesses, recorded u/s 50(8) of the Act,
as per the list of witnesses, confessional statements of the accused and statements recorded by the
Magistrate u/s 164 Cr.P.C, if any, should be filed along with the complaint.
6.52 All documents in original or certified copy, as per the list of documents enclosed, should be
submitted along with the Complaint. A comprehensive list of documents which are to be
compulsorily submitted along with the Complaint is given below:

competent Officer and who is competent is also depicted. A complaint filed under Section 55 of the
Act is to be treated as a complaint filed by a public servant in the discharge of his official duties as

be followed in every case of wildlife offence. It is a complete code from registration of crime till
investigation.
9. On the bedrock of what is quoted hereinabove, the procedure followed is what is required to be
noticed. After conduct of search and seizure if the wildlife offence is detected, then the Forest Officer
has to record all the details in the Wildlife Offence Register in terms of prescribed format and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 13
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
prepare a Wildlife Offence Report in terms of flow chart depicted hereinabove. This is given a
complete go-bye. It is thereafter, the complaint would be preferred before the jurisdictional
Magistrate under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. This procedure is violated for it to become topsy- turvy.
What the Range Forest Officer would do is to register the FIR at the outset and later, file a complaint
before the learned Magistrate both of which are on the same offence.
10. The duty of the learned Magistrate is to conduct an inquiry under Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. to
find out whether at all the matter would require investigation by a criminal Court. There was no
question of referring the matter under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. to decide whether Section 204
Cr.P.C. should be followed or otherwise. Sections 202 and 204 of the Cr.P.C. are completely violated
in the case at hand.
11. On 08-05-2023 after the final report was placed before the learned Magistrate, the learned
Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence under Section 190(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C. for the offences
under Section 51 of the Act and Sections 465 and 201 of the IPC. This is the second cognizance taken
by the learned Magistrate. What is the first is required to be noticed. When the complaint is
registered by the Range Forest Officer on 21-12-2022 invoking Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. for the
afore-quoted offences, the learned Magistrate takes cognizance and issues summons acting under
Section 190(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C. Section 190 of the Cr.P.C. reads as follows:
"190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates.--
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any Magistrate of the first class, and any
Magistrate of the second class specially empowered in this behalf under sub- section
(2), may take cognizance of any offence--
(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence;
(b) upon a police report of such facts;
(c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon
his own knowledge, that such offence has been committed. (2) The Chief Judicial
Magistrate may empower any Magistrate of the second class to take cognizance under
sub-section (1) of such offences as are within his competence to inquire into or try."
The learned Magistrate can take cognizance under both the provisions i.e., Section 190(1)(a) or
190(1)(b)(c) of the Cr.P.C. One would be on the police report and the other would be on the product
of the inquiry directed under Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. Both deal with taking of cognizance. Once
having taken cognizance, it was clearly impermissible in law to have taken cognizance yet again on
08-05-2023 for the offence that had already been taken cognizance on 22-12-2022. Therefore, the
procedure followed by the learned Magistrate is also topsy-turvy.
12. As observed hereinabove, the offences under the Act would fall under the manual which is a
complete code by itself. The Police by registering Criminal Case No.2319 of 2023 have envisaged a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 14
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
situation of hybrid trial for the same offence before one forum i.e., the learned Magistrate. This is
also impermissible in law as there is marked difference between the enquiry to be conducted under
Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. and the reference being made by the learned Magistrate for conduct of
investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. The net result of all the aforesaid actions is
multiple criminal proceedings being registered on the same offence which is clearly impermissible in
law.
13. Reference being made to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of T.T.ANTHONY (supra)
and the order passed by this Court in the case of B.V. BYRE GOWDA (supra), which followed the
judgment in the case of T.T.ANTHONY in the circumstances becomes apposite. The Apex Court in
the case of T.T. ANTHONY has held as follows:
"20. From the above discussion it follows that under the scheme of the provisions of
Sections 154, 155, 156, 157, 162, 169, 170 and 173 CrPC only the earliest or the first
information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the
requirements of Section 154 CrPC. Thus there can be no second FIR and
consequently there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of every subsequent
information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or
incident giving rise to one or more cognizable offences. On receipt of information
about a cognizable offence or an incident giving rise to a cognizable offence or
offences and on entering the FIR in the station house diary, the officer in charge of a
police station has to investigate not merely the cognizable offence reported in the FIR
but also other connected offences found to have been committed in the course of the
same transaction or the same occurrence and file one or more reports as provided in
Section 173 CrPC."
This Court in B.V.Byre Gowda (supra) has held as follows:
"12. The incident had occurred on 18.04.2018. It was concerning putting up of
buntings and their removal on account of being declaration of elections to the
Legislative Assembly of Karnataka State. The buntings were put up on the occasion of
arrival of Sri Amit Shah, for an election rally. The Code of Conduct was also in place
having been issued by the Election Commission and the Election Commission of
India has been issuing orders from time whenever elections take place. The order
dated 7th October, 2008 is followed even on 13th March, 2021 for General Elections.
The order insofar as it is relevant for the purpose of this lis is extracted herein for the
purpose of quick reference:
"DEFACEMENT OF PUBLIC PLACES 4(a) No wall writing, pasting of posters/papers
or defacement in any other form, or erecting/displaying of cutout, hoardings,
banners, flags etc. shall be permitted on any Government premises (including civil
structures therein). For this purpose a Government premise would include any Govt.
office and the campus wherein the office building is situated.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 15
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
(b) If the local law expressly permits or provides for writing of slogans, displaying
posters, etc., or erecting cut-outs, hoardings, banners, political advertisement, etc., in
any public place, (as against a Government premise) on payment or otherwise, this
may be allowed strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the law and
subject to Court orders, if any on this subject. It should be ensured that any such
place is not dominated/monopolized by any particular party(ies) or candidate(s). All
parties and candidates should be provided equal opportunity in this regard.
(c) If there is a specifically earmarked place provided for displaying advertisements in
a public place e.g. bill boards, hoardings etc. and if such space is already let out to any
agency for further allocation to individual clients, the District Election Officer
through the municipal authority concerned, if any, should ensure that all political
parties and candidates get equitable opportunity to have access to such
advertisement space for election related advertisements during the election period."
The defacement of property in terms of Election Commission would be in violation of Disfigurement
Act as could be seen from the Annexure appended to the said order. Clause 10 of the order, reads as
follows:
Sl.No. 10.
Name of State/UT Karnataka
Name of Act/Rule The Karnataka Open

such date as the State
Govt. may by notification
appoint."
(emphasis added)
The action of putting up buntings and their removal took place between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., resulting
in registration of complaint by Mr.Nisar Ahmed, an Official of the Municipality. The allegation was
violation of Section 3 of the Disfigurement Act. Section 3 of the Disfigurement Act, 1981 reads as
follows:
"3. Penalty for unauthorized disfigurement by advertisement. - Whoever by himself
or through another person affixes to, or erects, inscribes or exhibits on, any place
open to public view any advertisement without the written permission of the local
authority having jurisdiction over such area, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may
extend to one thousand rupees, or with both:
Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to any advertisement which, -
(i) is exhibited within the window of any building if the advertisement relates to the
trade, profession or business carried on in that building; or
(ii) relates to the trade, profession or business carried on within the land or building
upon or over which such advertisement is exhibited or to any sale or letting of such
land or building or any effects therein or to any sale, entertainment or meeting to be
held on or upon or in the same; or
(iii) relates to the name of the land or building upon or over which the advertisement
is exhibited, or to name of the owner or occupier of such land or building; or
(iv) relates to the business of a railway administration and is exhibited within any
railway station or upon any wall or other property of a railway administration.
(v) is affixed to or exhibited on any ancient and historical monument declared to be
of national importance under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and
Remains Act, 1958 (Central Act XXIV of 1958)."
The violation or contravention of the afore-quoted law forms the basis of the complaint registered at
9 a.m. by Sri Nisar Ahmed. The violations alleged in the said complaint which became an FIR in
Crime No.223 of 2018, are in terms of Representation of Peoples Act, Disfigurement Act and Section
171H of the IPC. The relevant portion of the FIR reads as follows:

If both the FIR in Crime No.223 of 2018 and FIR in Crime No.224 of 2018 are read in juxtaposition,
what would unmistakably emerge is that, both the complaints are by the very same complainant,
which pertain to the same incident and same time and date of incident. Once having registered a
complaint on a particular premise of an incident, it was not open to the complainant to have
registered another complaint on the very same incident regarding what happened during the very
same period. The complainant cannot be permitted to improve on the earlier complaint and as an
afterthought bring in other offences in the second complaint becoming a second FIR on sameness. It
would amount to permitting multiple FIRs' on the very same - incident, time of the incident, date of
the incident and by the very same complainant. It would be hit by the doctrine of sameness as held
by the Apex Court in the afore-extracted judgments. Therefore, insofar as Crime No.224 of 2018 is
concerned, the criminal trial cannot be permitted to continue as it would fall foul of the cardinal
principle of violation of fundamental rights of a citizen and the law laid down by the Apex Court, as
aforesaid.
13. A counter complaint is always permissible on the same incident as there can be complaints and
two FIRs', if it is a case of complaint and counter complaint or a case of consequential complaint.
These are not the facts in the case at hand. Therefore, without a shadow of doubt it would hit by
'doctrine of sameness'."
14. Insofar as the procedure followed by the learned Magistrate in referring the matter for
investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., after having taken cognizance and referred the
matter for inquiry under Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. is concerned there is a marked difference that
the inquiry under Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. and reference under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. is
ordered. The Apex Court in the case of KAILASH VIJAYVARGIYA (supra) has elucidated the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 20
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
difference between the two. The Apex Court has held as follows:
"65. One would grant that the jurisdiction of the Court when asked to invoke power
under Section 156(3) is wider as held in Priyanka Srivastava (supra), yet there are
limits within which the Magistrate must act. When the Magistrate is satisfied that the
allegations made disclose commission of a cognizable offence, he must stay his
hands, direct registration of an FIR and leave it to the investigative agency to unearth
the facts and ascertain the truth of the allegations. Magistrate in terms of the ratio in
Lalita Kumari (supra) can for good reasons direct preliminary enquiry. We would
now refer to the power of the Magistrate to take cognizance, postpone issue of
process and follow the procedure under Section 202 of the Code.
Difference in the power of Police to register and investigate an FIR under Section
154(1) read with 157 of the Code, and the Magistrate's direction to register an FIR
under Section 156(3) of the Code. Power of the Magistrate to direct registration of an
FIR under Section 156(3) in contrast with post- cognizance stage power under
Section 202 of the Code.
66. The operandi for registration of information in a cognizable offence and eventual
investigation is not limited to Police, and as observed above, sub-section (3) to
Section 156, subject to legal stipulations, gives the ameliorating power to a Magistrate
empowered under Section 190 to order an investigation in a cognizable offence. Two
different powers vested with two distinct authorities, namely the Police and the
Magistrate, who discharge distinct functions and roles under the Code as indicated
above are not entirely imbricating.
67. The power of Magistrate to direct investigation falls under two limbs of the Code :
one is pre-cognizance stage under Section 156(3), and another on cognizance under
Chapter XIV ('Conditions Requisite for Initiation of Proceedings'; Sections 190-199)
read with Chapter XV ('Complaints to Magistrates'; Sections 200-210). These two
powers are different and there also lies a procedural distinction between the two.
68. A three Judge Bench decision of this Court in Ramdev Food Products Private
Limited (supra) had examined the distinction between powers of the Magistrate to
direct registration of an FIR under Section 156(3) and power of the Magistrate to
proceed under Section 202 of the Code. It was observed that the power under the
former Section is to be exercised, on receiving a complaint or a Police report or
information from any person other than the Police officer or upon his own
knowledge, before he takes cognizance under Section 190. Once the Magistrate takes
cognizance, the Magistrate has discretion to take recourse to his powers under
Section 202, which provides for postponement of the issue of process and inquire
into the case himself or direct investigation to be made by a Police officer or by such
other person as he thinks fit for the purpose of deciding whether or not there are
sufficient grounds for proceedings. The proviso to Section 202 states that no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 21
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
direction for investigation shall be made where a complaint has not been made by a
Court, unless the complainant and the witnesses present (if any) are examined on
oath under Section 200. When it appears to the Magistrate that the offence
complained of is triable exclusively by the Court of Sessions, he shall call upon the
complainant to produce all his witnesses and examine them on oath. However, in
such cases, the Magistrate cannot issue direction for investigation of an offence.
Thus, the Magistrate has the power, when a written complaint is made, to issue
direction under Section 156(3), but this power is to be exercised before the Magistrate
takes cognizance of the offence under Section 190. However, in both cases, whether
under Section 156(3) or under Section 202 of the Code, the person accused as the
perpetrator, when the proceedings are pending before the Magistrate, remains
unrepresented. Under Section 203, the Magistrate, after considering the statement of
the complainant and witnesses (if any) on oath and the result of an inquiry (if any)
under Section 202, can dismiss the complaint if he is of the opinion that there is no
sufficient ground for proceeding and in every such case briefly record his reasons. If
the Magistrate after taking cognizance of the offence, is of the opinion that there are
sufficient grounds for proceeding he will issue the process to the accused for
appearance as per the procedure and mode specified under Section 204 of the Code.
Process to the accused under Section 204 falls under Chapter XVI of the Code and is
issued post the cognizance and inquiry/investigation/evidence recorded in a private
complaint in terms of Section 202 of the Code."
(Emphasis supplied) In the teeth of the aforesaid facts whether further proceedings could be
permitted to be continued or otherwise is required to be answered and the answer is an unequivocal
and emphatic 'no', as if such proceedings are permitted to continue it would run foul of the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of BHAJAN LAL (supra), wherein it is held as follows:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48754919/ 22
Sri. Sampanna Mutalik vs State Of Karnataka on 6 October, 2023
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-
cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate
as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code. (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or
complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can
ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."
(Emphasis supplied) Therefore, finding no procedure or the procedure completely topsy- turvy in
the cases at hand would mean that the entire proceedings need to be obliterated as glaring
procedure aberrations noticed hereinabove cannot be countenanced and further proceedings cannot
be permitted to continue by a fiat of this Court as they are all incurable illegalities cutting at the root
of the matter and become an abuse of the process of the law.
15. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Criminal petitions are allowed and the proceedings in C.C.No.2319 of 2023
pending before the II Additional Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Davangere stand quashed qua the petitioners.
(ii) It is made clear that the observations made in the course of the order are only for
the purpose of consideration of the case of petitioners under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
and the same shall not bind or influence the proceedings against any other accused
pending before the learned Magistrate or any other fora.
