Cr.P.C. praying to allow the petition and release the
accused petitioners on bail for the offences
U/S143,147,148,323,324,504,506,307 R/w section 149 of
Indian Penal Code in crime No.103/2019 of Khembavi P.S
pending in Senior Civil Judge & JMFC at Shorapur.
This petition coming on for orders this day, the Court
made the following:
ORDER
The petitioner has sought for regular bail under section 439 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in
Crime No.103/2019 of Kembhavi Police Station, registered for the offences punishable under
sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 307, 504, 506 read with section 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860
(hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'IPC').
2. The complainant in the case is said to be the elder brother of the alleged injured Bhimanagouda.
According to the complainant, on 15.09.2019 at about 8.30 a.m., the present petitioners joined by
remaining three accused, forming an unlawful assembly, went to a place called Mouneshwar temple
in Vandaganur village where the injured Bhimanagouda was sitting along with his brothers
including the complainant and accusing the injured that he is not facilitating the water in their
lands, the accused telling that they would take away his life, assaulted Bhimanagouda with stone,
hands and iron rod, causing injuries to him. Thus, a complaint in respondent station Crime
No.103/2019 for the offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 307, 504, 506 read
with section 149 of IPC was registered against them.
3. The prosecution has opposed the petition by filing its objection.
4. A perusal of the material, at this stage and prima facie would go to show that the alleged incident
is said to have taken place during the day light in an open place, that too, in the presence of several
other people. According to the complainant, the accused formed an unlawful assembly and assaulted
his brother with an intention to cause his death. However, looking at the circumstance as alleged in
the complaint, whether the alleged act of the accused would really attract section 307 of IPC is a
factor which requires a detailed consideration in the trial. Further, according to the learned counsel
for the petitioners, all the other accused have already been enlarged on bail, which submission is not
opposed by the learned High Court Government Pleader.
A perusal of the copy of the wound certificate of the alleged injured, which is placed before me by
the learned High Court Government Pleader, would go to show that the injured is said to have
sustained a contusion over the right temporal parietal region. The CT scan finding opined that there
was no evidence of fracture of skull. An abrasion over left tibia was also noticed. According to the
learned counsel from both side the injured has already been discharged from the hospital after
treatment. In the said circumstance, I am of the view that, imposing reasonable conditions, the
present petitioners also be enlarged on bail. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following:
