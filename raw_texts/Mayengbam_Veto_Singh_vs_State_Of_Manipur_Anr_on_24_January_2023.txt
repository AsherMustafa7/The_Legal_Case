S. Inaocha, learned counsel, appears for the newly impleaded respondent No. 3, the complainant.

prayer in this criminal petition, i.e., to quash FIR No. 16(12)2019 WKG-PS, registered under
Sections 376/420/506/34 IPC, has become infructuous in the light of the fact that a NIL final report
was filed therein before the learned Judl. Magistrate First Class, Thoubal, and the same led to
closure of the case.
Recording the said statement, CRIL. PETN. No. 1 of 2020 is closed.
