ORDER
2.8.2017 Invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and
challenging the stigmatic order of termination passed by the Collector/Chief Executive Officer of the
Jila Panchayat, the petitioners have filed these petitions.
2. The petitioners of Writ Petition No.2585/2015 and Writ Petition No.22314/2015 are
Sub-Engineers and the petitioners of Writ Petition No.21128/2015 and Writ Petition No.9670/2016
are Assistant Wardens and all the petitioners of Writ Petition No.16572/2014, Writ Petition
No.76/2015, Writ Petition No.800/2015, Writ Petition No.905/2015, Writ Petition No.2907/2015,
Writ Petition No.4290/2015, Writ Petition No.5584/2015, Writ Petition No.4079/2017, Writ
Petition No.6587/2017, Writ Petition No.7614/2017, Writ Petition No.7684/2017 are Gram Rojgar
Sahayaks governed by the Scheme issued by the Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rojgar Guarantee Parishad
on 2.6.2012. As per the Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rojgar Guarantee Parishad, the contract
employment can be terminated as per Clause 16, which is being reproduced as under:-

3. On perusal of Clause 16 of Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rojgar Guarantee Parishad, it is apparent that
the orders can be passed by the Gram Panchayat except in Sub-Clause No.7. It is a case wherein
against all the petitioners, the allegations of irregularities, dereliction in discharge of the duties and
negligence have been alleged. However, in this regard, as per the Scheme, the orders can be passed
after proving the allegation thereof.
4. In all these petitions, the fact finding inquiry was conducted behind the back of the petitioners
and on the basis of the said fact finding inquiry, the show cause notices were issued, which were
replied in some of the cases and in some of the cases, the reply has not been filed and thereafter, the
order of termination has been passed.
5. This Court while issuing the notice to the other side except in Writ Petition No.7684/2017 has
passed interim order to stay the impugned order of termination and under the garb of the said
interim order, the petitioners are continuing in service except one person.
6. In view of the foregoing facts, now the question arises for consideration is whether as per Clause
16(7) of Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rojgar Guarantee Parishad, what would be the meaning of word
''prove'' and how the allegations of irregularities, dereliction in discharge of the duties and
negligence can be proved.
7. Looking to the facts unfolded in the present cases, an inquiry was conducted either under the
orders of Collector or the Chief Executive Officer through some officers of the department. It is not
in dispute that while holding that fact finding inquiry, the petitioners were not called to give
opportunity of hearing and it is after seeking the report of the said fact finding inquiry, the notices
were issued, which were replied and thereafter the orders of termination have been passed. In this
regard, the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Rahul Tripathi Versus Rajeev Gandhi
Shiksha Mission, Bhopal & Others reported in 2001 (3) MPHT 397 has been relied.
8. In the case of Rahul Tripathi (supra), Hon'ble Shri Justice Dipak Misra, as he then was, while
dealing with the issue of termination of services of a contract employee where the allegations of
financial irregularities were alleged against them merely on the basis of the show cause notice
referring various judgments of the Hon'ble the Supreme Court, has held as under:-
''10. The present factual matrix is to be tested on the aforesaid enunciation of law. To
find out whether the order of termination is a termination simplicitor or punitive in
nature it is apposite to refer to the order contained Annexure P/18. The relevant

at the aforesaid order it becomes graphically clear that the petitioner's appointment
was extended from time to time but during his continuance serious allegations with
regard to financial irregularities were received. The order also reflects that the
petitioner was asked to show cause in number of correspondences but the petitioner
could not explain the charges levelled against him. It has also been mentioned in the
order as the petitioner has committed financial irregularities and has not performed
his duties with sincerity the work of the Mission has been affected and accordingly he
has been removed. At this juncture, it is worthwhile to refer to the counter affidavit
wherein it has been also mentioned that against the petitioner there were serious
financial irregularities and he was asked to show cause but his reply was not found
satisfactory. The return filed by the respondent No.3 also reflects the same. On a
scrutiny of the entire factual scenario, there remains no scintilla of doubt that the
order of termination passed against the petitioner is stigmatic and cannot be
regarded as a termination simplicitor. The allegations incorporated in the order
clearly establish that stigma has been cast and it will affect the future prospects of the
petitioner. Accordingly, the order contained in Annexure P/18 deserves to be
quashed and accordingly, I so do. Needless to emphasise the petitioner shall reap all
the consequential benefits.''
9. Relying upon the judgment rendered in the case of Rahul Tripathi (supra) as well as two other
judgments of this Court delivered in the cases of Jitendra Versus State of M.P & Others reported in
2008 (5) MPHT 146 and Rajendra Tiwari alias Raju Advocate, Second Additional Government
Prosecutor & Pleader, Rewa Versus State of M.P. & Others reported in 2005 (3) MPHT 69, the
coordinate bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.16309/2015 (Shriram Verma Versus State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138386066/ 4
Satyabhama Tripathi vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 August, 2017
M.P) decided on 16.3.2017 has held in Paragraph Nos.6 and 7 as under:-
''6. Having considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties as
well as in view of the above cited judgments, this Court is of the view that the
impugned termination orders being stigmatic in nature alleging misconduct
involving moral turpitude, the same could not have been passed without holding
regular enquiry. The impugned termination orders would certainly create hurdle in
his future employment. In the circumstances, before passing such an stigmatic order,
regular enquiry ought to have been conducted.
7. As a result, the impugned orders are hereby quashed. The petitioner shall be
entitled to reinstate with consequential benefits.
However, liberty is granted to the respondents to proceed against the petitioner afresh in
accordance with law, if so advised.''
10. Per contra, learned counsel representing the respondents has relied upon the judgment rendered
in Writ Petition No.8150/2011 (Rajendra Prasad Bakoriya Versus Secretary, the State of Madhya
Pradesh) decided on 26.8.2016 and contended that while dealing the issue of a contract employee,
this Court referring various judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court has held that a contract
employee can claim the compensation taking recourse before appropriate forum in appropriate Civil
Court and he cannot ask for specific performance of the contract until and unless the condition as
specified in the judgment rendered in the case of State Bank of India & Others Verus S.N.Goyal
reported in 2008 (8) SCC 92 has not been followed. In that view of the matter, it is urged by learned
counsel for the respondents that the judgment of coordinate bench of this Court passed in Shriram
Verma (supra) is not applicable in the present cases and, therefore, these petitions may be dismissed
at their threshold.
11. After hearing learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the undisputed facts of the present
cases, it is not in dispute that the petitioners were engaged either as Gram Rojgar Sahayak or
Sub-Engineers or Assistant Wardens under the Scheme prepared by Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rojgar
Guarantee Parishad and as per Clause 16, how the services of those persons can be terminated, has
not been disputed.
12. On perusal of Clause 16 of Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rojgar Guarantee Parishad, it is apparent that
in case of irregularities, dereliction in discharge of the duties and culpable negligence on proving
their services may be terminated. However, the core question is how those allegations can be
proved. As the petitioners are contract employees, therefore, for any allegation, an opportunity of
hearing may be given to them. This opportunity would be at the stage when the fact finding inquiry
is being prepared by the officers on imputation of the allegations against them or at the stage of
show cause. If a person has been given an opportunity of hearing while preparing the fact finding
inquiry and thereafter their services may be terminated giving a show cause notice to him.

Satyabhama Tripathi vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 August, 2017
13. In the present cases, the respondents have received a fact finding inquiry report against the
petitioners without giving an opportunity to defend on the allegation at the time of preparation of
the inquiry report and now by issuing a show cause notice, the order of termination has been
passed. The aforesaid recourse cannot be recognized in view of the judgment rendered by this Court
in the case of Rahul Tripathi (supra) and also in violation of principle of natural justice.
14. Insofar as the judgment of Rajendra Prasad Bakoriya (supra) is concerned; it is a case wherein
the order of termination is passed invoking condition No.6 of the appointment order. However, in
the said context, this Court has dealt with the issue of contract employment referring the judgment
of S.N.Goyal (supra). It is to be noted here that it is a case wherein the imputation of allegation of
irregularities or committing misconduct has been alleged to which inquiry ought to be conducted. It
is explained that the said inquiry may not be akin to the inquiry contemplated for the regular
employees as specified under the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Classification, Control & Appeal)
Rules, 1966 but the principle of natural justice ought to be observed to the misconduct, which is
alleged against them, affording an opportunity at the time of preparing the foundation for their
termination. It is a case wherein to prepare the foundation of termination, the opportunity of
hearing has not been given to the petitioners, therefore, relying upon the judgment rendered in the
case of Rahul Tripathi (supra), these appear to be the fit cases wherein the order of termination may
be quashed.
15. At this stage, the issue regarding completion of the contract period by the petitioners during the
tenure of the stay order has been pressed upon by learned counsel for the respondents. In this
regard, learned counsel for the petitioners has referred a Circular dated 6.7.2013 issued by the
Government of Madhya Pradesh, Ministry of Panchayat & Gramin Vikas Vibhag, Bhopal and
contended that now all the Gram Rojgar Sahayaks have been declared as Assistant Secretaries.
16. In this regard, it is suffice to observe here that the officers of the State Governments are at liberty
to take recourse of law as permissible to them considering the Circular of the department or if they
do not want to continue, it is with them to take a decision. This Court is having nothing to say on the
said issue because the said issue is not res integra in the relief as prayed for in these petitions.
17. Accordingly, all these petitions succeed and are hereby allowed and the order of termination
passed against the petitioners stand quashed. Except the petitioner of Writ Petition No.7684/2017,
the other persons are continuing on the basis of the stay order. However, they be continued subject
to decision by the authorities and the petitioner of Writ Petition No.7684/2017 be also reinstated if
he is not in service. However, it is open to the respondents to take recourse of law in view of the
foregoing observations and as per the procedure prescribed under the Scheme prepared by the
Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rojgar Guarantee Parishad.
