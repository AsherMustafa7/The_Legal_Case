was promoted to the post of Supervisor Sports at TELCO in the year 1973. On 1.4.1974, Sports
Directorate at U.P. was formed. The Chief Secretary, U.P. wrote a letter to the petitioner, offering
him appointment on the post of Deputy Director, Sports in the pay scale of 800-1450 with five

disciplinary proceeding were pending when the order of reversion in respect of the petitioner was

of reversion in the case of the petitioner without any basis. He next submits that the order of
reversion has been passed without issuing notice and opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.

9. Learned counsel for the petitioner has next submitted that once the respondents could not
proceed with the enquiry against the petitioner, they have resorted to passing of the impugned order
dated 28.04.2003, according to which, various deficiencies were found in the working of the
petitioner on the post of Director, Sports and opportunities were given to him to rectify his work but
as he has been unable to improve himself, it has been found that there is no chance of him
improving his work and consequently in exercise of power under Rule 19 (3) of the Uttar Pradesh
Sports Directorate (Gazetted Officers Services) Rules,1986 (hereinafter referred to as the ?Rules,
1986), a decision has been taken to revert him. He has further submitted that the impugned order
dated 28.04.2003 is illegal, arbitrary as well as mala fide considering the fact that the respondents
have sought to initiate the disciplinary proceeding against the petitioner but because of the infirmity
in the said proceedings which was subject matter of challenge before U.P. Public Services Tribunal,
they could not proceed and consequently have resorted to proceeding under the Rules, 1986 and
resorted to exercise of power under Rule 19 (3) of Rules 1986 to revert the services which power was
not available to them and also the manner of the exercise of power is clearly arbitrary and dehors
the rules.
10. In this regard, it was stated that according to the Rule 19 (1) of Rules, 1986, a person who is
appointed to a post in the service or against a permanent vacancy shall be placed on probation for a
period of two years and as per Rule 19 (2), the Appointing Authority may, for reasons to be
recorded, extend the period of probation in individual cases specifying the date up to which the
extension is granted and as per Rule 19 (3), if it appears to the Appointing Authority at any time
during or at the end of the period of probation or extended period of probation that a probationer
has not made sufficient use of his opportunities or has otherwise failed to give satisfaction, he may
be reverted to the substantive post, if any, and if he does not hold lien on any post, his services may
be dispensed with. He has further submitted that subsequently, the State of UP has promulgated the
Uttar Pradesh State Government Servants Confirmation Rules, 1991 (hereinafter referred to as the
?Rules, 1991?). According to Rule 2 of Rules, 1991, the aforesaid Rules have an overriding effects on
all the other rules existing inasmuch as it has been provided that Rules, 1991 shall have effect
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other rules made by the Governor under
the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution, or orders, for the time being in force. He has
submitted that the aspect of placing a Government servant on probation and subsequently
confirming him after completion of period of probation is subject matter of the Rules, 1991 and to
that extent, the said rules override the provisions of Rule 19 of the Rules, 1986. He has further
submitted that as per the Rules, 1991, in Clause (5), If a government servant is promoted on a
regular basis after following the prescribed procedure to aforesaid cadre where the promotion is
only source of recruitment but in case he is so promoted and in place on probation and in case he is
appointed without placing him on probation, then he shall be entitled to all the benefits as if he has
been confirmed in the said post. He has further submitted that as per Clause (3) of Rule 5 of Rules,
1991, a major deviation has been made from the Rules, 1986 to the effect that it is only on
completion of the period of probation, the work and conduct of the Government servant shall be
assessed and in case, the conclusion is that the Government servant is fit to hold his higher grade, he
would be confirmed on the said post, otherwise, he will be reverted. It has been emphasized that the
stage of consideration would be the ?completion of probation? and not ?during the probation?. He
has further submitted that as per Rule 19 of Rules, 1986, the said exercise could have been

conducted even during the period of probation but in coming into effect of the Rules, 1991, the said
exercise can be conducted only after the completion of the said period of probation. In this regard,
he has submitted that the petitioner was appointed and placed on probation by means of order
dated 08.11.2001 and as such two years? period would have been completed only on 07.11.2003, the
opportunity to assess the work of the petitioner would be only after 07.11.2003 and no any period
prior in light of Rule 5 (3) of Rules, 1991. He has further submitted that exercise of reverting is
otherwise a vulnerable extent of exercise of power inasmuch as when the respondents failed to
initiate disciplinary proceeding, they have resorting to invocation of Rule 19 of the Rules, 1986.
Accordingly, the order dated 28.04.2003 is without jurisdiction and contrary to the Rules and
deserves to be set aside.
11. Learned Additional Chief Standing Counsel, on the other hand, has opposed the prayer of
petitioner. He has submitted that firstly, it is undisputed fact that the petitioner was appointed on
the post of Director, Sports and placed on probation as per the order dated 08.11.2001. During his
working on the said post, several infirmities were found out and he was given several opportunities
to rectify himself and it is during this period, a decision was also taken to initiate disciplinary
proceeding against him. He does not dispute the fact that there was interference in the said
proceeding by the UP Public Services Tribunal and ultimately charge-sheet itself was quashed by the
Tribunal by means of judgment and order dated 05.01.2005. He also does not dispute this fact that,
in the meanwhile, the Rules, 1991 came into effect which have an overriding effect but looking into
the conduct of the petitioner, there is no infirmity in the impugned order, and consequently, the
petition deserves to be dismissed.
12. I have heard the rival contention of learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The
question arises, as to whether, the order date 28.04.2003 could have been passed considerating by
the respondents assessing the work of the petitioner prior to completion of period of probation. It is
noticed that the respondents have invoked the provision of Rule 19 of the Rules 1986, which
provides for assessing the work of the probationer, and in case, he is not fit to hold the higher grade,
then a suitable declaration in this regard could have been issued and the Government servant could
have been reverted to his original place of posting. The respondents probably lost sight of the fact
that Rule 19 ceased to exist in the manner as has been invoked by the respondents considering the
fact that in the meanwhile, the Rules, 1991 had come into effect which had an overriding effect over
the Rules, 1986 to the extent it provides for confirmation and further provides for the effects of
confirmation on the Government servant. Accordingly, the relevant aspect while coming into effect
of the Rules, 1991 was that the consideration pertaining to the assessment of work could have been
done only after completion of period of probation and not during the period of probation.
13. In the present case, the exercise of assessment was undoubtedly conducted during the period of
probation wherein he had six months remaining for completion of the probation. Accordingly,
impugned order dated 28.04.2003 is in fact relatable to exercise of power under Rule 5(3) of the
Rules, 1991, according to which, the said exercise is clearly arbitrary.
14. In light of the above, I find that the exercise of power is dehors the Rules, 1991 . Apart from the
said, I find that the said power has been invoked by the respondents, no in a bona fide manner, and

only after they had failed to proceed disciplinary proceeding against the petitioner. We also take
note of the fact that the petitioner has since retired from service.
15. For the aforesaid reasons, I find the substantial grounds are made out for interference of this
Court. Accordingly, the present writ petition is allowed and the order dated 28.04.2003 is hereby
quashed.
