Patna High Court L.P.A No.486 of 2022 dt.07-10-2025
2. The facts in brief are that the petitioner (respondent herein) was a Medical Officer under the
Bihar State Health Service and was posted as Chief Medical Officer (Child Specialist) under SNCU,
Sadar Hospital, Katihar. On basis of a complaint, an inquiry committee was constituted by the
District Magistrate, Katihar on 01.08.2012. On basis of the report of Inquiry Committee, Health
Department, State of Bihar initiated a departmental proceeding against the respondent. On
08.06.2021, an order was passed by the Health Department, State of Bihar, and the petitioner was
given the punishment of compulsory retirement at a lower pay scale. The petitioner was due to
superannuate on 30.09.2021.
3. The contention of the respondent herein in the Writ Petition was that on the basis of inquiry
report, a departmental proceeding was initiated by the Health Department against him, being one of
the members of the Purchase Committee. The respondent was called upon by the appellants herein
to explain the charges levelled against him on 28.12.2016, but he did not appear. However, he was
given another opportunity by the appellants, and subsequently, he appeared on 12.01.2017, and
submitted his written response explaining his inability to oppose the charges framed against him
and requested the appellants to Patna High Court L.P.A No.486 of 2022 dt.07-10-2025 supply all
evidence/documents relied upon by the Conducting Officer to prove the culpability of the
respondent. Thereafter, a second show cause was issued to the respondent, in response to which he
again raised objections with regard to non-supply of material evidence necessary to refute the
allegations of fraud/irregularities in the tender documents, comparative rate list and alleged
overwriting or cutting in the bid documents. The competent authority, finding that the respondent
had not submitted his response to the second show cause, passed an order of compulsory retirement
on a lower-pay scale, which was duly approved by the Bihar Public Service Commission and in the
Cabinet Meeting.
4. Being aggrieved with the order of the Departmental Authority dated 05.04.2018 and the order of
compulsory retirement dated 08.06.2021, the respondent preferred CWJC No. 12752 of 2021 before
the learned Single Judge.
5. The learned Single Judge, upon consideration of the materials on record, found that the
respondent (petitioner therein) had contended that there had been a non-compliance of the Bihar
Government Servants (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules, 2005 (for brevity 'CCA Rules'),
regarding the supply of material evidence. The learned Single Judge found Patna High Court L.P.A
No.486 of 2022 dt.07-10-2025 that such contention of the respondent was not controverted by the
appellants (respondents therein). Consequently, the order of compulsory retirement dated
08.06.2021 was set aside and the writ petition was allowed in part, and the matter was remanded
back to the disciplinary authority to complete the enquiry within a period of three months of the
impugned judgment.

6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the present appeal has been preferred by the appellants.
7. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the impugned judgment has been passed in a
casual manner, merely relying on the statements made in the writ petition that there is
non-compliance of the CCA Rules. Learned counsel further contended that the impugned
punishment order has been passed as per the provision contained in the CCA Rules when the
respondent failed to submit second show cause reply.
8. From the perusal of records of the case, we find that the respondent had contended in the writ
petition before the learned Single Judge that he had not been provided with the material evidences
and documents even after approaching the concerned authorities. The relevant paragraph of the
writ petition is reproduced as under:
"6. That since the Petitioner did not appear on the 28.12.2016, the Respondent No.3
vide Patna High Court L.P.A No.486 of 2022 dt.07-10-2025 another Letter No. 170
dated 29.12.2016 gave an additional opportunity to the Petitioner to appear before
him and adduce evidence and defend his cause in the Departmental Proceedings. In
compliance of the above mentioned letter, the Petitioner appeared before the
Respondent No.3 on 12.01.2017 with a written response explaining his inability to
oppose the charges framed against him, in absence of any bid document being
available with him or any other document with respect to purchases made and that
the evidence relied on by the conducting officer while initiating a Departmental
Proceeding was not provided to him. Despite all evidence and documents being kept
from the Petitioner, the Petitioner to the best of his ability and knowledge gave a
detailed written explanation with respect to each charge framed against him and
prayed to release him of all charges.
A copy of the written representation dated 12.01.2017 is annexed herewith and
marked as Annexure-2 to this petition.
7. That the Petitioner to make good his cause and to buttress his submission in the
Disciplinary Proceedings requested the Respondent No.3 to provide all evidence
which is relied on by the conducting officer to prove the culpability of the Petitioner.
However, despite repeated request by the Petitioner 20.03.2017, 26.05.2017 and
30.06.2017 to show all the Patna High Court L.P.A No.486 of 2022 dt.07-10-2025
evidences and specifically the signed technical and financial bid, the same was not
made available to the Petitioner. That the Respondent No.3 on 30.06.2017 allowed
the Petitioner access to some evidence however material evidence like the
comparative rate list, signed copies of technical and financial bid were still not made
available to the Petitioner.
A copy of the representation dated 20.03.2017, 26.05.2017 and 30.06.2017 is
attached herewith and marked as Annexure-3 (Series) to this petition."

9. Further, Rule 17(4) of the CCA Rules clearly states that the government servant has to be provided
with all documents and witnesses by which each article of charge is proposed to be sustained. The
relevant part of Rule 17 of CCA Rules is reproduced as under:
"(4) The disciplinary authority shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Government Servant a copy of the articles of charge, such statement of the
imputations of misconduct or misbehaviour and a list of documents and witnesses by
which each article of charge is proposed to be sustained and shall require the
Government Servant to submit, within such time as may be specified, a written
statement of his defence and to state whether he desires to be heard in person."
10. Upon further perusal of records, it is evident that Patna High Court L.P.A No.486 of 2022
dt.07-10-2025 the above mentioned paragraphs of Writ Petition (Paragraph 6 and 7 of the Writ
Petition) were not replied in the counter affidavit by the appellants, and as such, it can be correctly
proceeded with that there was a non-compliance of CCA Rules.
11. Therefore, we are of the view that the learned Single Judge had rightly set aside the order dated
08.06.2021 and remanded the matter to the disciplinary authority to commence and complete the
enquiry from the defective stage.
12. Accordingly, we do not find any reason to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge,
and the present appeal stands dismissed.
13. Interlocutory application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.
