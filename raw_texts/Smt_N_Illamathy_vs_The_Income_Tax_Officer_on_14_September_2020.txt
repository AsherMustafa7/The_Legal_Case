The Honourable Mr.Justice T.S.SIVAGNANAM and The Honourable Mrs.Justice
V.BHAVANI SUBBAROYAN Tax Case Appeal No.795 of 2019 Smt.N.Illamathy
...Appellant Vs The Income Tax Officer, Ward II(2), Erode. ...Respondent APPEAL
under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 against the order dated 06.1.2009
made in ITA.No.2442/Mds/2007 on the file of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,
Chennai 'A' Bench for the assessment year 1997-98.
For Appellant: Mr.D.G.Hariprasath for M/s.G.R.Associates For Respondent:
Mr.T.R.Senthilkumar, SSC assisted by Ms.K.G.Usharani, JSC Judgment was
delivered by T.S.Sivagnanam,J We have heard Mr.D.G.Hariprasath, learned counsel
appearing http://www.judis.nic.in on behalf of M/s.G.R.Associates, learned counsel
on record for the appellant – assessee and Mr.T.R.Senthilkumar, learned Senior
Standing Counsel assisted by Ms.K.G.Usharani, learned Junior Standing Counsel
appearing for the respondent – Revenue.
2. This appeal, filed by the Revenue under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for brevity, the
Act), is directed against the order dated 06.1.2009 made in ITA.No.2442/Mds/2007 the file of the
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chennai 'A' Bench (for short, the Tribunal) for the assessment year
1997-98.
3. The Revenue filed this appeal by raising the following substantial questions of law :
“i. Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Tribunal was justified in
confirming the direction of the Commissioner (Appeal) to issue notice for reassessment under
Section 149 of the Income Tax Act for the assessment year 1997-98 while deciding the merit of the
appeal in respect of the assessment year 2002-03 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ?
http://www.judis.nic.in ii. Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the
Tribunal was justified in ignoring the contention that the Assessing Authority had simply followed
and carried out the direction of the Commissioner (Appeal) ignoring the provision contained in
Section 150(2), which makes it clear that the embargo on period of limitation lifted under
Sub-Section (1) for the purpose of reassessment would not apply to the assessments, which have
attained finality due to bar of limitation applicable at the relevant period of time ?

Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
iii. Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Tribunal was justified in
ignoring the contention that the finding/direction by the Commissioner (Appeal) can be given only
to the extent it is necessary for the disposal of the appeal in respect of the assessment of a particular
year and thus the direction given in the matter for the assessment year 2002-03 cannot effect the
assessment for the assessment year 1997-98? and iv. Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the
case and in law, the Tribunal was justified in ignoring the http://www.judis.nic.in contention that
the reassessment is barred by limitation and void ab initio because reopening of the assessment is
after expiry of limitation by the relevant provisions of Statute?”
4. The short issue, which falls for consideration in this appeal, is as to the validity of the reopening of
assessment for the assessment year 1997-98.
5. The assessee – an individual filed her return of income for the assessment year under
consideration namely 1997-98 on 31.3.1999 admitting an income of Rs.86,270/-. The return was
processed under Section 143(1) of the Act. In respect of the assessment year 2002-03, the assessee
filed an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-I, Coimbatore [for short, the
CIT(A)]. In that appeal, the CIT(A) noted that a sum of Rs.10 lakhs was received by the assessee
from a firm in the year 1996 and out of the said sum of Rs.10 lakhs, the assessee accounted for a sum
of Rs.4,41,551/- in the previous year ending 31.3.1997 towards commission received and the balance
of Rs.5,58,449/- was shown as payable to the firm. The CIT(A) came to the conclusion that the
assessee was liable to admit the difference of Rs.5,58,449/- as commission received for the
assessment year 1997-98. Accordingly, by order dated 20.10.2005, the CIT(A) directed the
Assessing Officer to assess the turnover of Rs.5,58,449/- for the http://www.judis.nic.in assessment
year 1997-98.
6. Pursuant to such a direction issued by the CIT(A), the Assessing Officer issued a notice dated
22.12.2005 under Section 148 of the Act proposing to reopen the assessment solely for the reason
assigned in the order passed by the CIT(A) dated 20.10.2005. The assessee objected to the
reopening on the ground that the same was barred by limitation and in support of her contention,
she relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.M.Sharma Vs. ITO
[repored in (2002) 254 ITR 772]. However, vide order dated 04.12.2006, the Assessing Officer
rejected the contention advanced by the assessee and determined the income at Rs.6,44,720/- by
including the said sum of Rs.5,58,449/- as directed by the CIT(A).
7. As against the order dated 04.12.2006 passed by the Assessing Officer, the assessee filed an
appeal before the CIT(A), who dismissed the appeal vide order dated 05.10.2007 holding that the
assessment for the year 1997-98 was completed as per the direction issued by the CIT(A) while
deciding the appeal for the assessment year 2002-03.
http://www.judis.nic.in
8. Challenging the order passed by the CIT(A), the assessee filed further appeal before the Tribunal,
which also dismissed the appeal by the impugned order on the ground that the assessee should have
challenged the direction issued by the CIT(A) dated 20.10.2005 and in the absence of any challenge
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194180531/ 2
Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
to the direction issued by the CIT(A) dated 20.10.2005, the same had become final and the assessee
could not challenge the validity of the notice issued under Section 148 of the Act dated 22.12.2005.
Challenging the impugned order, the assessee is before us by way of this appeal.
9. The first issue, which needs to be considered, is as to whether the assessee could challenge the
validity of the notice under Section 148 of the Act.
10. The CIT(A) as well as the Tribunal fell in error in holding that the assessee was estopped from
challenging the validity of the notice under Section 148 of the Act dated 22.12.2005 on a wrong
understanding of the legal position. The CIT(A) issued a direction in the order dated 20.10.2005 to
the Assessing Officer to assess the turnover of Rs.5,58,449/- as commission received. There were
two options open to the assessee. One was to prefer an appeal against the order passed by the
CIT(A) dated 20.10.2005, which, in fact, was an order in an appeal filed for the assessment year
2002-03. The other http://www.judis.nic.in option open to her was to contest the matter before the
Assessing Officer upon issuance of the notice under Section 148 of the Act.
11. The assessee, in the case on hand, chose the second option, which, in law, was permissible to be
done by the assessee. Therefore, both the CIT(A) as well as the Tribunal fell in error in holding that
the assessee was estopped from challenging the validity of the notice under Section 148 of the Act
dated 22.12.2005.
12. The next issue is as to whether the Assessing Officer, the CIT(A) and the Tribunal were right in
holding that the period of limitation exceeded on the date of issuance of the notice under Section
148 of the Act dated 22.12.2005 for the assessment year 1997-98.
13. Once again, the Authorities below as well as the Tribunal committed an error of law in not
extending the law of limitation in the manner it has to be interpreted.
14. An identical issue was considered by the Delhi High Court in the case of C.B.Richards Ellis
Mauritius Ltd. Vs. Assistant Director of Income-tax [reported in (2012) 21 Taxmann.com 535]
wherein also, the assessment was sought to be reopened for the assessment year 1998-99. The
Court, after taking note of the various decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, held as follows :
http://www.judis.nic.in “7. Having considered the contentions of the parties and the
legal issues raised therein, we feel that the petitioner is entitled to succeed. Section 6
of General Clauses Act deals with effect of repeal of an enactment and stipulates that
unless a different intention appears, the repeal will not affect the previous operation
of any enactment so repealed or any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired,
accrued or affect any penalty, investigation, legal proceeding or remedy. The said
Section deals with substantive rights and liabilities. It is also subject to intention to
the contrary. Intention can be implied. The procedural law when it is repealed should
be applied from the date the new provision or procedure comes into force. The reason
is that no person has a vested right or an accrued right in the procedure. No
obligation or liability is normally imposed by a procedure. Sometime distinction is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194180531/ 3
Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
drawn between the right acquired or accrued and legal proceedings to acquire a right.
In the latter case, there is only hope which is destroyed by the repeal. What is
protected is the preserved right and privileges acquired and accrued and
corresponding obligation and liability incurred on the other party. The legal
http://www.judis.nic.in process or the procedure for the enjoyment of the said right
is not protected. Section 6, normally does not apply to procedural law. The
procedural law when amended or substituted is generally retroactive and applies
from the day of its enforcement and to this extent it can be retrospective. The
question raised is whether the amendment/substitution of the period with effect from
1.6.2001 in Section 149 of the Act, is procedural or substantive.
......
12. Law of limitation does not create any right in favour of a person or define or
create any cause of action, but simply prescribes that the remedy can be exercised or
availed of by or within the period stated and not thereafter.
Subsequently, the right continues to exist but cannot be enforced. The liability to tax under the Act
is created by the charging Section read with the computation provisions. The assessment
proceedings crystallize the said liability so that it can be enforced and the tax if short paid or unpaid
can be collected. If this difference between liability to tax and the procedure prescribed under the
Act for computation of the liability (i.e. the procedure of assessment), is kept in mind, there would
http://www.judis.nic.in be no difficulty in understanding and appreciating the fallacy and the error
in the primary argument raised by the Revenue. It is a settled position that liability to tax as a levy is
normally determined as per statute as it exists on the first day of the assessment year, but this is not
the issue or question in the present case. The issue or question in the present case relates to
assessment i.e. initiation of re-assessment proceedings and whether the time/limitation for
initiation of the re-assessment proceedings specified by the Finance Act, 2001 is applicable. We are
not determining/deciding the liability to tax but have to adjudicate and decide whether the re-
assessment notice is beyond the time period stipulated. This is a matter/issue of procedure i.e. the
time period in which the assessment or re-assessment proceedings can be initiated. Thus the time
period/limitation period prescribed on the date of issue of notice will apply. In our opinion, the
answer is clear and has to be in affirmative, i.e. in favour of the assessee.
13. This question is not debatable or res integra and was examined and answered with lucid and
clear reasoning in the opinion http://www.judis.nic.in expressed by Hidayatullah, J. on behalf of
himself and Raghubar Dayal, J. in S.C. Prashar v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas Hungerfor Investment
Trust Ltd. [1963] 49 ITR 1 (SC). The relevant portion reads:- 9/11/2020 www.taxmann.com 6/7 "93.
....If the 1948 Amendment could be treated as enabling the Income Tax Officer to take action at any
point of time in respect of back assessment years within eight years of March 30, 1948 then such
cases were within his power to tax. We have such a case here in CA No. 509 of 1958 where the notice
was issued in 1949 to the lady whose husband had remitted Rs 9180 to her from Bangkok in the year
relative to Assessment Year 1942-43. That lady was assessable in respect of this sum under Section
4(2) of the Income Tax Act. She did not file a return. If the case stood governed by the 1939
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194180531/ 4
Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
Amendment the period applicable would have been four years if she had not concealed the
particulars of the income. She had of course not deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars
thereof. If the case was governed by the 1948 Amendment she would come within the eight-year rule
because she had failed to furnish a return. Now, we do not think that we can treat the
http://www.judis.nic.in different periods indicated under Section 34 as periods of limitation, the
expiry of which grant prescriptive title to defaulting tax-payers It may be said that an assessment
once made is final and conclusive except for the provisions of Sections 34 and 35 but it is quite a
different matter to say that a "vested right" arises in the assessee. On the expiry of the period the
assessments, if any, may also become final and conclusive but only so long as the law is not altered
retrospectively. Under the scheme of the Income Tax Act a liability to pay tax is incurred when
according to the Finance Act in force the amount of income, profits or gains is above the exempted.
That liability to the State is independent of any consideration of time and, in the absence of any
provision restricting action by a time limit, it can be enforced at any time. What the law does is to
prevent harassment of assessees to the end of time by prescribing a limit of time for its own officers
to take action. This limit of time is binding upon the officers, but the liability under the charging
section can only be said to be unenforceable after the expiry of the period under the law as it stands.
In other words, though the liability to pay tax remains it http://www.judis.nic.in cannot be enforced
by the officers administering the tax laws. If the disability is removed or according to a new law a
new time limit is created retrospectively, there is no reason why the liability should not be treated as
still enforceable. The law does not deal with concluded claims or their revival but with the
enforcement of a liability to the State which though existing remained to be enforced… ** ** ** 95.
.....It says that the limit of time mentioned in Section 34 is removed in certain cases that is to say,
action can be taken at any time in these cases. In our judgment, each case of a notice must be judged
according to the law existing on the date the notice was issued or served, as the law may require. So
long as the notice where the notice is in question, and the assessment, where the assessment is in
question, are within the time limited by the law, as it exists when the respective actions are taken,
the actions cannot be questioned provided the law is clearly retrospective. The only case in which no
further action can be taken is one in which action was not taken under the old law within the period
prescribed by that law and which is not also within the period mentioned in the
http://www.judis.nic.in new law if its operation is retrospective. All other cases are covered by the
law in force at the time action is taken. It is from these viewpoints that these appeals, in our opinion,
should be judged."
14. In the said case, question of validity of notice had arisen because of repeated/ frequent changes
made in the period in which re-assessment proceedings could be initiated under Section 34 of the
income Tax Act, 1922 during the years 1939-59. Revalidation Act had also been enacted. This ratio
was followed and applied in CIT v. Sardar Lakhmir Singh [1963] 49 ITR 70 (SC), CIT v. Janabha
Muhammad Hussain Nachiar Ammal AIR 1963 SC 1401 and in ITO v . Murlidhar Bhagwan Das
[1964] 52 ITR 335 (SC).
15. Referring to this decision in Hussain Bhai v. CIT [1971] 80 ITR 477 the Supreme Court examined
whether Section 4 of the Income Tax (Amending) Act of 1959 saves a fresh notice under Section 34
from the bar of limitation. It was held that Section 4 of the Income Tax (Amending) Act, 1959 does
not save the fresh notice. It was observed as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194180531/ 5
Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
'We are supported in the view we have http://www.judis.nic.in taken by certain
observations of Sarkar J., as he then was, in S.C. Prashar v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas (1).
The court in that case was not concerned with assessment years in respect of which a
notice could be issued under section 34(1)(a) of the Act, as amended by the Finance
Act of 1956, but the present case was visualised by Sarkar J. in that case. He observed
: "So, though section 4 of the 1959 Act freed a notice from the bar of limitation in
respect of it imposed by the 1948 amendment, it did not altogether do away with all
prescriptions of time. In spite of section 4, a notice contemplated by it would be
subject to the prescription of time as to its issue under the 1939 Act and may be,
under section 34 as it stood before the 1939 amendment. If the notice was issued
after 9/11/2020 www. Taxmann.com 7/7 the 1956 amendment, it would also be
subject to the prescription as to time provided by that amendment. [Emphasis
supplied] Then it was said that if section 4 applied to a notice issued more than eight
years after the year in which the income escaped assessment but before the 1956
amendment came into force in a case where the escaped income of the year was less
than http://www.judis.nic.in Rs. 1,00,000, the position would be curious. A notice
issued in a similar case after the 1956 amendment would be bad under section 34 as
it then stood and section 4 could not save it for it saved notices only from the effect of
the 1948 amendment. The position then would be that in a case involving the same
amount of escaped income for the same year, a notice issued before the 1956
amendment and invalid under the 1948 amendment would be validated and a more
recent notice equally invalid under both the earlier and present laws would remain
invalid. Assume that the position is somewhat curious or incongruous. But that
seems to me to be the result of the words used. For all we know that might have been
intended. However strange, if at all, the result may be, I do not think the courts can
alter the plain meaning of the language of the statute only on the ground of
incongruity if there is nothing in the words which would justify the alteration. As I
have said earlier, in this case there is nothing to justify the alteration of the plain
meaning.'
16. Going back a little in point of time in J.P. Jani, ITO v. Induprasad Devshaner Bhatt [1969] 72
ITR 595 (SC), it was held that the http://www.judis.nic.in Income Tax Officer cannot issue notice
under Section 148 of the Act, where the right to re- open an assessment was barred under the
Income Tax Act, 1922 on the date when the 1961 Act came into force. This is a separate issue and
aspect which need not be examined and dealt with in this case. The issue/question in Induprasad
Devshanker Bhatt's case (supra) was what would be the legal position in case the period prescribed
for initiation of the re- assessment proceedings is enhanced or extended under the new statute. We
are not required to and do not examine or consider this aspect/question.”
15. The above decision was relied upon and followed in the decision of the Delhi High Court in the
case of Brahm Datt Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax [reported in (2018) 100
Taxmann.com 324] wherein the Court followed the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of K.M.Sharma. The relevant portions in the decision in the case of Brahm Datt read as follows
:

Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
“13. In KM Sharma's case (supra) the assessee's land was acquired under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 and an award was passed in 1967 granting compensation in
favour of the assessee. Thereafter, the http://www.judis.nic.in Additional District
Judge by judgment dated 20.05.1980 held the assessee to be entitled to 1/32th share
of the compensation and the assessee was granted total compensation of Rs. 1,18,810
in the year 1981. Subsequently, by another judgment dated 31.07.1991, the assessee
was awarded sum of Rs.
1,10,20,624, which was received by it between 15.10.1992 and 25.05.1993. The said
amount comprised of principal compensation as well as interest up to 18.05.1992. As
land acquired was agricultural land, principal amount was not chargeable to tax;
however, interest amounting to Rs. 76,84,829 was chargeable on year to year basis.
The assessee claimed that proceedings till assessment year 1982-83 had already
attained finality and therefore, filed letter requesting the assessing officer to initiate
proceedings for subsequent assessment years for bringing to tax interest component
relatable to the said assessment years. The assessee was, however, issued notices
under section148 of the Act for fifteen assessment years, viz., assessment years
1968-69 to 1971-72 and assessment years 1981-82 to 1992-93 which were challenged
on the ground of limitation. This court declined to exercise http://www.judis.nic.in
jurisdiction; on appeal, the Supreme Court held that the provision regulating period
of limitation ought to receive strict construction.
The Supreme Court held that the law of limitation was intended to give certainty and finality to legal
proceedings and therefore, proceedings, which had attained finality under the existing law due to
bar of limitation, could not be held to be open for revival unless the amended provision was clearly
given retrospective operation so as to allow upsetting of proceedings, which had already been
completed and attained finality. The observations of the Supreme Court are reproduced hereunder:
'10. The main question that has been raised on behalf of the learned counsels
appearing for the parties is whether the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 150 as
amended can be availed for reopening assessments, which have attained finality and
could not be reopened due to bar of limitation, that was attracted at the relevant time
to the proposed reassessment proceedings under the provisions of section149.
11. The submission made on behalf of the appellant is that neither the provisions of
http://www.judis.nic.in sub-section (1) nor sub-section (2) can be read as giving
more than intended operation to the said provision. The provisions, it is argued, do
not permit the authorities to reopen assessments, which have become final and
reassessment of which had become barred by time before 1.4.1989 when section
150(1) was amended Reliance is placed on the decision in S.S. Gadgil v. Lal & Co.
[1964] 53 ITR 231.
12. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the department has made an effort to
persuade this Court to accept his construction of the provisions of section 150(1)and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194180531/ 7
Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
(2). It is argued that it is for the specific purpose of assessing income, which might
accrue on the basis of any decision of any Court in any proceeding in any other law,
that the provision has been amended to lift bar of limitation for reassessment.
13. Fiscal statute, more particularly a provision such as the present one regulating
period of limitation must receive strict construction. The law of limitation is intended
to give certainty and finality to legal proceedings and to avoid exposure to risk of
litigation to litigant for indefinite period on future unforeseen events. Proceedings,
which http://www.judis.nic.in have attained finality under existing law due to bar of
limitation cannot be held to be open for revival unless the amended provision is
clearly given retrospective operation so as to allow upsetting of proceedings, which
had already been concluded and attained finality. The amendment to subsection (1)
of section 150 is not expressed to be retrospective and, therefore, has to be held as
only prospective.
The amendment made to sub-section (1) of section 150 which intends to lift embargo of period of
limitation under section 149 to enable authorities to reopen assessments not only on the basis of
orders passed in proceedings under the Act but also on order of a Court in any proceedings under
any law, has to be applied prospectively on or after 1.4.1989 when the said amendment was
introduced to sub-section (1). The provision in subsection (1), therefore, can have only prospective
operation to assessments, which have not become final due to expiry of period of limitation
prescribed for assessment under section 149.
14. To hold that the amendment to sub- section (1) would enable the authorities to reopen
assessments, which had already http://www.judis.nic.in attained finality due to bar of limitation
prescribed under section 149 as applicable prior to 1.4. 1989, would amount to give sub section (1) a
retrospective operation which is neither expressly nor impliedly intended by the amended
sub-section.
15. On behalf of the assessee before the High Court and in this Court reliance has been placed on the
provisions contained in sub- section (2) of section 150. It is submitted that the provision contained
in sub-section (2) of section150 is in the nature of clarification or Explanation to sub section(1).
Subsection (2) makes it clear that the embargo of period of limitation lifted under sub section (1) for
proposed reassessments based on order in proceedings under appeal, reference or revision, as the
case may be, would not apply to assessments which have attained finality due to bar of limitation
applicable at the relevant time.
16. The High Court rejected the above contention of the assessee on the ground that on the
amendment introduced with effect from 1.4.1989 in sub-section (1), which enables reopening of
assessment based on any Order of 'Court in any proceedings in any law', there
http://www.judis.nic.in is no corresponding amendment made in sub- section (2) of Section 150 to
bar reassessment based on Order of Court passed in any proceedings in any law in cases where
prescribed period of litigation for reassessment had already expired.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194180531/ 8
Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
17. We do not find the above reasoning of the High Court is sound. The plain language of sub-section
(2) of Section 150 clearly restricts application of sub-section (1) to enable the Authority to reopen
assessments which have not already become final on the expiry of prescribed period of limitation
under Section 149. As is sought to be done by the High Court, sub-section (2) of Section 150 cannot
be held applicable only to reassessments based on Orders 'in proceedings under the Act' and not to
Orders of Court 'in proceedings under any other law'. Such an interpretation would make the whole
provision under Section 150 discriminatory in its application to assessments sought to be reopened
on the basis of Orders under the IT Act and other assessments proposed to be reopened on the basis
of Orders under any other law. Interpretation, which creates such unjust and discriminatory
situation, has to be http://www.judis.nic.in avoided. We do not find that sub-section (2) of section
150 has that result. Subsection (2) intends to insulate all proceedings of assessments, which have
attained finality due to the then existing bar of limitation. To achieve the desired result it was not
necessary to make any amendment in sub-section (2) corresponding to sub-section (1), as is the
reasoning adopted by the High Court.
18. Sub-section (2) aims at putting embargo on reopening assessments, which have attained finality
on expiry of prescribed period of limitation. Sub-section (2) in putting such embargo refers to whole
of sub-section (1) meaning thereby to insulate all assessments, which have become final and may
have been found liable to reassessments or re-computation either on the basis of Orders in
proceedings under the Act or Orders of Courts passed under any other law. The High Court,
therefore, was in error in not reading whole of amended sub-section (1) into sub- section (2) and
coming to the conclusion that reassessment proposed on the basis of order of Court in proceedings
under Land Acquisition Act could be commenced even though the original assessments for the
relevant years in http://www.judis.nic.in question have attained finality on expiry of period of
limitation under Section 149 of the Act. On a combined reading of sub-section (1) as amended with
effect from 1.4.1989 and subsection (2) of Section 150 as it stands, in our view, a fair and just
interpretation would be that the Authority under the Act has been empowered only to reopen
assessments, which have not already been closed and attained finality due to the operation of the
bar of limitation under Section 149.
19. This Court took similar view in the case of S.S. Gadgil (supra) in somewhat comparable situation
arising from the retrospective operation given to Section 34(I) of Income Tax Act, 1922 as amended
with retrospective effect from 1.4.1956 by the Finance Act of 1956. In the case of S.S. Gadgil (supra)
admittedly under clause (iii) of the proviso to Section 34(I) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, as it
then stood, a notice of assessment or reassessment could not be issued against a person deemed to
be an agent of a non-resident under Section 43, after the expiry of one year from the end of the year
of assessment. The Section was amended by Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1956, extending
http://www.judis.nic.in this period of limitation to two years from the end of the assessment year.
The amended was given retrospective effect from April 1, 1956. On March 12, 1957, the Income Tax
Officer issued a notice calling upon the assessee to show cause why, in respect of the assessment
year 1954-55, the assessee should not be treated as an agent under Section 43 in respect of certain
non-residents. The case of the assessee, inter alia, was that the proposed action was barred by
limitation as right to commence proceedings of assessment against the assessee as an agent of
non-resident for the assessment year 1954-55 ended on 31.3.1956, under the Act before it was

Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
amended in 1956. This Court in the case of S.S. Gadgil (supra) accepted the contention of the
assessee and held as under: "
'The legislature has given to section 18 of the Finance Act, 1956, only a limited
retrospective operation, i.e., up to April 1, 1956, only. That provision must be read
subject to the rule that in the absence of an express provision or clear implication, the
legislature does not intend to attribute to the amending provision a greater
retrospectivity than is expressly mentioned, nor to authorise http://www.judis.nic.in
the Income-tax Officer to commence proceedings which before the new Act came into
force had by the expiry of the period provided become barred.'
20. On a proper construction of the provisions of Section 150 (1) and the effect of its
operation from 1.4.1989, we are clearly of the opinion that the provisions cannot be
given retrospective effect prior to 1.4.1989 for assessments which have already
become final due to bar of limitation prior to 1.4.1989. Taxing provision imposing a
liability is governed by normal presumption that it is not retrospective and settled
principle of law is that the law to be applied is that which is in force in the assessment
year unless otherwise provided expressly or by necessary implication. Even a
procedural provision cannot in the absence of clear contrary intendment expressed
therein be given greater retrospectivity than is expressly mentioned so as to enable
the Authorities to affect finality of tax assessments or to open up liabilities, which
have become barred by lapse of time. Our conclusion, therefore, is that sub-section
(1) of Section 150, as amended with effect from 1.4.1989, does not enable the
Authorities to http://www.judis.nic.in reopen assessments, which have become final
due to bar of limitation prior to 1.4.1989 and this position is applicable equally to
reassessments proposed on the basis of Orders passed under the Act or under any
other law.'
14. The ratio of KM Sharma and S.S. Gadgil, in the opinion of this court covers the
facts of this case. Reassessment for 1998-99 could not be reopened beyond
31.03.2005 in terms of provisions of Section 149 of the Act as applicable at the
relevant time. The petitioner's return for assessment year 1998- 99 became barred by
limitation on 31.03.2005. The question of revival of the period of limitation for
reopening assessment for AY 1998-99 by taking recourse to the subsequent
amendment made in Section 149 of the Act in the year 2012, i.e., more than 8 years
after expiration of limitation on 31.03.2005, has been dealt with by the Supreme
Court in KM. Sharma (supra).”
16. Apart from the above decisions, there are several other decisions on the point and
it may not be necessary for this Court to refer to all those decisions, as the issue is no
longer res integra. Thus, the Tribunal fell in error in dismissing the appeal filed by
the assessee.

Smt.N.Illamathy vs The Income Tax Officer on 14 September, 2020
http://www.judis.nic.in The Tribunal also fell in error in not taking note of the
settled legal position that the law applicable as on the date of issuance of notice alone
should be taken into consideration.
17. As per Section 149 of the Act as it stood prior to amendment by the Finance Act
2001 with effect from 01.6.2001, the limitation provided under Section 149(b)(iii) of
the Act was seven years, but not more than 10 years from the end of the relevant
assessment year unless income chargeable to tax, which has escaped assessment,
amounts to or is likely to amount to Rs.50,000/- or more for that year.
After amendment, in terms of Section 149(1)(b) of the Act, no notice under Section
148 shall be issued for the relevant assessment year if four years, but not more than
six years have lapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year unless the income
chargeable to tax, which has escaped assessment, amounts to or is likely to amount to
one lakh rupees or more for that year.
18. Admittedly, the notice under Section 148 of the Act was issued by the Assessing
Officer on 22.12.2005 and the law applicable as on date prescribed the limitation of
four years, but not more than six years. Thus, the notice issued on or after 31.3.2004
would suffer from lack of jurisdiction as it is clearly hit by the limitation prescribed
under the Statute. Unfortunately, the Tribunal failed to take note of
http://www.judis.nic.in this very important legal issue, which has been settled by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. In fact, the assessee, at the earliest point of time, referred to
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.M.Sharma, which was
erroneously distinguished by the Assessing Officer, the CIT(A) and the Tribunal and
they committed an error in gross violation of the Statute.
19. For the above reasons, the above tax case appeal is allowed, the orders passed by
(i) the Assessing Officer dated 04.12.2006, (ii) the CIT(A) dated 05.10.2007 and (iii)
the Tribunal dated 06.1.2009 are set aside and the substantial questions of law raised
are answered in favour of the assessee. No costs.
