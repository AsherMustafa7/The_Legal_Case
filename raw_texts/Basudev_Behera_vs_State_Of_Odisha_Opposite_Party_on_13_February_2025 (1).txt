For the Petitioners : Mr. Bijay Kumar Mohanty, Advocate
For the Opposite Party : Mr. Bibekananda Bhuyan,
Advocate for OPID
CORAM:
THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE SIBO SANKAR MISHRA
Date of Hearing: 23.12.2024 : : Date of Judgment: 13.02.2025 S.S. Mishra, J. In delivering this
judgment, I am reminded of a story I heard as a child - one that speaks of the profound importance
of liberty and freedom for a human being. The story goes as follows: A jail barrack man was arrested
on allegation of a petty crime and was put behind bars. This broke him into tears. The co-prisoner
observantly said it shouldn't make any difference to him as he has been all along sitting on the other
side of the door in the barrack for last 20 years, it shouldn't bother him now. The barrack man
replied with all his consciousness, sitting on the other side of the door for 20 years was unrestrictive
with all his freedom and liberty at his command. Today my liberty is withdrawn which indeed was
my life. Liberty is the breath of life. Sans it, it(cid:128)s like a bird with crippled wings.
Much like the story, the case before this Court is not purely about the procedural jargon that the
petitioner is facing, but about his fundamental right of life and liberty enshrined under Article 21 of
the Constitution of India. With this prospective, I now venture into the facts of the present case.
Entitlement of the petitioner of his release from the custody after completion of more than 50% of
the maximum sentence prescribed for the offences he is charged with the issues involved in all these
five cases. Therefore, analogously the matters are being heard and by a common Judgment, all the
five matters are being disposed of.

2. Heard Mr. B.K. Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Bibekananda Bhuyan,
learned Counsel for the OPID.
3. For better appreciation of facts of each case and developments that have taken place in the
interregnum are enumerated herein in seriatim. An FIR lodged by the informant, Arun Rana, who
alleged that he had given a total amount of Rs.16,50,000/- to six individuals associated with M/s.
Satyam Sai Infrastructure Office in Cuttack for the purchase of land at two locations. The petitioner,
Basudev Behera, issued two cheques amounting to Rs.4,00,000/- (Rs.3,00,000/- and
Rs.1,00,000/-), which were dishonored due to insufficient funds and account closure. The incident
was later published in a newspaper, leading to the arrest of four individuals by Chauliaganj Police
Station. The petitioner was implicated under Sections 420/34 of the IPC read with Section 6 of the
OPID Act, alleging fraudulent inducement and misappropriation of money without fulfilling the
promise of land transaction.
(cid:129) Petitioner was taken into custody on 13.11.2017. (cid:129) The petitioner had earlier moved for bail before
the High Court in BLAPL No.1050 of 2019, and bail was granted on 15.05.2019, subject to his
furnishing a cash security of Rs.10,00,000/-. (cid:129) Unable to comply with the condition, he filed I.A.
No.61/2020, seeking modification of bail conditions.
(cid:129) The High Court, vide order dated 12.02.2020, reduced the cash security to Rs.5,00,000/-, but the
petitioner was still unable to arrange the amount and remained in custody.
This case concerns with a complaint filed by Jitendra Kumar Nayak and Priyaranjan Behera on
09.11.2017, alleging that the petitioner misrepresented himself as the Managing Partner of M/s.
Satyam Sai Infratech and deceived them into paying Rs.2,50,000/- and Rs.1,60,000/- respectively,
for land transactions. The petitioner failed to execute the sale deed and issued cheque, which on
presentation got bounced. The offences alleged against the petitioner include Sections
420/468/471/34 of IPC r/w Section 6 of the OPID Act.
(cid:129) The petitioner filed a bail application being BLAPL No.1063 of 2019 before this Court.
(cid:129) This Court granted bail on 15.05.2019, with the condition to furnish cash security of (cid:130)1,00,000/-.
(cid:129) Due to financial constraints, the petitioner filed I.A. No.64/2020 for modification of bail
conditions.
(cid:129) On 12.02.2020, this Court although reduced the cash security to (cid:130)40,000/-, but the petitioner was
still unable to arrange the amount and remained in custody.
An FIR lodged by the informant, Ajay Kumar Sahoo, who alleged that on 10.02.2017, he had
engaged with the petitioner and his wife, Deepanjali Sahoo, for a land transaction worth
(cid:130)10,00,000/- at M/s. Satyam Sai Infratech. The amount was paid through Bijay Sahoo, but the
accused failed to provide the land and returned only (cid:130)1,50,000/-. As per an agreement dated
17.06.2017, the accused promised to refund the remaining amount by 28.06.2017. He issued
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123221017/ 2
Basudev Behera vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 13 February, 2025
cheques totalling (cid:130)1,80,000/- and assured further payment by 15.07.2017. However, instead of
fulfilling his commitment, the accused threatened the informant over phone, denying any
wrongdoing and warned him not to file a police complaint. The accused(cid:128)s wife also allegedly
threatened the informant, disclaiming any knowledge of the transaction. As a result, an FIR was
registered, implicating the petitioner for commission of alleged offences under Sections 420/ 468/
294/ 506/34 of IPC and Section 6 of the OPID Act.
(cid:129) The petitioner filed a bail application being BLAPL No.1951 of 2019 before this Court.

was still unable to arrange the amount and remained in custody.
An FIR lodged by the informant, Smt. Kabita Mohanty, a 47 year-old resident of Mahanadi Vihar.
She alleged that the petitioner, representing M/s. Satyam Sai Infratech Real Estate, fraudulently
convinced her to pay Rs.1,70,000/- for a land transaction that never materialized. After facing
delays and discovering that the petitioner had no actual land to offer, she realized that she had been
deceived. The investigation revealed that the petitioner had similarly collected large sums from
various individuals, issuing cheques, all of which got bounced on presentation and misrepresenting
ownership of land. Basing on these allegations, the petitioner was charged for alleged commission of
offences under Sections 420/468/471/34 of IPC read with Section 6 of the OPID Act. (cid:129) The
petitioner moved for bail before this Court in BLAPL No.1953 of 2019.

(cid:129) On 06.02.2020, this Court reduced the cash security to Rs.57,500/-, but the petitioner was still
unable to arrange funds and continued in custody.

Sukla paid Rs.8,00,000/- to the petitioner for purchase of a plot at Gopalpur, which the petitioner
failed to deliver. Despite repeated assurances, the petitioner did not return the money, leading to file
a complaint for which FIR has been registered against the petitioner for alleged commission of
offences under Sections 420/34 IPC r/w Section 6 of the OPID Act.
(cid:129) The petitioner filed a bail application being BLAPL No.1057 of 2019 before this Court.
(cid:129) This Court granted bail on 15.05.2019, subject to furnishing a cash security of (cid:130)5,00,000/-.
(cid:129) The petitioner filed I.A. No.64/2020 for modification of bail conditions.

(cid:129) On 12.02.2020, this Court reduced the cash security to (cid:130)2,00,000/-, but the petitioner was still
unable to arrange the amount and remained in custody.
In the above five cases the accused has been in custody for more than seven years and he has been
charged under various offences of the IPC and Section 6 of the OPID Act, 2011. For ready reference,
the provision of the penal Sections under which the accused is charged are reproduced below: -
420 of IPC: - Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property: -
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any
property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a

fine.
Section 468 of I.P.C Forgery for purpose of cheating:

Section 6 of The Odisha Protection Of Interests Of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act,
2011: - Notwithstanding anything contained in section 3, where any Financial Establishment

for the management of the affairs of the Financial Establishment shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and with fine which may extend to one lakh
rupees and such Financial Establishment is also liable for a fine which may extend to two lakh
rupees.
Of all the offences, petitioner has been charged for and he is facing trial, the maximum sentence
prescribed is ten years as has been reflecting from the provisions extracted herein above.
4. In the aforementioned five cases, the petitioner separately moved bail application for grant of
regular bail. Besides the ground on merits of the individual cases, petitioner precisely contended
that under statutory command of Section 436A of the Cr.P.C., he is entitled to be released on bail
having undergone more than 50% of the maximum sentence prescribed for the offences he has been
charged for and facing trial. The learned Trial Court rejected the application by separate order in all
the five cases. The ground for rejection of the bail application in all the five matters are similar and
for ready reference operative part of the impugned order passed in one of the aforementioned cases,
namely, in CRLMC No.2224 of 2024 is reproduced below:
"Perused the case record and rival submissions of the learned counsel for
accused-petitioner as well as the learned Spl.PP for the State. It is found from the
record that accusation against Basudev Behera in the alleged prosecution case relates
to offence punishable u/s 420 IPC r/w Sec.6 of the OPID Act, 2011. Perused the
operative portion of order No.05 dtd. 15.05.2019 passed by the Hon'ble High Court of
Orissa in BLAPL No.1057 of 2019 which is read as follows XXX XXX XXX
"Considering the submissions and the circumstances, it is directed that let the
petitioner be released on bail by furnishing cash security of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees
five lakhs) besides other conditions to be imposed by the learned trail court as
deemed proper."
XXX XXX XXX Further on perusal of order No.06 dtd.20.02.2019, of the Hon'ble
High Court of Orissa passed in IA No.55 of 2019 arising out of BLAPL No.1057 of
2019, it is found that Hon'ble High Court of Orissa in the above order have modified
the amount of cash security to be furnished by accused-petitioner. The accused-
petitioner has already been granted to release on bail but due to non-furnishing of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123221017/ 5
Basudev Behera vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 13 February, 2025
cash security as imposed by the Hon'ble High Court of Orissa vide order dtd.
15.05.2019 in BLAPL No.1057 of 2019, the accused-petitioner is still in jail custody.
As the accused- petitioner has already been granted bail by the Hon'ble High Court of
Orissa, therefore the present bail petition moved by the learned counsel for
accused-petitioner u/s 436A Cr.P.C is not maintainable in the eye of law. Hence, the
bail petition stands rejected."
Petitioner is aggrieved by such rejections and hence challenged the same by filing five different
cases.
5. Mr. Mohanty, learned Counsel for the petitioner, submitted that, petitioner had empathetically
relied upon Section 436A before the learned Presiding Officer, Designated Court under OPID Act,
Cuttack, while pressing for regular bail with a prayer to release him on the ground that he has
already undergone detention for the period of more than one- half of the maximum period of
sentence prescribed for the offences charged against him. He emphasized the provision of Section
436A of Cr.P.C. which reads as under:
―Section 436A of Cr.P.C - Maximum period for which an under-trial prisoner can be
detained: -
Where a person has, during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial under this
Code of an offence under any law (not being an offence for which the punishment of
death has been specified as one of the punishments under that law) undergone
detention for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of
imprisonment specified for that offence under that law, he shall be released by the
Court on his personal bond with or without sureties;
Provided that the Court may, after hearing the Public Prosecutor and for reasons to
be recorded by it in writing, order the continued detention of such person for a period
longer than one-half of the said period or release him on bail instead of the personal
bond with or without sureties;
Provided further that no such person shall in any case be detained during the period
of investigation inquiry or trial for more than the maximum period of imprisonment
provided for the said offence under that law."
The provision clearly limits the duration of detention for under-trial prisoners during
investigation, inquiry or trial of an offence not punishable by death to one half of the
maximum period specified for that offence under the relevant law. This provision
gives a statutory right to all the accused to be released after completion of more than
50% sentence prescribed for the offences they are charged for, except for the offences
for which punishment of death has been specified as one of the punishment. The
provision is more or less akin to Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C.

Basudev Behera vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 13 February, 2025
6. The learned counsel for the State while objecting to the prayer made by the petitioner, submitted
that the trial court has rightly rejected the bail application, because in the form of bail application,
the petitioner indeed has been seeking for the modification of conditions of bail imposed by this
Court. The learned trial court had no jurisdiction to modify any condition imposed by this Court
while admitting the petitioner on bail. Therefore, the petitioner needs to move separate application
in all the cases before this Court seeking variation of bail conditions. He further submitted that this
is not a case u/s.436A of Cr.P.C. In that view of the matter, the impugned order is justified and
interference is not called for.
7. In the conspectus of the above background, the petitioner beseeches this Court to consider the
application under Section 436A in the present case vis-à-vis his fundamental right enshrined under
Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Liberty of a citizen supersedes the procedural barriers created
under law. The Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation & Anr1 has held that Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, inserted by Act
25 of 2005, serves the vital objective of preventing excessive detention of undertrial prisoners. This
provision mandates that an under- trial, who has undergone detention for one-half of the maximum
prescribed sentence for the offence shall be released on personal bond, with or without sureties. The
use of expression "shall" in the provision signifies its mandatory nature, eliminating the necessity
for a formal bail application, particularly when delays are not attributable to the accused. The period
of incarceration includes custody during investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal and revision. The
Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court in the judgment has held thus: -
"46. Section 436A of the Code has been inserted by Act 25 of 2005. This provision has
got a laudable object behind it, particularly from the point of view of granting bail.
This provision draws the maximum period for which an undertrial prisoner can be
detained. This period has to be reckoned with the custody of the accused during the
investigation, inquiry and trial. We have already explained that the word „trial(cid:128) will
have to be given an expanded meaning particularly when an appeal or admission is
pending. Thus, in a case where an appeal is pending for a longer time, to bring it
under Section 436A, the period of incarceration in all forms will have to be reckoned,
and so also for the revision.
2022 LiveLaw (SC) 577
47. Under this provision, when a person has undergone detention for a period
extending to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that
offense, he shall be released by the court on his personal bond with or without
sureties. The word „shall(cid:128) clearly denotes the mandatory compliance of this
provision. We do feel that there is not even a need for a bail application in a case of
this nature particularly when the reasons for delay are not attributable against the
accused. We are also conscious of the fact that while taking a decision the public
prosecutor is to be heard, and the court, if it is of the view that there is a need for
continued detention longer than one-half of the said period, has to do so. However,
such an exercise of power is expected to be undertaken sparingly being an exception
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123221017/ 7
Basudev Behera vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 13 February, 2025
to the general rule. Once again, we have to reiterate that 'bail is the rule and jail is an
exception' coupled with the principle governing the presumption of innocence. We
have no doubt in our mind that this provision is a substantive one, facilitating liberty,
being the core intendment of Article 21. The only caveat as furnished under the
Explanation being the delay in the proceeding caused on account of the accused to be
excluded..."
In Vijay Madanlal Choudhary & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.2, the Hon(cid:128)ble Apex Court echoed the
same view that Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is a beneficial provision
aimed at upholding the right to a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution. It establishes the
outer limit for detention of undertrial prisoners, beyond which they should not be held unless
specific reasons are recorded in writing by the court. However, the relief under this Section is not
automatic and must be granted on a case-to- case basis, unlike default bail under Section 167 Cr.P.C.
The Court has [2022] 6 S.C.R. 382 discretion to extend detention beyond one-half of the maximum
sentence prescribed for the offence, subject to conditions ensuring the accused's availability for trial.
It is further held that the State has a duty to ensure that trials, particularly in cases with stringent
bail conditions are concluded expeditiously, preventing prolonged incarceration without trial. While
this provision does not apply to offences punishable with the death penalty, it functions as a
statutory bail provision, akin to Section 167 Cr.P.C. The Hon(cid:128)ble Apex Court held as under:
"147. Section 436A of the 1973 Code, is a wholesome beneficial provision, which is for
effectuating the right of speedy trial guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution and
which merely specifies the outer limits within which the trial is expected to be
concluded, failing which, the accused ought not to be detained further. Indeed,
Section 436A of the 1973 Code also contemplates that the relief under this provision
cannot be granted mechanically. It is still within the discretion of the Court, unlike
the default bail under Section 167 of the 1973 Code. Under Section 436A of the 1973
Code, however, the Court is required to consider the relief on case-to-case basis. As
the proviso therein itself recognises that, in a given case, the detention can be
continued by the Court even longer than one-half of the period, for which, reasons
are to be recorded by it in writing and also by imposing such terms and conditions so
as to ensure that after release, the accused makes himself/herself available for
expeditious completion of the trial.
148. However, that does not mean that the principle enunciated by this Court in
Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee Representing Undertrial Prisoners, to
ameliorate the agony and pain of persons kept in jail for unreasonably long time,
even without trial, can be whittled down on such specious plea of the State. If the
Parliament/Legislature provides for stringent provision of no bail, unless the
stringent conditions are fulfilled, it is the bounden duty of the State to ensure that
such trials get precedence and are concluded within a reasonable time, at least before
the accused undergoes detention for a period extending up to one-half of the
maximum period of imprisonment specified for the concerned offence by law. [Be it
noted, this provision (Section 436A of the 1973 662 Supra at Footnote No.658 Code)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123221017/ 8
Basudev Behera vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 13 February, 2025
is not available to accused who is facing trial for offences punishable with death
sentence].
149. In our opinion, therefore, Section 436A needs to be construed as a statutory bail
provision and akin to Section 167 of the 1973 Code. Notably, learned Solicitor General
has fairly accepted during the arguments and also restated in the written notes that
the mandate of Section 167 of the 1973 Code would apply with full force even to cases
falling under Section 3 of the 2002 Act, regarding money- laundering offences. On
the same logic, we must hold that Section 436A of the 1973 Code could be invoked by
accused arrested for offence punishable under the 2002 Act, being a statutory bail."
In the judgement of Bhim Singh Vs Union of India (UOI)3 the Hon(cid:128)ble Apex Court also expressed
similar view, and held thus: -
"5. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the legislative policy engrafted in
Section 436A and large number of under-trial prisoners housed in the prisons, we are
of the considered view that some order deserves to be passed by us so that the
under-trial prisoners do not continue to be detained in prison beyond the maximum
period provided Under Section 436A.
6. We, accordingly, direct that jurisdictional Magistrate/Chief Judicial
Magistrate/Sessions Judge shall hold one sitting in a week in each jail/prison for two
months commencing from 1st October, 2014 for the purposes of effective
implementation of 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In its sittings in jail, the
above judicial officers shall identify the under-trial prisoners who have completed
half period of the maximum period or maximum period of imprisonment provided
for the said offence under the law and after complying with (2015) 13 SCC 605 the
procedure prescribed Under Section 436A pass an appropriate order in jail itself for
release of such under-trial prisoners who fulfil the requirement of Section 436A for
their release immediately. Such jurisdictional Magistrate/Chief Judicial
Magistrate/Sessions Judge shall submit the report of each of such sitting to the
Registrar General of the High Court and at the end of two months, the Registrar
General of each High Court shall submit the report to the Secretary General of this
Court without any delay."
This Court also deems fit and proper to refer to the judgement of Hon(cid:128)ble Bombay High Court in
the case of Rakesh Mukesh Shah Vs State of Maharashtra4, where it has been held thus:
"5. It is a matter of record that the applicant has been in custody for 3½ years. The
offence punishable under Section 420 Indian Penal Code contemplates
imprisonment upto seven years. Hence, it is clear that the applicant has served more
than half of the sentences."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123221017/ 9
Basudev Behera vs State Of Odisha ....... Opposite Party on 13 February, 2025
"7. It is made clear that this Court has not gone into the merits of the matter and the
applicant is being enlarged on bail only under the provisions of Section 436-A of
Cr.P.C."
8. In light of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of the considered view that Section 436A of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 being a statutory provision akin to the provisions of default bail
provided under Section 167 of Cr.P.C, aims to safeguard the interests of under-trial accused in
custody from the prolonged incarceration. In the present case, it is evident that the accused has
2018 SCC OnLine BOM 17551 been in custody for a prolonged period exceeding seven years and has
not been released on bail due to the inability to fulfil the bail conditions. It is apparent from the face
of records that the accused- petitioner has been in custody for a duration that surpasses half of the
maximum sentence prescribed under the charged sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and
Section 6 of the Odisha Protection of Interests of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 2011.
Continuing to detain the accused as an undertrial for such an extended period not only contravenes
the statutory rights under Section 436A but also infringes the constitutional principles embodied in
Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which along with personal liberty also includes the right to a
speedy trial as an integral part of the right to life. This Court is also alive to the fact that procedurally
the petitioner ought to have moved for modification of the bail condition that has been imposed by
this Court while admitting him to bail. Inability to comply such bail condition despite repeated
reduction of cash security amount by this Court on the application of the petitioner, itself speaks of
the onerous nature of the bail condition. Condition of bail being a procedural facet of the matter,
should not be allowed to prevail upon fundamental right to life and liberty of an accused. Therefore,
while reaffirming the constitutional and statutory rights of the petitioner and by giving a go bye to
the procedural entanglement, I prefer to allow these petitions.
9. On the conspectus of the above discussion on law and fact, this Court allow all the five petitions
and direct the court below to release the petitioner on bail, subject to any condition as deemed fit
and proper. It(cid:128)s made clear that this Court has not expressed any view on the merits of the case. In
the event the petitioner is found misusing the concession granted to him by this judgment, in any
manner whatsoever, on the application of the prosecution, the liberty granted to the petitioner shall
be withdrawn by the trial court by giving reasons.
10. Consequently, all the five CRLMCs filed by the petitioner are hereby disposed of.
