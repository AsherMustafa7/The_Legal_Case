ground has been made after a lapse of fourteen years whereas
the prescribe time limit for filing the application is five years.
The petitioner further prays to direct the respondents to appoint
the petitioner on compassionate ground.
2. The brief facts of the case, according to the petitioner, is
that the father of the petitioner died in harness on 3.6.2003,
whereafter the mother of the petitioner had applied for
appointment on compassionate ground in the prescribed format
on 4.9.2004, however, her case was kept pending by the
authorities for more than six years and ultimately, her claim was
rejected in the year 2010 vide letter dated 25.3.2010 issued by
the Deputy Collector (Establishment), Darbhanga on the ground
of her being overage. Subsequently, the mother of the petitioner
appears to have applied for appointment of her elder daughter
i.e. the petitioner herein, on compassionate ground in the year
2010 itself, however, the claim of the petitioner has been
rejected in the year 2018.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that
the case of the petitioner should not be barred on account of the
laches of the respondents, who sat over the case of the mother of
the petitioner as well as the petitioner herein for appointment on
compassionate ground. The petitioner has relied upon various

Lakshmi Kumari vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 May, 2019
judgments, which are being discussed hereinbelow:-
(i) 2018 (2) PLJR 785 (Sanjay Kumar vs.
The State of Bihar & Ors.)- In the said case, it
has been held that since the date of birth of the
deceased employee was in dispute, the petitioner
of that case could have made an application for
appointment on compassionate ground only after
correction of the same inasmuch as only then his
entitlement arose, hence, the Hon'ble Court
directed that the bar of five years in making an
application for appointment on compassionate
ground would not arise in the said case since the
date of birth of the father of the said writ
petitioner was only corrected / rectified on
19.1.2013
, entitling the said writ petitioner to apply for appointment on compassionate ground, hence his
application dated 9.2.2013 would not be time barred.
(ii) 2018 (3) PLJR 829 (Baban Rai vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.)- In the said case, delay was caused
by the respondent authorities in considering the case for appointment on Patna High Court CWJC
No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 compassionate ground and the writ petitioner of the said case had
filed the application for appointment on compassionate ground within one year of death of his
father, hence, this Court held that consideration of the case of the petitioner after a lapse of about
four years, during which period, the petitioner had become overage, would not prejudice the said
writ petitioner. It was further held that for the delay caused by the respondent authorities, the said
writ petitioner cannot be made to suffer.
(iii) 2015(3) PLJR SC 197 (Canara Bank & Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar Santha & Anr.)- In the said
judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court, it has been stressed that in all claims of appointment
on compassionate grounds, there should not be any delay in appointment since the purpose of
providing appointment on compassionate ground is to mitigate the hardship due to death of the
bread-earner in the family. Moreover, the said judgment relates to the issue of applicability of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151506783/ 3
Lakshmi Kumari vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 May, 2019
particular scheme i.e. as to Patna High Court CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 whether the
scheme of existing on the date of death of the deceased employee would be applicable or the one in
vogue at the time of consideration of the claim of the incumbent would be applicable for the
purposes of considering the claim.
(iv) 1997 (1) PLJR 626 (Chandra Bhushan Singh vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.)- In the said case, this
Court has held that in case, the authorities considering the application for appointment on
compassionate ground made an inordinate delay and the delay is on account of circumstances
beyond the control of the petitioner, the right of the incumbent cannot be defeated on the ground of
delay caused by the authorities themselves.
This Court finds that the said proposition of law is not under dispute and this Court would apply the
ratio of the case upon arriving at a definite conclusion at the end of this judgment.
(v) 1991 (1) PLJR SC 1 :: (1989) 4 SCC 468 (Smt. Sushma Gosain & Others vs. Union of Patna High
Court CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 India & Others)- The ratio laid down by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the said judgment is to the effect that since the purpose of providing appointment on
compassionate ground is to mitigate the hardship on account of death of the bread-earner in the
family, such appointments should be made expeditiously without any delay.
This Court finds that the aforesaid judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court lays down a
general proposition of law and the course to be followed in claims of appointment on compassionate
ground and this Court is well aware of the said principle of law.
4. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent-State has submitted that the claim for
appointment on compassionate ground has been made by the petitioner after a lapse of about
fourteen years, hence, there is no question of appointment of the petitioner on compassionate
ground. It is further submitted that there has been no laches on the part of the respondent State
authorities.
5. The facts, which are not in dispute in the present case, is that the father of the petitioner died in
harness on 3.6.2003, Patna High Court CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 whereafter her
mother had applied on 4.9.2004 for grant of appointment on compassionate ground and at that
time, she was 39 years of age, approximately, inasmuch as her date of birth, as disclosed in her
petition at Annexure-2 to the writ petition is 2.4.1965. It appears that the authorities kept sitting
over the case of the mother of the petitioner for appointment on compassionate ground and
ultimately, rejected her case in the year 2010 vide letter dated 25.3.2010 on the ground that the
petitioner has crossed the maximum age of 40 years, as prescribed for appointment. It is then that
the mother of the petitioner thought it proper to apply for appointment of the petitioner herein on
compassionate ground and an application to the said effect was made on 5.6.2010, a date on which
the petitioner herein was 18 years old, her date of birth, as per the educational certificates enclosed
with the writ petition, being 5.2.1992.

6. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the materials on record. This
Court finds that admittedly, the father of the petitioner had died on 3.6.2003 and the mother of the
petitioner had applied for appointment on compassionate ground on 4.9.2004, well within the
prescribed time limit, as also a date on which she was less than 40 years of Patna High Court CWJC
No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 age i.e. well within the prescribed age for the purposes of grant of
appointment, however, the respondent authorities had kept the case of the mother of the petitioner
pending and only after she had become overage, had rejected the case of the mother of the petitioner
on the pretext that she was overage and that too in the year 2010, however, immediately, in the year
2010 itself i.e. by an application dated 5.6.2010, the mother of the petitioner had applied for grant of
appointment on compassionate ground to her eldest daughter i.e. the petitioner herein, at a time
when occasion had arisen for the first time for filing an application for appointment on
compassionate ground on behalf of the petitioner herein, since prior to the year 2010, the mother of
the petitioner was not knowing that her case would be rejected by the respondent authorities. In any
view of the matter, on the date of filing of an application at the behest of the petitioner for
appointment on compassionate ground, the petitioner was admittedly major having attained 18
years of age approximately, hence, there was no impediment as far as the consideration of the case
of the petitioner is concerned. The Respondent authorities have rejected the case of the petitioner
for appointment on compassionate ground vide impugned order dated 26.11.2018, after keeping the
application for appointment Patna High Court CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 of the
petitioner on compassionate ground pending for a period of more than eight years, on the ground
that the case of the petitioner for appointment on compassionate ground is time barred inasmuch as
the application has been filed after fourteen years.
7. This Court is of the view that the impugned order dated 26.11.2018 suffers from various fallacies,
the same being enumerated hereinafter. Firstly, the application was not filed after fourteen years
since the first application, by the mother of the petitioner, was filed within fifteen months of the
death of the father of the petitioner and only when the said application of the mother of the
petitioner was rejected in the year 2010, the mother of the petitioner had immediately, in the year
2010 itself, preferred an application for appointment of her eldest daughter i.e. the petitioner herein
for appointment on compassionate ground. Thus, it is wrong to say that there was delay in filing of
application, whereas the facts are otherwise and shows that there has been no delay on the part of
the petitioner. At best, the application, at the behest of the petitioner herein, can be said to have
been filed after seven years of death of the father of the petitioner, though this Court is of the view
that only after the case of the mother of the petitioner was rejected, occasion had Patna High Court
CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 arisen for filing such application at the behest of the
petitioner herein which was filed immediately, hence, there does not appear to be any delay on the
part of the petitioner / her mother, rather the delay is solely attributable to the respondent
authorities.
8. The next issue which arises for consideration is that in case, the respondent authorities had
promptly considered the application of the mother of the petitioner for appointment on
compassionate ground in the year 2004 itself or for that matter in the year 2005, the mother of the
petitioner would have been eligible for appointment and would not have become overage, hence
such an adverse situation has arisen only on account of apathy and laches on the part of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151506783/ 5
Lakshmi Kumari vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 May, 2019
respondent authorities for which no explanation has been given in the counter affidavit.
9. It is a well settled law that the purpose of providing appointment on compassionate ground is to
mitigate the hardship on account of death of the bread-earner in the family, hence, there should not
be any delay for appointment and it is improper to keep such cases pending for years. In fact, the
Hon'ble Apex Court has gone to the extent of holding that in case, no suitable post for appointment
is available, supernumerary post should be created to accommodate such Patna High Court CWJC
No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 candidates.
10. It is equally a well settled law that any delay on account of circumstances beyond the control of
the incumbent cannot defeat his / her right for appointment on compassionate ground on the
ground of delay caused by the authorities themselves.
11. At this juncture, it would be useful to refer to the celebrated judgment rendered by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of Umesh Kumar Nagpal vs. State of Harayana & Other, reported in (1994) 4
SCC 138, paragraph no. 2 whereof is reproduced hereinbelow:-
2. The question relates to the considerations which should guide while giving
appointment in public services on compassionate ground. It appears that there has
been a good deal of obfuscation on the issue. As a rule, appointments in the public
services should be made strictly on the basis of open invitation of applications and
met-it. No other mode of appointment nor any other consideration is Neither the
Governments nor the public authorities are at liberty to follow any other procedure or
relax the qualifications laid down by the rules for the post. However, to this general
rule which is to be followed strictly in every case, there are some exceptions carved
out in the interests of justice and to meet certain contingencies. One such exception is
in favour of the dependants of an employee dying in harness and leaving his family in
penury and without any means of livelihood. In such cases, out of pure humanitarian
consideration taking into consideration the fact that unless some source of livelihood
is provided, the family would not be able to make both ends meet, a Patna High Court
CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 provision is made in the rules to provide
gainful employment to one of the dependants of the deceased who may be eligible for
such employment. The whole object of granting compassionate employment is thus
to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis. The object is not to give a member
of such family a post much less a post for post held by the deceased. What is further,
mere death of an employee in harness does not entitle his family to such source of
livelihood. The Government or the public authority concerned has to examine the
financial condition of the family of the deceased, and it is only if it is satisfied, that
but for the provision of employment, the family will not be able to meet the crisis that
a job is to be offered to the eligible member of the family. The posts in Classes III and
IV are the lowest posts in non-manual and manual categories and hence they alone
can be offered on compassionate grounds, the object being to relieve the family, of
the financial destitution and to help it get over the emergency. The provision of
employment in such lowest posts by making an exception to the rule is justifiable and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151506783/ 6
Lakshmi Kumari vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 May, 2019
valid since it is not discriminatory. The favourable treatment given to such dependent
of the deceased employee in such posts has a rational nexus with the object sought to
be achieved, viz., relief against destitution. No other posts are expected or required to
be given by the public authorities for the purpose.
It must be remembered in this connection that as against the destitute family of the deceased there
are millions of other families which are equally, if not more destitute. The exception to the rule
made in favour of the family of the deceased employee is in consideration of the services rendered
by him and the legitimate expectations, and the Change in the status and affairs, of the family
engendered by the erstwhile employment which are suddenly upturned.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019
12. In the present case, admittedly, the family of the deceased does not appear to be having a good
financial condition and moreover, the deceased has left behind not only his widow i.e. the mother of
the petitioner herein, but also three daughters, out of which the petitioner herein is the eldest and
the mother of the petitioner has been left to fend, not only for herself, but also for the petitioner
herein and her two sisters.
13. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, as also considering the law discussed
hereinabove, I find that the entire family of the deceased has been traumatized beyond a limit, on
account of laches, delay and inaction on the part of the respondent authorities, as discussed
hereinabove, hence, the case of the petitioner is required to be considered immediately for
appointment on compassionate ground, if there is no impediment otherwise. It is directed,
accordingly.
14. The necessary steps in the aforesaid direction, be taken within a period of six weeks from the
date of receipt / production of a copy of this order, by the Respondent No. 4 i.e. District Magistrate,
Darbhanga.
15. The writ petition stands allowed and the order dated 26.11.2018 passed by the District
Programme Officer (Establishment), Darbhanga, as contained in letter no. 3633 Patna High Court
CWJC No.4725 of 2019 dt.07-05-2019 stands quashed.
