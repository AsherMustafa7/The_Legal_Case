JUDGMENT
This appeal under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act for
short) has been preferred by the assessee. The subject matter of the appeal pertains to Assessment
year 2003-04. The appeal was admitted by a bench of this Court vide order dated 29.06.2011 on the
following substantial question of law:
(i) Whether the order passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal confirming he
order passed by the appellate authority and the assessing officer that the appellant is
not entitled to exemption under Section 54 as he has purchased more than one house
is perverse, arbitrary and contrary to law laid down by the division bench of this court
in ITA No.783/2008 dated 27.08.2010?
2. The issue, which arises for consideration in this appeal is whether the assessee is entitled to claim
exemption under Section 54 of the Act as he had purchased more than two houses. In order to
appreciate the factual background, in which the aforesaid issue arises for consideration, reference to
relevant facts is necessary, which are stated herein after:
3. The assessee was the owner of a residential property situate at Harrington Road Chetpet,
Chennai. The said property was sold vide registered sale deed dated 09.10.2002 for a consideration
of Rs.2,68,89,375/-. The assessee filed return of income on 09.07.2003 for Assessment year
2003-04 declaring income of Rs.1,68,52,920/-, under the head income from salary, house property,
capital gains and income from other sources and paid tax of Rs.49,57,706/-. The assessing officer
issued a notice under Section 148 of the Act calling upon the assessee to file the return of income
disclosing true particulars of income chargeable to tax. The assessee vide communication dated
31.03.2008 submitted that original return of income be treated as return of income for proceeding

Arun K Thiagarajan vs Commissioner Of Income Tax on 18 June, 2020
under Section 148 of the Act. The assessee also sought for the reasons recorded for issue of notice,
which were provided to him on 12.08.2008.
4. The assessee declared long term capital gain arising out of the sale of the above property of
Rs.15,44,009/- after claiming deduction towards incidental charges for transfer of property, the cost
of acquisition and the deduction admissible under Section 54 of the Act in respect of two properties
purchased in Bangalore viz., Koramangala and Domlur, II Stage, Bangalore, respectively on
23.09.2002 and 23.10.2002. The assessing officer by an order dated 24.12.2008 inter alia held that
fair market value for the proposes of assessment is to be adopted on the basis of guidance value as
prescribed by stamp valuation authorities. It was further held that the guidance value of the
property sold was Rs.4,62,56,000/- and the aforesaid value was adopted subject to valuation report.
It was further held that assessee's claim for deduction under Section 54 of the Act in respect of
investments made in acquiring two residential properties is not admissible in view of the decision of
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal' for short) dated
30.04.2008 in ITO VS. SMT.H.V.RAJLAKSHMI. Therefore, the assessee's claim for deduction
under Section 54 of the Act was restricted to acquiring one residential building and deduction was
allowed in respect of higher value of investment i.e., Rs.97,15,652/-, which was in respect of
property situate in Koramangala. Thus, it was held that assessee had deliberately furnished
inaccurate particulars in relation to sale consideration of the property sold disregarding the
guidance value as required under Section 50C of the Act and therefore, the assessee has rendered
himself liable for levy of penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act.
5. Being aggrieved, the assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals).
The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) by an order dated 15.03.2010 inter alia held that
Section 50C comes into play only when there is a valuation at a higher value for stamp valuation
purposes by the state authority then declared by the assessee concerned in the sale deed. It was
further held that the property was registered for a consideration of Rs.2,68,89,375/-, whereas, the
valuation adopted by the stamp valuation authority is Rs.4,06,56,735/-. Therefore, by placing
reliance on decision of the Lucknow Bench of the tribunal in 'JITENDRA MOHAN SAXENA VS.
ITO', (305 ITR (AT) 62), the assessing officer was directed to re-compute the value of the property at
Rs.4,06,56,735/-. It was further held that decision of this court in 'CIT VS. ANAND BASAPPA', 309
ITR 329 does not apply to the fact situation of the case as the assessee had made investment in
residential properties, which are situate in different places in Bangalore and therefore, the benefit of
exemption under Section 54 of the Act cannot be granted. In the result, the appeal was partly
allowed.
6. The assessee approached the tribunal by filing an appeal. The tribunal by an order dated
17.09.2010 inter alia by taking into account the sale instances in the vicinity during the relevant
period put forth by the assessee, subject property being a corner plot and the fact that District
Valuation Officer had fixed land rate at Rs.2,220/- per square feet without assigning any basis or
comparison / citing any sale instances in the vicinity for the relevant period, the value of the land
was fixed at Rs.1,869/- per square feet. Accordingly, the value of the property was determined at
Rs.2,71,03,329/- and the assessing officer was directed to re-compute the value of the property at
Rs.2,71,03,330/- instead of Rs.4,06,56,735/-. The tribunal agreed with the findings recorded by the

Arun K Thiagarajan vs Commissioner Of Income Tax on 18 June, 2020
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) insofar as it pertains to denial of benefit under Section 54 of
the Act. In the result, the appeal was partly allowed. In the aforesaid factual background, the
assesses have approached this court.
7. Learned Senior Counsel for the assessee has submitted that claim of the assessee in this appeal
relates to exemption under Section 54 of the Act in respect of investment made in two residential
properties. It is argued that there is no dispute with regard to computation of capital gains or factum
of investments in two properties. It is pointed out that Section 54(1) was amended by Finance Act,
2014 with effect from 01.04.2015, by the which the words 'constructed a residential house' were
substituted and the words 'constructed one residential house in India' was substituted. It is argued
that the expression 'a residential house' used in Section 54 of the Act refers to the nature of house
and the number of residential units to be purchased by the assessee and therefore, the assessee was
eligible for exemption. In this connection, reliance has been placed on Circular No.1/2015 issued by
Central Board of Direct Taxes dated 20.01.2015 and it is argued that the aforesaid amendment is
prospective in nature. It is also urged that several courts including a bench of this court has
interpreted the expression 'a residential house' and have held that the letter 'a' in the context, in
which it is used should not be construed as singular but the expression also permits use of plural. In
support of aforesaid submission, reliance has been placed on the following decisions in 'CIT VS. KG
RUKMINIAMMA', 331 ITR 211 (KARNATAKA), 'B.SRINIVAS VS. ITO', ITA NO.1134/2008, 'CIT
AND ANR. VS. LATE KHOOBCHAND M.MAKHIJA', ITA NO.496/2007 (KARNATAKA), 'CIT AND
ANR. VS. SMT.JYOTHI K MEHTA', ITA NO.194/2010 (KARNATAIKA), 'TILOKCHAND AND SONS
VS. ITO', 413 ITR 189 (MADRAS), 'CIT VS. GITA DUGGAL', 228 TAXMAN 62 (SC), 'CIT VS. GITA
DUGGAL', 357 ITR 153 (DELHI), ' CIT VS. D.ANAND BASAPPA', 309 ITR 329 (KARNATAKA), 'CIT
VS. VR KARPAGAM', 373 ITR 127 (MADRAS), 'CIT VS. SYED ALI ADIL', 352 ITR 418 (ANDHRA
PRADESH), 'G.CHINNADURAI VS. ITO', 74 TAXMANN.COM 227 (MADRAS).
8. On the other hand, learned counsel for the revenue submitted that the word used 'a residential
house' has to be interpreted in the facts and circumstances of the case. It is further submitted that
assessee in the facts of the case is not entitled to the benefit of Section 54(1) of the Act and the same
would amount to abuse of law. It is further submitted that an attempt is made by the assessee to
evade the tax. Learned counsel for the revenue has invited our attention to the decision relied by
learned Senior Counsel for the assessee in the case of K.G.RUKMINIAMMA supra and has pointed
out that on a site a residential premises existed, which was demolished and was given to a builder
under a Joint Development Agreement for putting up flats. In the aforesaid factual background, it
was held that all four flats are situate in a residential building and therefore, constitute 'a residential
house' for the purposes of Section 54 of the Act. Similarly, it is pointed out that in all the cases relied
upon by the assessee in the fact situation of the cases referred to by the counsel for assessee, it was
held that assessee is entitled to benefit to Section 54(1) of the Act. Therefore, the aforesaid decision
is of no assistance to the assessee.
9. By way of rejoinder, learned Senior Counsel for the assessee has submitted that there is no finding
by any of the authorities that assessee had engaged either in tax planning or tax evasion and in
various decisions, the expression 'a residential house' has been interpreted and the ratio laid down
in the aforesaid decision applies to the fact situation of the instant case.

10. We have considered the submissions made on both the sides and have perused the record. In
order to appreciate the rival submissions made at the bar, we deem it appropriate to reproduce
Section 54(1) of the Act, which read, prior to its amendment by Finance Act No.2/2014, as under:
54(1) Subject to the provisions of sub- Section (2), where, in the case of an assessee
being an individual or a Hindu undivided family, the capital gain arises from the
transfer of a long-term capital asset, being buildings or lands appurtenant thereto,
and being a residential house, the income of which is chargeable under the head
"Income from house property" (hereafter in this section referred to as the original
asset), and the assessee has within a period of one year before or two years after the
date on which the transfer took place purchased or has within a period of three years
after that date constructed, a residential house, then, instead of the capital gain being
charged to income-tax as income of the Previous year in which the transfer took
place, it shall be dealt with in accordance with the following provisions of this section.
11. From close scrutiny of the aforesaid provision, it is axiomatic that property sold is referred to as
original asset and the original asset is prescribed as buildings and lands appurtenant thereto and
being a residential house. The expression 'a residential house' therefore, includes building or lands
appurtenant thereto. It cannot be construed as one residential house.
12. A Bench of this court in case of SMT.KG RUKMINIAMMA supra dealt with the meaning of
expression 'a residential house' used in Section 54(1) of the Act while taking into account Section
13(2) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 held that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or
context, the words in singular shall include the plural and vice versa. It was further held that context
in which the expression 'a residential house' is used in Section 54 makes it evident that it is not the
intention of the legislature to convey the meaning that it refers to a single residential house. It was
also held that an asset newly acquired after sale of original asset can also be buildings or lands
appurtenant thereto, which also should be residential house, therefore, the letter 'a' in the context it
is used should not be construed as meaning singular, but the expression should be read in
consonance with other words viz., buildings and lands. Accordingly, the contention raised by the
revenue was rejected. Similar view was taken by a bench of this court in KHOOBCHAND M.
MAKHIJA supra, B.SRINIVAS supra and in the case of SMT.JYOTHI K MEHTA supra. The Madras
High Court while dealing with Section 54 of the Act as it stood prior to amendment by Finance Act
No.2/2014 in the case of TILOKCHAND AND SONS supra took the similar view and held that the
word 'a' would normally mean one but in some circumstances it may include within its ambit and
scope some plural numbers also. The Delhi High Court also took the similar view in case of GITA
DUGGAL supra.
13. It is well settled in law that an Amending Act may be purely clarificatory in nature intended to
clear a meaning of a provision of the principal Act, which was already implicit. [SEE: DECISION OF
THE SUPREME COURT IN 'CIT VS. NEW DELHI VS. RAMKRISHNA DAS' IN CIVIL APPEAL
NO.3211/2019 DECIDED ON 26.03.2019]. In view of aforesaid enunciation of law by different High
Courts including this court and with a view to give definite meaning to the expression 'a residential
house', the provisions of Section 54(1) were amended with an object to restrict the plurality to mean
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109627497/ 5
Arun K Thiagarajan vs Commissioner Of Income Tax on 18 June, 2020
singularity by substituting the word 'a residential house' with the word 'one residential house'. The
aforesaid amendment came into force with effect from 01.04.2015. The relevant extracts of
Explanatory note to provisions of Finance Act No.2/2014 reads as under:
20.3 Certain courts had interpreted that the exemption is also available if investment
is made in more than one residential house. The benefit was intended for investment
in one residential house within India. Accordingly, sub-Section (1) of Section 54 of
the Income-Tax Act has been amended to provide that the rollover relief under the
said Section is available if the investment is made in one residential house situated in
India.
20.5 Applicability:- These amendments take effect from 1st April, 2015 and will
accordingly apply in relation to Assessment year 2015-16 and subsequent Assessment
years.
Thus it is axiomatic that the aforesaid amendment was specifically applied only prospectively with
effect from Assessment year 2015-16.
14. The subsequent amendment of Section 54(1) also fortifies the fact that the legislature felt the
need of amending the provisions of the Act with a view to give a definite meaning to the expression
'a residential house', which was interpreted as plural by various courts by taking into account the
context in which the aforesaid expression was used. The subsequent amendment of the Act also
fortifies the view taken by this court as well as Madras High Court and Delhi High Court. It is trite
law that the principle underlying the decision would be binding as precedent in a case. In
HALSBURY LAWS OF ENGLAND, Volume 22, Para 1682, Page 796, the relevant extract reads as
under:
The enunciation of the reasons or principle on which a question before a court has
been decided is alone binding as a precedent. This underlying principle is often
termed the ratio decidendi, that is to say, the general reasons given for the decision or
the general grounds on which it is based, detached or abstracted from the specific
peculiarities of the particular case which gives rise to the decision.
[ALSO SEE: 'STATE OF HARYANA VS. RANBIR', (2006) 5 SCC 167 & 'GIRNAR
TRADERS VS. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA', (2007) 7 SCC 555].
15. This Court as well as Madras and Delhi High Court have interpreted the expression 'a residential
house' and have held that the aforesaid expression includes plural. The ratio of the decisions
rendered by coordinate bench of this court are binding on us and we respectively agree with the view
taken by this court while interpreting the expression 'a residential house'. Therefore, the contention
of the revenue that the assessee is not entitled to benefit of exemption under Section 54(1) of the Act
in the facts of the case does not deserve acceptance.

In view of preceding analysis, the substantial question of law framed by this court is answered in
favor of the assessee and against the revenue. In the result, the order passed by the assessing officer
and Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal insofar as it
deprives the assessee of the benefit of exemption under Section 54(1) of the Act are hereby quashed
and the assessee is held entitled to benefit of exemption under Section 54(1) of the Act. In the result,
the appeal is allowed.
