Jabalpur, Dated : 27-07-2021
Heard through Video Conferencing.
Shri Ankit Saxena, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Shri Akhilendra Singh, learned G.A. for the respondent/State.
This is first bail application filed by the petitioner under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.
Petitioner is in custody since 14.05.2021 in connection with Crime No.17/2021 registered at
P.S.-STF, District-Bhopal (M.P.) for the offence punishable under Sections 420 and 188 of IPC,
Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act and Section 3/7 of Essential Commodities Act.
A s per prosecution story, in short is that the present petitioner/accused has conspired connivance
with other co-accused who are selling and black marketing the Remdesivir injection which is a life
saving drug during the pandemic of COVID-19 and they had sold out the injection illegally of Rs.
25,000/-.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner/accused has been falsely implicated in the
case. Petitioner/accused neither committed any offence nor seized the remdesivir injection from the
possession of petitioner/accused. He did not sell out the said injection to any person.
Petitioner/accused is made as an accused only on the basis of memorandum of co-accused. He is in
custody since 14.05.2021. Charge sheet has been filed. It is time of Covid-19, due to which,
conclusion of trial will take time for its final disposal. There is no possibility of his absconding or
tampering with prosecution evidence. Petitioner/accused is breadwinner of his family, if he is kept
in custody for unlimited period, then future of his family will be spoiled. On these 2
MCRC-35228-2021 grounds, he prays for grant of bail to the petitioner/accused.
Per-contra, learned G.A. for the respondent/State opposes the bail application.
Considering the contentions of counsel for both the parties and the fact that petitioner/accused has
no previous criminal antecedent, he is aged about 24 years young boy, he is in custody since
