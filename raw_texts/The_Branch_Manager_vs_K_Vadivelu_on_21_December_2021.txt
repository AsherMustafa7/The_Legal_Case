JUDGMENT
This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal has been filed by the appellant/Insurance Company against the
judgment and decree dated 31.08.2012 made in M.A.C.T.O.P.No.368 of 2011 on the file of Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal, Principal Sub Court, Tindivanam.
2.The appellant is 2nd respondent/Insurance Company in M.A.C.T.O.P.No.368 of 2011 on the file of
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Principal Sub Court, Tindivanam. The 1st respondent filed the said
claim petition claiming a sum of Rs.13,00,000/- as compensation for the injuries sustained by him
in the accident that took place on 02.05.2011.
3.According to the 1st respondent, he was employed under the 2 nd respondent as driver. On the
date of accident i.e., on 02.05.2011 at about 9.30 a.m., during the course of his employment, while
the 1st respondent was driving the lorry belonging to the 2nd respondent, near Valacherry patti
junction road in Trichy to Madurai Main Road, he dashed on the back side of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the stationed lorry and caused the accident. In the accident, he
sustained grievous injuries all over the body. Therefore, the 1st respondent filed the above claim
petition claiming compensation against the 2nd respondent and appellant, owner and insurer of the
lorry respectively.
4.The 2nd respondent, owner of the lorry, remained exparte before the Tribunal.
5.The appellant/Insurance Company filed counter statement denying the averments made in the
claim petition and stated that there is a delay in lodging the complaint before the Police. The
accident has occurred only due to negligence on the part of the 1st respondent. In any event, he
contributed negligence to the accident. The 1st respondent did not possess valid driving license and
the insurance policy was not in force at the time of accident. Therefore, the appellant/Insurance
Company is not liable to pay any compensation to the 1st respondent. The appellant/Insurance
Company has also denied the age, avocation, income and injuries sustained by the 1st respondent. In
any event, the compensation claimed by the 1st respondent is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
excessive and prayed for dismissal of the claim petition.
6.Before the Tribunal, the 1st respondent examined himself as P.W.1 and Dr.Sekar was examined as
P.W.2 and marked seven documents as Exs.P1 to P7. The appellant/Insurance Company did not let
in any oral and documentary evidence.
7.The Tribunal considering the pleadings, oral and documentary evidence, held that the accident has
occurred due to negligence on the part of the 1st respondent and directed both the 2nd respondent,
owner of the lorry as well as the appellant/Insurance Company being insurer of the said lorry to pay
a sum of Rs.2,98,218/- as compensation to the 1st respondent.
8.Against the said award dated 31.08.2012 made in M.A.C.T.O.P.No.368 of 2011, the
appellant/Insurance Company has come out with the present appeal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147993752/ 2
The Branch Manager vs K.Vadivelu on 21 December, 2021
9.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant/Insurance Company
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis contended that the Tribunal erred in fastening liability on the
appellant holding that the 1st respondent had hit the stationed lorry parked due to the tyre burst.
The 1st respondent was the tort-feasor and therefore, the claim petition filed by him is not
maintainable and prayed for setting aside the award of the Tribunal.
10.Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the 1 st respondent contended that the 1st
respondent was working as a driver under the 2nd respondent and the accident has occurred, during
the course of his employment. The lorry belonging to the 2nd respondent was insured with the
appellant/Insurance Company at the time of accident and hence, the appellant is liable to pay
compensation. The Tribunal has rightly held that the 2nd respondent and appellant, owner and
insurer of the lorry are liable to pay compensation to the 1st respondent and prayed for dismissal of
the appeal.
11.The 2nd respondent remained exparte before the Tribunal and hence, notice to the 2nd
respondent is dispensed with.
12.Heard the learned counsel for the appellant/Insurance Company,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis who appeared before this Court physically as well as the learned
counsel appearing for the 1st respondent through Video-conferencing/Hybrid mode and perused the
entire materials available on record.
13.From the materials on record, it is seen that 1st respondent was driver of the lorry belonging to
the 2nd respondent. On the date of accident, i.e. on 02.05.2011, while the 1st respondent was driving
the said lorry, he dashed on the back side of the stationed lorry and caused the accident. In the
accident, he sustained injuries all over the body including fracture. He filed claim petition under
Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act claiming compensation for the injuries sustained by him
against the 2 nd respondent, who is his employer and appellant, insurer of lorry. The Tribunal
considering the evidence let in by the 1st respondent as P.W.1 and Ex.P1/F.I.R., held that accident
has occurred due to rash and negligent driving by the 1st respondent. From this finding of the
Tribunal, it is seen that 1st respondent is the tort-feasor. Now it is well settled that a tort-feasor is
not entitled to maintain claim petition even under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act. At the
same time, it is to be taken note that 1st respondent has claimed that he is the driver
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of the lorry working under 2nd respondent and while in the course
of his employment, the accident has occurred. The 2nd respondent as well as appellant did not deny
the said claim of 1st respondent. In view of the fact that 1st respondent being the employee of 2nd
respondent and accident has occurred during course of his employment, he is entitled to
compensation under Workmen's Compensation Act and both the 2nd respondent as well as
appellant are liable to pay compensation as per the provisions of Workmen's Compensation Act.
14.The issue whether an employee of the owner of the vehicle or in case of death, the legal heirs of
the deceased/employee can maintain the claim under the Motor Vehicles Act or only course
available in such situation is only to approach the authority under Workmen's Compensation Act,
came up for consideration before the Division Bench of this Court. This Court considering the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147993752/ 3
The Branch Manager vs K.Vadivelu on 21 December, 2021
provisions of Motor Vehicles Act and contract of injured held that a claim petition under Motor
Vehicles Act as well as Workmen's Compensation Act are maintainable. The claimants must choose
either one of the legal forums and they cannot maintain the same application under both the Acts.
The Division https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Bench of this Court, further held that even if the
claimants are not entitled to compensation under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, they are
entitled to compensation covered under the insurance policy, which is the contract between the
owner of the vehicle and insurer. In paragraph 6 of the judgment reported in 2002 (4) CTC 469 in
the Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. vs. Kaliya Pillai and 2 others, it is held as follows:
“6. .. .. However, the insurer's liability is to be determined not only with reference to
the provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act, but also with reference to the contract of
insurance which would extend to the liability of the insured under the Workmen's
Compensation Act. There is a specific finding by the Tribunal that the deceased
tractor driver died in the course of his employment. Further, it is not disputed that
there was a valid insurance on the date of the accident, and accordingly the insurer
was liable to the extent of liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act. In other
words, we hold that even though the insurance company was not liable under the
provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, it would be proper to assess the compensation
under the Workmen's Compensation Act and award the same in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis favour of the claimants. On this ground, instead of
directing the respondents/claimants to go before the Commissioner for Workmen's
Compensation Act, in order to shorten the litigation and also in the interest of justice,
we decided to dispose of the appeal by determining the appropriate compensation in
favour of the claimants.”
15.This judgment was followed by another Division Bench of this Court in the judgment reported in
2015 (2) TNMAC 362 (DB) in M.Anbalagan vs. K.M.Asalm Basha, in paragraph 6 to 12 it is held as
follows:
“6. Relying upon two decisions of the Supreme Court one in Oriental Insurance
Company Limited vs. Dyamavva and others, reported in 2013(1) TN MAC 161(SC)
and another in Ramachandra vs. Regional Manager (2013(2) TN MAC 304 (SC)), it is
contended by Mr.M.Swamikannu, the learned counsel for the appellant that the
choice of the forum cannot actually deprive the victim of compensation. Therefore,
the learned counsel contended that if a person is entitled to claim compensation in
terms of the Employees' Compensation Act, 1923, he cannot be deprived of
compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7. We have carefully considered the above submissions. But we are unable to sustain
the said argument in total.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147993752/ 4
The Branch Manager vs K.Vadivelu on 21 December, 2021
8. It is true that the victim is entitled to choose any one of the two fora, depending
upon the benefits that he may get before either of them. But in so far as the claim
under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is concerned, the claimant should establish that
he was entitled to approach the Court under Section 166 and that he was not himself
a tort-feasor. This question played a vital role in distinguishing the claim made under
the Motor Vehicles Act from the claim made under the Employees' Compensation
Act, 1923.
9. However, as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the second respondent,
this Court is empowered to award compensation as payable under the Employees'
Compensation Act, 1923. In Oriental Insurance Company Vs. Kaliya Pillai and
another, reported in 2003-1-L.W.113, a Division Bench of this Court held that the
aggrieved or interested person can make a claim for compensation either under the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Workmen's Compensation Act or under the Motor
Vehicles Act. The only bar is that the claim cannot be made under both the Acts.
10. The Division Bench pointed out that the insurer's liability is to be determined not
only with reference to the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, but also with
reference to the contract of insurance.
Therefore, the Division Bench held that the compensation as payable under the
Workmen's Compensation Act, could at least be awarded.
11. A similar view was taken by yet another Division Bench of this Court in the
Oriental Insurance Co., Ltd., vs. Krishnan and others, reported in 2003-2-
L.W.73. Therefore, even if the appellant is not entitled to make a claim, as a third party, under
Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, he can at least make a claim under the Employees'
Compensation Act, 1923.
12. Coming to the quantum of compensation that should be awarded, at least under the Employees
Compensation Act, 1923, it is seen from the pleadings and the evidence on record that the appellant
was aged https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 38 years on the date of the accident. Therefore, the
relevant factor under Schedule-IV to the Employees' Compensation Act, 1923, is 189.56.”
16.The ratio in the above two judgments is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case. The
1st respondent is entitled to compensation as per the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation
Act, 1923. The 1 st respondent is claiming that he was earning Rs.15,000/- per month at the time of
accident. Initially as per Workmen's Compensation Act, the maximum salary that can be taken into
account for awarding compensation is only Rs.4,000/- per month. Subsequently, as per
G.O.No.1047, Ministry of Labour and Employment Notification dated 31.05.2010, the limit is
enhanced to Rs.8,000/- per month. The accident has occurred on 02.05.2011, i.e., after the
amendment. Therefore, a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month is fixed as notional income of the 1 st
respondent. The 1st respondent was aged 35 years at the time of accident. As per Schedule IV of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147993752/ 5
The Branch Manager vs K.Vadivelu on 21 December, 2021
Employees Compensation Act, 1923, for 35 years, the relevant factor applicable is 197.06. In the
accident, the 1st respondent suffered fracture of both bones, underwent surgery and rod was
implanted. Due to the injuries, the 1st respondent finds it difficult to walk, climb staircase
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and squat and he is limbing. To prove the same, the 1 st
respondent marked the discharge summaries and medical bills as Exs.P3 to P6 respectively.
P.W.2/Doctor after examining the 1st respondent, assessed the disability of the 1st respondent as
53%. The appellant/Insurance Company has not let in any evidence to disprove the disability
certificate issued by P.W.2/Doctor and evidence of P.W.2/Doctor. As per Section 4(1) of the said
Act, the salary could be taken into account for calculating compensation and in case of permanent
total disability resulting from the injury, 60% of salary received by him has to be taken for
calculation. Hence, applying the factor mentioned in Schedule IV of the Employees Compensation
Act and taking into consideration 60% of the salary fixed by this Court, the amount awarded by the
Tribunal towards disability comes to Rs.5,01,320.64 (Rs.8,000/- X 197.06. X 60/100 X 53/100).
The Tribunal has granted only a sum of Rs.2,98,218/- as total compensation to the 1st respondent.
In view of the same, the award of the Tribunal is not interfered with.
17. In the result, this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed and the sum of Rs.2,98,218/- awarded
by the Tribunal as compensation to the 1st https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis respondent along with
interest and costs is confirmed. The 2nd respondent and appellant/Insurance Company are directed
to deposit the entire award amount along with interest and costs, less the amount already deposited,
if any, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. On such
deposit, the 1st respondent is permitted to withdraw the entire amount awarded by the Tribunal
along with interest and costs, less the amount if any, already withdrawn. Consequently, connected
Miscellaneous Petition is closed. No costs.
