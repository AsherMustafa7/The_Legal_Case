Order on Writ Petition
1. Heard Sri Arun Kumar Tiwari, learned counsel for the petitioners and Sri Om Anand, learned
standing counsel for the state-respondents.
2. Brief facts of the case are that petitioners' father Ram Akshaywar was chak holder no.592.
Original holding of the petitioners' father is mentioned in C.H. form No.23 Part-1 as plot nos. 1797
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82055950/ 2
Vanshidhar Tiwari And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru Secy F And R And Others on 1 May, 2025
and 2051/2, having 1/2 share. The father of respondent nos. 5 to 8 Nanku was chak holder no.306.
The Assistant Consolidation Officer has proposed single chak to petitioners' father on plot
no.2051M, area .221 hect. Private respondents are also the co-sharer of the petitioners. The
Consolidation Officer in chak objection, disturbed the petitioners' chak on 1.12.2006, taking out the
entire area of plot no.2051 and allotting them on plot no.1796 & 1797. Petitioners' father filed chak
appeal before the Settlement Officer of Consolidation under Section 21(2) of the U.P. Consolidation
of Holdings Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as the "U.P. C.H. Act") which was registered as Appeal
No.249. The Assistant Settlement Officer of Consolidation vide order dated 29.9.2007 allowed the
petitioners' appeal in part and adjusted both the petitioners and private respondents over plot
nos.2051/2, 1796 & 1797 according to their share in the aforementioned plots. Against the appellate
order dated 29.9.2007, both the parties filed revision under Section 48 of the U.P. C.H. Act. The
revision filed by the petitioners' father was registered as Revision No.3258/2008 and the revision
filed by the private respondents was registered as Revision No.1707/2008. The Deputy Director of
Consolidation vide order dated 18.2.2009 dismissed the revision filed by the petitioners and allowed
the revision in part filed by the private respondents. Hence, the instant writ petition for the
following reliefs:-
"(i) Issue a suitable writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari to quash the
order dated 18.2.2009, passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Jaunpur.
(ii) Issue a suitable writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus, commanding
the respondents to provide chaks in pursuance of the order dated 29.9.2007 passed
by the Settlement Officer of Consolidation, Jaunpur."
3. This Court entertained the matter on 15.4.2009 and directed the parties to maintain status quo
with respect to nature and possession of the plot in dispute.
4. At the time of admission of the writ petition, respondent no.5 was represented through counsel
Sri Sushil Kumar Dwivedi but no counter affidavit has been filed in the instant petition even after
expiry of more than 16 years. Steps were taken by the petitioners to serve the private respondents
even by way of publication but no counter affidavit has been filed in the petition.
5. Sri Deepak Dubey, Advocate has made statement before the Court that he has no instruction in
the matter and his name is wrongly printed in the cause list as counsel for the respondents.
6. Counsel for the petitioners submitted that petitioners and private respondents are co-sharer and
Settlement Officer of Consolidation has rightly adjusted both the parties according to their share in
both the original plots, as such, there was proper exercise of the appellate jurisdiction by the
Assistant Settlement Officer of Consolidation while deciding the chak appeal. He submitted that the
petitioners as well as private respondents have challenged the appellate order but the Deputy
Director of Consolidation has allowed the revision filed by the private respondents, taking out the
area of plot no.2051 which was allotted to petitioners according to their share in the plot by the
Assistant Settlement Officer of Consolidation. He submitted that the petitioners have prayed in
revision that the stage of Assistant Settlement Officer of Consolidation should be maintained but
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82055950/ 3
Vanshidhar Tiwari And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru Secy F And R And Others on 1 May, 2025
that prayer was refused in revision. He submitted that the impugned revisional order should be set
aside and the stage of Assistant Settlement Officer of Consolidation should be maintained.
7. On the other hand, learned standing counsel submitted that no interference is required against
the order passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation in the allotment of chak proceeding as
both the parties have been allotted chak on their original plots.
8. I have considered the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perused the
records.
9. There is no dispute about the fact that the petitioners and private respondents are co-tenure
holder of the plot in question.
10. In order to appreciate the controversy involved in the matter, perusal of the finding of fact
recorded by the Assistant Settlement Officer of Consolidation while deciding the chak appeal will be
relevant which is as under:-

11. The perusal of the finding of fact recorded by the Assistant Settlement Officer of Consolidation
demonstrates that there was proper exercise of the appellate jurisdiction by the Assistant Settlement
Officer of Consolidation, allotting chak to both the parties according to their share in both the
original plots.
12. The exercise of the appellate jurisdiction was according to the provisions contained under
Section 19 of the U.P. C.H. Act. The revisional court has illegally set aside the order of the appellate
court and disturbed the petitioners' chak, taking out the entire area of plot no.1051/2 from the chak
of the petitioners and allotting them on plot nos. 1796 and 1797 which is not proper exercise of
revisional jurisdiction.
13. It is also material to mention that no counter affidavit has been filed by the private respondents
for the last 16 years, as such, there is no other option but to decide the instant matter finally, on the
basis of the averment made in the writ petition.
14. The perusal of C.H. Form No.23, order of the Consolidation Officer, Assistant Settlement Officer
of Consolidation, Deputy Director of Consolidation fully demonstrates that the stage of Assistant
Settlement Officer of Consolidation should be maintained between the petitioners and the private
respondents.
15. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned revisional order dated
18.2.2009, passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Jaunpur/respondent no.2 is liable to be
set aside and the same is hereby set aside.
16. The writ petition stands allowed and the stage of the Assistant Settlement Officer of
Consolidation is hereby maintained.
17. No order as to costs.
