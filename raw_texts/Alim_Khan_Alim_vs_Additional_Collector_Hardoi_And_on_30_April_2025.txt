The petitioner has also challenged the order dated 21.10.2024 passed by the opposite party
No.1-Additional Collector, District-Hardoi in the Appeal No. 3061/2022, Computerized Case
No.D202210330003061 filed under Section 67(5) of the Code of 2006.
By the order dated 28.06.2022, the opposite party No.2 directed the revenue official to evict the
petitioner from Gata No.490/0.1340 Hect. (recorded as Naveen Parti) alleging that the petitioner is
encroacher of 0.1340 Hect. land of Gata No.490 and imposing fine of Rs. 10,800/-.
A challenge has been made to the impugned order(s) on the ground that the procedure, which ought
to have been followed by the opposite party No.4 at the time of passing of final order in the
proceedings instituted under Section 67(1) of the Code of 2006, was not followed. In continuation, it
is stated that the procedure, which should be followed, has been indicated by this Court in the
judgment dated 02.12.2022 passed in the bunch of petitions, leading of which, is Writ C No.6658 of
2022 (Rishipal Singh vs. State of U.P. & 3 Others) reported in 2022 SCC OnLine All 829. A reference
has been made to para 74 of the report of Rishipal Singh (Supra), which reads as under:-
"74. Thus, in my view, following guidelines be adopted as procedure to be applied to
proceedings under Sections 67,67A and 26 of the U.P. Revenue Code. It is all aimed
at ensuring transparency in the procedure, judiciousness in approach by the
authorities and to thwart every complaint made with ulterior and oblique motive to
dislodge a long settled possession and causing of unnecessary harassment to an
innocent villager:
(i) In case of complaint made on RC From 19, the official making it shall ensure that
proper survey is done in the light of observations made in this judgment; the land,
occupation of which has stood identified to be unauthorized is in exact measurement
and so also shown in the survey map prepared on scale, as per the Land Revenue
Survey Regulations, 1978; the exact assessment of damages on the basis of circle rate
with details of calculation made on that basis.
(ii) In a case of suo motu action, before issuing RC Form 20, the authority will ensure
that proper report upon RC Form 19 is submitted as per para (i) above on parameters
of subrule 1 Rule 67.
(iii) RC Form 20 must be accompanied by a copy of report and spot survey submitted
alongwith RC Form 19 to the person against whom proceedings have been instituted,
or even otherwise submitted in case of suo motu action vide para (ii) above.
(iv) Upon reply being filed to the notice, if authority finds that spot
survey/explanation report is not satisfactory, it may order for a fresh spot report to
be prepared in presence of the party aggrieved.
(v) In the event, objection includes a plea of statutory protection/ benefit under
Section 67-A, the authority should invite the objection from the Gaon Sabha, and will

decide the same alongwith the matter under Section 67, without requiring aggrieved
party to move separate application under Section 67-A.
(vi) If the report is admitted on record, may be in case no objection is filed, the
authority must ensure presence of the person preparing the report before it, to prove
the report by his statement, with a right to aggrieved party to cross question him.
(vii) The authority must endeavour to decide the case within time framed provided
under the relevant Act and the Rules and should desist from granting adjournment to
the parties in a routine manner.
(viii) In case of appeal under Section 67(5) of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006,
preferred/ filed within the time prescribed alongwith interim relief application, the
interim relief application as far as possible should be decided within two weeks' time
with prior notice to other side and where plea of settlement under Section 67-A has
been taken before Assistant Collector-1st Class, and damages to the tune of 25 %
at-least of the total damages are paid and an affidavit of undertaking is filed for not
raising any further construction upon the land in question, the authorities including
civil administration should avoid taking any coercive measure pursuant to the order
appealed against until the disposal of interim relief application. The Appellate
authority may also consider granting interim relief on the very first day of filing of
appeal with stay application if above conditions are fulfilled by the appellant.
(ix) The appellate authority should as far as possible decide the appeal within a
period of two months of its presentation."
He stated that this Court in the judgment passed in Writ- C No.9500 of 2022 (Sharda Industries
Thru. Partner Mayank vs. The Additional District Collector, District Unnao And 2 Others); also
observed that the report of Lekhpal should be proved and unproved report can not be relied upon.
It is also stated that a perusal of the impugned order(s) would show that without following the
procedure as indicated by this Court in the judgment, referred above, the opposite party No.2 passed
the order dated 28.06.2022, which was affirmed by the impugned order dated 21.10.2024. As such,
the interference of this Court is required in the matter.
Learned counsel for the side opposite could not dispute the principle settled by this Court while
dealing with the proceedings instituted under Section 67 of the Code of 2006.
Considered the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and the orders
particularly the order dated 28.06.2022 passed by the opposite party No.2 and the order dated
21.10.2024 passed by the opposite party No.1.
It is apparent from the impugned order dated 28.06.2022 that the procedure as indicated by this
Court in the judgment, referred above, was not followed while deciding the case instituted under

Alim Khan @ Alim vs Additional Collector, Hardoi And ... on 30 April, 2025
Section 67 of the Code of 2006 by opposite party No.2 affirmed by the opposite party No.1 vide
order dated 21.10.2024, who also failed to take note of the fact that while passing the order dated
28.06.2022 the opposite party No.2 has not followed the procedure prescribed. Thus, to the view of
this Court, the interference is required in the matter.
Accordingly, the petition is allowed. The order(s) dated 28.06.2022 and 21.10.2024 are set aside and
the matter is remanded back to opposite party No.2-Assistant Collector/Tehsildar, Tehsil-Bilgram,
District-Hardoi to conclude the proceedings afresh strictly in terms of law laid down by this Court in
the judgment, referred above, within a period of three months as statutory provisions says that the
proceedings under Section 67 of the Code of 2006 ought to have been concluded within a period of
90 days.
For concluding the proceedings, the opposite party No.2 shall not provide any adjournment to the
petitioner and in case, the petitioner fails to appear on the date fixed, then in that event, the
authority concerned is at liberty to proceed ex-parte, however, in the light of the law laid down by
this Court and conclude the proceedings within a period of three months.
