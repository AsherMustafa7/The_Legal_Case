COMMON JUDGMENT
SUBRAMONIUM PRASAD,J Writ Appeals challenge the judgment, dated 6/12/2019, passed in
W.P.Nos.32708 and 31964 of 2019.
2. Writ petitions are one of a mandamus for a direction to the Tamil Nadu Public Service
Commission to interview the petitioners for the posts included in the Combined Civil Services
Examination, Group
- II (Interview Posts) (Group - II Services), conducted pursuant to the Notification No.15/2018
dated 10/9/2018. http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019
3. Shorn of details, the facts leading to the writ appeals are as under:-
a. Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission, respondent herein invited applications
through on-line mode for direct recruitment to the posts included in the Combined
Civil Services Examination Group - II (Interview Posts) (Group - II Services).
b. The writ petitioners applied through the on-line mode. Notification permitted
persons in Government Services to participate in the selection. In the Notification,
there was a column which sought detail as to whether a candidate is a Government
employee or not. The other related windows automatically open depending upon the
answer. If the answer was "Yes", then certain related windows will open and if the
answer was no, then the other related windows will open. It is further pertinent to
mention here that the writ petitioners had sought for permission from the
Department to take part in the examination. The writ petitioners had given letters
seeking no objection certificate from the Department and they had received no
objection letters. http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 c. Petitioners had
against the column "Are you a Government employee" filled in "No" because of which
they were disqualified and were not allowed to participate in the interview on the
ground that they had suppressed information that they are Government employees.
d. Disqualification has been challenged by filing the writ petitions in W.P.Nos.32708
and 31964 of 2019.

P. Prabu vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 11 March, 2020
e. The learned Single Judge, placing reliance on a judgment of a Hon'ble Division
Bench of this Court in (i). Dr.M.Venilla Vs. Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission,
rep. by Deputy Secretary, Chennai and others {2006 (3) LLN - 437}; (ii). M. Sudha
Parameswari Vs. The Joint Secretary, Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission,
Chennai and another {W.P.(MD) No.22089 of 2016} and (iii). The State of Tamil
Nadu and Others Vs. G.Hemalatha and another (Civil Appeal No.6669 of 2019), held
that the instructions in the Notification have to be strictly complied with and this
Court, cannot in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India modify or relax the terms and conditions. He would further state that the said
judgments has held http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 that even if the
mistakes are unintentional, it has to be end up with the consequences that are
provided in the Notification/application form itself. Consequently, writ petitions
were dismissed. Challenging the said judgment, instant writ appeals are filed.
4. Heard Mr.N.G.R.Prasad, learned counsel for the appellants and Ms.C.Niraimathi, Standing
Counsel for the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission.
5. Mr.N.G.R.Prasad, learned counsel for the appellants would vehemently contend that the mistake
was purely unintentional. He would state that the applications were filled in on-line and there was
hardly any opportunity for them to verify the particulars. He would state that there are no special
seats reserved for Government employees and there is also no disadvantage for the Government
employee for taking part in the examination. He would state that no prejudice has been caused to
anybody by the answer given by the appellants. He would also argue that in any event, the
appellants had informed the http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 Government and sought
permission for taking part in the examinations and they had got no objection certificates. He would
therefore, state that in the present case, the writ petitioners need not be disqualified and therefore,
this Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, in the
interest of Justice, can direct the respondents to call the appellants for interview.
6. Mr.Prasad would place reliance on a judgment of Delhi High Court in ROHIT YADAV Vs.
CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION AND ORS (W.P.(C) No.4189 of 2012), dated
24/7/2012, wherein the age of the petitioner therein had wrongly been mentioned. Delhi High Court
held that for a bona fide mistake, an applicant cannot be penalized to the extent that the admission
granted to him is cancelled. High Court interpreted the clause in the application form which stated
that if the personal data submitted/entered by a candidate is found to be wrong at the time of
verification of certificates either during reporting or at any later stage, the allotment of
seat/provisional admission is liable to be cancelled to mean that the word liable should
http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 be interpreted as likely and therefore, a lenient view
can be taken in such cases. Delhi High Court went on further to state that there was no intention on
the part of the petitioner therein to mislead the respondent or give him unfair advantage. The
learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court found that the certificate from CBSE is a genuine
document and the petitioner cannot be debarred for filling in a column in the application form
wrongly. Mr.Prasad would state that the said judgment applies to the present case on all force.

P. Prabu vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 11 March, 2020
7. Mr.Prasad would also rely on a Division bench judgment of this Court in THE TAMIL NADU
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Vs. 1. INIYAVAN AND ANOTHER (W.A.(MD) No.1143 of 2019),
dated 5/11/2019, wherein again, there was a mistake in filling the Date of Birth. A Division Bench of
this Court came to a conclusion that since no advantage will accrue to the writ petitioner and in fact,
the incorrect Date of Birth is mentioned, it will lead to the disadvantage of the writ petitioner. The
candidature of the writ petitioner therein was not cancelled.
http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019
8. Mr.Prasad would also place reliance on another Division Bench of this Court in THE
SECRETARY, TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, CHENNAI Vs. A.
SUTHANTHIRAMOORTHY (W.A.No.3285 of 2019), dated 26/9/2019, wherein again this Court
while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, permitted correction
in the on-line Registration form for a mistake which had been committed inadvertently. This Court
also found that since no serious prejudice would be caused to the appellant, being the Public Service
Commission, if the mistake is permitted to be corrected, but on the other hand, the respondent in
the said writ petition would lose his chance of being appointed in a Government post. This Court felt
that in such a cases, power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can be exercised.
9. Mr.Prasad would also rely on two more judgment of this Court, in P. NETHAJI SUBASH
CHANDRA BOSE Vs. 1. TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, CHENNAI AND
http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 ANOTHER (W.P.Nos.20394 and 20474 of 2017),
dated 23/1/2018, wherein a learned Single Judge held that a holistic approach must be adopted in
such matters. In that case also, there was a mistake by the candidate while submitting his on-line
application, regarding as to whether they had faced any disciplinary action. The candidate has
written "No" inadvertently, but had obtained a no objection certificate, permitted him to take the
examination. The learned Single Judge observed that in no objection certificate, all the relevant
particulars had been mentioned and therefore, there was no suppression of fact. The learned Single
Judge further held that since the mistake was only inadvertent and there was no real consideration
of fact, the candidate need not be disqualified.
10. He would also contend that a similar view has also been taken by a learned Single Judge in
M.KAVIN KUMAR VS. 1. TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, CHENNAI AND
ANOTHER {W.P.(MD).Nos.22006 and 22055 of 2018}, dated 27/4/2019, wherein the learned
Single Judge held that mistakes which http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 are due to
inadvertence and which can be rectified, the candidates cannot be penalized by denying
employment.
11. On the other hand, Ms.CNG.Niraimathi, Standing counsel for Tamil Nadu Public Service
Commission, would rely on (i). Dr.M.Venilla Vs. Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission, rep. by
Deputy Secretary, Chennai and others {2006 (3) LLN - 437}; (ii). M. Sudha Parameswari Vs. The
Joint Secretary, Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission, Chennai and another {W.P.(MD)
No.22089 of 2016} and (iii). The State of Tamil Nadu and Others Vs. G.Hemalatha and another
(Civil Appeal No.6669 of 2019). She places heavy reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152876216/ 5
P. Prabu vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 11 March, 2020
Court in THE STATE OF TAMIL NADU & ORS Vs. G.HEMALATHAA & ANR (Civil Appeal No.6669
of 2019), dated 28/8/2019, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that conditions of
instructions is of paramount importance and the High Court in exercise of Article 226 of the
Constitution of India cannot modify/relax the instructions issued by the Commission. She would
contend that the instructions are mandatory in http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 nature
and therefore, the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court would cover the instant case also.
12. The appellants have filled in the application form through on-line mode. In the on-line form,
there is a specific column which states "Are you a Government Employee". After the said column,
there are four more column pertain to Government employee, which are as under:-
(i). Candidates not belonging to SCs, SC (A)s, STs, MBCs/DCs, BCs and BC(M)s who
have put in 5 or more years of service in State or Central Government are not eligible
even though they are within the age limit.
(ii). Persons serving in the Armed forces shall be eligible to apply for the posts under
the Government if they are due to complete the specified term of their engagement in
the Armed Forces within one year from the last date of the receipt of the application
of a particular recruitment and all such candidates should choose this Government
http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 employee field as 'No' and furnish their
service details in Ex-
servicemen field.
(iii). Are you a temporary or discharged State Government employee because of reduction in
establishment or for any other reason but not as disciplinary measure.
(iv). Have you been debarred or disqualified by the Public Service Commission or any other
recruiting agency from appearing for examinations and selections for a specific period or
permanently?
13. The candidates have against the column "Are you a Government Employee" have answered "No".
No doubt, they have also furnished the request seeking no objection certificate from the employer
and have also furnished no objection granted to them. It is also not disputed that they do not stand
to gain by giving a wrong particular. It also cannot be said that by giving such a wrong particulars,
they would cause prejudice either to the Commission or to any other candidate. It is also correct that
they will not derive any advantage by giving the wrong answer. Inspite of all these, the short
http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 issue is that can the Commission take a liberal view by
condoning this action, and consequently, whether the High Courts, while exercising discretion
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, can give a mandamus to the Commission to ignore
the mistake in on-line form.
14. Paragraph 19 of the Commission's instructions to the applicants which deals with
disqualification/debarment as which is given in para 7 of the counter affidavit filed before the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152876216/ 6
P. Prabu vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 11 March, 2020
learned Single Judge reads as under:-
The following acts will end in disqualification or debarment:
"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
(b) (ii) Suppression of material information regarding
(a) Previous appearances or availing free chances, employment in Government or
Local Bodies, Public Corporations, etc. And that the applicant responsible for such
act will be debarred from appearing for the examination and selection held by this
Commission permanently or for such period of year as the Commission may decide
and hence he was not allowed for Oral Test. Necessary action is being taken
separately for issuing show-cause notice to the candidate.
http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019
15. Similarly, in paragraph 13 (g) of the Commissioner's Notification No.15/2018 dated 10/8/2018,
read as under:-
"para 13 (g) if any of their claims is found to be incorrect, it will lead to rejection of
their candidature and suitable penal action including debarment."
16. Counter also states that the appellants have also given a following declaration in their
applications, which reads as under:-
"I hereby declare that all the particulars furnished in this application are true, correct
and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. In the event of any information
being found false or incorrect or ineligibility being detected before or after the
examination or at any stage, any action can be taken against me by the TNPSC
including rejection of my application.
I have gone through the instructions to the candidates and Commission's Notification
for this recruitment before filling up the application form."
17. The appellants/writ petitioners are not illiterate candidates. http://www.judis.nic.in and
W.A.No. of 2019 The consequences of the mistake even if inadvertent was known to them. No power
has been shown to us by which the Commission can relax any of the conditions or relax
consequences which will follow from giving a wrong information. No mistake can be found with the
Commission for rejecting the candidature of the appellants on the ground of furnishing wrong
information.
18. Mr.N.G.R.Prasad, learned counsel is correct in stating that most of the judgments of this Court
and Delhi High Court, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152876216/ 7
P. Prabu vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 11 March, 2020
have condoned inadvertent errors which do not cause any prejudice to the Commission or to other
candidates and which also does not give any unfair advantage to the applicant, but the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in THE STATE OF TAMIL NADU AND ORS Vs. G.HEMALATHAA & ANR (Civil
Appeal No.6669 of 2019) has observed as under:-
"7. We have given our anxious consideration to the http://www.judis.nic.in and
W.A.No. of 2019 submissions made by the learned Senior Counsel for the
Respondent. The Instructions issued by the Commission are mandatory, having the
force of law and they have to be strictly complied with. Strict adherence to the terms
and conditions of the Instructions is of paramount importance. The High Court in
exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot modify/relax the
Instructions issued by the Commission.
8. The High Court after summoning and perusing the answer sheet of the
Respondent was convinced that there was infraction of the Instructions. However,
the High Court granted the relief to the Respondent on a sympathetic consideration
on humanitarian ground. The judgments cited by the learned Senior Counsel for the
Respondent in Taherakhatoon (D) By LRs v. Salambin Mohammad2 and Chandra
Singh and Others v. State of Rajasthan and Another3 in support of her arguments
that we should not entertain this appeal in the absence of any substantial questions of
law are not applicable to the facts of this case.
9. In spite of the finding that there was no adherence to the Instructions, the High
Court granted the relief, ignoring the mandatory nature of the Instructions. It cannot
be said M. Vennila v. Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission, (2006) 3 Mad. LJ 376
(1999) 2 SCC 635 (2003) 6 SCC 545 that such exercise of discretion should be
affirmed by us, especially when such direction is http://www.judis.nic.in and
W.A.No. of 2019 in the teeth of the Instructions which are binding on the candidates
taking the examinations.
...........
12. After giving a thoughtful consideration, we are afraid that we cannot approve the
judgment of the High Court as any order in favour of the candidate who has violated
the mandatory Instructions would be laying down bad law. The other submission
made by Ms. Mohana that an order can be passed by us under Article 142 of the
Constitution which shall not be treated as a precedent also does not appeal to us."
(emphasis supplied)
19. A perusal of the said judgment would show that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that strict
adherence to the terms and conditions of the instructions is of paramount importance and the High
Court, in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India cannot modify/relax the
instructions issued by the Commission.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152876216/ 8
P. Prabu vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 11 March, 2020
20. We are bound by the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, under Article 141 of the
Constitution of India, which mandates that the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all
the Courts, http://www.judis.nic.in and W.A.No. of 2019 within the territory of India. We therefore,
have to accept the submission of the learned counsel appearing for Tamil Nadu Public Service
Commission that instructions are mandatory in nature and therefore, cannot be relaxed.
21. In view of the above, writ appeals are dismissed. No costs. Consequently, the connected
Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
