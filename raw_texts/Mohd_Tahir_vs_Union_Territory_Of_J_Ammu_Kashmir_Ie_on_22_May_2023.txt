JUDGMENT
. Respondent no.2, Divisional Commissioner Jammu (hereinafter called as 'Detaining Authority') in
exercise of powers under Section 3 of the Prevention of Ulicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substance Act 1988 r/w SRO 247 of 1998 dated 27.07.1988 has passed detention
Order No. PIT NDPS 35 of 2022 dated 18.11.2022 (for short 'the impugned order') in terms whereof
the petitioner/detenue has been detained.
. Aggrieved of the detention order, petitioner has questioned it's legality, proprietary and correctness
by the medium of instant petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and has sought it's
setting aside/quashment on the ground, that the perusal of grounds of detention shows that there is
a reference of FIR No. 193/2019 of Police Station Thannamandi u/s 8(A)/20/60 NDPS Act, FIR No.
05/2021 u/s 8/21/22 of NDPS Act of Police Station Surankote, FIR No. 62/2021 u/s 8(A)21/22/29

Mohd Tahir vs Union Territory Of J Ammu & Kashmir Ie ... on 22 May, 2023
making effective representation which constitute infraction of valuable right of the petitioner
guaranteed to him under Article 25(5) of the constitution of India r/w Section 13 of J&K PSA 1978
which makes the order of detention invalid and legally unsustainable.
. Respondent No. 2 (Divisional Commissioner Jammu), has filed counter, wherein passing of the
impugned detention order has been defended, and it has been specifically pleaded, that the
petitioner/detenue has been detained for his repeated and continuous involvement in the Illicit
Traffic of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances which poses serious threat to the health and
welfare of the people and has deleterious effect on the national economy, the detention order was
passed by him only after careful examination of the dossier, the relevant record made available by
SSP Rajouri and after following due procedure of law under the relevant provisions of the
Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1988. It is
contended, that the detention warrant was duly executed upon the petitioner/detenue and the copy
of the detention warrant, grounds of detention and other relevant record was read over and
explained to the petitioner/detenue in the language he understands and the above documents. were
handed over to the petitioner who was informed about his right to make representation to the
Government as well as to the detaining authority against the order of detention.
. Mr. Ajaz Chowdhary, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner/detenue, has sought the setting
aside of the impugned detention order by vehemently articulating arguments, that
petitioner/detenue has not been supplied the detention record/material viz; copies of dossier, copies
of FIRs, recovery memo, statements of witnesses recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C to enable him to
make effective representation against the impugned detention order, by not supplying the essential
material petitioner/detenue's right to make effective representation to the Government or detaining
authority has been violated/infringed under Article 22 (5) of the Constitution of India r/w Section 13
of the J&K Public Safety Act 1978 and such failure on part of the detaining authority to supply the
essential material vitiates whole of the detention order.
To support his arguments, learned counsel has relied upon the judgment of Homble Supreme Court
reported in, AIR 2000 SC 2504 [State of Maharashtra & Others--Appellants Versus Santosh
Shankar Achariya--Respondent].
. Mr. Bhanu Jasrotia, learned GA has vehemently supported the impugned detention order against
the petitioner and has sought its affirmation by projecting arguments, that the petitioner/detenue is
involved in as many as three FIRs and one complaint viz; FIR No. 193/2019 of Police Station
Thannamandi u/s 8(A)/20/60 NDPS Act, FIR No. 05/2021 u/s 8/21/22 of NDPS Act of Police
Station Surankote, FIR No. 62/2021 u/s 8(A)21/22/29 NDPS Act of P/S Thanamandi, complaint
u/s 107/110/151 Cr.PC dated 30-06-2019 of Police Station Thannamandi and confidential report of
DSB Rajouri dated 27.10.2022, wherein from his possession contraband charas/heroine has been
recovered on different dates of occurrences. It is argued, that petitioner/detenue is habitual criminal
involved in illicit trafficking leading to spread of drug addiction among the general public especially
the youth of the area, the criminal activities of the petitioner/detenue are prejudicial to the society at
large besides detrimental to the peace and tranquility and menace to the public order,
petitioner/detenue is engaged in sale and purchase of illicit traffic in narcotics drugs and

Mohd Tahir vs Union Territory Of J Ammu & Kashmir Ie ... on 22 May, 2023
psychotropic substances which poses a serious threat to the health and lives of the young
generation, petitioner/detenue has close nexus with the gang of criminals involved in illicit
trafficking of drugs in clandestine manner to earn huge and easy bucks and has spread the network
of drug peddling in the entire UT of J&K. It is moreso argued, that petitioner/detenue has no respect
for law and order and public tranquility causing serious threats prejudicial to the security of UT of
J&K, keeping in view the continuous and repeated involvement of the petitioner/detenue in the
narcotic trade, respondent No. 3 vide his endorsement No. PA/PSA/2022/10911-15/C dated
11.11.2022 recommended the detention of the petitioner/detenue to prevent him from indulging in
illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and in a view to prevent the
petitioner/detenue from further committing any illicit trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and to secure
the health and welfare of public at large, the petitioner/detenue has been rightly and correctly
detained under Section 3 of The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act 1988 r/w SRO 247 dated 27.07.1988. It is argued, that as per the detention record
the petitioner has been supplied all the essential detention record including the copies of detention
order (02 leaves), grounds of detention (03 leaves) and other related relevant documents [Total 05
leaves] through Executing Officer MAan Singh PSI EXJ-196565 of P/S Thannamandi, moreso, the
impugned detention order has been read over in English and explained to the petitioner/detenue in
Urdu/Pahari language understood by him fully and he has also been informed of his right to make
representation to the Government as well to the Detaining Authority if he desires, the order of
detention has been passed by respondent No. 2 on 18.11.2022 and the same has been executed upon
the petitioner without any delay.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the averments of the petition, counter affidavit
filed by the respondent No. 2, detention record made available by the respondents and the relevant
law on the subject matter coupled with the judgments relied upon by learned counsel for petitioner.
. The argument canvassed by Ld. Counsel for petitioner for quashment of detention order is, "that
the detenue/petitioner has not been supplied the copies of FIRs registered against him and.
statements of witnesses recorded under Section 161 CrP.C to enable him to make effective
representation against the impugned detention order, for non-supplying of such material,
petitioner's right to representation against his detention has been infringed/violated in terms of
Article 22 (5) of Constitution of India r/w Section 13 of Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act 1978,
vitiating the detention order."
In AIR 2000 SC 2504, (State of Maharashtra and Ors.-
Appellants Vs. Santosh Shankar Acharya- Respondent) relied upon by learned counsel for the
petitioner, Hon'ble Supreme Court while quashing the detention order by observing that detenue
was not supplied the copies of the material from which the detention order was made amounted to
denial of representation to him and infraction of his valuable constitutional right guaranteed to him
under Article 22(5) of Constitution of India, in para (8) held as under:-
8. If the contention of Mr. Deshpande to the effect that the moment an order of
detention issued by an order under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act is

Mohd Tahir vs Union Territory Of J Ammu & Kashmir Ie ... on 22 May, 2023
communicated to the State Government under sub-section (3) of the said Section
thereof the State Government becomes the detaining authority, and therefore, the
power under Section 21 of the Bombay General Clauses Act cannot be exercised by
the said detaiming authority is correct, then it has to be found out as to under which
contingency Section 14 of the Maharashtra Act would apply. To our query neither Mr.
Deshpande nor Mrs. Ramani, learned counsel appearing for the State Government
could indicate any situation when such power could be exercised. It is too well known
a principle of construction of statutes that the legislature engrafted every part of a
statute for a purpose and the legislative intention is that every part of the statute
should be given effect. The legislature is deemed not to waste its words or to say
anything in vain and a construction which attributes redundancy to the legislature
will not be accepted except for compelling reasons. We are cognizant of the principle
ex majori cautela but it is difficult for us to apply the said principle to Section 14 of
the Maharashtra Act and even hold the same to be tautologous in as much as it has
never been shown as to what was the necessity for the legislature to protect the power
under section 21 of the Bombay General Clauses Act, to an order of detention made
under the Maharashtra Act. The only logical and harmonious construction of the
provisions would be that in a case where an order of detention is issued by an officer
under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act, notwithstanding the fact that he is
required to forthwith report the factum of detention together with the grounds and
materials to the State Government and notwithstanding the fact that the Act itself
specifically provides for making a representation to the State Government under
Section 8(1), the said detaining authority continues to be the detaining authority until
the order of detention issued by him is approved by the State Government within a
period of 12 days from the date of issuance of detention order. Consequently, until
the said detention order is approved by the State Government the detaining authority
can entertain a representation from a detenu and in exercise of his power under the
provisions of Section 21 of Bombay General Clauses Act could amend, vary or rescind
the order, as is provided under Section 14 of the Maharashtra Act.
Such a construction of powers would give a full play to the provisions of Section 8 (1) as well as
Section 14 and also Section 3 of the Maharashtra Act. This being the position, non-communication
of the fact to the detenu that he could make a representation to the detaining authority so long as
the order of detention has not been approved by the State Government in a case where an order of
detention is issued by an officer other than the State Government under sub-section (2) of Section 3
of the Maharashtra Act would constitute an infraction of a valuable right of the detenu under Article
22(5) of the Constitution and the ratio of the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Kamlesh
Kumars case (supra) would apply notwithstanding the fact that in Kamlesh Kumar's case (supra) the
Court was dealing with an order of detention issued under the provisions of COFEPOSA.
Ratio of the judgment (supra) makes the legal proposition manifestly clear, that non-supply of
essential documents/material basing the issuance of detention order deprives the detenue from
making effective representation before the detaining authority or the Government which is an
infraction of the Constitutional right of the detenue as guaranteed to him under Article 22(5) of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66982942/ 4
Mohd Tahir vs Union Territory Of J Ammu & Kashmir Ie ... on 22 May, 2023
Constitution of India r/w Section 13 of J&K Public Safety Act which invalidates the detention order
and makes it legally unsustainable. Ratio of the judgment (supra) squarely applies to facts of the
case in hand. In the case in hand, detention record demonstrates that the order of detention dated
18-11-2022 has been served upon petitioner/detenue without any delay and the petitioner has been
provided 2 leaves of copies of detention order, 3 leaves of grounds of detention (total 5 leaves)
through executing officer Maan Singh PSI No. EXJ- 196565 of Police Station Thanamandi (Rajouri).
The allegations against petitioner/detenue are, that he is indicted in case FIR No. 193/2019 of Police
Station Thannamandi u/s 8(A)/20/60 NDPS Act, FIR No. 05/2021 u/s 8/21/22 of NDPS Act of
Police Station Surankote, FIR No. 62/2021 u/s 8(A)21/22/29 NDPS Act of P/S Thanamandi,
complaint u/s 107/110/151 Cr.PC dated 30-06- 2019 of Police Station Thannamandi and
confidential report of DSB Rajouri dated 27.10.2022. Detention record depicts that copies of FIRs,
copies of statements of prosecution witnesses recorded u/s 161 Cr.pc, copies of seizure memos of the
contraband in the above FIRs, copies of site plans, copies of the complaint registered against
petitioner/detenue which form basis of the grounds of detention of petitioner have not been
provided to him. Non-supply of the aforesaid detention material to the petitioner/detenue has
infringed/violated his right to make effective representation against his detention before the Govt.
or detaining authority which is serious infraction of the constitutional right guaranteed to the
petitioner/detenue under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India r/w Section 13 of the J&K Public
Satety Act 1978, the same invalidates the detention order and makes it legally unsustainable.
. For what has been discussed above, instant petition is allowed and the detention order No. PIT
NDPS-35 of 2022 dated 18-11-2022 issued by respondent No.2 (Divisional Commissioner Jammu)
for detention of petitioner is quashed. Petitioner shall be released from preventive custody forthwith
if not wanted in any other case. Detention record be returned to Ld. Counsel for respondents under
proper receipt.
. Disposed off accordingly.
