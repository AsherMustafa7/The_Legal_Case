Amit Kumar vs The T. M. Bhagalpur University And Ors on 16 October, 2025
appointment was rejected.
2. The case of the petitioner, in brief, is that his father,
Patna High Court CWJC No.8139 of 2017 dt.16-10-2025
2/10
Late Subhash Chandra, was appointed as a Counter Clerk (Arts)
in K.M.D. College, Parbatta, on 09.02.1981 vide Appointment
Letter No. 67 / 81 and he joined his duties on 13.02.1981. His
appointment was accepted and approved by the then Professor-
in-Charge of the College. Subsequently, the petitioner's father,
along with other Class-III and Class-IV non-teaching employees
of the College approached this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 12544 of
2003 (Ranjan Kumar Singh & Ors. vs. State of Bihar & Ors.)
seeking regularization of their services. The said writ petition
was disposed of vide order dated 11.07.2005 directing the
Secretary, Human Resources Development Department,
Government of Bihar to take appropriate steps in light of Full
Bench judgment in Braj Kishore Singh vs. State of Bihar &
Ors., 1997 (1) PLJR 509 and to release funds in respect of such
non-teaching posts falling within the staffing pattern.
3. In compliance with the said order, the Director, Higher
Education, Government of Bihar issued Memo No. 931 dated
26.06.2006
, whereby 22 Class-III and 21 Class-IV posts were sanctioned under staffing pattern for K.M.D.
College, Parbatta and the services of 43 employees including the petitioner's father were approved
for absorption. However, the said Memo contained a restrictive Clause No. 4, stipulating that the
posts Patna High Court CWJC No.8139 of 2017 dt.16-10-2025 so created under the staffing pattern
would cease to exist upon retirement, death or resignation of the incumbent, and that no further
appointment would be made thereon.

4. The petitioner's father was absorbed in 2006 as Laboratory In-charge. The father of the petitioner
died in harness on 19.08.2009 while serving on the post of Laboratory In-Charge in K.M.D. College,
Parbatta - a constituent unit of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University.
5. After his demise, the petitioner, being the elder son and a dependent of the deceased employee,
submitted an application for compassionate appointment on 30.08.2010 enclosing all requisite
documents including the recommendation of the Principal of the College before the Registrar of the
University.
6. The matter remained pending before the authorities which compelled the petitioner to approach
this Court by filing C.W.J.C. No. 18996 of 2014. The University filed a counter affidavit indicating
that a decision had been taken to seek legal opinion in the matter. Accordingly, the writ petition was
disposed of on 08.10.2015 directing the University to take a final decision on the petitioner's case
preferably before 31.12.2015.
7. The Compassionate Appointment Committee of the Patna High Court CWJC No.8139 of 2017
dt.16-10-2025 University headed by the Vice-chancellor in its meeting held on 27.02.2016 rejected
the petitioner's claim for compassionate appointment relying upon the legal opinion of a Senior
Advocate of this Court.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the rejection of the petitioner's claim of
compassionate appointment is wholly arbitrary, mechanical and passed without due application of
mind. The said order runs contrary to the spirit and ratio laid down by Full Bench of this Court in
Braj Kishore Singh case (supra) which categorically held that posts falling within the staffing pattern
of an affiliated college are to be treated as sanctioned posts.
9. It was argued that once the services of the petitioner's father had been duly absorbed against a
sanctioned post, his death in harness created a legitimate and enforceable right for consideration of
his dependent's claim for compassionate appointment. The University, therefore, could not defeat
this right by inserting an arbitrary and illegal clause providing for automatic abolition of the post
upon the incumbent's death. Such a condition is nothing but an attempt to circumvent judicial
pronouncements and is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
Patna High Court CWJC No.8139 of 2017 dt.16-10-2025
10. He further submits that in the absence of an adequate number of teaching and non-teaching staff
no educational institution can effectively run. Hence, the action of the authorities directing for such
automatic abolition of posts is unreasonable, unjustified, and unsustainable in law. The post of
Laboratory In-Charge in which the petitioner's father was serving continues to exist. In the event
that the post of Laboratory In-Charge is not available, the petitioner may be considered for
adjustment on any other suitable post.
11. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent- University argued that in terms of Clause
4 of Memo No. 931 dated 26.06.2006 as well as Clause 3 of the absorption letter dated 25.08.2006
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40613343/ 3
Amit Kumar vs The T. M. Bhagalpur University And Ors on 16 October, 2025
of the petitioner's father it is evident that the posts created under the staffing pattern would cease to
exist upon the retirement, death or resignation of the incumbent and that no further appointment
would be made thereon. Accordingly, upon the death of the petitioner's father, the post held by him
stood automatically abolished, and consequently, no vacancy remained available for consideration
of the petitioner's case for compassionate appointment.
12. It is further contended that the petitioner's father had duly accepted the terms and conditions of
absorption, including Patna High Court CWJC No.8139 of 2017 dt.16-10-2025 the aforesaid clause,
and the same was never challenged during his lifetime.
13. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through material on record. The father of
the petitioner was absorbed on the post created under staffing pattern in view of the judgment Full
Bench judgment rendered in Braj Kishore Singh case (supra). Clause 4 of the letter of the State
Government dated 26.06.2006 represents a conscious policy decision of the State taken to create
additional posts only to the limited extent necessary for regularizing existing employees with a clear
condition that such posts would lapse upon retirement, death or resignation of the incumbent. The
absorption letter of the petitioner's father also contained a similar stipulation in clause-3. The
petitioner father accepted the aforesaid clauses and it was never challenged by his father during his
life time or by any other employee.
14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Director of Treasuries in Karnataka and Anr. versus
Somyashree reported in 2021(12) SCC 20 has held that compassionate appointment is an exception
to general rule and no aspirant can claim right to compassionate appointment.
15. In yet another judgment of Umesh Kumar Nagpal vs. Patna High Court CWJC No.8139 of 2017
dt.16-10-2025 State of Haryana and Ors. reported in 1994(4) SCC 138 in paragraph no. 2 the
principles of compassionate appointment has been encapsulated in the following terms:-
"2. The question relates to the considerations which should guide while giving
appointment in public services on compassionate ground. It appears that there has
been a good deal of obfuscation on the issue. As a rule, appointments in the public
services should be made strictly on the basis of open invitation of applications and
merit. No other mode of appointment nor any other consideration is permissible.
Neither the Governments nor the public authorities are at liberty to follow any other
procedure or relax the qualifications laid down by the rules for the post. However, to
this general rule which is to be followed strictly in every case, there are some
exceptions carved out in the interests of justice and to meet certain contingencies.
One such exception is in favour of the dependants of an employee dying in harness
and leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood. In such cases,
out of pure humanitarian consideration taking into consideration the fact that unless
some source of livelihood is provided, the family would not be able to make both ends
meet, a provision is made in the rules to provide gainful employment to one of the
dependants of the deceased who may be eligible for such employment. The whole
object of granting compassionate employment is thus to enable the family to tide over
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40613343/ 4
Amit Kumar vs The T. M. Bhagalpur University And Ors on 16 October, 2025
the sudden crisis. The object is not to give a member of such family a post much less a
post for post held by the deceased. What is further, mere death of an employee in
harness does not entitle his family to such source of Patna High Court CWJC No.8139
of 2017 dt.16-10-2025 livelihood. The Government or the public authority concerned
has to examine the financial condition of the family of the deceased, and it is only if it
is satisfied, that but for the provision of employment, the family will not be able to
meet the crisis that a job is to be offered to the eligible member of the family. The
posts in Classes III and IV are the lowest posts in non-manual and manual categories
and hence they alone can be offered on compassionate grounds, the object being to
relieve the family, of the financial destitution and to help it get over the emergency.
The provision of employment in such lowest posts by making an exception to the rule
is justifiable and valid since it is not discriminatory. The favourable treatment given
to such dependant of the deceased employee in such posts has a rational nexus with
the object sought to be achieved, viz., relief against destitution. No other posts are
expected or required to be given by the public authorities for the purpose. It must be
remembered in this connection that as against the destitute family of the deceased
there are millions of other families which are equally, if not more destitute. The
exception to the rule made in favour of the family of the deceased employee is in
consideration of the services rendered by him and the legitimate expectations, and
the change in the status and affairs, of the family engendered by the erstwhile
employment which are suddenly upturned.
16. Inter alia it has been held that compassionate appointment is not a vested right of the
dependent. It is a concession extended to enable the family of a deceased Patna High Court CWJC
No.8139 of 2017 dt.16-10-2025 employee to tide over a sudden financial crisis arising out of the
employee's death in harness. Such appointment cannot be claimed as a matter of course or in
disregard to the prevailing service rules, recruitment norms, or sanctioned strength. While
compassionate appointment serves as an exception to general rule of appointment, it is extended
purely on humanitarian grounds to the dependents of an employee who dies in harness leaving his
family in penury and without any means of livelihood. The object of such appointment is to provide
immediate financial relief to the bereaved family to enable it to overcome the sudden crisis. The
mere death of an employee in service does not by itself entitle his dependents to such employment.
17. The father of the petitioner died in 2009 and if the petitioner has been able to survive for the last
sixteen years, it goes to show that he has sufficient means of livelihood from other sources.
Furthermore, absorption letter of the petitioner's father dated 25.08.2006 and policy decision of the
State dated 26.06.2006 also say that the post sanctioned under staffing pattern shall cease to exist
upon retirement, death or resignation of the incumbent and that no further appointment would be
made thereon. As such, the petitioner cannot claim his vested Patna High Court CWJC No.8139 of
2017 dt.16-10-2025 right to appointment. Accordingly, the application is dismissed.
