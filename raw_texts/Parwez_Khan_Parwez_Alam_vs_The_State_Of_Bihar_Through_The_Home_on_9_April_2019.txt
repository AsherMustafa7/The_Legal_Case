Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
under the Bihar Control of Crimes Act, 1981. An order has been
passed under Section 12(2) of the said Act for detaining the
petitioner on the basis of a police report dated 13 th July, 2018.
The detention order has been passed on 18 th of August, 2018 and
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019
2/22
the same has been affirmed by the State Government vide order
dated 1st of October, 2018. The said orders are under challenge.
3. The petitioner, apart from the other cases referred
to in the police report, was also involved in an incident in
respect whereof Bikramganj P.S. Case No. 95 of 2018 has been
registered.
4. The order of preventive detention as affirmed by
the State Government to keep the petitioner behind bars in the
interest of public order is the gravamen of the present dispute.
5. The petitioner claims that he is a practising lawyer
in the local Civil Court of District Rohtas and he has been
implicated in certain cases in spite of the fact that he is dedicatd
towards every good cause of the society and as a matter of fact
he had got an FIR lodged against the members of his own
community. He is also a patient of Hepatitis B and in respect of
the FIR arising out of Bikramganj P.S. Case No.95 of 2018, he
has been granted bail by this Court on 5th October, 2018.
6. The detention order under the Bihar Control of
Crimes Act, 1981 (hereinafter referred as 'the 1981 Act') has

custody. The petitioner filed a representation before the State
Government which has also been rejected on 1st of October,
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019
3/22
2018.
7. Prior to this, the petitioner had been served with a
notice of externment to which he submitted a reply on 12 th June,
2018 and the said proceedings were dropped.
8. The petitioner in respect of the cases referred to in
the detention order and the confirmation order also refers to a
particular case relating to the posting of certain material on the
face bookwhich according to the respondents was sufficient to
make one believe that the petitioner was spreading hatred and
aimed at disturbing public order by resorting to such activities.
The criminal history of the petitioner is as follows:-
(i) Bikramganj P.S. Case No.9 of 2017 dated
12.01.2017
under Sections 147, 149, 341, 323, 353, 143, 504, 506 of the IPC. This was with regard to an
allegation of an unlawful assembly blocking the road and creating obstruction in the discharge of
Government work causing danger to life. The charge-sheet in the said case has been submitted on 29
th June, 2018.
(ii) Bikramganj P.S. Case No.186 of 2017 dated 3 rd July, 2017 under Sections 504, 341, 323, 324/34
of the IPC. This is an allegation with regard to an alleged assault and use of abusive language against
the informant in which a charge-sheet Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 has
been filed on 30th November, 2017.
(iii) Bikramganj P.S. Case No.95 of 2018 dated 18 th March, 2018 under Sections 153 (A), 504 of the
IPC. It is this case lodged by one Manoj Kumar Singh posting news on the Facebook. While
submitting the charge-sheet, the petitioner has been charged of the offences under Sections
295(A)/153(A)/504 of the IPC and Section 66 of the D.I.T. Act in which charge- sheet has been filed
on 29th June, 2018.

Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
(iv) Bikramganj P.S. Case No.210 of 2018 dated 6 th June, 2018 under Sections 341, 342, 323, 354,
379, 506, 384, 307/34 of the IPC. The allegation in this is that one Aruna Devi lodged the FIR
alleging that the petitioner along with his associates surrounded her and snatched her Mangal Sutra
with the intention to cause bodily harm and even kill her.
9. The petitioner, according to this case history, was found to have indulged in activities that would
be detrimental to public peace and public order and, therefore, his detention was found to be
necessary. Accordingly, in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 12(2) of the 1981 Act and
the Notification dated 21st June, 2018, a detention order was passed by the District Magistrate on
18th August, 2018.
10. The petitioner's representation was received that Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019
dt.09-04-2019 was dispatched to the Home Department and after calling for the report from the
District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police, the order was confirmed by the Advisory
Board and was approved by the State Government vide an order dated 1st October, 2018. The
detention period is of one year that is to come an end on 17th August, 2019.
11. One of the ingredients that forms the basis of the detention order is of a case relating to the
posting of offensive material on the Facebook. This material levelled an allegation against a T.V.
Anchor Anjana and the same is extracted hereinunder:-

12. Thus, apart from the other criminal cases, the history whereof has been indicated in the
detention order, one of Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 the grounds was
that in case the petitioner is allowed to be released and there is every likelihood of he being granted
a bail order, his presence in the society would be detrimental as there is every likelihood of his
indulging into activities that may spread communal disharmony. There is also a recital in the
detention order that he has the potential to spread such news even while remaining in jail and,
therefore, he should be kept under detention to prevent any such mishappening.
13. We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner who submits that there was no material to
arrive at any such conclusion and the apprehension about the petitioner being bailed out was also
unfounded keeping in view the nature of the bail order which has been passed in the present case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158318530/ 4
Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
14. The exercise of power under Section 12 of the 1981 Act is to prevent anti-social elements from
carrying out their nefarious activities for which a detention order can be passed. Section 12 is
extracted hereinunder:-
12. Power to make order detaining certain persons.- (1) The State Government may, if
satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in
any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and there is reason to fear
that the activities of anti-
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 social elements can not be prevented
otherwise than by the immediate arrest of such person, make an order directing that such anti-social
element be detained.
(2) If, having regard to the circumstances prevailing or likely to prevail in any area within the local
limits of the jurisdiction of a District Magistrate, the State Government is satisfied that it is
necessary so to do, it may by an order in writing direct, that during such period as may be specified
in the order, such District Magistrate, may also, if satisfied as provided in sub-section (1) exercise
the powers conferred upon by the said sub-
section:
Provided that the period specified in an order made by the State Government under
this sub-section shall not, in the first instance exceed three months, but the State
Government may, if satisfied as aforesaid that it is necessary so to do, amend such
order to extend such period from time to time by any period not exceeding three
months at any one time.
(3) When any order is made by District Magistrate, he shall forthwith report, the fact
to the State Government together with the grounds on which the order has been
made and such other Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019
particulars as, in his opinion, have a bearing on the matter, and no such order shall
remain in force for more than 12 days after the making thereof unless, in the
meantime, it has been approved by the State Government:
Provided that where under section 17 the grounds of detention are communicated by
the officer making the order after five days but not later than ten days from the date
of detention, this sub-
section shall apply subject to the modification that, for the words "twelve days", the
words "fifteen days" shall be substituted."
15. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on a judgement of a Division Bench of this Court in
the case of Mahendra Sharma @ Mahendra Sardar Versus The State of Bihar & Ors (Criminal Writ
Jurisdiction Case No.698 of 2014) to contend that the passing of a preventive detention order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158318530/ 5
Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
requires strict scrutiny as it necessarily curtails the personal liberty of a person without trial in the
interest of the public at large on the ground that release of the detenue is likely to disturb the peace
and order of society. The Division Bench in paragraph 7 has discussed the intent and purpose of
preventive Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 law and its impact which is
extracted hereinunder:-
"7. As may appear from the reading of the provision of Section 3, there is some sense
of urgency in initiating and taking action under Section 3 of the Act. The urgency is to
protect the society from unlawful activities which are noted in the very provisions of
Section 3(1) of the Act which may ultimately prejudice and disturb the peace and
order and smooth flow of human life and activities in the society so that society
moves smoothly without being disturbed by any criminal activities and further, that
people live in the society enjoying peaceful atmosphere not only to enjoy their lives
but also to prosecute their vocations. It appears necessary that a crime free society is
created by taking preventive measures which are envisaged to be taken either by
Section 3 or by Sections 12, 17 and 22 of the Act by the authorities at different levels
and in the light of reports which might have been received by them. But, it is too well
known to be pointed out that passing preventive detention order or orders of the
nature which are required to be passed under Section 3 of the Act necessarily curtails
the personal liberties of the person proceeded against. The liberties which have to be
curtailed or which have to be abridged are guaranteed under Chapter III of the
Constitution of India as the fundamental Right's of the citizens and persons and
courts exist Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 only to
safeguard those liberties to the extent unless it becomes utterly necessary to put
down some fetters on the enjoyment of those rights that too under some emergent
situation. The right to personal liberty, in fact, are the catalysts of human
development. Liberty of any nature enthuses persons and citizens of the nation to
think and interact, to chart paths of achievements in their personal lives and thus,
enhance the prospect of nation building. The ordinary situation could be always
viewing with foul eyes such actions which tell upon the personal liberties of persons
living anywhere in the society.
Preventive laws are harsh and sometimes they do not appear passed after following
the general provisions of trials which could be available to a criminal court. Summary
proceedings by perusing the reports so as to drawing the subjective satisfaction so as
to issuing the order are the modes of proceeding in such matters, but even in that
case, as may appear from the very provisions of Section 3 or other provisions, the
right to be heard has been safeguarded by the legislature. In case of Section 3 of the
Act, the right is available to a person in a broader manner than what appears
available to him when he is being proceeded against either under Section 12 or 17 or
22 a case of an order which has to be passed under Section 22 of the Act, the
legislature has set down more stringent a Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019
dt.09-04-2019 measure by directing that all materials including the show-cause or
explanation submitted by the proposed detenue has to be placed before the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158318530/ 6
Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
Advisory Board so as to taking a decision under Section 21 of the Act to recommend
or not to recommend the detention of a person. We need hardly to point out that the
State Advisory Board is constituted by persons of reason and conscience and it is
supposed that they had never defaulter in making recommendations which are
desired to be made by them."
16. It was further found that the recording of reasons by the District Magistrate is a must and further
merely because a person is involved in a few cases, the same may not be a convincing reason by itself
to pass an order of preventive detention. The observations made in paragraphs 9 and 10 are
extracted hereinunder:-
"9. The negation of this right by the District Magistrate has to be declared arbitrary if
he does not record reasons for denying the right of hearing to a person.
10. We were not required to note into such finer details the scope and ambit of the
provision of section 3 of the Act for disposing of the present petition, but considering
that a District Magistrate holds position in the district who heads not only many
establishments but has a wider power of passing Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of
2019 dt.09-04-2019 various orders telling upon the personal liberties of a person, we
desired to clarify position so that the personal liberties do not fall prey to personal
whims and caprice of a person who might be the District Magistrate of a district on
mere information which has not yet been verified and tested by going through the
trial procedure. We have noted that detention as well as laws on preventive detention
is somewhat draconian. For drawing satisfaction for acting under the provisions of
the Act it requires some serious and weighty materials because the satisfaction is
never objective it is subjective and one is made to believe generally the report
submitted by the police establishment. If a person being at large appears dangerous
to the society then in that act his detention may be required, but merely because he
has been involved or has been concerned in a few cases may not be requiring him to
be detained if the materials past and present other than the first information report
do not appear as convincing to a reasonable man as is required under law. This was
the reason that we were explaining the provisions in some finer details so as to
impressing upon the District Magistrate not only of Arwal, but of all districts of the
State that they are supposed, on account of being the officer of the State, to protect
the liberties of the citizens also. Issuing a notice itself is a very serious business and it
could be done only for compelling reasons as the very receipt of a notice under the
Act by a person may put his personal liberties under some clouds. The District
Magistrate should be cautious and should in all cases adhere to the provisions of the
Act before they have Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 finally
decided to issue an order."
17. We have been apprised of another Division Bench Judgement where the petition was allowed on
the ground that there was no particular material in the order to demonstrate that the detenue was
trying to come out of jail nor was there any material showing that the petitioner's release was likely
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158318530/ 7
Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
to cause disturbance culminating in public disorder. Thus, where the detenue was alleged to be
making an attempt to come out of jail was not found to be the basis for preventive detention and the
writ petition was allowed. The said decision of the Division Bench is in the case of Shyam Rai @
Shyam Chandra Rai Versus The State of Bihar & Ors. (Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No.523 of
2014) decided on 10th July, 2014.
18. The above mentioned judgement has referred to the judgement of the Apex Court in the case of
Huidrom Konungjao Singh Versus State of Manipur, (2012) 7 SCC
181. The order of detention was quashed in that case after discussing the entire law on the subject.
Paragraphs 4 to 9 are extracted hereinunder:-
4. The question of personal liberty of a person is sacrosanct and State Authority
cannot be permitted to take it away without following the procedure prescribed by
law, otherwise it would be violative of Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019
dt.09-04-2019 the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 21 and 22 of the
Constitution. In Ayya v. State of U.P. [(1989) 1 SCC 374 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 153 : AIR
1989 SC 364] this Court held that the law of preventive detention is based and could
be described as a "jurisdiction of suspicion" and the compulsion of values of freedom
of democratic society and of social order sometimes might compel a curtailment of
individual's liberty.
5. In Yumman Ongbi Lembi Leima v. State of Manipur [(2012) 2 SCC 176 : (2012) 1
SCC (Cri) 701] this Court held that: (SCC p. 182, para 27) "27. ... personal liberty of an
individual is the most precious and prized right guaranteed under the Constitution in
Part III thereof. The State has been granted the power to curb such rights under
criminal laws as also under the laws of preventive detention, which, therefore, are
required to be exercised with due caution as well as upon a proper appreciation of the
facts as to whether such acts are in any way prejudicial to the interest and the security
of the State and its citizens, or seek to disturb public law and order, warranting the
issuance of such an order."
6. Whether a person who is in jail can be detained under detention law has been the
subject-
matter of consideration before this Court time and again. In Dharmendra Suganchand Chelawat v.
Union of India [(1990) 1 SCC 746 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 249 : AIR 1990 SC 1196], this Court while
considering the same issue has reconsidered its earlier judgments on the point in Rameshwar Shaw
v. District Magistrate, Burdwan [AIR 1964 SC 334 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ 257], Masood Alam v. Union of
India [(1973) 1 SCC 551 :
1973 SCC (Cri) 435 : AIR 1973 SC 897], Dulal Roy v. Patna High Court CR. WJC
No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 District Magistrate, Burdwan [(1975) 1 SCC 837 :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158318530/ 8
Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
1975 SCC (Cri) 329], Alijan Mian v. District Magistrate, Dhanbad [(1983) 4 SCC 301 :
1983 SCC (Cri) 840 : AIR 1983 SC 1130], Ramesh Yadav v.
District Magistrate, Etah [(1985) 4 SCC 232 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 514 : AIR 1986 SC 315], Suraj Pal Sahu
v. State of Maharashtra [(1986) 4 SCC 378 : 1986 SCC (Cri) 452], Binod Singh v. District Magistrate,
Dhanbad [(1986) 4 SCC 416 : 1986 SCC (Cri) 490 :
AIR 1986 SC 2090] and Shashi Aggarwal v. State of U.P. [(1988) 1 SCC 436 : 1988
SCC (Cri) 178 : AIR 1988 SC 596] and came to the following conclusion:
(Chelawat case [(1990) 1 SCC 746 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 249 : AIR 1990 SC 1196], SCC p.
754, para 21) "21. The decisions referred to above lead to the conclusion that an order
for detention can be validly passed against a person in custody and for that purpose it
is necessary that the grounds of detention must show that (i) the detaining authority
was aware of the fact that the detenu is already in detention; and (ii) there were
compelling reasons justifying such detention despite the fact that the detenu is
already in detention. The expression 'compelling reasons' in the context of making an
order for detention of a person already in custody implies that there must be cogent
material before the detaining authority on the basis of which it may be satisfied that
(a) the detenu is likely to be released from custody in the near future, and (b) taking
into account the nature of the antecedent activities of the detenu, it is likely that after
his release from custody he would indulge in prejudicial activities and it is necessary
to detain him in order to prevent him from engaging in such activities."
7. In Amritlal v. Union Govt. [(2001) 1 SCC 341 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 147 : AIR 2000 SC
3675] a Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 similar issue arose
as the detaining authority recorded its satisfaction for detention under the Act, in
view of the fact that the person, who was already in jail, was going to move a bail
application. In the grounds of detention it had been mentioned that there was
"likelihood of the detenu moving an application for bail" and hence detention was
necessary. This Court held that there must be cogent materials before the authority
passing the detention order that there was likelihood of his release on bail. (See also
N. Meera Rani v. Govt. of T.N. [(1989) 4 SCC 418 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 732] ,
Kamarunnissa v. Union of India [(1991) 1 SCC 128 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 88 : AIR 1991 SC
1640] and Union of India v. Paul Manickam [(2003) 8 SCC 342 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 239
: AIR 2003 SC 4622] .)
8. This Court while deciding the case in A. Geetha v. State of T.N. [(2006) 7 SCC 603 :
(2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 324] relied upon its earlier judgments in Rajesh Gulati v. Govt. of
NCT of Delhi [(2002) 7 SCC 129 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1627 : AIR 2002 SC 3094] ,
Ibrahim Nazeer v. State of T.N. [(2006) 6 SCC 64 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 17] and
Senthamilselvi v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158318530/ 9
Parwez Khan @ Parwez Alam vs The State Of Bihar Through The Home ... on 9 April, 2019
State of T.N. [(2006) 5 SCC 676 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 50] and held: (A. Geetha case [(2006) 7 SCC
603 :
(2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 324] , SCC p. 606, para 10) "10. ... that the detaining authority
should be aware that the detenu is already in custody and is likely to be released on
bail. The conclusion that the detenu may be released on bail cannot be ipse dixit of
the detaining authority."
Its subjective satisfaction based on materials, normally, should not to be interfered with. Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019
9. In view of the above, it can be held that there is no prohibition in law to pass the detention order
in respect of a person who is already in custody in respect of criminal case. However, if the detention
order is challenged the detaining authority has to satisfy the Court the following facts:
(1) The authority was fully aware of the fact that the detenu was actually in custody.
(2) There was reliable material before the said authority on the basis of which it could
have reasons to believe that there was real possibility of his release on bail and
further on being released he would probably indulge in activities which are
prejudicial to public order.
(3) In view of the above, the authority felt it necessary to prevent him from indulging
in such activities and therefore, detention order was necessary.
In case either of these facts does not exist the detention order would stand vitiated. The present case
requires to be examined in the light of the aforesaid settled legal proposition."
19. There is yet another aspect which deserves mention and that we have come across, namely, the
extensive and elaborate proposition of law while striking down the provisions of Section 66A of the
IT Act, 2000 where it was held that it was violative of Article 19 (1) (a) and Article 19(2) of the
Constitution of India. The corresponding provision in the Kerala Police Act was also struck down.
The Apex Court discussed the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 issues
relating to public order being disturbed on the posting of certain information on the Facebook and it
was ultimately found that the punishment indicated for sending offensive message through
communication under Section 66-A were unconstitutional. The judgement in the case of Shreya
Singhal v. Union of India, reported in (2015) 5 SCC 1 therefore also deals with issues relating to
safeguards against arrest and detention arising out of such cyber crimes and the protection of
fundamental rights as indicated above. It appears that a Miscellaneous Application No.3220 of 2018
was filed in the said case which came up on 15th February, 2019 whereby the Supreme Court was
pleased to pass the following order:-
"The learned Attorney General appears before us and has made a concrete
suggestion, which we accept.

India' [(2015) 5 SCC 1] will be made available by every High Court in this country to
all the District Courts. This should be done within a period of eight weeks from today.
Also, we direct the Union Government to make available copies of this judgment to
the Chief Secretaries of all the State Governments and the Union Territories. This
should be done within a period of eights weeks from today. The Chief Secretaries will,
in turn, sensitise the police Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019
departments in this country by sending copies of this judgment to the Director
General of Police in each State, within a period of eights weeks thereafter.
The application stands disposed of
accordingly."
20. It is thus evident that the matters relating to such offenses arising out of the
Facebook posts have to be dealt with keeping in view the said observations of the
Apex Court.
21. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner has been granted
bail in all the cases, including the following order dated 5.10.2018 being passed in
respect of Bikramganj P.S. Case No. 95 of 2018.
"Heard the parties.
The petitioner seeks bail in Bikramganj P.S. Case No. 95 of 2018 registered for the
offences under Sections 153(a), 504 of the I.P.C. and Section 66 of the D.I.T. Act.
Allegation against the petitioner is of making sensational and provocative messages
viral on social media causing communal tension in area.
Submission on behalf of the petitioner is that he has been falsely implicated in this
case and now he is in custody and he is ready to abide by the conditions imposed
upon him by this Court.
Heard the learned A.P.P. and the informant who opposed the prayer for bail of the
petitioner stating that the petitioner is in jail custody and he is accused in four other
cases.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 Having heard both sides
and in view of the fats and circumstances of the case, as stated above, I am not
inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at this stage. However, learned Court
concerned is directed to release the petitioner on completion of six months of the
petitioner in jail custody shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.

25,000/- to the satisfaction of the trial court on condition that in future, if he is found
involved in such type of the cases, the prosecution shall move for cancellation of his
bail bond.
Accordingly, this application is disposed of."
22. The said bail order was passed when the petitioner was in custody and immediate bail was
declined but, at the same time, the Court observed that the petitioner shall be released on
completion of six months of serving jail custody.
23. The detention order is to last till 17th of August, 2019.
24. We have considered the submissions raised and we find that the detention order does not appear
to have detailed the material or the compelling reasons so as to construe that the petitioner was
while in jail involved in planning to disturb public order after he comes outside jail. This material is
only based on an allegation that he had threatened a police officer with dire consequences.
25. Apart from this, the detention order dated 18th Patna High Court CR. WJC No.72 of 2019
dt.09-04-2019 August, 2018 also recites that while being detained in jail he has the potential, and he
does conspire to spread hatred and violence. We have not been able to gather anything from the
report of the Superintendent of Police or even the detention order about the existence of any such
material. The State Government, while approving the same, therefore, appears to have overlooked
these aspects, including the material which may or may not have been there for the purpose of
drawing such inference by the detaining authority.
26. The Face Book message extracted above has nowhere been analyzed nor any conclusion drawn
keeping in view the judgement of the Apex Court in the case of Shreya Singhal (supra). The State
Government also does not appear to have applied its mind keeping in view the observations made in
the said judgement.
27. We, therefore, at this stage find that the State Government is required to re-visit the matter in
order to consider the correctness or otherwise of the detention order dated 18.08.2018.
28. We partly allow the writ petition and set aside the order of confirmation dated 1st October, 2018
passed by the State Government and remit the matter back to the Respondent Patna High Court CR.
WJC No.72 of 2019 dt.09-04-2019 No. 2 for being placed before the competent authority of the
State Government for a decision afresh within the period of 15 days from today and communicate
the same to the petitioner.
29. A copy of the order may be made available by tomorrow to the Assisting Counsel to learned
Advocate General for being communicated to the Respondent No. 2 for taking appropriate action.
