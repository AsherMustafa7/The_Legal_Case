In order to avoid any further ambiguity and since it has been informed to this Court that some of
petitioners and other aggrieved persons have filed first appeal against impugned order which are
rejected and some of effective persons have filed second appeal which are still pending, whereas
some of petitioners have approached directly before this Court and, therefore, the fair submission of
counsels for petitioner is accepted that petitioners who have still not filed first appeal in terms of
relevant provisions be permitted to file first appeal within two weeks, which shall be decided
thereafter within two weeks.
It is further observed that appeals be decided on its own merit and may not be rejected only on
ground that some earlier first appeals were rejected, if facts so warrants.
