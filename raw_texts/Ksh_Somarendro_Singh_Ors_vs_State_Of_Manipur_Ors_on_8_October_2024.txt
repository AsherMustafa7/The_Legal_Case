requesting the latter to verify whether the provisions of the regulations were followed while
admitting the forty-five new members of the Society and that in case of any violation of the
provisions of the Act or Regulations of the Society in admitting the new members, appropriate
necessary action be taken to rectify such violation.
[3] Acting on the said letter of the Registrar of Societies, the Deputy Registrar of Societies, Kakching,
issued an order dated 27-08-2024 authorizing Shri M. Nanao Singh, Inspector, Co-operative
Societies and Smt. Sheela Leishangthem, Sub-Registrar of Co-operative Societies to conduct an
enquiry in connection with meetings of the Managing Committee of the Padma Ratna English
School (Sitting No. 40, 41, 42 and 43 held on 23-09-2023, 22-10-2023, 13-11-2023 and 26-12-2023)
respectively and to submit a report on or before 30-08-2024. Subsequently, the appointed two
Officers held an enquiry and submitted a report dated 19-09-2024 to the Deputy Registrar of
Societies, Kakching stating, inter alia, as under:-
"Resolution No. 7 regarding admission of 45 (forty-five) person as new members of
the school under misc. agenda. Also asking for payment of Rs. 2000/- as
membership fee:-
In this regard admission of new members cannot be considered under misc. agenda
as admission of 45 (forty- five) persons in a 24 (twenty-four) original members will
be significant development impacting the organization's structure, dynamics and
decision-making process. Further notice for new admission should be widely
published specifying a fixed date for last date of submission of application. Also the
newly admitted members were not mentioned about the specific class of membership
as per Rule No. 2 of the Rules and regulations of the school land there is no class of
membership which have to pay Rs.
2000/- as admission fee. If any change is to be made, it has to be done by amending the existing
rules and Regulations of the school. Hence it violates the Rules and Regulations of the school.
Therefore, the above information is submitted for further necessary action."
WP(C) No. 704 of 2024 Contd.../-
On the basis of the said report, the Deputy Registrar of Societies, Kakching, issued the impugned
order dated 23-09-2024 cancelling the admission of new forty-five members.
[4] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that even
though the Registrar of Societies specifically directed the Deputy Registrar of Societies, Kakching, to
hold an enquiry in respect of only the admission of forty-five new members of the Society, the
Deputy Registrar of Societies, Kakching, expanded the scope of the enquiry in respect of other
proceedings of the Committee Meeting held on different dates without any requirement or
authority. It has further been submitted by the learned senior counsel that even though in the report
submitted by the Enquiring Officers that there was no violation of rules and regulations with regard
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54617352/ 2
Ksh. Somarendro Singh & Ors vs State Of Manipur & Ors on 8 October, 2024
to the proceedings of the Managing Committee Meeting held on different dates, the Deputy
Registrar of Societies, Kakching, declared all such proceedings as null and void without giving any
reason, arbitrarily and in colourable exercise of power. It has also been submitted by the learned
senior counsel that the impugned order dated 23-09-2024 cancelling the admission of the new
forty-five members of the Society had been issued without giving any opportunity of being heard to
the newly admitted members or to the authorities of the Society and in complete violation of the
principle of natural justice. The learned senior counsel, accordingly, prays for passing an interim
order for suspending the operation of the impugned order dated 23-09-2024.
[5] Mr. Th. Vashum, learned GA appearing for the official respondents submitted that under Section
22 of the Manipur Societies Registration Act, 1989, the Registrar of Societies is empowered to
conduct an enquiry on receiving information that the affairs of a society WP(C) No. 704 of 2024
Contd.../-
is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other person, or that the
society is guilty of mismanaging its affairs or of any fraudulent or unlawful act. The learned GA
further submitted that since the Registrar of Societies is empowered to conduct such an enquiry and
since a serious complaint has been made against the admission of forty-five new members of the
Society, there is nothing wrong in ordering for conducting an enquiry with regard to the admission
of new members of the Society and in taking action on the basis of the report submitted after such
enquiry. The learned GA also submitted that there is no merit in the writ petition and no interim
order be passed.
[6] I have heard the rival submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
also carefully examined the materials available on record.
Even though under Section 22 of the Societies Registration Act, the Registrar of Societies is
empowered to conduct an enquiry as to whether a society is guilty of mismanaging its affairs or of
any fraudulent or unlawful act, the provisions of Section 22 did not empowered the Registrar of
Societies to take suo-moto action on the basis of the report submitted after such enquiry. Under the
provisions of Section 22(5), it is provided that on receiving a report of the enquiry, the Registrar of
Societies shall send the report with his comments to the State Government and the State
Government is the only authority who can give direction to the Society for removal of any defects or
irregularities committed by such society. Under Section 22, the Registrar of Societies is not
empowered to take any action suo-moto on the basis of such enquiry.
[7] In view of the above, this court is of the considered view that in issuing the impugned order, the
Deputy Registrar of Societies has WP(C) No. 704 of 2024 Contd.../-
exceeded its power given under the Act. Moreover, since no notice or opportunity of being heard was
given to the affected parties in issuing the impugned order, this court is of the considered view that
the Deputy Registrar of Societies, Kakching, has violated the principle of natural justice in issuing
the impugned order. Accordingly, it is hereby directed that the operation of the impugned order
dated 23-09-2024 shall remain suspended till the next date of hearing.
