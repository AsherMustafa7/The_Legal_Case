ORDER (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] By way of this writ petition, the petitioner assails the order dated 29.08.2022 of
the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, whereby he was subjected to
preventive detention in exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. He seeks a
consequential writ of habeas corpus to set him at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Mr. L. Seityandra, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Th. Vashum, learned
Government Advocate, for respondents No. 1 & 2; and Mr. S. Vijayanand Sharma, learned Sr. PCCG,
appearing for respondent No. 3. [3] The primary ground of attack urged by Mr. L. Seityandra,
learned counsel, is that there is unexplained delay in the disposal of the petitioner's representation
against his detention. The petitioner's representation was dated 21.09.2022 and it was rejected by
the State Government on 26.10.2022. The Central Government rejected the said representation on
07.11.2022. The affidavit- in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, reflects that the petitioner's representation was received from the Inspector General of
Prisons, Manipur, on 23.09.2022. It was forwarded to the Deputy Secretary (PIT-ND&PS),
Department of Revenue, New Delhi, on 27.09.2022. No further details were furnished in the
affidavit as to what transpired after receipt of the representation until its disposal more than a
month later. [4] The file of the detaining authority produced by Mr. Th. Vashum, learned
Government Advocate, reflects that the representation submitted by the petitioner was forwarded by
the Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, on 21.09.2022 itself and was received in the
Directorate of Prisons, Manipur, on W.P. (Crl) No. 17 of 2022 Page 2 22.09.2022. The Inspector
General of Prisons, Manipur, thereupon addressed letter dated 23.09.2022 to the Special Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, forwarding the representation and it was received by the Home
Department on the very same day. However, it was only on 27.09.2022 that the Deputy Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, addressed a letter to the Director General of Police, Manipur,
seeking para-wise comments on the representation. The Superintendent of Police, Thoubal,
furnished para-wise comments to the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, under his
letter dated 29.09.2022. The Note File reflects that an entry was made therein only on 24.10.2022
referring to receipt of the comments from the police department. Surprisingly, this entry refers to
receipt of the comments under letter dated 07.10.2022. However, there is no such letter dated
07.10.2022 in the file but, on the other hand, the letter dated 29.09.2022 of the Superintendent of
Police, Thoubal, is very much there. Thereafter, an entry was made in the Note File only on
24.10.2022 that the representation of the petitioner may be rejected on the strength of the police
recommendation. This led to the order dated 26.10.2022, rejecting the petitioner's representation.

Md. Fazlur Rahaman @ Abbas vs Special Secretary (Home) on 1 February, 2023
[5] The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Director (PITNDPS), Department of Revenue, Ministry of
Finance, Government of India, discloses that the petitioner's representation dated 21.09.2022 was
forwarded by the Home Department of the State of Manipur under letter dated 27.09.2022 and was
received through e-mail on 29.09.2022. Para-wise comments were forwarded by the Deputy
Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, by e-mail on 26.10.2022. The relevant material was
submitted to the competent/appropriate authority, viz., the Secretary (Revenue), on 02.11.2022 and
upon consideration of the same, the W.P. (Crl) No. 17 of 2022 Page 3 representation was rejected on
07.11.2022. No explanation is forthcoming as to why no action was taken from 26.10.2022 till
02.11.2022, when all that was required was to place the material before the competent authority.
Further, there is no explanation as to why the competent authority needed five days to dispose of the
representation, as it is not even required that any reasons be recorded for rejection thereof. It is
therefore manifest that there was delay at every stage at the levels of the State Government as well
as the Central Government. [6] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1
SCC 417], the Supreme Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's
representation owing to indifference or any other lapse, such delay would adversely affect further
detention of the prisoner. According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned to
explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the delay
is very short, as even longer delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration or
range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that
case was a mere 5 days. [7] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur
[AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground
that there was unexplained delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by
the detenu. [8] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and
others [(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the
Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government W.P.
(Crl) No. 17 of 2022 Page 4 denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court
observed that the delay by the State Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the
heart of the procedural rights and guarantees granted to a detenu. [9] Though it is laudable that the
Government of Manipur is waging a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the
menace of illicit drug manufacture, trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur,
it is equally its responsibility to ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to
protect the Constitutional and statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws.
Despite this Court stating to this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities
concerned to compliance with the prescribed norms.
[10] The unexplained delays on the part of the authorities in dealing with the detenu's
representation dated 21.09.2022 clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on their part,
which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The same would
also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order.
[11] The order of detention dated 29.08.2022 issued by the Special Secretary (Home), Government
of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand
set aside. The petitioner, Md. Fazlur Rahaman @ Abbas, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central
Jail, Sajiwa, shall be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly required in

connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 17 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
W.P. (Crl) No. 17 of 2022 Page 5 A copy of this order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary,
Government of Manipur, for information and necessary further action in the context of educating
the detaining authorities in the State of Manipur as to what are the procedural norms that they need
to adhere to while exercising power and jurisdiction under preventive detention laws.
