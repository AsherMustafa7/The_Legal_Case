between KM stone 5 (Sikta 15 KM) and
Chanuli Pul Saiphan towards Sikta in the
district of East Champaran in favour of
the petitioner.
iv. To any other relief or
reliefs for which the petitioner is found
to be entitled in the facts and
circumstances of the case."
2. The brief facts as culled out from
the Writ petition are that the petitioner applied for
the Kisan Sewa Kendra (Retail Outlet dealership)
for location No. 644/1 in in the district of East
Champaran, as advertised by Indian Oil
Corporation Limited ((hereinafter called as the
IOCL) on 22/10/2014. After scrutiny of applications,
a draw of lots was conducted on 23/09/2016 at the
Divisional Office in Muzaffarpur for selection of
successful applicant. The petitioner and
respondent No. 5 were the only candidates. The
Block Development Officer, Minapur, was the chief
guest and was asked to pick a slip but it was
Patna High Court CWJC No.6282 of 2018 dt.17-10-2025

neither announced nor showed to the applicants.
Instead, the slip was handed to the Divisional
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100193636/ 3
Anju Singh vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited Through ... on 17 October, 2025
Retail Sales Manager, who announced respondent
No. 5, as the winner without displaying the slip
publicly. The petitioner immediately raised
objection alleging irregularities.
3. Further the case of the petitioner is
that the petitioner submitted a complaint dated
27/09/2016
, along with a demand draft of Rs.
1000, pointing out the irregularities committed during the draw. Despite repeated requests and
submissions including references to videographic evidence of the draw, the petitioner was never
informed about any inquiry. It is submitted that eventually, the IOCL conducted an investigation
without the petitioner's knowledge and on 23/01/2018, informed the petitioner that the allegations
were unsubstantiated and recommended the corporation to proceed with selection of respondent
No. 5, forfeiting the petitioner's complaint fee. The petitioner challenged the fairness of this process,
highlighting Patna High Court CWJC No.6282 of 2018 dt.17-10-2025 that the video recording of the
draw was withheld and the investigation was conducted behind her back, suggesting mala fide intent
by the respondents. The petitioner again submitted a representation dated 06/02/2018 raising
objection with regard to the manner of inquiry and stated that neither she was informed about the
inquiry nor she was given an opportunity to participate. The petitioner, therefore, prays for a fresh,
transparent draw and quashing of the impugned selection.
4. A counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the respondent Indian Oil Corporation Limited. The
Learned counsel for the respondents IOCL contended that the draw was conducted in accordance
with the corporation's established guidelines. The petitioner and respondent no. 5 were the only
eligible candiates for the said location. The video recordings that captured the proceedings from
different angles were available and was thoroughly examined by the Investigating Officer (IO). The
IO's report concluded that the Patna High Court CWJC No.6282 of 2018 dt.17-10-2025 allegations
were unsubstantiated, and the complaint was disposed of as per policy. The slip that was drawn by
the invited guest, the name was announced, and though not always clearly visible on camera, the
video showed the slip being momentarily displayed. The respondents denied any mala fide or
irregularity and asserted that the petitioner's grievance was without merit and should be dismissed.
5. A supplimentary affidavit was also filed on behalf of the petitioner wherein, the petitioner
challenged the authenticity of the video recordings submitted by the respondent IOCL. The
petitioner contended that the video was improperly recorded and several critical moments were out
of camera's view. The petitioner refuted the respondents' claim that she never requested for a copy
of the video.

6. The Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the investigation was conducted, without
affording any opportunity to the petitioner or to present any evidence, which Patna High Court
CWJC No.6282 of 2018 dt.17-10-2025 violates the principles of natural justice. It is further
submitted that the entire process was manipulated to favor respondent no. 5.
7. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the Learned counsel for the respondent
IOCL. However, the private respondent, i.e., respondent No. 5, has chosen not to appear despite
issuing notices and also providing information by the the Learned counsel for IOCL.
8. Upon careful examination of the pleadings, video evidence, and submissions, the Court finds that
the petitioner was not given any opportunity to participate or be heard during the inquiry conducted
by the respondents. The video recordings, though made from two angles, have significant gaps, with
crucial portions missing such as the actual display of the drawn slip either unclear or missing. It
further appears that the name on the slip was not announced by the invited guest and further was
not shown clearly to the public or the petitioner at the time of the draw. The records reveals that the
respondents failed to Patna High Court CWJC No.6282 of 2018 dt.17-10-2025 provide the petitioner
with a copy of the video recording or the investigation report, thereby denying her the chance to
effectively challenge the findings. The Court further finds that the procedure adopted lacks the
necessary transparency and fairness required in matters affecting livelihood. Given the serious
allegations of irregularity and the procedural deficiencies, the petitioner's grievance warrants
further scrutiny.
9. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed. The impugned order dated 23/01/2018 (Annexure-5) is
hereby quashed. The respondents are directed to conduct a fresh draw of lots for allocation of the
Kishan Sewa Kendra dealership at location no. 644/1 in East Champaran in a fair manner, ensuring
the presence of the petitioner and proper video recording. The petitioner shall be afforded full
opportunity to participate in the proceedings and access all relevant documents and evidence. The
allocation made in favor of respondent no. 5 shall stand suspended pending the fresh draw.
Patna High Court CWJC No.6282 of 2018 dt.17-10-2025
10. With the above observations and directions, the writ petition is allowed.
11. Interlocutory Application, if any, shall stands disposed of.
