Dhanpat Kumar Andother vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 July, 2019
Code of Criminal Procedure, the petitioners have sought for

Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dalsing Sarai in connection with
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019
2/12
Ujjiyarpur Police Station Case No.94 of 2014, corresponding to
Trial No.1334 of 2015, whereby cognizance has been taken
against the petitioners for the offences under Sections 420, 467
and 468 of the Indian Penal Code.
3. The ground of challenge is that none of the offences
alleged are made out on bare perusal of the complaint based First
Information Report.
4. According to F.I.R., the complainant had purchased
the referred land through registered sale deed dated 27.05.2013
from villagers Chand Sharma, Ram Prasad Sharma and Shankar
Sharma, all sons of Late Anup Lal Sharma.
5. Claim of the complainant is that the land is recorded
in the name of Anup Lal Sharma and the complainant is in
possession of the same after purchase. Further case is that
petitioner, Sukhdev Sharma executed a registered sale deed on
28.12.2013
in respect of the same land in favour of petitioner, Dhanpat Kumar. Other accused persons, who are
petitioners herein are either witnesses or scribe of the sale deed.
6. Allegation is that the subsequent sale deed is just to cheat the complainant, and the same was a
forged document.
7. Contention of the petitioners is that the petitioners have disclosed the genealogical table of the
family in para 9 of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019 the application on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62497011/ 2
Dhanpat Kumar Andother vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 July, 2019
oath, which would show that Anup Sharma and Saukhi Sharma were full brothers. Petitioner,
Sukhdev Sharma is son of Saukhi Lal Sharma and the vendors of complainant are sons of Anup Lal
Singh. The property is ancestral property. The true fact is that the said property falls in share of
Sukhdev Sharma but even in absence of any evidence to support the same, for the present, it cannot
be inferred that petitioner Sukhdev Sharma acted with out and out mala fide intention without any
bona fide claim over the property.
8. Submission is that the issue of requirement to prove offences under Sections 468 and 420 of the
Indian Penal Code was before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Md. Ibrahim & Others versus the State
of Bihar & Another, reported in 2009 (4) PLJR (SC) 99.
9. Para 9 to 15 of the judgment are being reproduced below:-
"9. The term "forgery" used in these two sections is defined in section 463. Whoever
makes any false documents with intent to cause damage or injury to the public or to
any person, or to support any claim or title, or to cause any person to part with
property, or to enter into express or implied contract, or with intent to commit fraud
or that the fraud may be committed, commits forgery. Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019 Section 464 defining "making a false document" is
extracted below :
"464. Making a false document.--A person is said to make a false document or false
electronic record---
First.--Who dishonestly or fraudulently -
(a) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document;
(b) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;
(c) affixes any digital signature on any electronic record;
(d) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the
digital signature, with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or
a part of document, electronic record or digital signature was made, signed, sealed,
executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by
whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed; or
Secondly.--Who, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by
cancellation or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any material
part thereof, after it has been made, executed or affixed with digital Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019 signature either by himself or by any
other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such alternation;
or Thirdly.--Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute
or alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his digital signature on any

Dhanpat Kumar Andother vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 July, 2019
electronic record knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or
intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practised upon him, he does not
know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the
alteration.
The condition precedent for an offence under sections 467 and 471 is forgery. The condition
precedent for forgery is making a false document (or false electronic record or part thereof). This
case does not relate to any false electronic record. Therefore, the question is whether the first
accused, in executing and registering the two sale deeds purporting to sell a property (even if it is
assumed that it did not belong to him), can be said to have made and executed false documents, in
collusion with the other accused.
10. An analysis of section 464 of Penal Code shows that it divides false documents into three
categories:
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019 10.1) The first is where
a person dishonestly or fraudulently makes or executes a document with the
intention of causing it to be believed that such document was made or executed by
some other person, or by the authority of some other person, by whom or by whose
authority he knows it was not made or executed.
10.2) The second is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or
otherwise, alters a document in any material part, without lawful authority, after it
has been made or executed by either himself or any other person.
10.3) The third is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to
sign, execute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of (a)
unsoundness of mind; or (b) intoxication; or (c) deception practised upon him, know
the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration.
11. In short, a person is said to have made a `false document', if (i) he made or
executed a document claiming to be someone else or authorised by someone else; or
(ii) he altered or tampered a document; or (iii) he obtained a document by practicing
deception, or from a person not in control of his senses.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019
12. The sale deeds executed by first appellant, clearly and obviously do not fall under the second and
third categories of 'false documents'. It therefore remains to be seen whether the claim of the
complainant that the execution of sale deeds by the first accused, who was in no way connected with
the land, amounted to committing forgery of the documents with the intention of taking possession
of complainant's land (and that accused 2 to 5 as the purchaser, witness, scribe and stamp vendor
colluded with first accused in execution and registration of the said sale deeds) would bring the case
under the first category. There is a fundamental difference between a person executing a sale deed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62497011/ 4
Dhanpat Kumar Andother vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 July, 2019
claiming that the property conveyed is his property, and a person executing a sale deed by
impersonating the owner or falsely claiming to be authorized or empowered by the owner, to
execute the deed on owner's behalf. When a person executes a document conveying a property
describing it as his, there are two possibilities. The first is that he bona fide believes that the
property actually belongs to him. The second is that he may be dishonestly or fraudulently claiming
it to be his even though he knows that it is not his property. But to fall under first category of 'false
documents', it is Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019 not sufficient that a
document has been made or executed dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a further requirement
that it should have been made with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was
made or executed by, or by the authority of a person, by whom or by whose authority he knows that
it was not made or executed. When a document is executed by a person claiming a property which is
not his, he is not claiming that he is someone else nor is he claiming that he is authorized by
someone else. Therefore, execution of such document (purporting to convey some property of which
he is not the owner) is not execution of a false document as defined under section 464 of the Code. If
what is executed is not a false document, there is no forgery. If there is no forgery, then neither
section 467 nor section 471 of the Code are attracted.
13. Let us now examine whether the ingredients of an offence of cheating are made out. The
essential ingredients of the offence of "cheating" are as follows: (i) deception of a person either by
making a false or misleading representation or by dishonest concealment or by any other act or
omission; (ii) fraudulent or dishonest inducement of that person to either deliver Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019 any property or to consent to the retention thereof by
any person or to intentionally induce that person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he
would not do or omit if he were not so deceived; and
(iii) such act or omission causing or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind,
reputation or property. To constitute an offence under section 420, there should not only be
cheating, but as a consequence of such cheating, the accused should have dishonestly induced the
person deceived: (i) to deliver any property to any person, or (ii) to make, alter or destroy wholly or
in part a valuable security (or anything signed or sealed and which is capable of being converted into
a valuable security).
14. When a sale deed is executed conveying a property claiming ownership thereto, it may be
possible for the purchaser under such sale deed, to allege that the vendor has cheated him by
making a false representation of ownership and fraudulently induced him to part with the sale
consideration. But in this case the complaint is not by the purchaser. On the other hand, the
purchaser is made a co-accused. It is not the case of the complainant that any of the accused tried to
deceive him either by making a false or misleading Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015
dt.02-07-2019 representation or by any other action or omission, nor is it his case that they offered
him any fraudulent or dishonest inducement to deliver any property or to consent to the retention
thereof by any person or to intentionally induce him to do or omit to do anything which he would
not do or omit if he were not so deceived. Nor did the complainant allege that the first appellant
pretended to be the complainant while executing the sale deeds. Therefore, it cannot be said that the
first accused by the act of executing sale deeds in favour of the second accused or the second accused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62497011/ 5
Dhanpat Kumar Andother vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 2 July, 2019
by reason of being the purchaser, or the third, fourth and fifth accused, by reason of being the
witness, scribe and stamp vendor in regard to the sale deeds, deceived the complainant in any
manner. As the ingredients of cheating as stated in section 415 are not found, it cannot be said that
there was an offence punishable under sections 417, 418, 419 or 420 of the Code.
15. When we say that execution of a sale deed by a person, purporting to convey a property which is
not his, as his property, is not making a false document and therefore not forgery, we should not be
understood as holding that such an act can never be a criminal offence. If a person sells a property
knowing that it does not belong to him, and Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015
dt.02-07-2019 thereby defrauds the person who purchased the property, the person defrauded, that
is the purchaser, may complain that the vendor committed the fraudulent act of cheating. But a
third party who is not the purchaser under the deed may not be able to make such complaint. The
term `fraud' is not defined in the Code. The dictionary definition of `fraud' is "deliberate deception,
treachery or cheating intended to gain advantage". Section 17 of the Contract Act, 1872 defines
'fraud' with reference to a party to a contract. In Dr. Vimla vs. Delhi Administration, AIR 1963 SC
1572, this Court explained the meaning of the expression 'defraud' thus "The expression "defraud"
involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other
than economic loss that is, deprivation of property, whether movable or immovable, or of money,
and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or such
others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver
will almost always cause loss or detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a
benefit or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the second condition
is satisfied."
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.13347 of 2015 dt.02-07-2019
10. In view of the settled proposition above, this is not a case wherein the registered sale deed dated
28.12.2013 was created by impersonation or by claiming through some other person, nor it is a case
wherein complainant has been cheated. Even if the transaction was a case of cheating, in fact
petitioner No.1, Dhanpat Kumar, i.e., the purchaser of consideration, has been cheated and he has
not made any complaint against the petitioner No.2, Sukhdev Sharma. The complainant has not
been cheated at all.
11. Therefore, no offence for which cognizance is taken is made out. Accordingly, the impugned
order is set aside and this application stands allowed.
