3. The Respondent/Assessee is a Contractor, who carried out the work of road laying in the Thermal
Power Plant, Rathnagiri, to the tune of Rs.3300 lakhs. The learned Assessing Authority made an
addition of Rs.4,41,08,210/- in the hands of the Assessee on the ground that 14 of the Sub
Contractors to whom the sub contracts were assigned by the Respondent/Assessee/ Contractor were
not produced before the Assessing Authority upon summons being issued to them and thereupon,
disbelieving their existence and the sub contract work carried out by them, the entire payments
made to them were disallowed by the Assessing Authority and they were added back to the income
of the Assessee.
4. On appeal by the Assessee before the learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), the said
addition was restricted to 10% of the total sum of Rs.4,41,08,210/- on the agreement of the Assessee
and thus, relief to the extent of 90% was granted by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals),
which order was upheld by the learned Tribunal by the order impugned before us.
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
5. The following substantial questions of law are suggested in the Memorandum of Appeal filed by
the revenue:-
"(i) Whether the Tribunal was correct in restricting the disallowance to 10% of
expenditure of Rs.4,41,08,210/- incurred towards subcontractors even though the
assessee had failed to prove the identity, credibility and genuineness of the sub
contractors?
(ii) Whether the Tribunal was right in not appreciating the findings of the assessing
officer that the contractors were nonexistent, inexperienced, incompetent and bogus
and the assessee had claimed the said expenditure only to reduce the income and the
tax incidence on the income.
(iii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the liability of the assessee to pay back to
the creditors had not ceased even after 3 years time limit provided under Limitation
Act and thereby holding that no addition can be made on account of cessation
liability u/s 41 (1)?"
6. The relevant findings of the learned Tribunal on the said issue, http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.
7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
including the extract of the order passed by the learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), are
quoted below for ready reference:
"4. On appeal, the CIT(A) has restricted the disallowance to Rs.44,10,821/- as against
the disallowance of Rs.4,41,08,210/- by observing as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119709329/ 2
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Spl Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd on 7 August, 2020
" 6.1.2. I have considered the findings of the assessing officer and also submission
made by the AR of the appellant in the course of appellate proceedings along with the
cited case laws on this issue carefully. It is not disputed that all the 14 persons have
furnished the confirmation and some of the parties in response to the summons
issued to them have furnished the copies of the Income Tax returns and also copies of
the bank accounts. Some of the parties have also confirmed that they do not have
invoice copies and maintain only M. Book which was retained by the assessee i.e
M/s.SPL Infrastructure Private limited. The copy of the M. Book placed before me
give the details of work http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of
2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. done for particular period, measurement up
to date of work done with signature of the supervisor of the company. 11 parties have
sent the details from far of places to the assessing officer through courier. One party
namely M/s.Sakthi Kanna Constructions Private limited appeared before the
assessing officer and the transactions with this party were accepted by the assessing
officer. The letters issued by assessing officer were remain uncomplied with only two
parties. It is also fact that the appellant carried out the sub contract work with EDAC
Engineering limited for laying the road work at the remote places for the purpose of
Thermal Power Plant, JSW Energy (Rathnagiri limited), Nandiwadi Maharashtra
State. For laying out road work man power is necessarily required. There is no
evidence available on the record that the appellant had not executed the road work at
Thermal Power Plant, Rathnagiri. The most of http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.
7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. the labour
contractors were either relatives of the appellant or known to the appellant. The
entire disallowance made by the assessing officer in respective expense debited in the
name 14 parties cannot be accepted without disproving the confirmations received,
disproving the payments made to them beyond doubt, disproving the execution of the
work order. However there is a possibility of the inflation of the expenses in respect
of road work carried out by the appellant as a whole. In the earlier A.Ys, the
department accepted the 5% of the turnover declared by the appellant after detection
of the inflation of the expenses by carrying out survey action. In the year under
consideration, there was increase in GP and Net profit ratio declared by the appellant
as compared to the GP and Net profit ratio declared in the earlier years. However the
net profit declared by the appellant at 3.83% is less than the 5% of the
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Net profit accepted by the department in the earlier years.
The 5% of the Net profit on the turnover of Rs. 3334.16 lacs comes to Rs.166.7 lacs.
The appellant had declared Rs.127.53 lacs as Net profit. The difference comes to
about Rs.39.178 lacs. In the course of the appellant proceedings, the AR of the
appellant had come out to offer 10% of the disallowance of Rs.4,41,08,210.00 which
comes to about Rs.44,10,821.00 on the basis of the decision of the Honorable ITAT,
Chennai B BENCH reported in (2014) 159 TTJ (Chennai) 526 and also on the basis of
the decision of the Honorable Gujarat High Court reported in [2013] 355 TR290
(Guj). In the case cited by the AR of the appellant decided by Chennai B BENCH, the
similar road work was entrusted to two persons namely Sri.N.Erulappan and Sri
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119709329/ 3
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Spl Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd on 7 August, 2020
S.Kesavan by EDAC Engineering limited and the assessing officer recorded the
statement of the two persons http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766
of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. who admitted that they had not carried
out any work of the nature mentioned. In spite of the denial of the work carried out
by Sri N.Erulappan and Sri S.Kesavan, on examination of the facts, the Honorable
tribunal came to conclusion that the entire disallowance made by the assessing
officer cannot be sustained and restricted the disallowance to 25% of the total claim
of Rs. 22.10 crores. The Honorable Gujarat High Court in the case of Bholanath Poli
Fab Pvt. Ltd., reported in [2013] 355 ITR 290 held that tribunal having examined the
evidence on the record came to the conclusion that assessee did purchase cloth and
sell the finished fabrics, as a natural corollary, not the amount covered under such
purchase but the profit element embedded would be subject to tax. In the instant case
the parties have not denied the payments made to them and also have not denied the
work carried out by them. The http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA
766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. existence of the parties and the
payments are also not disproved. The only fact was that the parties have not appeared
before assessing officer for the summons issued to them but have given confirmation
to the assessing officer. Since all the parties are known to the appellant, the appellant
would have taken to the adequate steps for producing before the assessing officer for
examinations. The net profit ratio declared by the appellant in the year under
consideration is also less as compared to the net profit computed by the assessing
officer in the earlier years which was also accepted by the appellant. Looking to the
facts of the case in totality and legal position on this issue, I am convinced that the
offer of the 10% of the total disallowance of Rs.4,41,08,210.00 made by the appellant
during the course of the appellate proceedings as additional income over and above
retuned income is reasonable. The offer of the 10% of http://www.judis.nic.in Order
dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. the total
disallowance would lead to net profit ratio more than 5% of the turnover which was
any way accepted by assessing officer in the earlier years. Therefore, the assessing
officer is directed to restrict the disallowance to Rs. 44,10,821.00 as against the
disallowance of Rs.4,41,08,210.00. The grounds of appeal raised by the appellant on
this issue are treated as disposed off accordingly." . Against the above, the Revenue is
in appeal before us.
5. . We have heard both the parties and perused the material on record. In this case, it
is admitted fact that 14 persons have furnished confirmation and some of the parties
in response to summons issued to them have furnished the copies of income-tax
return and also copies of bank account. Some of the parties also confirmed that they
do not have invoice copies and maintain only Method book which was returned by
the assessee. The copy of M.Book gave details of work done for a particular period,
measurement up to the date of http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA
766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. work with the signature of supervisor
of the company. 11 parties have sent the details from far off places to the Assessing
Officer through courier. However, there was no response from two parties. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119709329/ 4
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Spl Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd on 7 August, 2020
assessee has taken the road laying work and also completed that work. Most of the
payments are not supported by bills issued by the above parties. On the above
reasons, the Assessing Officer disallowed Rs.4,41,08,210/-. However, the CIT(A)
considering the nature of business of the assessee and also chances of inflated
expenses, sustained the disallowance to 10% of above expenditure. As seen from the
fact brought on record that the assessee's total turnover for the assessment year
under consideration is at Rs.3334.16 lakhs against which the assessee declared gross
profit of 14.21% and net profit at 3.83%. When we compare the turnover of gross
profit and net profit of the present assessment year with other assessment years it is
at higher side. This can be seen from the below mentioned http://www.judis.nic.in
Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. table:
Rs. in lakhs Y.E. 31.3.0 31.3.0 31.3.0 31.3.0 31.3.09 31.3.1 Turn over 3133.3 2760.7

it is also admitted fact that the payment to above parties was subject to TDS and paid
by cheques and the assessee has maintained the M. book which is signed by the
sub-contractors. The only discrepancy noticed by the Assessing Officer is that the
payments are not supported by the bills raised by the parties and only self-made
vouchers were maintained by the assessee. In our opinion, considering the nature of
work carried on by the assessee, there is no question of not incurring of expenditure
by the assessee to carry on the road work contracts and the work is mentioned in the
M http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. book maintained by the assessee and counter signed by the
sub contractors. However, there is chances of inflating the expenditure for which the
CIT(A) has, already disallowed 10% of the expenditure claimed by the assessee to the
extent of Rs.4,41,08,210/-. Hence, the contention of the ld. DR that the entire
amount of Rs.4,41,08,210/- is to be disallowed cannot be appreciated as held by the
Tribunal in the case of EDAC Engineering Ltd vs ACIT, 149 ITD 341, wherein held
that if expenditure claimed was not supported by proper evidence and some
deficiency persist in evidence, part expenditure is disallowed on estimated basis.
Being so, by placing reliance on the above decision of the Tribunal, the CIT(A) is
justified in disallowing only 10% of the sub-contract expenses not supported by
proper bills. This ground of the Revenue is dismissed.
6. The next ground is with regard to deletion of addition made u/s 41(1) of the Act as
cessation of liability.
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119709329/ 5
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Spl Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd on 7 August, 2020
7. The facts of this issue are that the Assessing Officer made an addition of
Rs.18,16,728/- towards creditors as they are outstanding for more than three years
and any claim beyond three years is not good in law as per Limitation Act. However,
the CIT(A) observed that there is no cessation of liability as on the date of the
accounts since the assessee has not written off these amounts in its books of account.
According to the CIT(A), Explanation 1 sec. 41(1)(4) also to apply to the facts of this
case. Accordingly, he deleted the addition against which the Revenue is in appeal
before us.
8. We have heard both the parties and perused the material available on record. In
the present case, the Assessing Officer has not issued any notice to the creditors to
confirm from them whether they have given up their dues from the assessee. The
assessee has also not written back these amounts in its books of account. Except for
the fact that the amounts are outstanding, there was no material
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. evidence to show that there was remission or cessation of
liability. It is the Assessing Officer who has presumed that the liability in respect of
these creditors was ceased to exist. Before coming to the conclusion by the Assessing
Officer that the creditors were no more existing, it is incumbent upon the Assessing
Officer to make necessary enquiry to bring on record material that the creditors were
ceased to exist. He could have made necessary enquiry to this effect. The assessee
herein, is a limited company and as per the legal position the acknowledgement of
the liability in favour of the creditors in its Balance Sheet extends the period of
limitation for the purpose of sec.18 of the Limitation Act. It is the assessee's claim
that the debts are subsisting and it continues to be liable to pay the creditors.
Therefore, it is not open to the Assessing Officer to draw the conclusion that the
creditors have remitted the liability or that the liability has otherwise ceased without
evidence or material http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017
CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. when the assessee acknowledges a liability in the
Balance Sheet and Explanation 1 is not applicable. Since the creditors are continued
to be appearing in the Balance Sheet from year to year and the accounts of the
creditors have not been written back, the conclusion of the Assessing Officer that it
was ceased to exist is not proper. Accordingly, in our opinion, the CIT(A) is justified
in deleting the addition made by the Assessing Officer u/s 41(1) of the Act. This view
of our is fortified by the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs
Hotline Electronics Ltd, [2012] 80 CCH 156, and Punjab & Haryana High Court
judgment in the case of CIT vs GP International Ltd, 325 ITR 25. Accordingly, the
deletion made by the CIT(A) is confirmed.
9. In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is dismissed"
7. The learned Senior Standing Counsel Mr.J.Narayanasamy appearing for the Appellant/Revenue
submitted that for want of production of the Sub Contractors before the Assessing Authority, and
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119709329/ 6
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Spl Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd on 7 August, 2020
one of them being 94 years old, the Assessing Authority was justified in believing that the payments
made to those Sub contractors were not the actual expenditure incurred by the respondent/assessee
Contractor and therefore, he was justified in disallowing the same and adding back the same as the
income of the Assessee. He also submitted that though the learned Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) had found that 11 out of these 14 sub contractors had not appeared before the Assessing
Authority but submitted their confirmation forms, the payments made to them tallied with TDS
(Tax Deducted at Source) claimed by the Respondent/Assessee Company. However, since these
persons were not produced before the Assessing Authority, no proper verification could be carried
out by the Assessing Authority for such payments made to them, and merely on the basis of
Measurement Books (M Book) maintained by the Respondent Contractor Company, the allowance
could not be made.
8. Upon the court's question, however, the learned Senior Standing Counsel for the
Appellant/Revenue was unable to satisfy as to how the work, in the absence of sub contractors, was
really carried out by the Respondent/ Assessee Company and why the estimate of the Gross
Profit/Net Profit by the Appellate Authority could not be made, and no satisfactory answer could be
given by the learned http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
counsel for the Revenue.
9. The learned counsel for the Respondent/Assessee, however, submitted that the agreement to the
extent of 10% disallowance was made by the Assessee to buy peace and such disallowance has
definitely given a much better compared result of Net Profit over 5% and a Gross Profit over 10% in
the present assessment year compared to the previous years, which were given in the form of table
by the learned Tribunal in the impugned order extracted above. Therefore, he submitted that the
fact finding Bodies at appellate levels have given proper, cogent and reasonable estimation of profits
in the hands of the contractor Assessee and the said findings do not give rise to any question of law,
much less a substantial question of law, requiring consideration by this Court.
10. On the other issue of disallowance under Section 41(1) of the Act to the extent of Rs.18,16,728/-,
the relief has been given by both the Appellate Authorities also, giving their findings, as they found
that the amount in question did not become bad merely on expiry of three years of limitation and
there was no cessation of liability in the hands of the Assessee.
11. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the clear opinion that the impugned
order of the learned Tribunal does http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017
CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
not give rise to any question of law much less a substantial question of law.
12. A bare perusal of the compared results of the Gross Profit and Net Profit by the Assessee given in
para 7 of the Tribunal's order clearly shows that the said Gross Profit at the rate of 14.21% and Net
Profit at the rate of 3.83% declared by the Assessee, with the addition of 10% agreed by the Assessee
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119709329/ 7
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Spl Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd on 7 August, 2020
before the learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), resulted in a much better result of
profits declared by the Assessee in the present Assessment Year viz., A.Y.2010-11 as compared to the
previous years. The Net Profit rate in the previous three years was less than 3%, whereas the
Assessee himself declared the net profit at the rate of 3.83% before the aforesaid addition of 10% of
Rs.4,41,08,210/-. Therefore, the estimation of profit by the Appellate Authorities even on the
premise taken by the Assessing Authority that some of the sub contractors could not be produced
before the Assessing Authority, does not result in any perversity in the findings of the learned
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well as the learned Tribunal.
13. It is well known that where the books of accounts maintained by the contractors are not accepted
by the Department, the estimation of profit made on the basis of history of Gross Profit rate and Net
Profit http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd.
rate of the Assessee in the previous years or comparable cases of contractors can be made. Once
such profit rates are compared, the additions on account of non confirmation or non production of
the sub contractors, etc. is totally irrelevant and cannot be made.
14. In the hierarchy of the fact finding bodies created under the Income Tax Act, obviously the
findings of the Assessing Authority stand superseded for all purposes, by the findings of the higher
appellate authorities. Unless glaring perversity in the findings of the appellate authorities are
pointed out and established by the Revenue in the Appeals filed by them under Section 260A of the
Act, there is nothing for the High Court or Constitutional Courts to do in such matters. The findings
of fact arrived at by the Authorities below are binding on the High Court under Section 260A of the
Act, unless the perversity as aforesaid is clearly visible, established and proved.
15. As aforesaid, as against the perversity in these findings, we see a better taxable income finally
taxed in the hands of the Assessee, albeit with the agreement to disallowance to the extent of 10% of
the payments made to the sub contractors, which the Assessee appears to have agreed under the
compulsion of circumstances to avoid litigation and to buy peace.
16. In fact, the results declared by the Assessee of the net profit http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.
7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
rate at the rate of 3.83% was much better as compared to previous three years and only marginally
less than the previous two years of 2005-06 and 2006-07, which were at the rate of 4.20% and
3.94%. In these circumstances, no disallowance was called for. Still, if the Assessee agreed to such
addition to apparently buy peace with the Department, we fail to understand as to why the Revenue
has filed these Appeals to drag cases further in the High Court incurring the loss of man hours and
cost of litigation. Such unnecessary litigation on the part of the Revenue Authorities deserves to be
strongly deprecated, but, the Revenue Authorities do not seem to be seeing the sense behind this
and keep on filing Appeals under Section 260A of the Act, as a matter of routine.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119709329/ 8
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S.Spl Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd on 7 August, 2020
17. Though the provisions of Section 260A of the Act are intended only to settle the substantial
questions of law arising from the order of the Tribunal, such appeals, against the pure findings of
facts, are also filed in an absolutely reckless manner. We strongly deprecate this practice of the
Revenue Authorities, as there seems to be no application of mind by the higher Authorities in
sanctioning filing of these appeals before the High Court. We would have imposed exemplary costs
in the present case also to compensate the Respondent/Assessee, who had to incur such litigation
expenditure at http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
all the levels of appellate forums, three in number, beyond the Assessing Authority, viz., before
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and before the
High Court. However, we are not imposing the said costs with a clear warning to the Revenue
Authorities in this regard. They should, as responsible Authorities, try to give quietus to litigation
instead of mindlessly increasing the same before the Constitutional Courts. Even to dismiss such
frivolous appeals, the precious time of the court is taken. In the present case itself, during Covid
times, when we are hearing urgent matters through Video Conferencing, such matters are brought
before us to be heard at least for an hour and then to pass such a detailed order.
18. We expect and have a sanguine hope that the Revenue Authorities will see the absence of
reasonableness in filing such Appeals in future. On the one hand, the Central Board of Direct Taxes
keeps on issuing of litigation policies and as of now, the latest CBDT instructions talks of withdrawal
of Appeals with Revenue stake of less than Rupees One Crore. On the other hand, by such arbitrary
additions made by the Assessing Authority, merely because the Revenue's stake may be more than
Rupees One Crore for the Revenue Department, the validity of substantial question of law arising in
the matter ought to http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt. 7.8.2020 in TCA 766 of 2017 CIT v. SPL
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
have been examined by the responsible authorities of the Revenue Department, before filing such
Appeals before this Court.
19. In these circumstances, while not imposing the cost on the Appellant/Revenue with the hope
that they will not file such unnecessary Appeals in future, we dismiss this Appeal in favour of the
Respondent/ Assessee, while holding that no question of law arises in the present Appeal at all. No
costs.
20. Registry is directed to send a copy of this order to the Chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes
(CBDT), New Delhi, and to the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, New Delhi and
also to the President, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, for information and needful.
