d. issue such other order or directions as this Hon'ble Court deems fit under the

6. In all the above matters, a private complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C., read with Section 138 and
141 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, 'N.I.Act') came to be filed against the petitioner
herein on the allegation that the petitioner had borrowed certain money from the complainant,
which was not repaid and the cheque which had been issued thereto had got dishonoured with a
remark 'account blocked'. It is aggrieved by the same that the petitioner is before this Court.
7. The submission of Sri.G.S.Venkat Subba Rao, learned counsel for the petitioner is that:
7.1. The petitioner, though described as a proprietary concern, the said proprietary
concern has not been specifically made a party and the petitioner has been made a
party by describing him as a proprietor of Venkateshwara Stone Crushers. In essence,
the submission is that both Venkateshwara Stone Crushers as a proprietary concern
and the petitioner H.N.Nagaraja were required to be
- 10 -
arrayed as separate accused. Non-arraying of the proprietary concern separately as an accused goes
to the root of the matter is contrary to Section 141 of N.I.Act and is therefore requiring the complaint
which had been filed to be quashed.
7.2. In this regard, he relies upon the decision of the Panjab and Haryana High Court in the case of
SARDAR BUPENDER SINGH VS. M/S.GREEN FEEDS THROUGH ITS PARTNER VIPIN KUMAR
dated 26.08.20221 more particularly Paras 12, 13 and 17 thereof, which are reproduced hereunder
for easy reference:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119531201/ 7
Sri H.N.Nagaraj vs Smt S.Priya Soliwal on 21 September, 2022
12. Clause (a) of the explanation as occurs in Section 141 of 'the Act' describes, a
'Company' to not only include any corporate body, but also makes a firm, or, other
association of individuals, to become included within the realm of statutory coinage
'Company', and, besides when clause (b) thereof, when defines a 'Director', it makes
the said statutory phrase, 1 CRM-M-54111/2021
- 11 -
to in relation to a firm, to also include a partner in a firm.
13. If so, when the statutory signification assigned to a 'Company', does visibly cover not only any
corporate body, but also covers a firm, or other association of individuals, therefore, not only a
corporate entity either private, or, public limited becomes a Company', for the purpose of
application thereon of Section 141 of 'the Act', but also a firm, or, other association of individuals, do
also, become covered by Section 141 of 'the Act', besides a partner in a firm when is given the colour
of a Director of a firm, also does become covered for the relevant purpose.
17. In consequence, there is merit in the petition, and, the same is allowed, and, the complaint
bearing No.467 dated 30.01.2019 under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, titled as
'M/s Green Feeds V/s. Sardar Bhupinder Singh' (Annexure P-1), as well as, the summoning order
dated 05.08.2019 (Annexure P-2), both are quashed and set aside.
7.3. The second submission insofar as Crl.P No.8257/2019, Crl.P No.8235/2019, Crl.P
No.8262/2019 and Crl.P No.8279/2019 are concerned is that the sworn statement of the Special
Power Attorney holder of the complainant was recorded on which basis the
- 12 -
cognizance was taken and the same cannot be so done and the same is contrary to the decision of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of A.C.NARAYANAN VS. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND
ANOTHER2 more particularly Paras 31 and 33 thereof which are reproduced hereunder for easy
reference:-
31. In view of the discussion, we are of the opinion that the attorney holder cannot
file a complaint in his own name as if he was the complainant, but he can initiate
criminal proceedings on behalf of his principal. We also reiterate that where the
payee is a proprietary concern, the complaint can be filed
(i) by the proprietor of the proprietary concern, describing himself as the sole
proprietor of the "payee";
(ii) the proprietary concern, describing itself as a sole proprietary concern, represented by its sole
proprietor; and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119531201/ 8
Sri H.N.Nagaraj vs Smt S.Priya Soliwal on 21 September, 2022
(iii) the proprietor or the proprietary concern represented by the attorney holder under a power of
attorney executed by the sole proprietor.
33. While holding that there is no serious conflict between the decisions in MMTC (supra) and Janki
(2014) 11 SCC 790
- 13 -
Vashdeo Bhojwani (supra), we clarify the position and answer the questions in the following
manner:
33.1 Filing of complaint petition under Section 138 of N.I Act through power of
attorney is perfectly legal and competent.
33.2 The Power of Attorney holder can depose and verify on oath before the Court in
order to prove the contents of the complaint. However, the power of attorney holder
must have witnessed the transaction as an agent of the payee/holder in due course or
possess due knowledge regarding the said transactions.
33.3 It is required by the complainant to make specific assertion as to the knowledge
of the power of attorney holder in the said transaction explicitly in the complaint and
the power of attorney holder who has no knowledge regarding the transactions
cannot be examined as a witness in the case.
33.4 In the light of section 145 of N.I Act, it is open to the Magistrate to rely upon the
verification in the form of affidavit filed by the complainant in support of the
complaint under Section 138 of the N.I Act and the Magistrate is neither mandatorily
obliged to call upon the complainant to remain present before the Court, nor to
examine the complainant of his witness upon oath for taking the decision whether or
not to issue process on the complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.
33.5 The functions under the general power of attorney cannot be delegated to
another person without specific clause permitting the same in the power of attorney.
Nevertheless, the general
- 14 -
power of attorney itself can be cancelled and be given to another person.
7.4. By relying upon the said decision, the submission is that a complaint under Section 138 of
N.I.Act can be filed through a power of attorney holder but the name of the complaint has to be that
of the complainant itself. 7.5. The power of attorney holder must have actually witnessed the
transaction as an agent of the payee/holder in due course or possess due knowledge regarding the
said transaction. In the present case, the SPA holder not possessing such knowledge could not have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119531201/ 9
Sri H.N.Nagaraj vs Smt S.Priya Soliwal on 21 September, 2022
been examined at the time of recording the sworn statement. The power of attorney not having
complied with the requirements of the dicta laid down by the Apex Court in
- 15 -
A.C.Narayanan's case2, the sworn statement recorded cannot be considered and cognizance could
not have been taken. On both the above grounds, he submits that the above petitions are required to
be allowed and proceedings required to be quashed.
8. Per contra, Ms.Neha Shetty, learned counsel for the respondent would submit that:
8.1. Section 141 of N.I.Act would apply insofar as a company is concerned. The same
has no applicability to a proprietary concern. A proprietor and a proprietary concern
are one and the same. There being no registration or perpetual seal of succession
insofar as the proprietary concern is concerned, they have no separate existence and
there could not be arrayed as two different parties.
- 16 -
8.2. As regards the power of attorney, she submits that he has categorically averred in the complaint
when filed that he is the son and special power of attorney holder of the Proprietor and is aware of
the facts of the matter and he would be deposing to the matter. The necessary averments having
been made it is in compliance with the decision of A.C.Narayanan's case2. On this basis, she submits
that the petition is required to be dismissed.
9. Heard Sri.G.S.Venkat Subbarao, learned counsel for the petitioner and Ms.Neha Shetty, learned
counsel for respondent and perused papers.
10. The points that would arise for determination by this Court are:
- 17 -
1) Whether a proprietary concern is required to be arrayed as a separate party in a
proceeding under Section 138 of N.I.Act?
2) Whether the sworn statement of the Special Power of Attorney holder could be
recorded in a proceeding under Section 138 of N.I.Act?
3) What order?
11. Answer to Point No.1: Whether a proprietary concern is required to be arrayed as a separate
party in a proceeding under Section 138 of N.I.Act? 11.1. The facts relating to each of the complaint,
cheque numbers, date of dishonour etc., are not relevant for the purpose of these matters. 11.2. The
submission of Sri.Venkat Subba Rao by relying upon the decision in Sardar Bhupinder Singh1 is that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119531201/ 10
Sri H.N.Nagaraj vs Smt S.Priya Soliwal on 21 September, 2022
the proprietary concern is a separate entity and as such, ought to have been arrayed as a separate
accused. 11.3. Section 141 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 reads as under:
- 18 -
141. Offences by companies. --
(1) If the person committing an offence under section 138 is a company, every person
who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to
the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against
and punished accordingly:
PROVIDED that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any person liable
to punishment if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge, or
that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence:
[PROVIDED FURTHER that where a person is nominated as a Director of a company
by virtue of his holding any office or employment in the Central Government or State
Government or a financial corporation owned or controlled by the Central
Government or the State Government, as the case may be, he shall not be liable for
prosecution under this Chapter.] (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in
sub-section (1), where any offence under this Act has been committed by a company
and it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or connivance
of, or is attributable to, any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or
other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall
also be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against
and punished accordingly.
- 19 -
Explanation.-- For the purposes of this section,--
(a) "company" means any body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals;
and
(b) "director", in relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm.] 11.4. The said provision relates to
offences by Companies. A reading of the entire provision does not indicate the applicability of the
same to a proprietary concern though it indicates that it would apply to a company, firm or
association of individuals. The requirement of Section 141 of N.I.Act has arisen on account of a
company being a corporal entity, a firm being either registered or unregistered comprising of two or
more partners and an association of individuals also comprising of two or more individuals. Thus, in
all the three situations, there would be more than two or more people who could be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119531201/ 11
Sri H.N.Nagaraj vs Smt S.Priya Soliwal on 21 September, 2022
- 20 -
incharge of the affairs of the business of the company, firm or association of individuals and it is
therefore required for the complainant to make specific allegations as regards each such person so
as to invoke the criminal process. 11.5. Insofar as a proprietary concern is concerned, as the name
indicates there can only be one proprietor and it is the said proprietor who would be incharge of the
affairs of the proprietary concern. Thus, it is not required for any pleading to be made as regards
who is the person in charge of a proprietary concern when there is only one proprietor. I am unable
to agree with the decision of the Hon'ble Panjab and Haryana High Court in the case of SARDAR
BUPENDER SINGH1 where the definition of a company has been extended to a proprietary
- 21 -
concern to contend that the proprietary concern has a separate and independent existence. In my
considered opinion a proprietary concern cannot have any independent or separate existence dehors
the proprietor thereof. 11.6. In view thereof, I answer point no.1 by holding that in a proceeding
under Section 138 of N.I.Act, the arraying of a proprietor as an accused or a proprietary concern
represented by the proprietor would be sufficient compliance with the requirements under Section
138 of N.I.Act, the proprietor and the proprietary concerareis not required to be separately arrayed
as a party accused.
12. Answer to Point No.2: Whether the sworn statement of the Special Power of Attorney holder
could be recorded in a proceeding under Section 138 of N.I.Act?
- 22 -
12.1. Para 33 of the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in A.C.Narayanan's2 case has been
reproduced hereinabove.
12.2. In terms of Para 33.1 of A.C.Narayanan's2 case, it is clear that a complaint under Section 138 of
N.I.Act can be filed through a power of attorney. In the present case, the compliant has been filed by
a Special Power of Attorney, which is sufficient compliance. 12.3. In terms of para 33.2 of
A.C.Narayanan's2 case, a power of attorney could depose and verify on oath and prove the contents
of the complaint which has been done.
12.4. The power of attorney holder being a witness to the transaction as an agent is a matter which
has been averred in the complaint but the
- 23 -
veracity of the same would always be subject to cross-examination in the proceedings. In the event
of the accused being able to establish that the power of attorney does not know the transactions
and/or that the deposition given is not correct or false, the accused could always succeed in the said
mater. At the stage of filing of an affidavit or recordal of sworn statement it cannot be said or

decided as to whether the power of attorney is aware of or not of the transactions.
12.5. In terms of para 33.3 of A.C.Narayanan's2 case, what is required is for a specific assertion to be
made that the power of attorney is aware of the transactions. In the present case, such an assertion
has been made. Be that as it may, during the course of cross-examination if it is
- 24 -
established that the power of attorney holder has no knowledge regarding the transaction, then the
complaint itself would fail and it is the risk which has been taken by the complainant by appointing
power of attorney holder. 12.6. In view of the above, I answer Point No.2 by holding that a power of
attorney could file a complaint, could depose to an affidavit as also record his sworn statement in a
proceedings under Section 138 of N.I.Act.
13. Answer to Point No.3: What order?
13.1. The two contentions which have been addressed by Sri.Venkat Subbarao, learned counsel for
the petitioner being dealt with hereinabove, those two grounds not being sufficient for exercise of
powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. I am of the considered opinion that the petitions not making any
grounds
- 25 -
are required to be dismissed and as such Criminal Petitions are dismissed.
