Sri Krupa Sagar Patil &
Sri B.R.Patil, Advocates for C/R2)
This Writ Petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227
of the Constitution of India praying to set aside the
impugned judgment and order dated 20.12.2019 passed in
Application No.6785/2019 by the Hon'ble Karnataka State
Administrative Tribunal, Kalaburagi (Annexure-A) and
consequently allow the said Application No.6785/2019 filed
by the petitioner before the Hon'ble Karnataka State
Administrative Tribunal as prayed for by him.
This writ petition having been heard and reserved
for orders on 07.02.2020, this day Nagaprasanna J.,
made the following:
ORDER
The instant writ petition assails the order dated 20.12.2019 passed by the Karnataka State
Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the 'Tribunal' for short), Kalaburagi, in
application No.6785 of 2019, whereby the Tribunal dismissed the application filed by the
petitioner-applicant challenging his order of transfer and posting.
2. Shorn of unnecessary details, the skeletal material facts necessary for appreciation of the
controversy are as follows:
The petitioner and the 2nd respondent, are both employees of the Department of
Public Works, Water Resources and Inland Water Transport. By a notification, dated
8.11.2019, the petitioner, who was in the cadre of Executive Engineer, was placed on
independent charge under Rule 32 of Karnataka Civil Service Rules, (for short
'KCSR'), in the cadre of Superintending Engineer. The name of the petitioner was
found at Sl. No.34 in the said list. The Government, while placing the petitioner on
independent charge under Rule 32 of the KCSR, posted him as Superintending
Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, in place of the 2nd respondent.

Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
3. On the same day, by a separate notification, the 2nd respondent, who was working as
Superintending Engineer at PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, was transferred without a posting and was
directed to report to the Water Resources Department. Both the above mentioned notifications had
the prior approval of the Hon'ble Chief Minister.
4. On the same day, yet again, by another notification, the posting of the petitioner as
Superintending Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, was kept in abeyance. This was challenged by the
petitioner before the Tribunal in application No.6785 of 2019. The Tribunal, while entertaining the
application, by way of an interim order, permitted the petitioner to report to duties. On the strength
of the interim order granted by the Tribunal, the petitioner assumed charge of the post on 11.11.2019
(Annexure-A7). Finally, the Tribunal, by its order dated 20.12.2019, held that the petitioner, being
an Officer under Rule 32 of KCSR, could not disturb the 2nd respondent who was the regular
appointee to the post of Superintendent Engineer, and dismissed the application. Aggrieved by the
order dated 20.12.2019, the petitioner-applicant before the Tribunal has filed the instant writ
petition.
5. We have heard Sri M.S. Bhagwath for Sri Ravi B. Patil and Sri Pruthveesh M.H., learned Counsels
appearing for the petitioner, Sri I. Taranath Poojari, learned Additional Government Advocate
appearing for respondent No.1 and Sri D.L. Jagadeesh, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
caveator-respondent No.2.
6. The facts that are not in dispute are that the petitioner, who is in a substantive cadre of Executive
Engineer, on his independent charge arrangement under Rule 32 of KCSR was posted to the place of
the 2nd respondent, namely Superintending Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi. On the same day,
two other notifications were issued, the first notification was posting the 2nd respondent who was
working as Superintending Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, to go and report to the Water
Resources Department and no place was shown to the 2nd respondent. Another notification, the
order of posting the petitioner was kept in abeyance. The petitioner challenged the notification,
insofar as it pertains to keeping his transfer and posting in abeyance, before the Tribunal in
application No.6785 of 2019. The Tribunal by its order dated 9.11.2019, directed the petitioner to
take charge of the post. In terms of the interim order granted by the Tribunal, the petitioner took
charge of the post of Superintending Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi on 11.11.2019. The Tribunal,
after hearing the parties and considering the material available on record, dismissed the application
by order dated 20.12.2019.
7. Learned Counsel for the petitioner would contend that the notification of transfer and posting
being kept in abeyance is contrary to the guidelines and mala fide, as there is no reason assigned to
keep the said notification in abeyance. The notification dated 8.11.2019 (Annexure-A9) is contrary to
the guidelines inasmuch as it does not bear the prior approval of the Hon'ble Chief Minister. The
learned Counsel further contends that the 2nd respondent has been in Kalaburagi close to ten years,
and in the present place of posting, for more than three years two months.
8. It is the further contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the 2nd respondent who
was working as Superintending Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, from 18.11.2016 has completed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 3
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
his minimum tenure, stipulated under the guidelines which is two years and he cannot have any
grievance as to which officer replaces him, be it an officer under Rule 32 of KCSR.
9. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate would contend that the posting of the
petitioner to the place of the 2nd respondent was erroneous as the post was not vacant. When the
notification of the transfer was made, the 2nd respondent was still holding the post and when he
was still holding the post, the petitioner who was an officer under Rule 32 of the KCSR could not be
posted to the place of the 2nd respondent, as the petitioner can be posted only to a vacant post. It is
his submission that in the entire notification dated 08.11.2019, the only officer who has given
posting to a particular place which was not vacant is the petitioner. The entire list does not contain
the posting of any Officer to replace anybody and it was a mistake in the case of the petitioner. It is
for that reason, the posting of the petitioner was kept in abeyance on the very same day and the
petitioner does not have any right to contend that the order keeping the notification in abeyance is
contrary to the guidelines as his posting was not even a transfer.
10. The learned Additional Government Advocate would further contend that in the light of
judgment of the Raghuram Shetty, the posting of an Officer under Rule 32 of the KCSR to a post
which is not vacant would become contrary to law. Hence, the order of transfer was kept in
abeyance.
11. Learned Counsel for the 2nd respondent, while adopting the submissions made by the learned
Additional Government Advocate, would submit that merely because the 2nd respondent has
completed his tenure, would not lead to a situation where he must be transferred. It was within the
power of the Government to keep the transfer in abeyance and continue the 2nd respondent in the
post. He would further assert that the order keeping the notification in abeyance is approved by the
Hon'ble Chief Minister. It is the further contention of the learned Counsel for the 2nd respondent
that pursuant to the order of the Tribunal, the petitioner herein is given the posting on 23.12.2019 as
Superintending Engineer (Designs), PWD, Kalaburagi and he has neither questioned the order nor
obeyed it by reporting to duties.
12. We have given our anxious consideration to the contentions advanced by all the learned counsel
and have perused the original file pertaining to the transfer and posting of the petitioner and the
2nd respondent in terms of which, the following points arise for our consideration:
1. Whether the transfer and posting and its subsequent order keeping it in abeyance
are contrary to the guidelines and vitiated by malafides?
2. Whether the petitioner who is an officer under Rule 32 of KCSR can be posted to a
post which is held by a regular appointee?
3. Whether the transfer and posting of both the petitioner and the 2nd respondent
are vitiated by bringing political influence?
Point No.1:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 4
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
13. The petitioner was posted as Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle by an order dated
08.11.2019, it was a composite order of transfer of 78 officers being given independent charge under
Rule 32 of the KCSR and consequently posting them to various places. The name of the petitioner is
found at Sl.No.34 in the said list and he was posted as Superintendent Engineer in place of the 2nd
respondent. On the very same day, another order was made transferring the 2nd respondent who
was holding the post of Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi to report to Water
Resource Department for further posting. The action of the State Government did not stop there, by
yet another notification on the same day i.e. on 08.11.2019, promotion, transfer and posting of the
petitioner to the place of the 2nd respondent was kept in abeyance. From a perusal of the file, it is
indicative of the fact that the first two notifications namely, the composite order of transfer and the
transfer of the 2nd respondent to report to the Water Resources Department had the prior approval
of the Hon'ble Chief Minister, the third notification of dated 08.11.2019 does not have the prior
approval of the Hon'ble Chief Minister.
14. The third notification namely, keeping the order of the transfer and posting of the petitioner to
the place of the 2nd respondent in abeyance does not indicate any reason whatsoever, either in the
notification or in the original file. The reasons ought to have been indicated in the light of the fact
that out of the 78 officers who were promoted and transferred, a solitary case of the petitioner is
kept in abeyance, which would clearly indicate, malice in law and suffers from want of bonafides, as
without there being any compelling reason or administrative exigency, the transfer and posting of
the petitioner to the place of the 2nd respondent could not have been kept in abeyance.
15. The contention of the petitioner that the order keeping it in abeyance is premature is
unacceptable to us as the petitioner was not issued the movement order or did not assume charge of
the post on 08.11.2019 pursuant to the notification, as on the very day, the order was kept in
abeyance. The petitioner assumed the charge of the posting at PWD Circle, Kalaburagi on the
strength of an interim order granted by the Tribunal. The assumption of the charge of the petitioner
on 11.11.2019 cannot be said to be an assumption of charge without judicial intervention. Ultimately
the application filed by the petitioner came to be dismissed by the Tribunal. It cannot be held that
the notification keeping the posting of the petitioner in abeyance is premature and contrary to
clause 9 of the guidelines. The notification impugned cannot be said to be vitiated on this ground.
16. Thus, notification keeping the transfer and posting of the petitioner in abeyance is vitiated on
account of want of reasons and not on any other ground. Hence, we answer point number one
accordingly.
Point No.2
17. It is germane to notice Rule 32 of the KCSR which reads thus:
"32. Instead of appointing a Government servant to officiate, it is also permissible to
appoint him to be in charge of the current duties of a vacant post. In such a case, a
"charge allowance" (additional pay) is payable as specified in Rule 68."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 5
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
In terms of the afore-extracted Rule, it is permissible to the government to appoint a government
servant to officiate in a vacant post. Note 1 to the said Rule reads thus:
"A Government servant can be appointed under this Rule to be in-charge of the current duties of a
vacant post only if he is eligible to be promoted to officiate in that post according to the Cadre and
Recruitment Rules applicable to that post or if he is holding a post in an equivalent or higher grade."
18. In the case on hand, the petitioner who was placed on independent charge under Rule 32 of the
KCSR is posted to the place of the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent did not choose to challenge
it, as on the very same day, the order was kept in abeyance. To consider this point, the service of the
2nd respondent at Kalaburagi is required to be noticed.
Service particulars of the 2nd respondent from 9.7.2010 Sl. Place of Working Duration No.
1. Superintending Engineer, PWD From 09.07.2010 Circle, Kalaburagi to 11.12.2011
2. Superintending Engineer, Minor From 12.12.2011 Irrigation Circle, Kalaburagi to 18.11.2016
3. Superintending Engineer, PWD From 18.11.2016 Circle, Kalaburagi till the petitioner has taken
charge of the post.
19. In terms of the service of the 2nd respondent at Kalaburagi, as tabulated herein above, it is seen
that the 2nd respondent worked in the same post from 09.07.2010 to 11.12.2011 and was posted as
Superintendent Engineer, Minor Irrigation Circle, Kalaburagi from 12.12.2011 to 18.11.2016 and
from 18.11.2016 goes back to the same place i.e. Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, and is
functioning in the said post since 18.11.2016, which was over and above three years on the date of
passage of the impugned order. Under the operative guidelines regulating transfer of Government
servant in the State of Karnataka, the minimum tenure prescribed for Group-A post is two years and
the 2nd respondent had completed two years long ago. Thus, on completion of two years, the 2nd
respondent cannot have any grievance with regard to an officer under Rule 32 of the KCSR replacing
him. It would not be violative of the law laid down by the learned Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Raghuram Shetty. Once an officer completes his tenure, unless, the said person who replaces
him is ineligible to hold the post under the Cadre and Recruitment Rules, it is only then,
notwithstanding completion of tenure the person holding the post could have any grievance. In the
instant case, the 2nd respondent has been in Kalaburagi for the last 10 years and in the present
place namely Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi for the last three years and two
months.
20. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajendra Singh and Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh
and Others reported in (2009) 15 Supreme Court Cases 178 has held that transfer being an incidence
of service no person can claim that he or she to be posted on a particular place, unless the transfer is
contrary to the statute or malafide. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed at paragraph Nos.8, 9
and 10 which read as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 6
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
"8. A government servant has no vested right to remain posted at a place of his choice
nor can he insist that he must be posted at one place or the other. He is liable to be
transferred in the administrative exigencies from one place to the other. Transfer of
an employee is not only an incident inherent in the terms of appointment but also
implicit as an essential condition of service in the absence of any specific indication to
the contrary. No Government can function if the government servant insists that once
appointed or posted in a particular place or position, he should continue in such
place or position as long as he desires (see State of U.P. v. Gobardhan Lal [(2004) 11
SCC 402 : 2005 SCC (L&S) 55] , SCC p. 406, para 7).
9. The courts are always reluctant in interfering with the transfer of an employee
unless such transfer is vitiated by violation of some statutory provisions or suffers
from mala fides. In Shilpi Bose v. State of Bihar] this Court held: (SCC p. 661, para 4)
"4. In our opinion, the courts should not interfere with a transfer order which is made
in public interest and for administrative reasons unless the transfer orders are made
in violation of any mandatory statutory rule or on the ground of mala fide. A
government servant holding a transferable post has no vested right to remain posted
at one place or the other, he is liable to be transferred from one place to the other.
Transfer orders issued by the competent authority do not violate any of his legal
rights. Even if a transfer order is passed in violation of executive instructions or
orders, the courts ordinarily should not interfere with the order instead affected party
should approach the higher authorities in the department. If the courts continue to
interfere with day-to-day transfer orders issued by the government and its
subordinate authorities, there will be complete chaos in the administration which
would not be conducive to public interest. The High Court overlooked these aspects
in interfering with the transfer orders."
10. In N.K. Singh v. Union of India this Court reiterated that: (SCC p. 103, para 6) "6. ... the scope of
judicial review in matters of transfer of a government servant to an equivalent post without any
adverse consequence on the service or career prospects is very limited being confined only to the
grounds of mala fides and violation of any specific provision...."
21. In terms of the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the petitioner or the 2nd respondent
cannot be said to be claiming that they should work in a particular post. More so, the 2nd
respondent as he has completed his minimum tenure under the operative guidelines.
22. Insofar as the judgment relied on by 2nd respondent, the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in
W.P.No.14393 of 2012 (S-KAT) in the case of Raghurama Shetty and Ors. vs. State and Ors., has
held as follows:
"3. The learned Counsel for the petitioner assailing the impugned order contended
that admittedly when an order is made under rule 32 of the Rules posting should be
to a vacant post. Therefore, the second respondent could not have been posted to a
post which is held by the petitioner and as such the said order is illegal. That apart,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 7
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
the authority who has passed the order was not competent to pass the said order.
These two aspects have not been considered by the Tribunal and has proceeded on
the assumption that the petitioner was on deputation and he had completed 3 years
of service and he had no substantive right. Therefore, the impugned order came to be
passed, which is patently illegal and requires to be set aside."
23. It is germane to notice that the said judgment of the Division Bench came to be distinguished in
a subsequent judgment by the learned Division Bench of this Court in W.P.No.44916 of 2014
(S-KAT) in the case of B.Madesh Vs. State of Karnataka wherein the learned Division Bench has held
as follows:
"17. It is true that the posting of the petitioner as Deputy Commissioner of Excise,
Bangalore West vide transfer order 01.09.2014 is under Rule 32 of the KCSR but the
said posting is done after assessing not only the eligibility of petitioner but also the
suitability, by the Departmental Promotion Committee constituted by the
Government.
Though transfer order dated 01.09.2014 cannot be considered as an order of
promotion, it can be certainly said that Government has taken into consideration all
W.P.No.44916/2014 relevant criteria before posting eligible officers found in the
seniority list with independent charge of the post of Deputy Commissioners of Excise.
If respondent No.3 had not completed one year of service as Deputy Commissioner of
Excise, Bangalore West, it would have been certainly contrary to guidelines. His
posting is on the basis of his completion of more than one year service as Deputy
Commissioner of Excise, Bangalore West and therefore, his transfer is in accordance
with the guidelines framed by the Government vide order dated 20.05.2014.
18. The facts in Raghurama Shetty's case are distinguishable vis-à-vis facts of the
present case. The Tribunal has misapplied the decision rendered in Raghurama
Shetty's case to the facts of the present case. It has proceeded on a wrong
W.P.No.44916/2014 assumption that the petitioner's posting is purely under Rule 32
of KCSR that too against the post which is not vacant. Hence, we are inclined to
interfere with the order passed by the KAT."
(emphasis supplied)
24. Thus, the learned Division Bench which subsequently considered Raghuram Shetty's case has
clearly held that the question whether an officer under Rule 32 of the KCSR can replace a regular
officer holding a regular post would arise being only if the officer holding the place on regular basis
has not completed his minimum tenure. In the instant case, the 2nd respondent had completed his
minimum tenure and the order of transfer was issued, the law declared in B. Madhesha's case is
applicable to the fact situation and not the one declared in Raghuram Shetty's case. Hence, we hold
that the transfer and posting of the petitioner who is officer under Rule 32 of the KCSR to the post of
the 2nd respondent who was regularly holding the post did not vitiate the transfer and posting of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 8
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
petitioner qua the 2nd respondent. Hence, we answer point No.2 accordingly.
Point No.3
25. On a perusal of the original file, concerning the transfer and posting of both the petitioner and
the 2nd respondent, it is seen that there are several letters given by the elected representatives both
in favour of the petitioner and the 2nd respondent. It is seen that two elected representatives, one of
Kalaburagi Rural constituency has addressed letters both to the Deputy Chief Minister and Secretary
to the PWD. The MLA of Kalaburagi, Dakshina constituency has also addressed letters to the Deputy
Chief Minister and Secretary to PWD. All these four letters were written on 8.11.2019 that is the date
on which the 2nd respondent was transferred and directed to report to the Water Resources
Department.
26. Letters in favour of the 2nd respondent read as follows.

29. The aforementioned letters of the political representatives and the Minister, in favour of both
the petitioner and the 2nd respondent would indicate that political interference in the matters of
transfer or political pressure was brought in both by the petitioner and the 2nd respondent. Learned
Additional Government Advocate appearing for the 1st respondent and learned counsel appearing
for the 2nd respondent have placed before us the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Mohd. Masood Ahmad vs. State of U.P. And Others reported in 2007(8) SCC 150 and refer to
paragraphs 7 and 8, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:
" 7. The scope of judicial review of transfer under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India has been settled by the Supreme Court in Rajendra Roy v. Union of India
[(1993) 1 SCC 148 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 138 : (1993) 23 ATC 426 : AIR 1993 SC 1236] ,
National Hydroelectric Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Shri Bhagwan [(2001) 8 SCC 574 : 2002
SCC (L&S) 21 : AIR 2001 SC 3309] , State Bank of India v. Anjan Sanyal [(2001) 5
SCC 508 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 858 : AIR 2001 SC 1748] . Following the aforesaid
principles laid down by the Supreme Court, the Allahabad High Court in Vijay Pal
Singh v. State of U.P. [(1997) 3 ESC 1668 : 1998 All LJ 70] and Onkar Nath Tiwari v.
Chief Engineer, Minor Irrigation Deptt. [(1997) 3 ESC 1866 : 1998 All LJ 245] has
held that the principle of law laid down in the aforesaid decisions is that an order of
transfer is a part of the service conditions of an employee which should not be
interfered with ordinarily by a court of law in exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction
under Article 226 unless the court finds that either the order is mala fide or that the
service rules prohibit such transfer, or that the authorities who issued the orders,
were not competent to pass the orders.
8. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the impugned transfer order of
the appellant from Muzaffarnagar to Mawana, District Meerut was made at the
instance of an MLA. On the other hand, it has been stated in the counter- affidavit
filed on behalf of Respondents 1 and 2 that the appellant has been transferred due to
complaints against him. In our opinion, even if the allegation of the appellant is
correct that he was transferred on the recommendation of an MLA, that by itself
would not vitiate the transfer order. After all, it is the duty of the representatives of
the people in the legislature to express the grievances of the people and if there is any
complaint against an official the State Government is certainly within its jurisdiction
to transfer such an employee. There can be no hard-and-fast rule that every transfer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 14
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
at the instance of an MP or MLA would be vitiated. It all depends on the facts and
circumstances of an individual case. In the present case, we see no infirmity in the
impugned transfer order. "
Quoting the aforementioned judgment, the learned counsels would submit that it is permissible in
law to act upon the recommendation of the MLA. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Mohd. Masood Ahmad (Supra) is distinguishable on facts without much ado, inasmuch
as the very paragraphs relied upon by the learned counsels would clearly indicate that it was the
recommendation made by the MLA on the basis of the complaints that were received upon the
officer whom the MLA had sought the transfer of. The facts in the instance case are entirely
different. The 2nd respondent had completed his minimum tenure and has been in the same place
for more than ten years, and in the same post for more than three years and two months, and the
petitioner herein, who had just stepped into the post of the 2nd respondent, namely, Superintending
Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, also brings in political pressure to continue him in the same post
even during the pendency of the proceedings before the Tribunal.
30. It is apposite to refer to judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarvesh Kumar
Awasthi vs. UP Jal Nigam and Others reported in (2003) 11 SCC 740, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has held in paragraph No.4, which reads thus:
4. In our view, transfer of officers is required to be effected on the basis of set norms
or guidelines. The power of transferring an officer cannot be wielded arbitrarily, mala
fide or an exercise against efficient and independent officer or at the instance of
politicians whose work is not done by the officer concerned.
For better administration the officers concerned must have freedom from fear of being harassed by
repeated transfers or transfers ordered at the instance of someone who has nothing to do with the
business of administration.
31. In terms of the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as extracted hereinabove, transfer
would get vitiated, if it is at the instance of politicians. In our view, political interference in transfers
and posting of officers would result in politicization of public office and put public efficiency and
good administration to peril.
32. The guidelines of transfer dated 22.11.2001 which was superseded by the guidelines of transfer
dated 7.6.2013, which regulated and presently regulate the transfer of Government servants in the
State of Karnataka, have been declared to have a statutory force by two Full Bench judgments of this
Court in the case of H.N. Chandru vs. State of Karnataka and Others reported in 2011 (3) KLJ 562
and in the case S.N. Gangadharaiah vs. State of Karnataka reported in ILR 2015 KAR 1955.
33. Apart from various regulatory measures contained in the guidelines, it would also contemplate a
situation where officers bring political pressure amounting to political interference. Clause 12 of the
guidelines reads thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153841409/ 15
Sri. Prem Singh S/O Bhikku Singh vs The State Of Karnataka & Anr on 28 February, 2020
"12. Bringing political pressure regarding transfers:
Transfer cannot be claimed as a matter of right by the Government servants. Bringing
political pressure for transfers is prohibited. If any Government servant brings
political pressure regarding his posting to a particular place at any time, in
contravention of the instructions contained in Circular No.SI AA SU EE 26 SE NOU
VA 93, dated 22.5.1993, official Memorandum No.DPAR 41 STR 94, dated 5.8.1994
and Official Memorandum No.SI AA SU EE 54 SE NOU VA 93, dated 19.12.1994, he
shall be proceeded with accordingly. It shall also be ensured that he is not posted to
such a post."
34. In terms of the afore-extracted clause of the guidelines, it is clear that the transfer cannot be
claimed as matter of right and bringing the political pressure for transfer is prohibited. Such persons
who would bring political pressure shall not be posted to those posts.
35. In terms of clause 12 of the guidelines, the facts obtaining in the case on hand are considered on
the touchstone of clause 12 of the guidelines. Both the petitioner and the 2nd respondent cannot be
posted to the post of Superintending Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, as both the petitioner and
the 2nd respondent have brought in political pressure, one, to remain there and one, to be posted to
that place.
36. In terms of law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the clause 12 of the guidelines of
transfer which have been held to have a statutory force, both the petitioner and 2nd respondent
ought not to be posted to the PWD Circle, Kalaburagi as Superintendent Engineer. In view of the
discussion herein above pertaining to bringing in political pressure to continue in the post and to get
a transfer to the post, we direct 1st respondent not to post either of the two officers, namely
petitioner and 2nd respondent to the post of Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi.
37. In view of our findings on point Nos.1 and 2, the relief should have been granted to the writ
petitioner. But, in view of our finding on point No.3 and for the reasons indicated therein, we pass
the following:
ORDER
(i) Writ petition is allowed in part.
(ii) The order of the Tribunal in application No.6785/2019 dated 20.12.2019 is set
aside.
(iii) The 1st respondent is directed not to post either the petitioner or the 2nd
respondent to the post of Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi.
(iv) There shall be no order as to costs.
