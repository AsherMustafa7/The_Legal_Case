3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that an incompetent authority has passed the order.
To that extent, he is relying on Annexure P - 2, Notification by the Road Construction Department in
particularly Rule 11, it relates to Black-Listing and Suspension. Relevant paragraph would be Clause
(c) of Rule 11, it reads as under :
"(c) The order of black-listing / suspension shall be passed by the officer who is
competent to register the contractor or by the officer under whom the registering
officer works."
To contend that the Deputy General Manager is not the competent authority, since the Chief
General Manager was registering officer (vide Annexure - P1) further it is submitted that Annexure
P - 4 is bereft of material information like referring to show cause notice or reply to the show cause
notice on behalf of Patna High Court CWJC No.16239 of 2025 dt.08-10-2025 the petitioner. In
other words, blacklisting would affect petitioner's civil consequence, therefore, he is entitled to have
the benefit of all formalities like issuance of show cause notice and reply and other materials is
required to be taken note of in order to comply Articles 14, 19 (1)(g) read with Article 21 of the
Constitution. On these counts petitioner has made out a case so as to interfere with the impugned
order dated 01.08.2025 and it is set aside.
4. Matter is remanded to the concerned competent authority to take decision afresh after providing
due opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The above exercise shall be completed within a period
of three months from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
5. Accordingly, present writ petition stands allowed.
