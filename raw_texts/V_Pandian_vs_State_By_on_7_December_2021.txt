For Respondents : Mr. S. Vinoth Kumar

Mr.L. Gavaskar [for R2]
ORDER
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the Final Report filed under Sections 420,
468, 471,506(ii) I.P.C.
2. The crux of the charge against the Petitioners are as follows:
2.a. A1 is father of A2 and A3 is the husband of A2. The Accused and Defacto
Complainant are relatives. Partnership firm was constituted in the name of
“Thirumalai Timber Marts” and the Defacto Complainant invested Rs.2,50,000/-.
The Partnership Firm was run in the place belonged to 3 rd Accused/3rd Petitioner
herein. The main customer to the partnership business is Esan M.R.Top Changes Pvt.
Ltd., A3 was in-charge of the partnership firm preparing Delivery Chalan, Invoice
etc., However, the 1st Petitioner used the name “Sri Thirumalai Timber Marts” and
received payment of Rs.5,27,801/- by issuing the bogus Delivery Chalan and utilised
the amount actually meant for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of
2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 partnership business. It is the further case of the
prosecution that the accused utilised the cheques issued in favour of the “Thirumalai
Timber Marts” for the new company formed by them viz., “Sri Thirumalai Timber
Marts”, and when the defacto complainant found the above fraud and enquired about
the same, the accused threatened the defacto complainant and her husband, thereby
they have committed the offences under Sections 420, 468,471, 506(ii) I.P.C.
3. Learned Counsel Mr. Sarath Chandran appearing for the Petitioners mainly
contended that the entire prosecution is nothing but a result of dispute in a
partnership business and criminal proceedings were initiated for settling the scores
or pressurising the parties to settle the civil disputes. It is his contention that even as
the entire materials of the prosecution taken as a proof, same do not constitute any of
the offences alleged against the petitioners. Absolutely there is no material available
on record to show that the accused have created false document so as to attract the
offence of forgery or the offence under Sections 468 and 471 of IPC.
Absolutely there is no evidence to show that the accused have deceived somebody in this case. The
only grievance of the defacto complainant appears to be with regard to opening of the new
partnership firm in the name of “Sri Thirumalai https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of
2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 Timber Marts.” by the accused and selling the products directly
from that partnership company. Therefore, such dispute could not be construed an offence. At the
most it is only a Civil nature the same cannot be given a criminal colour. Therefore, submitted that
the entire prosecution is nothing but abuse of process of law and prays to quash the entire

V. Pandian vs State By on 7 December, 2021
proceedings.
4. The learned counsel also relied upon the following judgments in support of his contention:
1. Mohammed Ibrahim and Others vs. State of Bihar and Another [(2009) 8 Supreme
Court Cases 751]
2. V. Srinivasan and another vs. the State [2019-1-L.W.(Crl) 934]
3. Velji Raghavji Patel vs. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1965 SC 1433]
5. Whereas the learned Counsel Mr.L. Gavaskar appearing for the defacto complainant submitted
that the name of the partnership firm “Thirumalai Timber Marts” has been misused and the word
“Sri” has been prefixed in the Invoices https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and
Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 issued by the Partnership firm and the amount of Rs.5,27,801/- issued to
the original partnership firm was directed to the newly formed partnership firm by the accused.
Therefore, it is the contention that there are materials available on record. Even before allotting the
TIN number by the authorities the accused used the TIN number of the defacto complainant
partnership firm in certain invoices. That itself clearly shows that there is creation of false
documents. Therefore, submitted that when the prosecution is collected materials, the entire
prosecution cannot be quashed. Further, it is his contention that the Certificate of Registration of
“Sri Thirumalai Timber Marts” itself indicate that the firm was commenced only on 17.09.2010,
whereas certificate was issued on 11.11.2010. All these facts have to be seen only at trial and the
matter cannot be quashed.
6. In support of his contention the learned counsel for the defacto complainant/R2 relied upon the
judgment in Kaptan Singh vs. The Stae of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. [AIR 2021 SC 3931] wherein the
Apex court has held that the High Court is not required to consider the merits of the allegations in
detail, which as such are required to be considered at the time of trial.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017
7. The learned counsel also relied in Priti Saraf and Ors. vs. State of NCT of Delhi and Ors. [AIR
2021 SC 1531] the Apex Court has also held that exercise of inherent power of the High Court is an
extraordinary power which has to be exercised with great care and circumspection.
8. Heard both sides.
9. As indicated above, the crux of the prosecution case is that the accused have created false
document in the name of “Thirumalai Timber Marts” wherein the defacto complainant and accused
are original partners. The accused used the word “Sri” before the “Thirumalai Timber Marts” and
diverted the funds therefore created false document and committed the offence. It is well settled
that while exercising power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.the Court should be slow in exercising the
power. However, when the entire materials collected by the prosecution do not constitute an offence
or a civil dispute given a criminal colour to settle some other partnership dispute, the Court can

V. Pandian vs State By on 7 December, 2021
exercise the power in order to prevent the abuse of process of law from the inception.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017
10. The allegations set out in the prosecution case clearly indicate that there are disputes in the
partnership business between the partners. The main grievance of the defacto complainant is that
the accused have opened a new partnership firm prefixing the word “Sri” before the existing
partnership firm viz., “Thirumalai Timber Marts” and diverted the business of original firm and
received a sum of Rs.5,27,801/- by creating false Delivery Chalan, Invoice, etc., In this regard, it is
relevant to note that the Apex Court in Mohammed Ibrahim's case (supra) held as follows:
“14. An analysis of section 464 of Penal Code shows that it divides false documents
into three categories:
1) The first is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently makes or executes a
document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was
made or executed by some other person, or by the authority of some other person, by
whom or by whose authority he knows it was not made or executed.
2) The second is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or
otherwise, alters a document in any https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of
2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 material part, without lawful authority, after it has
been made or executed by either himself or any other person.
3) The third is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign,
execute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of (a)
unsoundness of mind; or (b) intoxication; or (c) deception practised upon him, know
the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration.
In short, a person is said to have made a `false document', if (i) he made or executed a document
claiming to be someone else or authorised by someone else; or (ii) he altered or tampered a
document; or (iii) he obtained a document by practicing deception, or from a person not in control
of his senses.”
11. To attract the offence under Section 464 IPC, a person should have done any of the Act
contemplated under Section 464. The first clause that he made or executed a document claiming to
be someone else or authorised by someone else. Absolutely there is no evidence to show that the
petitioner dishonestly or fraudulently made or executed a document with the intention of causing it
to be believed that such document was made or executed by some other person or by the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 authority of
some other person by whom or by whose authority he knows it was not made or executed. Here it is
the case of the prosecution is that the petitioners themselves altered the document. Therefore, the
first category of Section 464 IPC will not be attracted as against the petitioners herein. Similarly, to
attract third category, it is not the case of the prosecution here that the petitioners have fradulently

V. Pandian vs State By on 7 December, 2021
or dishonestly caused any person to sign, execute or alter a document knowing that such person
could not by reason of (a) unsoundness of mind; or (b) intoxication; or (c) deception practised upon
him, know the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration.
12. The allegations putforth by the prosecution will not attract 3rd category also. To bring the
accused in the second category namely, a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or
otherwise, altered a document in any material part, without lawful authority, after it has been made
or executed by either himself or any other person, if there is a materials then certainly the
prosecution can make out a case against the accused. Though it is contended by the prosecution that
the accused have altered the invoices issued by the “Thirumalai Timber Marts” as “Sri Thirumalai
Timber Marts” after the invoices have been issued by the original https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 partnership firm. It is to be noted in this regard,
the main witness relied upon by the prosecution is L.W.5.
13. The court aware of its limitation going to the details about the statements recorded by the
prosecution,. But at the same time prosecution materials itself indicated that particularly, L.W.5
statement when carefully seen, he has stated that he has paid amount of Rs.5,27,801/-. He stated
that the very supply itself was made in the name of “Sri Thirumalai Timber Marts”. Pursuant to the
same they paid the amount directly in the name of “Sri Thirumalai Timber Marts.” From the above,
the prosecution version clearly indicate that it is not the case of prosecution that after the supply has
been made in the name of “Thirumalai Timber Marts”, the word “Sri” was prefixed. Whereas what
has been unearthed by the investigation indicates that the supply itself made in the changed name of
new partnership by the accused. In such view of the matter, the act of the petitioner will not fall
within the second category also to attract the offence of making false document under section 464
IPC and other offences. It is nowhere the case of the L.W.5 or others that the accused have played
deception dishonestly from the inception to pay the amount by L.W.5. Therefore, the offence under
Section 420 IPC also https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of
2017 could not be made out. Therefore, merely because the Final Report has been filed, when the
material collected by the prosectuion itself indicates that the offence has not been made out, there is
no prohibition in law exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
14. In STATE OF HARYANA AND OTHERS Vs. BHAJANLAL AND OTHERS [1992 Supp (1)
Supreme Court Cases 335] the Apex Court has held as follows:
“8. In the exercise of the extra-ordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent
powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the following
categories of cases are given by way of illustration wherein such power could be
exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure
the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly
defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guide- myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised
(a) where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90766952/ 5
V. Pandian vs State By on 7 December, 2021
constitute any offence or make out a case against https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 the ac- cused;
(b) where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investi- gation by police officers under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code;
(c) where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or 'complaint and the evidence collected
in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against
the accused;
(d) where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code;
(e) where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 conclusion that there is sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused;
(f) where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institu- tion and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party;
(g) where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge. [305D-H; 306A-E] 8.2. In the instant case, the
allegations made in the complaint, do clearly constitute a cognizable offence justi- ï7 on and this
case does not call for the exercise of extraor- dinary or inherent powers of the High Court to quash
the F.I.R. itself. [307B] State of West Bengal v. S.N. Basak, [1963] 2 SCR 52; distinguished.
15. From the above judgement the Apex Cout has also held that where the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.No.7815 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.No.5646 of 2017 uncontroverted
allegations made in the FIR or 'complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not
disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused, the Court can
exercise the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C and quash the proceedings.
16. Considering the above judgments and also well settled provisions and the entire materials
collected by the prosecution itself on the face value do not constitute any offence and the matter
arising out of the partnership dispute, criminal colour cannot be given to settle the dispute which
are purely of civil nature. In such a view of the matter, it is the case where power under Section 482
Cr.P.C.has to be exercised. Accordingly, charge sheet filed in C.C.No.64 of 2016 pending before the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90766952/ 6

learned Judicial Magistrate at Ambattur is quashed.
17. In the result Criminal Original Petition is Ordered. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous
Petition is closed.
