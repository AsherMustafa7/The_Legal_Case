2. The facts which are germane and not in dispute
in the present batch of writ applications filed under Article 226
of the Constitution of India, are short. There are 1119 non-
Government recognized Madarsas and 9 (nine) girls Madarsas
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114051600/ 18
Imran Alam & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 23 June, 2016
(total, 1128) in the State of Bihar. Besides the above
Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016
18/30
Madarsas, there are 2459 Madarsas, which have been
registered by the Bihar State Madarsa Education Board, but
have not been recognized by the State Government. These
Madarsas impart education to male and female students of the
minority. Similarly, there are 531 Sanskrit Schools, which have
due recognition by the State Government, which impart
teaching in Sanskrit. The Madarsas and Sanskrit Schools,
recognized by the State Government, get grant-in-aid from the
State Government for the purpose of making payment to the
teaching and non-teaching employees, working in the said
Madarsas and Sanskrit Schools in their respective pay scales,
which has been mentioned in the resolution issued by the
letter No. 10/o 3-06/1994 (va'k) 970, dated 31.08.2013, by
Education Department, Government of Bihar (Annexure-4).
3. The grievance of the petitioners, in the present
batch of writ applications, is that they had been appointed by
the respective Governing Bodies/Managing Committees of the
respective recognized Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools in their
respective pay scales, which were among 1128 Madarsas and
531 Sanskrit Schools, since before 31.08.2013, but after
15.02.2011
. Clause 6 of the aforesaid Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, however, prescribes that teaching and non-
teaching employees, appointed in the said recognized Madarsas and Sanskrit Schools, against

Imran Alam & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 23 June, 2016
vacancies arising out Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016 of retirement of
teaching/non-teaching employees, shall be treated to have been converted into
teaching/non-teaching employees in fixed salary, with effect from 15.02.2011, for the purpose of
quantifying the grant-in-aid to be released to the said recognized Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools on the
basis of fixed salary for such employees.
4. The English translation of Clause 6 of the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, reads thus:
"6. Posts which have fallen vacant after retirement of teaching/non-teaching
employees working in 1119 non-government recognized (without grant-in-aid)
Madarsas and 9 girls Madarsas, i.e., total 1128 Madarsas and 531 Sanskrit Schools of
different categories of the State, shall be treated to be automatically converted in the
fixed pay for grant by the Government with effect from 15.02.2011 and the grant shall
be payable on the basis of calculation of pay fixed by the State Government for
teaching and non- teaching employees, appointed against all vacancies on or after
15.02.2011."
5. It is the common grievance of the petitioners that Clause 6 of the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, is
in breach of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India for the following reasons:
(i) When the petitioners were appointed before Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of
2015 dt.23-06-2016 issuance of the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, they were entitled
for regular pay scales. It is their plea that if Clause 6 is to be implemented, in the
same recognized Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools, there will be two class of teachers, one
appointed before 15.02.2011 and the others appointed on or after 15.02.2011;
whereas, the teachers and non-teaching employees, appointed before 15.02.2011,
would be entitled to salary and allowances on the basis of regular pay scale, those
appointed on or after the said date (i.e., 15.02.2011) will be getting fixed salary.
According to the petitioners, this classification is discriminatory, irrational and,
therefore, violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
(ii) The decision of the State Government to introduce the scheme of fixed salary for teaching and
non- teaching employees of Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools with retrospective effect from 15.02.2011 is
arbitrary and unreasonable.
6. Counter affidavits have been filed on behalf of the State of Bihar, taking a plea that the Human
Resources Development Department (now, Education Department), Government of Bihar, for the
purpose of providing quality education to Madarsa students considered the possibility of granting
aid to such Madarsas which are registered with the Bihar State Madarsa Education Board, but were
not recognized. Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016 Accordingly, it was decided
that the Bihar State Madarsa Education Board shall get an enquiry conducted through the
concerned District Education Officers, pertaining to 2459 Madarsas, which had been registered
through Bihar State Madarsa Education Board in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
Resolution No. 1090, dated 29.11.1980, regarding their feasibility. Accordingly, through the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114051600/ 20
Imran Alam & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 23 June, 2016
Resolution, dated 15.02.2011, it was decided to provide grant-in-aid in proportion to the fixed salary
in said Madarsas, 2459 in number. The Resolution, dated 15.02.2011, has been brought on record by
way of Annexure A to the counter affidavit, filed in CWJC No. 985 of 2015. It is the specific stand on
behalf of the State of Bihar that the said Resolution, dated 15.02.2011, was published in Bihar
Gazette.
7. It is further stand of the State Government that in compliance of the aforesaid Resolution, dated
15.02.2011, another resolution, being Resolution No. 970, dated 31.08.2013 (impugned), has been
issued, indicating that the teaching and non-teaching employees of Madarsas who were appointed
on or after 15.02.2011 shall be paid fixed salary and grant-in-aid to the Madarsas and Sanskrit
Schools shall be released accordingly.
8. It has been stated, in paragraph 17 of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Bihar in
CWJC Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016 No. 985 of 2015, that the decision, for
quantifying grant-in-aid on the basis of fixed salary to the teaching and non-teaching employees of
the Madarsas, had already been taken on 15.02.2011, and, thus, it is contended on behalf of the State
of Bihar that it cannot be said that the impugned Clause 6 of the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013,
amounts to implementing the scheme of fixed salary from a retrospective date.
9. It has been argued by Mr. Lalit Kishore that decision to release grant on the basis of fixed salary
against the posts filled up on or after 15.02.2011, consequent upon retirement of the original
employees of recognized Madarsas/ Sanskrit Schools was taken to maintain parity in matter of
release of grant to recognized and un-recognized Madarsas/ Sanskrit Schools. Accordingly, it is his
plea that State action is not in breach of equality clause of the Constitution of India rather the same
is to ensure that all Madarsas and Sanskrit Schools, either recognized or unrecognized, are treated at
par.
10. We have closely examined the Resolution, dated 15.02.2011, brought on record by way of
Annexure A to the counter affidavit and the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, brought on record by way
of Annexure B to the counter affidavit, filed on behalf of the State of Bihar in CWJC No. 985 of 2015.
11. On bare reading of the two resolutions, it is Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015
dt.23-06-2016 easily noticeable that the said two resolutions deal with two different classes of
Madarsas. The Resolution, dated 15.02.2011, is confined to 2459 Madarsas, which were not
recognized by the State Government, but duly registered by the Bihar State Madarsa Education
Board. The said resolution contains the decision of the State Government for providing grant-in-aid
to such Madarsas, for payment of fixed salary to the teachers of such Madarsas, at par, with the fixed
salary payable to teachers of High Schools/Primary Schools. On the other hand, the Resolution,
dated 31.08.2013, is with respect to 1119 Madarsas and 09 girls Madarsa (total, 1128) and 531
Sanskrit Schools, which were duly recognized by the State Government and were getting grants from
the State Government for the purpose of making payment of salary to the teaching and non-teaching
employees. The said Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, is with respect to grant of a revised pay to the
teaching and non-teaching employees of Madarsas/ Sanskrit Schools, which also contains a decision
in paragraph 6, as noted above.

Imran Alam & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 23 June, 2016
12. In our considered view, the State Government of Bihar has taken an incorrect plea in paragraph
17 of the counter affidavit that issuance of Resolution, date 31.08.2013, is in compliance of the
earlier Resolution, dated 15.02.2011. The Resolution, dated 15.02.2011, which is confined to 2459
Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016 non-recognized Madarsas, does not at all
refer to release of grant-in-aid on the basis of fixed salary for teaching and non- teaching employees
of recognized 1128 Madarsas and 531 Sanskrit Schools. The plea on behalf of the State Government,
justifying the provision as contained in the impugned Clause 6 of the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013,
by referring to Resolution, dated 15.02.2011, cannot be accepted.
13. It has, however, to be kept in mind that decision, in question, relates release of grant-in-aid to
the Madarsas and Sanskrit Schools, by the State Government for payment of salary to teaching and
non-teaching employees. The said Madarsas and Sanskrit Schools are, admittedly, privately
managed by the Governing Bodies/Managing Committees. There is no dispute that the petitioners
claim to have been appointed by the said Governing Bodies/Managing Committees against regular
pay scale. Whether appointment of the petitioners by Governing Bodies/Managing Committees of
recognized and Government aided privately managed Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools with salary based
on pay scale, confer upon them any indefeasible right against the State Government to claim release
of grant-in-aid to the said Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools, is one of the basic issues which the present
case involves.
14. The same question had arisen before a Division Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015
dt.23-06-2016 Bench of this Court (comprising of both of us), in the case of The State Government
of Bihar through the Secretary, Department of Higher Education and Others v. Parvati Kumari and
Others, reported in MANU/BH/0008/2016. This Court, in Parvati Kumari (supra), referring to two
decisions of the Supreme Court, in the cases of State of Assam v. Ajit Kumar Sharma (AIR 1965 SC
1196) and Cyril E. Fernandes v. Sr. Myria Lydia and Others (AIR 1977 SC 2145), has held in
paragraphs 30 to 34 as follows:
"30. So far as question Nos. I and II, as referred to above, are concerned, they have
been answered in Supreme Court's decision, in the case of State of Assam v. Ajit
Kumar Sharma (AIR 1965 SC 1196), which has been subsequently relied by the
Supreme Court in its another decision in the case of Cyril E. Fernandes v. Sr. Myria
Lydia & Ors. (AIR 1977 SC 2145). In Ajit Kumar Sharma (supra), the Supreme Court
held that withholding of grant-in-aid to a private College by the Government is a
matter between the concerned Government and the management of the private
College. The Supreme Court held that the conditions or instructions as to grant-
in-aid confer no right on the teachers
of the private Colleges and they
cannot ask that either particular
Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016 instructions or conditions
should be enforced or should not be enforced.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114051600/ 22
Imran Alam & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 23 June, 2016
31. Relying upon its decision in Ajit Kumar Sharma (supra), the Supreme Court, in
Cyril E. Fernandes (supra), held that the appellant of that case, being teacher of a
private institution, was not directly concerned with the question whether the rules in
grant-in-aid code conferred on the management of the institution an enforceable
right against the Government, which is entirely a matter between the management
and the Government.
32. Following the aforesaid decisions in Cyril E. Fernandes (supra) and Ajit Kumar
Sharma (supra), we have no hesitation in holding that in the matter of the said policy
or State action, touching release or withholding of grant to a private institution,
cannot be said to be conferring any enforceable right on the employees of the
institution or taking away any right from the employees of the institution, since they
cannot be said to be directly concerned with the dispute between the private
institution and the Government, particularly, when the institution does not question
the decision of the Government to withhold such grant. We are of the clear Patna
High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016 view that the private respondents,
herein, had no locus standi to question the order passed by the Secretary,
Department of Higher Education, dated 09.11.2001, pursuant to the order of this
Court, dated 16.09.2002, as the said dispute was raised by the Governing Body of the
College against the decision of the State Government of stopping Recurring Annual
Grant to the College and the dispute, as regards grant-in-aid, was between the
Governing Body of the private College and the State Government. The Governing
Body elected not to question the decision of the said State Government and, thus,
accepted it.
33. Further, the right of the private respondents/writ petitioners, if any, is determinable on the basis
of contract of employment between them and the management of the private institutions inter se.
Question of denial of their right will depend upon the nature of agreement between them and their
employer.
The writ petitioners-private respondents could not have, in our considered opinion, raised any
grievance and/or seek release of grant-in-aid in favour of the College inasmuch as there was no legal
right vested in them, which can be said to have been violated.
Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016
34. The law is well settled that a mandamus cannot be issued to create a right; but mandamus is to
be issued to restore a party, who has been denied right, to enjoyment of such right. A person can be
said to be to be aggrieved only if his legal rights are directly affected. In our opinion, thus, the
private respondents/ writ petitioners had no locus standi to maintain writ petitions, under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, against the order passed by the Secretary, Department of Higher
Education, rejecting the plea of the Governing Body to continue with the release of recurring annual
grant-in-aid to the College."

Imran Alam & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 23 June, 2016
(Emphasis is added)
15. One of the effects of Clause 6 of the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, is that the State Government
would, now, release grant for payment of salary to the persons appointed as teachers/non-teaching
employees on or after 15.02.2011, on the basis of fixed salary and not on the basis of regular pay
scales and, thus, Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools would be getting less grant-in-aid from the State
Government than what they would have received had regular pay scale of the teachers appointed
after on or after 15.02.2011 been taken into account.
16. It cannot be said that eventually, the said Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016
Madarsas may or may not be able to pay to their teachers/non-teaching employees, salary on the
basis of regular pay scales from the grant they would be receiving in the light of the Resolution,
dated 31.08.2013. We are not concerned with the same.
17. Evidently, Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools, in question, are privately managed by their respective
Governing Bodies, who have not raised any grievance against the said decision of the State
Government, dated 31.08.2013.
18. On the basis of pleadings on record and submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, it
appears that the State Government releases grant to respective Madarsas/ Sanskrit Schools in
accordance with its policy decision, the grant so received by the respective Madarsas/Sanskrit
Schools is utilized for payment of salaries/ wages to the teachers and non-teaching employees of the
respective Madarsas/Sanskrit Schools by their Governing Bodies/Managing Committees, as the case
may be. The petitioner being employees, appointed by the Government Bodies/Managing
Committees cannot, in our opinion, raise a grievance against the State Government for release of
grant on the basis of pay less than what was allowed by their employees.
19. Considering the above, in our view, no relief can be granted in the present proceedings, the same
having Patna High Court CWJC No.985 of 2015 dt.23-06-2016 been preferred by the individual
teachers of privately managed institutions, raising grievance against the decision of the State
Government.
20. It will be, however, open to the Governing Bodies/Managing Committees of the concerned
institutions to question the validity of the impugned decision of the State Government, as contained
in Clause 6 of the Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, in appropriate proceeding in accordance with law.
21. Before we part with the present order, we consider it appropriate to observe that in the facts and
circumstances of the case, the State Government of Bihar may reconsider the applicability of Clause
6 of the said Resolution, dated 31.08.2013, with effect from the date of its issuance.
22. These applications shall stand disposed of with the observations, as above.
