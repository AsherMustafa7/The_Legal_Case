that according to the ossification test report the age of the prosecutrix is 17 to 19 years
and she is major. It is also submitted that according to her statement she is living
with Banshi after performing the marriage and is also pregnant. In view of the
aforesaid circumstances, prayer is made to enlarge the appellant / accused on bail.
Learned P.L. for the respondent/State has opposed the bail and stated that notice of
this appeal has been served upon the victim, therefore, prayed for rejection for the
same.
Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case and perusal of impugned order,
this Court is of the view that this is not a case in which the appellant is required to be
kept in custody during the whole trial, but without commenting anything on the
merits of the case, this appeal deserves to be allowed. The impugned order is set aside
and it is ordered that the appellant / accused Ravi Vaswani @ Banshi be released on
bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand
only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court
for securing his presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this
regard during trial and for complying with the conditions enumerated in sub- section
(3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.
C.c. as per rules."
The prayer for bail is opposed by learned Panel Lawyer.
Looking to the nature and facts of the case, prima- facie there appears to be parity between the
present applicant and Ravi Vaswani, hence, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the
case, this appeal is allowed.
It is directed that on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand
Only) by the appellant along with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial
court, the appellant be released on bail with a direction to appear before the trial court on the date of
the trial.
The Criminal Appeal is disposed of accordingly. Certified copy as per rules.
