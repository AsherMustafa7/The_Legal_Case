3. Succinctly, the marriage of appellant-Manorma
Devi was solemnized with respondent-Deep Narayan @
Vijay Panjiyar on 07.07.2003 as per Hindu rites and
ceremonies. The marriage was duly consummated; and
three children were born out of the wedlock.
4. The pleaded case of respondent-husband in his
petition filed before learned Family Court is that the
marriage of the respondent with the appellant was
solemnized as per Hindu rites and rituals at Laheriasarai,
Darbhanga on 07.7.2003. In the marriage, the father of the
appellant did not pay anything and all the arrangements of
marriage were borne by the respondent-husband as the
appellant was a beautiful girl and the respondent was liking
her. After marriage, at the request of the appellant, the
respondent spent a lot of money on the treatment of mother
of the appellant. The respondent also provided financial
help to the family of the appellant due to their weak
financial conditions. Sometimes after the marriage, the
respondent came to know that appellant has illicit
relationship with a boy of her Maike. Somehow, the
marriage was consummated and three children were born

out of the wedlock. The appellant remained with the
respondent till he has been giving expenses to her parents
and when he stopped paying the expenses, then the
appellant, under a conspiracy has filed a false case and
implicated the father of the respondent. It is further alleged
that on 21.03.2010, the appellant, in the absence of father of
the respondent went to her maike along with her minor child
and after taking gold ornaments and cash of Rs. 30,000/-
she fled away. Next day, on 22.03.2010, when the father of
the respondent went to her maike and asked about this fact,
then her family members started abusing him and when he
made protest then father and brother of the appellant
assaulted the father of the respondent on his head. He,
thereafter registered Laharia Sarai P.S. Case No. 119 of
2010 on 27.03.2010 under Sections 307, 447, 323, 380, 504,
34 of the Indian Penal Code against the brothers and father
of the appellant. It is further alleged that in order to save
their skin, the father of the appellant has also filed
Complaint Case No. 498 of 2010 on 25.03.2010 which was
subsequently converted into Laheria Sarai P.S. Case No.
136 of 2010 on 07.04.2010 under Sections 341, 323, 325,
Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
4/20
342, 498(A), 120(B), 504, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and
Section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. In the aforesaid
case, he has made false allegation of demand of dowry and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139321042/ 3
Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
torture against the respondent-husband and other family
members. The appellant-wife has also filed Maintenance
Case No. 164 of 2010 on 19.08.2010 under Section 125 of
the Cr.P.C in which the reconciliation took place and after
reconciliation, the respondent took the appellant to her
matrimonial house on 19.01.2011 and started living
separately from his parents. The respondent made all his
efforts to resume the conjugal relation but it was the
appellant who did not want to continue any kind of
relationship with the respondent and started pressurizing the
respondent to withdraw the cases filed by the father of the
respondent against her father and brothers. In the year 2011,
the appellant has again filed a case bearing Laheria Sarai
P.S. Case No. 134 of 2011 under Section 498(A) of the
Indian Penal Code on 01.03.2011 against the respondent
and other in-laws family members making false and
frivolous allegations wherein the respondent and other
family members were compelled to take anticipatory bail.
Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
5/20
The appellant is a quarrelsome lady and also involved in an
illicit relationship with another man and has continuously
implicated the respondent in false criminal cases, thereby
causing immense mental agony, financial hardship and
physical distress. The appellant has willfully deserted the
respondent since 2010 and has failed to fulfill any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139321042/ 4
Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
matrimonial obligation. Hence, leaving no other option, the
respondent has filed the present divorce petition.
5. The appellant-wife has appeared in pursuance to
the notice issued to her and filed her written statement. In
her written statement, she has denied all the allegations
made against her. She has stated that the matrimonial case is
not maintainable either on fact or law and the respondent
has got no cause of action to file this case. The respondent-
husband has no interest to continue conjugal relationship
with the appellant. Soon after marriage, the appellant-wife
was tortured for demand of dowry. The respondent-husband
himself deserted the appellant-wife and did not make any
concrete effort to restore the matrimonial relation with the
appellant-wife. The appellant had never given threat, nor ill
behaved, humiliated or quarreled with any in-laws family
Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
6/20
members and all the allegations made against the appellant-
wife are fake with a view to take divorce from her. Hence,
the divorce petition is liable to be dismissed.
6. In view of facts and circumstances and
considering the materials available on record, learned
Principal Judge, Family Court, Darbhanga has held that the
appellant-wife has not taken any honest effort to continue
her matrimonial relationship with her husband, to get the
matrimonial dispute settled amicably. Hence, for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139321042/ 5
Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
peaceful life of both spouses including their family, an order
of judicial separation is required and accordingly the
matrimonial suit was disposed of by passing order of
granting decree of judicial separation under Section 10 of
the Hindu Marriage Act. The appellant-wife, aggrieved by
the said judgment of the learned Family Court has filed the
instant appeal before this Court.
7. Learned counsel for the appellant-wife submits
that the learned Family Court has erred in law and facts
both in allowing the judicial separation between the parties
under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Learned
counsel has further submitted that the order of judicial
Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
7/20
separation was granted on the ground of cruelty, rather the
appellant-wife had been treated with cruelty at her
matrimonial home and she had only availed her legal
remedies by filing cases as regards the cruelty meted out to
her and also as regards the demand of dowry by the
respondent-husband and his family members, however the
same have been wrongly taken against the appellant. It is
further submitted that the Family Court has wrongly
concluded that the appellant had deserted the respondent-
husband, whereas it was the respondent, who had compelled
the appellant-wife to leave her matrimonial home. The
respondent has alleged the cruelty at the hands of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139321042/ 6
Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
appellant but no specific date of cruelty/incidence was
brought on record. In his divorce petition, the respondent
has not brought on record any document to prove his case.
The respondent has alleged that his father has sustained
injuries at the hands of the father and brother of the
appellant but he has not produced any injury report to
authenticate his claim. Though the respondent claims that
appellant has illicit relationship with with a person of her
Maike but he has not even disclosed the name of that person
Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
8/20
which clearly suggests that all the allegations were levelled
in order to take advantage in the matrimonial case filed for
dissolution of marriage. The appellant has three children
and she is still ready to live with the respondent.
8. It is also submitted that no efforts were made by
the Family Court to reconcile the matter between the
parties. It is therefore contended that the findings returned
by the Family Court are not sustainable in the eyes of law.
9. Learned counsel for the respondent-husband
submits that the learned Family Court failed to appreciate
the evidences brought on record by the respondent
supporting the fact that appellant is not fit to carry the
matrimonial obligation. Learned counsel further submits
that allegation regarding extra marital affair amounts to
mental cruelty as same has been held to be a ground of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139321042/ 7
Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
divorce in the matter of Narendra vs. K. Meena reported in
AIR 2016 SC 4599. Parties have not stayed together for the
last fifteen years for which it can be reasonably inferred that
marriage between the parties is broken down irretrievably
and decree of divorce ought to be passed. Learned counsel
has further submitted that since the date of judgment dated
Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
9/20
31.03.2017
and decree dated 13.04.2017, seven years have already been elapsed and no solution has come out
for establishing matrimonial relation or matrimonial obligation by virtue of the said reason the
ground of divorce on the basis of mental cruelty is necessary to be allowed. Learned counsel further
submitted that parties have been litigating for a long and have lost best part of their life and there is
no possibility of living together, so it is necessary to mitigate their mental agony through the decree
of divorce. Learned counsel further submitted that under the given facts and circumstances of the
case respondent-husband has spent much of his career in litigating against the appellant-wife for
getting the decree of divorce. He has suffered lot of mental agony and led a secluded life. Learned
counsel for the respondent has submitted that since the purpose of marriage would not be served as
both parties are living separately after the year 2010 and even after the order of judicial separation,
there was no room for living together, for all practical purposes marriage came to end. Learned
counsel for the appellant relied upon the decision of Rakesh Raman vs. Kavita reported in 2023 SCC
Online SC 497 in Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025 which it has been observed in
para 20(xiv) which reads as under:-
"20(xiv). Where there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may fairly
be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair.
The marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever
that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the
contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In such
like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty.
10. Learned counsel for the respondent further submits that in Rakesh Raman vs.
Kavita (supra), the husband got the decree of divorce as he was living separately from
his wife since long. In support of his contention, learned counsel for the appellant
also cited decision of Subhransu Sarkar vs. Indrani Sarkar reported in 2021 SCC
Online SC 720.

Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
11. In order to prove his case, the respondent-
husband only himself has examined as P.W. 1. No documentary evidence has been
produced on behalf of the Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
respondent-husband.
12. The appellant-wife has also examined two witnesses which are O.P.W. 1 Manorma
Devi (appellant herself) and O.P.W. 2 Amarnath Mahto. She has also not produced
any documentary evidence.
13. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and perused the concerned
record of Family Court as well as the impugned judgment.
14. From perusal of the case records, it appears that decree of judicial separation
between the appellant and the respondent has been granted by the learned Family
Court on the ground of cruelty and desertion.
15. So far as, the ground of cruelty for taking divorce is concerned, the word 'cruelty'
has not been defined in specific words and language in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,
but it is well settled position that cruelty is such of character and conduct as cause in
mind of other spouse a reasonable apprehension that it will be harmful and injurious
for him to live with O.P.- respondent.
16. It is observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in leading case of Samar Ghose vs. Jaya
Ghose reported in Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025 2007 (4) SCC
511 that a sustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour of one spouse actually
affecting physical and mental health of the other spouse. The treatment complained
of and the resultant danger or apprehension must be very grave, substantial and
weighty. More trivial irritations, quarrel, normal wear and tear of the married live
which happens in day-to-day live would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the
ground of mental cruelty.
17. In this context, we are tempted to quote the golden observation made by the
Hon'ble Apex Court during decision in case of Narain Ganesh Dastane vs. Sucheta
Naraih Dastane reported in, AIR 1975, 1534, which are as follows:-
"One other matter which needs to be clarified is that though under Section 10(1) (b),
the apprehension of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious to live with the
other party has to be reasonable, it is wrong, except in the context of such
apprehension, to import the concept of a reasonable man as known to the law of
negligence of judging of matrimonial relations. Spouses are undoubtedly supposed
and expected to Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025 conduct their
joint venture as best as they might but it is no function of a court inquring into a
charge of cruelty to philosophise on the modalities of married life. Some one may
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139321042/ 9
Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
want to keep late hours of finish the day's work and some one may want to get up
early for a morning round of golf. The court cannot apply to the habits or hobbies of
these the test whether a reasonable man situated similarly will behave in a similar
fashion. "The question whether the misconduct complained of constitutes cruelty and
the like for divorce purposes is determined primarily by its effect upon the particular
person complaining of the acts. The question is not whether the conduct would be
cruel to a reasonable person or a person of average or normal sensibilities, but
whether it would have that effect upon the aggrieved spouse. That which may be cruel
to one person may be laughed off by another, and what may not be cruel to an
Individual under one set of circumstances may be extreme cruelty under another set
of circumstances". The Court has to deal, not with an ideal husband and ideal wife
(assuming any such exist) but with the particular man and woman before it. The ideal
couple or a near-ideal one will Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
probably have no occasion to go to a matrimonial court for, even if they may not be
able to draw their differences, their ideal attitudes may help them overlook or gloss
over mutual faults and failures."
18. After going through the impugned judgment, it is crystal clear that respondent-husband has
failed to prove the cruel behaviour of the appellant towards him and his family members by the
strength of cogent, relevant and reliable evidence, while burden of proof of cruelty rests upon the
respondent-husband of this case, because, he has sought relief of divorce on the basis of cruel
behaviour of the appellant towards him. Not even single incident with reference to specific date of
alleged cruelty has been urged in the plaint before the Family Court. Furthermore, alleged certain
flimsy act or omission or using some threatening and harsh words may occasionally happen in the
day-to-day conjugal life of a husband and wife to retaliate the other spouse but that cannot be a
justified/sustainable ground for taking divorce. Some trifling utterance or remarks or mere
threatening of one spouse to other cannot be construed as Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017
dt.15-10-2025 such decree of cruelty, which is legally required to a decree of divorce. The austerity of
temper and behaviour, petulance of manner and harshness of language may vary from man to man
born and brought up in different family background, living in different standard of life, having their
quality of educational qualification and their status in society in which they live.
19. Moreover, it is specifically pleaded in the petition of the respondent-husband that his father was
brutally assaulted at the hands of the appellant's family members and for which a criminal case was
also registered and subsequently counter case was registered on behalf of the appellant's side, but
neither the father of the respondent has been examined in the trial nor any chit of paper of the above
case has been filed. So, virtually, no any oral or documentary evidence has been produced on behalf
of the respondent in support of the aforesaid pleaded facts.
20. Thus, considering the above entire aspects of this case and evidence adduced on behalf of both
the parties, we find that respondent-husband has failed to prove the allegation of cruelty, much less,
the decree of cruel Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025 behaviour of appellant.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139321042/ 10
Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
21. So far as ground of desertion is concerned, it is the case of the respondent-husband that
appellant-wife has deserted the respondent-husband since 2011 and since then she has been living
along with her children at her Maike. The respondent-husband made all his efforts to bring back the
appellant-wife to her matrimonial house but she was not agree to come with the respondent, hence,
ultimately, the respondent has filed the present Divorce Petition. Here it is important to refer
Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act:-
(1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act,
may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a
decree of divorce on the ground that the other party--
[(i) has, after the solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary sexual intercourse with any person
other than his or her spouse; or (ia) has, after the solemnization of the marriage, treated the
petitioner with cruelty; or (ib) has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than
two years Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025 immediately preceding the
presentation of the petition; or]
(ii) has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion; or [(iii) has been incurably of
unsound mind, or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from mental disorder of such a
kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the
respondent.
22. The learned Principal Judge, Family Court has also observed in his judgment that keeping in
view the facts and circumstances of the case, both parties are directed for a judicial separation for
few months. Para 10 of the said judgment reads as under:-
" Under the facts and circumstances of the case it is evident that the Opposite
party/wife does not take any honest effort to continue her matrimonial relation with
her husband, to get the matrimonial dispute settled amicably. Hence, for the peaceful
life of both spouses including their family it is expedient to live separately for some
months within stipulated period as per the law required till the period where both the
Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025 spouse keep faith between each
other and without having any good faith, both the spouse cannot enjoy their
matrimonial life peacefully and prior to holding faith between both the spouse it is
expedient to remain separate life of both of them for their better future for time being
and also in view of future prospect of their three children who have to live at some
time in one side and at the other time in the other side which show that both the
spouse have made the present and future prospect of the aforesaid three children in
hell and also in much doldrum along with both the spouse themselves having the
same situation of their life and later on, they both have option to materialize their
matrimonial dispute with the help of their parents, if they both so like. Thus, an order
for Judicial separation is required to pass and as such, the aforesaid issue No. ii to vi
are disposed of accordingly as discussed above."

Manorma Devi vs Sri Deep Narayan @ Vijay Panjiyar on 15 October, 2025
23. From perusal of the record, it clearly transpires that just after few months of the alleged
desertion by the appellant-wife, the respondent-husband has filed the present Divorce Petition
which clearly indicates that respondent- Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017 dt.15-10-2025
husband did not make reasonable efforts to settle the dispute with her wife (appellant) and
hurriedly filed the divorce petition. The learned Family Court also did not take a pain to reconcile
the matter/dispute between the parties and without considering the period of alleged desertion, has
order for a judicial separation without considering the fact that appellant has three children and in
the absence of their father, the future of their children would be at stake as appellant is a housewife
and she does not have any source of income.
24. So far as ground of adultery is concerned, adultery may be defined as the act of a married person
having sexual intercourse with a person of opposite gender other than the wife or husband of the
person. Under the present Hindu Marriage Act, adultery is laid down as one of the ground for
divorce or judicial separation.
25. The essential ingredients in an offence of adultery are that: (i) There should be an act of sexual
intercourse outside the marriage, and (ii) that such intercourse should be voluntary.
26. The respondent has not brought on record the Patna High Court MA No.420 of 2017
dt.15-10-2025 name of adulterer or any proof to show that appellant was having illicit relationship
with any person nor he has proved that they were living in adultery and only in order to make a valid
ground in the divorce petition, these allegations were levelled against the appellant without any
supporting material evidence.
27. Hence, after going through the entire facts and evidence of both the parties, the judgment dated
31.03.2017 and decree dated 13.04.2017 passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court,
Darbhanga in Matrimonial Case No. 127 of 2011, is hereby set aside.
28. Accordingly M.A. No. 420 of 2017 stands allowed.
29. Pending I.A(s), if any, stand disposed of.
