THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION,
THIS DAY, COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
In this petition filed under section 482 of Cr.P.C., the petitioner, who is arraigned as accused No.2
has challenged the initiation of criminal prosecution in C.C.No. 961/2022 on the file of the Civil
Judge and JMFC, Banahatti.
2. Learned HCGP takes notice for respondent.
3. Though the matter is listed for admission, with the consent of both sides, it is taken up for final
disposal.
4. Brief facts leading to filing of the present petition are that the Fertilizer Inspector cum Assistant
Director of Agriculture, Bilagi (hereinafter referred to as "complainant"), filed a private complaint
under section 200 of Cr.P.C. against the petitioner/accused No.2 and another alleging that
petitioner being the Assistant General Manager, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizer Ltd., ('RCF' for
short) and accused No.1, who is retailer are indulged in selling sub-standard fertilizer called
"19:19:19 complex fertilizer" manufactured by RCF. On 15.02.2017, the complainant visited the
business premises of accused No.1 and collected three samples of fertilizer in question and got one
sample analyzed through Assistant Fertilizer Control Laboratory Dharwad, reanalyzed at
Commissioner of Agriculture, Sheshadri Road, Bangalore and Analytical Chemist, Fertilizer Control
Laboratory, Aurangabad. The analysis result state that the fertilizer is of sub-standard and
accordingly, the complaint is filed and the same is challenged in this petition.
5. During the course of the arguments, the learned Counsel for petitioner submits that as required
under Section 10 of the Essential Commodities Act, the company is not arraigned as accused and in
its absence, the petitioner is not liable to answer the charges.
6. On the other hand, the learned HCGP would submit that the action of the complainant in filing
the complaint and registering the case is justified and it is a matter for trial and it is for the
petitioner to prove his innocence during trial.

7. Heard the arguments and perused the records.
8. Admittedly, the charges leveled against the petitioner are that he has violated section 3 and
Clause 19 of the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985 read with Section 7 of the Essential Commodities
Act, 1955.
9. Section 10 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, deals with the offence by Companies and it
reads as follows:
10. Offences by companies.-- (1) If the person contravening an order made under section 3 is a
company, every person who, at the time the contravention was committed, was in charge of, and was
responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of the company as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and
punished accordingly:
Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any such person
liable to any punishment if he proves that the contravention took place without his
knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent such contravention.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where an offence under
this Act has been committed by a company and it is proved that the offence has been
committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the
part of any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such
director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of that
offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
10. Perusal of Section 10 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 makes it evident that wherever
contravention is by a Company, then every person who, at the time the contravention was
committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of
the company as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be
liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Therefore, petitioner is being made liable
on account of he being an employee of Company in question and as such, until and unless the
company is arraigned as accused, the petitioner cannot be held responsible.
11. In fact, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Aneeta Hada Vs. Godfather Travels and Tours Private Limited1
while considering the offence committed by the company has held as follows:
"53. It is to be borne in mind that Section 141 of the Act is concerned with the
offences by the company. It makes the other persons vicariously (2012) 5 SCC 661
liable for commission of an offence on the part of the company. As has been stated by
us earlier, the vicarious liability gets attracted when the condition precedent laid
down in Section 141 of the Act stands satisfied. There can be no dispute that as the
liability is penal in nature, a strict construction of the provision would be necessitous
and, in a way, the warrant.

... ... ...
56. We have referred to the aforesaid
passages only to highlight that there has to be strict observance of the provisions
regard being had to the legislative intendment because it deals with penal provisions
and a penalty is not to be imposed affecting the rights of persons, whether juristic
entities or individuals, unless they are arrayed as accused. It is to be kept in mind
that the power of punishment is vested in the legislature and that is absolute in
Section 141 of the Act which clearly speaks of commission of offence by the company.
The learned counsel for the respondents have vehemently urged that the use of the term "as well as"
in the section is of immense significance and, in its tentacle, it brings in the company as well as the
Director and/or other officers who are responsible for the acts of the company and, therefore, a
prosecution against the Directors or other officers is tenable even if the company is not arraigned as
an accused. The words "as well as" have to be understood in the context.
59. In view of our aforesaid analysis, we arrive at the irresistible conclusion that for maintaining the
prosecution under Section 141 of the Act, arraigning of a company as an accused is imperative. The
other categories of offenders can only be brought in the drag-net on the touchstone of vicarious
liability as the same has been stipulated in the provision itself. We say so on the basis of the ratio
laid down in C.V. Parekh [(1970) 3 SCC 491 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 97] which is a three- Judge Bench
decision. Thus, the view expressed in Sheoratan Agarwal [(1984) 4 SCC 352 : 1984 SCC (Cri) 620]
does not correctly lay down the law and, accordingly, is hereby overruled. The decision in Anil Hada
[(2000) 1 SCC 1 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 174] is overruled with the qualifier as stated in para 51. The
decision in Modi Distillery [(1987) 3 SCC 684 :
1987 SCC (Cri) 632] has to be treated to be restricted to its own facts as has been
explained by us hereinabove."
12. In the light of the above judgment and having regard to the fact that the company
is not arraigned as accused, I am of the considered opinion that the complaint is not
tenable as against the petitioner and therefore, the proceedings are liable to be
quashed insofar as the petitioner is concerned. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the
following:
ORDER The Criminal petition is allowed.
The impugned proceedings in C.C.No.961/2022 on the file of Civil Judge and JMFC,
Banahatti, as against the petitioner/accused No.2, is hereby quashed.
In view of disposal of the matter, pending interlocutory applications, if any, do not
survive for consideration and are disposed of accordingly.
