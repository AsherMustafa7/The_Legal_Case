2. The Deputy Commissioner – II, Large Tax Payers Unit, Chennai (hereinafter referred to as the
'Deputy Commissioner' for clarity and convenience) by Order No. CST – 32911/2008-2009 dated
30.01.2014 had determined the liability for the year 2008-2009 under the Central Sales Tax Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94081490/ 3
Mahindra & Mahindra Limited vs The Joint Commissioner (C.T) Appeals on 19 November, 2020
1956 (hereinafter referred to as the 'CST Act' for short), in respect of the Petitioner, who preferred
an appeal in A.P. No. 24 of 2014 against that order under the CST Act, before the Joint
Commissioner (CT) Appeals, Chennai (hereinafter referred to as the 'Joint Commissioner' for clarity
and convenience).
3. The Deputy Commissioner by Order No. CST – 32911/2013-14 dated 16.09.2014 had determined
the liability for the year 2013-2014 under the CST http://www.judis.nic.in W.P. Nos. 32257, 33878
and 33879 of 2015 Act, in respect of the Petitioner, who preferred an appeal in A.P. No. 159 of 2014
against that order under the CST Act, before the Joint Commissioner.
4. The Joint Commissioner by order dated 06.03.2015 disposed the aforesaid appeals holding as
follows:-
“13. In view of the aforestated discussion, it is very clear that the appellants have
purchased “software”, an intangible item, against Form-C declarations
mis-representing that they were eligible to purchase the alleged “good” at the time of
purchase and that it would be used in the manufacturing process and there by they
have committed the offences under section 10 (b) and 10 (d) of the CST Act.
Therefore, I am of the view that the penalty levied by the Deputy Commissioner (CT)-II, Large Tax
Payers Unit, under section 10-A of the Act in the impugned orders for the years 2008-09 and
2013-14 is sustainable in law. However, I have to interfere with the quantum of penalty in the
impugned orders. The authority has levied a penalty of Rs. 2,82,49,200/- for the year 2008-09
(AP.24/2014) and Rs.5735625/- (AP.159/2014) http://www.judis.nic.in W.P. Nos. 32257, 33878
and 33879 of 2015 being the 150% of the tax due on the purchase of “software”. The authority has
not given any findings on records as to the reasons which compelled him to levy maximum penalty.
The discretion in fixing the quantum of penalty cannot be exercised arbitrarily but has to be
reasonable and just as held by the Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in the case of Sai Electricals (P)
Ltd, reported in 107 STC 1997. In view of the above position, I restrict the penalty levied in the
impugned orders to 100% of the tax due to meet the ends of justice.
In fine the appeals are PARTLY MODIFIED and PARTLY DISMISSED.” The Petitioner has received
a copy of that order on 13.05.2015 as per the Counter-Affidavit dated 05.11.2020 filed by the First
Respondent.
5. In furtherance to the aforesaid order passed by the First Respondent, Garnishee Order No. TIN:
33510640011 dated 07.10.2015 was issued to Standard Chartered Bank, where the Petitioner was
having its banking accounts.
http://www.judis.nic.in W.P. Nos. 32257, 33878 and 33879 of 2015
6. At that stage, the Petitioner has on 08.10.2015 filed W.P. No. 32257 of 2015 challenging the
common order dated 06.03.2015 in A.P. Nos. 24 and 159 of 2014 passed by the Joint Commissioner.
The Petitioner has on 19.10.2015 filed W.P. No. 33878 of 2015 challenging Order No. CST –

Mahindra & Mahindra Limited vs The Joint Commissioner (C.T) Appeals on 19 November, 2020
32911/2008-2009 dated 30.01.2014 and the consequential Garnishee Order No. TIN:
33510640011 dated 07.10.2015 passed by the Deputy Commissioner, and W.P. No.
33879 of 2015 challenging Order No. CST – 32911/2013-2014 dated 16.09.2014 and
the consequential Garnishee Order No. TIN: 33510640011 dated 07.10.2015 passed
by the Deputy Commissioner.
7. It requires to be noticed here that the Petitioner was entitled to prefer appeal against the common
order dated 06.03.2015 in A.P. Nos. 24 and 159 of 2014 passed by the Joint Commissioner under
Section 58 of the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the 'TNVAT Act'
for short), within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt before the Tamil Nadu Service Tax
Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the 'TNSTAT' for short) as mentioned in the note of
that order itself, who has been empowered to condone delay in filing such appeal for an extended
period of 60 days, if sufficient cause for not preferring appeal within that period is made out.
However, the Petitioner did not prefer any such appeal before the TNSTAT, but
http://www.judis.nic.in W.P. Nos. 32257, 33878 and 33879 of 2015 has instead filed W.P. No.
32257 of 2015 on 08.10.2015 challenging the order passed by the Joint Commissioner beyond the
maximum limitation period of 120 days from the date of receipt of copy of that order.
8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Assistant Commissioner (CT) LTU, Kakinada -vs- Glaxo
Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Limited (Order dated 06.05.2020 in Civil Appeal No. 2413 of
2020) has emphatically laid down that the High Court in the exercise of powers under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India ought not to entertain Writ Petition assailing the order passed by a
Statutory Authority which was not appealed against within the maximum period of limitation before
the concerned Appellate Authority.
9. The Order No. CST – 32911/2008-2009 dated 30.01.2014 and the Order No. CST –
32911/2013-2014 dated 16.09.2014 passed by the Deputy Commissioner have merged with the
common order dated 06.03.2015 in A.P. Nos. 24 and 159 of 2014 passed by the Joint Commissioner
and as such, the orders of the Deputy Commissioner cannot be independently challenged. As already
noticed, the Writ Petition challenging the order of the Joint Commissioner has not been filed within
the maximum limitation period of 120 days from the date of receipt of copy of that order. The
Petitioner has not http://www.judis.nic.in W.P. Nos. 32257, 33878 and 33879 of 2015 shown any
infirmity in the Garnishee Order No. TIN: 33510640011 dated 07.10.2015 issued by the Deputy
Commissioner to Standard Chartered Bank for the recovery of the tax liability determined against
the Petitioner. Having regard to that legal position, it is not possible for this Court to express any
view on the correctness or otherwise on the merits of the controversy involved in the matter.
In the result, the Writ Petitions, which cannot be entertained, are dismissed. Consequently, the
connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed. No costs.
