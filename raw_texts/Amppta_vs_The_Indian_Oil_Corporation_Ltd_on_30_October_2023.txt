ORDER
(CAV) [A. Guneshwar Sharma, J] [1] Heard Mr. H.S. Paonam, learned senior counsel assisted by
Mr. S. Gunabanta, advocate appearing for the applicants, Mr. L. Shashibhushan, learned senior
counsel assisted by Mr. K. Kamei, advocate appearing for the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and Mr. S.
Nepolean, learned Government Advocate appearing for the State respondent.
[2] The present application has been filed by the applicants/writ petitioners under Section 151 of
Cr.P.C. for closing the W.A. No. 39 of 2018.
[3] The applicants/writ petitioners filed W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017 challenging the validity and
correctness of the NIT dated 10.11.2027 issued by the Deputy General Manager, IOC (OPS),
Guwahati, Indian Oil Corporation inviting tenders "for Road Transportation of Bulk Petroleum
Products White Oil".
[4] The writ petitioner association is a registered society under the Manipur Societies Registration
Act, 1989. The association was formed in the year 1981-82 by the transporters of POL products and
its members are the owners of the Tank Trucks/Oil Tankers (hereinafter referred to as "the TTs")
who have been rendering their services for bridging input in respect of Petrol, Kerosene and Diesel
oil in the State of Manipur from other States through NH-2 and NH-37. Keeping in mind the
circumstances obtaining in the State of Manipur, the IOC Ltd. used to issue NIT for the State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160020221/ 2
Amppta vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd on 30 October, 2023
Manipur only in respect of TTs with a carrying capacity of 12 KL for a total of 534 TTs with the
condition that the bidders will have to offer minimum three TTs, out of which one should be owned
by him/it.
[5] Deviating from the earlier practice and procedure, the NIT dated 10.12.2017 was issued by the
General Manager, IOC (OPS), Guwahati inviting tenders "for Road Transportation of Bulk
Petroleum Products - White Oil" for three locations, namely (i) Tinsukia / Digboi Terminal, (ii)
Dimapur Depot and (iii) Malom Depot, Imphal. As per the scope of work, the NIT invited tenders in
respect of 11 to 12 KL for 247 TTs as compared to earlier tender for 534 TTs and 18 KL and above up
to 40 KL for 336 TTs with the aim and object to outs or negate the service of the State TT owners
and to attract/please the outside POL businessman only.
[6] Being aggrieved by the said NIT, the writ petition has been filed on the ground that :
(a) The NIT was issued with a view to oust the members of the petitioners association
who have rendered their services despite they being exposed to various threats,
frequent landslides and meeting illegal road taxes imposed by various underground
organizations. However, they have been rendered ineligible to compete with the
outsides in the tenders, as many of them do not own two TTs registered in their
names.
(b) The rate fixed by the IOC Ltd. in the NIT is unreasonable, as the same had been
fixed at a rate lower than the one fixed in the year 2013-14 completely ignoring the
escalation of price/cost with respect to maintenance of vehicle; salary of the
driver/handyman and essential items.
(c) In the NIT, the security deposit was increased to Rs. 5,00,000/-
from Rs. 3,00,000/- although the rate quotation was decreased from that of the previous year
within an average range between 12% and 14% without considering the increasing cost factor due to
GST.
(d) The bidders will have to offer minimum three TTs, out of which two will be owned by him/it
deviating from the earlier eligibility criteria whereby the bidders will have to offer minimum three
TTs, out of which he/it will own at least TT. The members of the petitioners association have been
rendered incapacitated as most of them do have only TT registered in their names. In order to make
eligible, the members of the petitioners association are required to purchase at least one more TT
costing about 20 to 25 lakhs in a short period of time.
(e) The Retail Outlet Dealers (hereinafter referred to as "the ROs") under EOI (Expression of
Interest) performance clause as reflected at Page No. 5 of 98 of the NIT is also quite offensive to the
petitioners association as the NIT allowed the ROs to participate in the tender as on date. There are
about 101 TTs under EOI and allowing them to participate in the NIT amounts to granting double
benefits/chances to them and a number of 110 TTs belonging to the General Transporters will have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160020221/ 3
Amppta vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd on 30 October, 2023
to remain idle or wasted without their being utilized. This amounts to unequal treatment meted out
to the members of the petitioners association.
(f) The NIT invited tenders from TT owners having a capacity of 21 to 40KL for 334 Oil Tankers but
since none of the local transporters own such vehicle as the registration thereof is not possible in
Manipur, the offer is un-favourable to the transporters from the State of Manipur. The TTs having
capacity of 24KL and 29KL were introduced only during February, 2017 to June, 2017 by way of
gateway notice. The introduction of 21 KL to 40 KL in the NIT with different rates, for the first time
in the State of Manipur, affects the level playing field.
(g) Deviations in the NIT, from that of the earlier one, have been made without taking into
consideration the situation prevailing in the State but with the aid and advice of the Assam based
Transporter Association. The IOC Ltd. has completely overlooked the sacrificial services rendered by
the members of the petitioners association during natural as well as manmade crisis when there is
scarcity of petrol in the State of Manipur.
[7] Another writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 933 of 2017 has been filed by 3 (three) writ petitioners
for setting aside the NIT dated 10.11.2017 issued by the Deputy General Manager, IOC(OPS),
Guwahati, Indian Oil Corporation for tender "for Road Transportation of Bulk Petroleum - White
Oil".
[8] Another writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 545 of 2018 has been filed by the writ petitioner for
quashing and setting aside the e-mail dated 12.06.2018 under the subject "Offer for acceptance of L1
rate" when the NIT under Tender ID : 2017-NEISO-64145-1 is pending for finalization.
[9] Vide common judgment and order dated 25.08.2018, three writ petitions being W.P.(C) No. 882
of 2017, W.P.(C) No. 933 of 2017 and W.P.(C) No. 545 of 2018 are allowed and consequently, the
NIT dated 10.11.2017 and the e-mail dated 12.06.2018 are quashed and set aside with no order as to
costs. However, it is open to the IOD Ltd. to float a new NIT keeping in mind the observations made
in the common judgment and order.
[10] Being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 25.08.2018, the IOC preferred 3 (three) writ
appeals being W.A. No. 38 of 2018 against W.P.(C) No. 933 of 2017; W.A. No. 39 of 2018 against
W.P.(C) No 882 of 2017 and W.A. No. 40 of 2018 against W.P.(C) No. 545 of 2017.
[11] During the pendency of the writ appeals, no interim order was passed by this Court. It is stated
that without obtaining any leave from this Court, another NIT being Tender No.
RCC/ERO/37/2021-22/PT-216, E- tender ID 2022 ERO 148215 dated 02.03.2022 whereby many
new conditions have been introduced in great deviation of from the earlier NIT even to the extent of
reducing number of TTs in respect of 11-12 KL to 121 which was originally 534 in 2017 NIT to 212 in
the fresh NIT mentioned above.
[12] The IOC appellant herein issued an order on 14.03.2022 notifying about the cancellation of the
tender published on 10.11.2017 which was the subject matter of the writ petitions under appeal in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160020221/ 4
Amppta vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd on 30 October, 2023
the above referred writ appeals. The cancellation order was uploaded in their website knowing fully
about the prevailing circumstances.
[13] The writ appeal filed by the appellant is for quashing and setting aside of the impugned
judgment and order of the learned Single Judge in its interference of the NIT of 2017 by quashing
and setting aside and thus, if the appeal is decided in favour of the appellant, the NIT of 2017 dated
10.11.2017 would stand revived and in the event appeals are decided against the appellant, applicant
writ petitioner will get the benefit of the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge
impugned in the present writ appeal and consequently, IOC would be legally obligated to issue a
fresh NIT in accordance with the observation made by the learned Single Judge. However, by
cancellation of the 2017 NIT on their own, the cause of the writ petition as well as writ appeals has
no longer survived and virtually it has become infructuous. Further, insisting on continuing the writ
appeal would be only academic consideration as well as from getting away from the omission and
commission in issuing the new NIT of 02.03.2022 in breach of the observation made by the learned
Single Judge which would not be legally permissible in the present facts and circumstances
obtaining as on today.
[14] It is submitted that as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of "Shipping Corporation
of India Ltd. vs. Machado Brothers and Ors." Which is gainfully quoted below as under :
"Thus, it is clear that by subsequent even if the original proceeding has become
infructuous, ex-debito justitiae, it will be the duty of the Court to take such action as
is necessary in the interest of justice, which includes disposing of infructuous
litigation. For the said purpose, it will be open to the parties to make application
under Section 151 CPC to bring to the notice of the Court the facts and circumstances
which have made the pending litigation infructuous. Of course, when such an
application is made, the Court will enquire into the alleged facts and circumstances to
find out whether the pending litigation has in fact become infructuous or not."
Therefore, the above referred writ appeal may be disposed of as infructuous having regard to the
subsequent event of issuance of the cancellation of NIT of 2017 by the IOC which is the subject
matter of the original writ petition. Cancellation of the NIT of 2017 by the IOC is reproduced herein

Amppta vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd on 30 October, 2023
PM tender:pdf corrigendum attached [15] It may be noteworthy to being on record
about the various action and order issued by the IOC Ltd. for circumventing the order
of this Court including undue favour to RO Dealers in the name of induction of TT for
the transportation of POL products by wholly ignoring the hard fact that it is the
member of the applicant association who has been continuously shouldering the
responsibility of transportation of POL product in the State since the very beginning
facing unfriendly environment and great life threatening obstacles and as on today
also there has not been any complaint against the service of the member of the
applicant. The IOC while ignoring the case of the General Transporters have
selectively taken up the case of RO who are in possession of TT lying without
utilization for transportation of POL to Malom Depot in the name of induction. The
proposal and recommendation reflects consideration on the part of IOC for those RO
dealers who are in possession of TT and difficulty in discharging their EMI and
Insurance premium annually which is a favoritism and discrimination shown to the
general transporters who are members of the applicant/writ petitioner who are also
facing the same problem and issue. Applicant for convenience and appreciation beg
to reproduce the portion of the proposal made on 09.08.2022 and approval accorded
in principle on 16.08.2022 as under:
"Proposal:
It is proposed that in-principle approval be accorded for induction of dealer owned
TTs into operations for taking supplies ex. Malom Depot (7D17)."
Therefore, applicant submitted that IOC writ appellant by their own action goes to show that they
will resort to any activities without limit for imposing their condition on the general transporters
irrespective of the order passed from the ends of this Court which is wholly against the
constitutional edifice of this country hence, passing of an appropriate order is highly called for so
that unbridle power exercise by IOC is restrained.
[16] Insisting on continuous induction to TTs of RO dealers for utilizing of POL at Malom Depot
from outside in addition to original intent of EOI relying on provision/clause in the NIT, it would be
best on the part of IOC to do away with the floating of NIT for general transporter so that they will
be free to utilize the TTs of ROs wherever and whenever situation demands as they claim without
any apprehension of litigation in the Court.
[17] The IOC filed replies to the counter affidavit stating that with regard to the statements made in
paragraph No. 4 and 5 of the application/Misc. Case, the deponent states that the appellants / IOCL
has already issued letters/Corrigenda on 11.12.2023 and 13.02.2023 for withdrawal of the EOI dated
09.04.2021 and General Tender dated 02.03.2022 as well as for revocation of earlier order dated
10.03.2022 whereby the NIT dated 10.11.2017 was cancelled/withdrawn. Thus, after the aforesaid
exercise undertaken by the IOCL, the writ petitions being W.P.(C) No. 195 of 2022 and 495 of 2021
filed by the applicants against the newly issued POL product transportation EOI and tender became
infructuous and were disposed of by this Court as such vide order dated 13.02.2023. Corrigenda

[18] The applicant filed rejoinder to the counter affidavit of the IOC stating that with reference to
para No. 6 of the affidavit-in-opposition under reply, deponent submits that the moment the EOI
dated 09.04.2021 and General Tender dated 02.03.2022 were floated after the disposal of W.P.(C)
No. 882 of 2017 & Ors., the writ appeal has become infructuous even though the legality of the fresh
tender are subjected to judicial review. It may be pertinent to mention here that this Court had
quashed and set aside the impugned NIT dated 10.11.2017 in W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017 with further
direction to float the NIT afresh by keeping in mind the observation made in the judgment and
order. Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel submits that after floating of the fresh tender, the
respondents shall be deemed to have been complied with the judgment and order passed in W.P.(C)
No. 882 of 2017 from their part. Now, the respondents cannot turn back the clock by canceling the
fresh NIT and re-instating the NIT dated 10.11.2017 which has been quashed by this Court. Further,
the NIT dated 10.11.2017 was cancelled by the appellants/respondents on the ground that the tender
has exceeded the validity date of 240 days without the leave of this Court on 11.03.2022. Therefore,
there is no reasonable ground for revoking the 10.02.2022 whereby the NIT dated 10.11.2017 was
cancelled and the appellants/respondents in the Misc. Case cannot re-instate the NIT dated
10.11.2017 legally as the same has been quashed and set aside by this Court in W.P.(C) No. 882 of
2017 & Ors. The respondents upon failure to complete the fresh tender process due to litigation
cannot turn back after more than 1 year subsequent to the floating of fresh tender to claim that they
have cancelled it and re-instate the earlier NIT dated 10.11.2017 to adjudicate the matter. Since the
aforesaid fresh tender was issued after the judgment and order passed in W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017
and cancellation of NIT dated 10.11.2017, the respondents have waived their right to challenge the
judgment and order dated 25.08.2018 passed in W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017 & Ors. Re-instating NIT
dated 10.11.2017 amounts to flogging dead horse as the same has been quashed and set aside by this
Court in W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017 and a fresh NIT was floated. It is also stated that ligitations cannot
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160020221/ 8
Amppta vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd on 30 October, 2023
be fought on trial and error basis. Respondents are accountable for their action and they cannot
change their stand one after another to suit their interest. Such action of the respondents has made
the legal proceedings before this Court a mockery in the eyes of the general public.
Further, it is submitted that the letter/notice dated 13.02.2023 which re-instates the Tender No. IO
AOD So/OPS/POL/PT-8 of 2017 dated 10.11.2017 directly amount to challenging the judgment and
order passed in W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017 and as such, this Court may intimate suo moto Contempt
proceedings against the respondents for willful and deliberate disobedience of the judgment and
order dated 25.08.2018 passed in W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017 & Ors.
[19] With reference to para no. 7 of the affidavit-in-opposition under reply, deponent submits that
statement of the respondents that the previous tender of 2017 stands revived for all intents and
purposes is contemptuous.
The respondents have tried to justify holding of fresh tender by stating that the earlier tender of
2017 has been cancelled on the ground that the tender has exceeded the validity date of 240 days.
Therefore, when the respondents failed to prevent passing of interim order staying the fresh tender,
the respondent cannot alter their stand and state that the EOI dated 09.04.2021 and General Tender
dated 02.03.2022 is cancelled and NIT dated 10.11.2017 is re-instated for all intents and purposes.
Respondents cannot be allowed to keep on changing their stand. The appellants/respondents ought
to have considered this legal aspect of the appeal becoming infructuous upon floating of fresh tender
and cancellation of the NIT of 2017 before taking those decisions. It is stated that the appellants
upon floating the fresh tender and cancelling the earlier NIT of 2017 are estopped from re-instating
the NIT of 2017. Before floating the NIT afresh and before cancelling the NIT of 2017, the
appellants/respondents ought to have taken leave of this Court since the appeal is pending.
However, by doing so, the respondents have waived their right to challenge the validity of the
impugned judgment and order passed in W.P.(C) No. 882 of 2017. Such act of the respondents for
reviving the NIT of 2017 is also barred by the principle of estoppels and doctrine of promissory
estoppel.
[20] We have gone through the materials on record and considered the rival submissions made at
bar. After floating fresh NIT by cancelling the impugned NIT of 2017, the cause in the writ petitions
as well as writ appeals has not survived anymore. The NIT of 2017 is no longer in existence after its
cancellation by IOC and floating new NIT in its place. Reviving the NIT of 2017 which was quashed
by learned Single Judge and cancelled by IOC itself during pendency of the appeals, will be on the
threshold of contempt of court. Accordingly, the application is allowed and writ appeal being WA
No. 39 of 2018 is closed.
[21] Since the applicant has filed only one application for closing of WA No. 39 of 2018, registry is
directed to list remaining writ appeals being WA Nos. of 38 of 2018 and 40 of 2018 on 21.11.2023
for further proceedings.
