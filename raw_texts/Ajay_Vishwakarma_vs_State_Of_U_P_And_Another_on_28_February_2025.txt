Ajay Vishwakarma vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
Azamgarh, pending in the court of 2nd Special Judge (S.C./S.T. Act), Azamgarh.
5. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that an FIR stood lodged on 22.04.2018 at 15:47 hours
against the applicant under Sections 354-B, 323, 506 IPC and 3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act, relatable to
the commission of offence on 15.04.2024, whereby when O.P. No.2 was sleeping with his family
members, then at 12:00 in the night, the applicant herein, started behaving in an indecent behaviour
and also tried to disrobe his daughter while removing the stole on account whereof there was a
ruckus created. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that first of all, none of the offences of
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 stand made out and
further according to him, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Hitesh
Verma Vs. State of Uttarakhand, (2020) 10 SCC 710 in particular paragraph-17, there has to be an
act, which tantamounts to act as a catalist in commission of the offence against SC/ST and merely
because the informant/victim is an SC/ST would not be sufficient. He further submits that the
present case is nothing but a counterblast, particularly, when proceedings under Section 156(3)
CrPC were initiated with respect to an incident dated 20.04.2018, wherein the accused herein was
marked as an accused in the said complaint. Apart from the same, one Mukesh son of Sri Ram was
also there along with the others and the incident took place on 20.04.2018 at 08:00 hours when the
accused therein acted as a gang and with the help of cuddle and wooden stick inflicted injuries and
while inviting attention toward Annexure-9 at page 53 of the paper-book, it is submitted that though
FIR was lodged but subsequently summons were issued, but the applicant herein got himself
medically examined and the nature of the injuries were found to be simple. He submits that it is
nothing but a counterblast.
6. Learned A.G.A. on the other hand submits that whatever might be, the submissions made by the
applicant, however, what is to be seen is the fact as to whether offences stand committed under the
SC/ST Act and the invocation of the penal provisions under Section 3(2)(va) would apply or not is a
crucial factor and once, it has come on record that the applicant had attempted to disrobe the
daughter of O.P. No.2, then the offences surely are made out. He further submits that the medical
report at page-53 of the paper book shows that the applicant was put to medical examination by
himself on 20.04.2018, but the duration of the injuries are 2-3 days old. He submits that the theory
of counterblast would not come into play, particularly when there happens to be a pinpointed
allegation in the FIR.
7. I have heard learned counsel for the applicant as well as the learned A.G.A. The first and foremost
question, which would fall for consideration before this Court wold be as to whether invocation of
the provisions under Sections 3(2)(va) of SC/ST Act would apply or not. Section 3 contains the
heading 'Punishment for Offences Atrocities' and clause va deals with the words "commits any
offence specified in the Schedule, against a person or property, knowing that such person is a
member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe or such property belongs to such member, shall
be punishable with such punishment as specified under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) for such
offences and shall also be liable to fine". A schedule has been appended according to which 354-B
talks about assault or use of criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intent to
disrobe. Interestingly, the words used are "intent to disrobe".

8. Apparently, the allegations contained in the FIR speaks about disrobing the daughter of O.P. No.2
by an act or omission of the applicant. Thus the provisions would come into play. Now, the question
arises whether the present case can be termed to be a counterblast or not. Though the applicant has
sought to argue that with relation of an incident dated 20.04.2018 at 08:00 hours, the applicant
along with his son and others had administered beating with the aid of cuddle and wooden sticks
etc. and the applicant had taken himself for getting medically examined, however, the injuries
shown are 2-3 days old. In the opinion of the Court, it might be a defence that the applicant can take
at the time, when trial commences, showing the fact that a criminal proceeding has unnecessarily
been slapped upon him, but at this stage, this Court is not required to go into these factual aspects,
as the stage has yet not come. Apart from the same, what is to be seen in the proceeding under
Section 482 CrPC/ 528 BNSS is the fact as to whether the offences are made out and once the same
is apparent on the face of the record, then delving into factual issues is not required.
9. Accordingly, no interference is required at this stage. The application is consigned to record.
10. At this stage, learned counsel for the applicant submits that a direction be issued for
consideration of the bail.
11. This Court has no reason to disbelieve that in case applicant moves appropriate proceedings
before the court below for enlargement of bail, then the same may be decided with most expedition
in accordance with the law of the land.
