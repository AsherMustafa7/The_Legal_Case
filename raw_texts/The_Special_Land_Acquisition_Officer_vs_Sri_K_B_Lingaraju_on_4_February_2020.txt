JUDGMENT
Aggrieved by the order dated 17.08.2017 passed in W.P.Nos.34318-34322 of 2016 and
W.P.Nos.34323- 34326 of 2016 by the learned Single Judge, in allowing the writ petitions,
respondent nos.2, 3 and 4 therein have preferred this appeal.
2. Respondent nos.1 and 2 herein are said to be the owners of certain lands situated in Anagahalli
village, Srirangapatna Taluk, Mandya District, the acquisition of which by the appellant-Karnataka
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175072767/ 2
The Special Land Acquisition Officer vs Sri K B Lingaraju on 4 February, 2020
Industrial Area Development Board ('KIADB' for short) is the subject matter of this writ appeal.
3. The appellants issued a preliminary notification dated 15.09.2000 under Section 28(1) of the
Karnataka Industrial Area Development Act, 1966 (for short 'KIAD Act') and the final notification
dated 13.05.2005 under Section 28(4) of the KIAD Act acquiring the properties of respondent nos.1
and 2 herein.
4. The said notifications were challenged by respondent nos.1 and 2 by way of W.P.No.20195 of
2005. This Court vide order dated 15.10.2008 allowed the writ petition and quashed the
notifications reserving liberty to the appellants herein to proceed with the acquisition afresh, if they
intended to go ahead with it. This order was challenged by the KIADB in W.A.Nos.259-265 of 2009
and connected cases. By order dated 16.12.2010, the said writ appeals were allowed setting aside the
order passed by the learned Single Judge. The acquisition was upheld. However, it was made clear
that the land owners who had not received compensation during the pendency of the writ petition
shall be paid compensation based on the market value as obtained on the date of final notification
issued under Section 28(4) of the KIAD Act on 13.05.2005. A Special Leave petition was preferred
against the said order passed by the Division Bench of this Court and the same was dismissed on
18.01.2016 by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
5. However, the appellant-KIADB did not pass any award. It is noticed that after the disposal of the
writ appeals on 16.12.2010, there was no legal impediment for the KIADB to proceed with passing of
an award and thereby completing the process of acquisition. As there was inordinate delay in the
process of acquisition, respondent nos.1 and 2 herein preferred the instant writ petitions contending
that due to the inordinate delay in KIADB not passing the award, acquisition proceedings of the
lands in question should be declared as lapsed.
6. The learned Single Judge, while considering the rival contentions of respondent nos.1 and 2
herein and the appellants herein, held that the provisions of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013
has no application to the proceedings made under the KIAD Act and the challenge made to the
acquisition proceedings on the said ground is not sustainable.
7. However, the learned Single Judge noted that there was no legal impediment for the KIADB to
proceed with the acquisition after disposal of W.A.Nos.259-265 of 2009 vide order dated 16.12.2010
and they have not done so and nearly 7 years had since lapsed. The learned Single Judge relying
upon the judgments of the Apex Court in Tukaram Kana Joshi and Others through Power of
Attorney Holder vs. M.I.D.C and others reported in AIR 2013 SC 565 and Ramchand and Others vs.
Union of India reported in (1994)1 SCC 44 came to the conclusion that there is an obligation on the
part of the authorities to complete the acquisition proceedings and to make payment of requisite
compensation within a reasonable period.
8. The learned Single Judge also relied upon the decision of this Court in H.N.Shivanna and Others
vs. State of Karnataka and Another reported in (2013)4 KCCR 2793 (DB) to come to the conclusion
that the acquisition proceedings should be completed within a reasonable period and passing of the

The Special Land Acquisition Officer vs Sri K B Lingaraju on 4 February, 2020
award within two years after final notification would be reasonable. He further noted that there is a
delay of nearly 7 years in passing the award. It was not passed even on the date of hearing of the writ
petitions. On the said ground, the learned Single Judge held that the acquisition proceedings of the
lands in question have been declared as lapsed.
9. Aggrieved by the same, respondent Nos.2, 3 and 4 therein KIADB have preferred this writ appeal.
They have contended that there is no time limitation prescribed under the KIAD Act for passing of
successive notification and also the award. The appellants have further contended that once final
notification under Section 28(4) of the KIAD Act is issued, the lands stand vested in the State free of
all encumbrances by operation of law. According to them, once the lands vest with the State, the
acquisition is complete and if there is a delay in passing of the award, the land losers can seek for
passing of the award but the acquisition will not lapse. In support of their contentions, they have
relied upon the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Nagabhushana vs. State of Karnataka
and Others reported in AIR 2011 SC 1113, Grinar Traders vs. State of Maharashtra and Others
reported in (2011)3 SCC 1, Pratap and Another vs. State of Rajasthan and Others reported in (1996)3
SCC 1, Munithimmaiah v. State of Karnataka and Others reported in (2002)4 SCC 326, Offshore
Holdings Pvt. Ltd. vs. Bangalore Development Authority and Others reported in
MANU/SC/0060/2011, Delhi Development Authority vs. Sukhbir Singh and Others reported in
2016 SCC Online SC 929 and P.Narayanappa and Another vs. State of Karnataka and Others
reported in (2006)7 SCC 578.
10. None of the above cases pertain to the time limit within which the award needs to be passed.
They all pertain to the KIAD Act or similar enactments not being in pari materia with the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894, inapplicability of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, to acquisition made under the KIAD Act or
similarly placed enactments or vesting of the land upon issuance of final notification.
11. The proposition of law that though the KIAD Act is silent on the time limit within which the
award needs to be passed and compensation be disbursed to the land losers under the KIAD Act has
been examined in the case of H.N.Shivanna and Others vs. State of Karnataka and Another reported
in (2013)4 KCCR 2793 (DB). It has been observed at paragraph 39 as follows:
"39. From the aforesaid discussion, it is clear if a period is prescribed under the Act
for issue of a final declaration as well as for passing of the award, if the final
declaration is not issued and the award is not passed within the stipulated period, the
entire acquisition lapses, unless it is shown by virtue of any order of stay or
injunction issued by any Court, the authorities were precluded from completing the
acquisition proceedings. It is by operation of law as contained in the statute. Merely
because such a provision is not found in an enactment, it does not mean limitation is
not a bar at all. If such a prescription is not there expressly in any enactment it is not
possible to hold that such an acquisition has lapsed relying on the provisions
contained in the Land Acquisition Act. In other words, the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act cannot be read into the Act or such similar statutes. But nonetheless
in order to decide what is the reasonable time within which authorities have to

The Special Land Acquisition Officer vs Sri K B Lingaraju on 4 February, 2020
exercise their power either for issue of a final notification or for passing of the award
is concerned, certainly the Parliament intendment as contained in this provision
cannot be completely lost sight of. On the contrary, it acts as a guide. It expresses the
will of the Parliament. It has to be given due weight. When this acquisition
proceedings were delayed endlessly and land owners were deprived of just
compensation under law and consequently the constitutional right was violated, the
Parliament amended the Land Acquisition Act prescribing the time limit. According
to the Parliament, one year is the reasonable time for passing of a final declaration
and two years is the time for passing of an award. If within those periods the final
declaration is not issued, the award is not passed, the whole acquisition lapses. The
Act is enacted for industrial development which has to be done expeditiously."
Thus, as per the above decision, around two years would be a reasonable period for passing the
award. There was no legal impediment for the KIADB to pass the award in the instant case. But as
observed by the learned Single Judge, in spite of delay of nearly 7 years, the award was not yet
passed. Based on the said ground, the learned Single Judge held that the acquisition as lapsed in
respect of the lands concerned.
The appellants have not made out any good ground to interfere with the well reasoned order of the
learned Single Judge. Hence, the writ appeal is hereby dismissed.
