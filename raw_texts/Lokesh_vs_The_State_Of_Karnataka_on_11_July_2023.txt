Lokesh vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 July, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC-K:5260
CRL.A No. 200082 of 2019
JUDGMENT
This appeal under Section 374(2) of Cr.PC is filed challenging the impugned judgment and order
dated 2.4.2019 passed by the learned II Additional Sessions Judge, Kalaburagi in Special Case
(POCSO) No.06/2018, by which, the accused has been convicted for the offences punishable under
Sections 341, 354(A), 307, 504, 506, 376, 511 of IPC and Sections 8 and 18 of the POCSO Act, 2012
and he has been sentenced to undergo RI for a period of 10 years for the offence punishable under
Section 307 of IPC and fine of Rs.1,00,000/- , and sentenced to undergo RI and pay fine as
enumerated in the order of sentence.
2. The case of the prosecution is that, on 18.11.2017 at about 12.30 p.m., when CW1 - victim, who
was minor aged about 16 years, went near the lake to wash the clothes, the accused came there, held,
dragged and abused her in filthy language by putting knife to her neck, and threatened her life and
attempted to kill. When the victim tried to escape from the clutches of the accused, he bit on her left
hand forcibly, CWs.4 and 5 came to rescue her. Later the accused abused in filthy language, and ran
away from the spot. CWs.4 to 8 are the eye witnesses to the incident.
3. The learned Sessions Judge framed the charges and read over and explained the same to the
accused, to which, the accused denied, and pleaded not guilty, and claimed to be tried.
NC: 2023:KHC-K:5260
4. The prosecution to prove its case examined PWs.1 to 11 and exhibited the documents as Ex.P1 to
P15 and marked the material objects at MOs.1 to 7.
5. After completion of the evidence of prosecution, the incriminating circumstances found in the
evidence of prosecution witnesses were put to the accused as contemplated under Section 313 of
Cr.PC, to which, the accused denied. The learned Sessions Judge, after appreciating the evidence on
record, passed the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence. Hence, this appeal.
6. The learned counsel for the appellant - accused would submit that, in the absence of any material
on record that, the accused has committed sexual assault, or there was any attempt made by the
accused to cause death of the victim, and also in the absence of any intention to outrage modesty of
the victim, the impugned judgment passed by the learned Sessions Judge is not sustainable in law.
7. The learned High Court Government Pleader would submit that, the evidence on record
establishes that, the accused has committed the aforesaid offence, and the prosecution having
established the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt, the learned Sessions Judge has
rightly passed the impugned judgment, and the same does not warrant any interference.

NC: 2023:KHC-K:5260
8. Considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on
record.
9. PW1, in her examination-in-chief, has stated that, the accused used to roam around near her
house, pelt stones on the terrace of the house, and abuse her in filthy language. When she
questioned, the accused went away without responding. On 18.11.2017, when she and her mother
were going to the lake to wash clothes, at that time, the accused came, restrained them, holding a
club, and stated that, he has to speak to the victim, and thereafter, held her hand, and when she
tried to escape, the accused held a knife to her neck, and threatened her that, he would kill her.
When her mother came to rescue her, the accused pulled her, and bit her left hand, and when they
screamed, her maternal uncle, Shivasharanappa and Rudrappa, who are the residents of the village,
came to rescue them. Nothing was elicited in the cross-examination to disbelieve her statement.
Though the victim had not stated that, there was sexual assault, however, a suggestion was made in
the cross-examination that, the accused assaulted her with an intention to outrage her modesty. The
eye witnesses to the incident viz: PWs.2 and 3 have supported the case of the prosecution, and
nothing was elicited in the cross-examination to disbelieve their statements.
10. The incident having been proved by the prosecution, the point that arises for consideration is:
whether the allegation made against the accused constitutes the commission of offences of which he
is convicted.
NC: 2023:KHC-K:5260
11. To constitute an offence punishable under Section 307 of IPC, an act must be done by a person
with an intention or knowledge, if he by that act caused death. In the instant case, the allegation
against the accused is that, he put the knife to the neck of the victim. In the statement recorded
under Section 164 of Cr.PC, the victim has stated that, the accused threatened that, he would kill her
by stabbing with the knife. Either in the FIR, nor in the statement recorded under Section 164 of
Cr.PC, nor the statement of the eye witnesses, there is an allegation that, the accused had put the
knife to the neck of the victim, and the statement made in the examination-in-chief is an
improvement, and to that extent, the statement of the victim is not trustworthy or credible so as to
hold that, the accused is guilty of the offence punishable under Section 307 of IPC. The learned
Sessions Judge, the contrary to the evidence on record, has convicted the accused for the offence
punishable under Section 307 of IPC, and the same is not sustainable in law.
12. To constitute an offence punishable under Sections 376 and 511 of IPC, there is no allegation,
much less, any material so as to establish the circumstances so as to constitute the commission of
offence of rape as specified under Section 376 of IPC. Hence, in the absence of any evidence on
record so as to constitute the commission of offence under Sections 376 and 511 of IPC, the
impugned judgment of conviction insofar as it relates to convicting for the aforesaid offence is also
not sustainable in law.

NC: 2023:KHC-K:5260
13. To constitute an offence punishable under Section 8 of the POCSO Act, 2012, a person must have
touched the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis,
anus or breach of such person or any other person, or does any other act with sexual intent, which
involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault. In other words, a
person is said to have committed sexual assault if commits any act, which involves physical contact
with sexual intent.
14. To prove the guilt of the accused for the offence punishable under Section 8 of the POCSO Act,
the prosecution has to prove that, the accused with sexual intent held the hands of the victim.
However, the prosecution, in the instant case, has not established that, the accused held/pulled the
hands of the victim with sexual intent. Explanation appended to Section 11 of the POCSO Act
specifies that, any question which involves "sexual intent" shall be a question of fact. The ordinary
meaning of `sexual intent' means the decision to act in a manner in order to fulfill sexual desire.
15. The prosecution having failed to establish that, the accused held the hands of the victim with
sexual intent, the conviction of the accused for the offence punishable under Section 8 of the POCSO
Act is not sustainable in law.
16. To constitute an offence punishable under Section 354A of IPC, a man must have committed the
act of physical NC: 2023:KHC-K:5260 contact involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures. In
the instant case, the allegation is that, the accused held the hands of the victim, however, there is no
allegation that, the same involved unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures. Mere physical contact
without an intention to outrage modesty of the woman would not alone constitute the commission
of offence under Section 354A of IPC, unless the same involves unwelcome and explicit sexual
overtures. Hence, the conviction of the offence punishable under Section 354A of IPC is also not
sustainable.
17. Though the accused is not charged and convicted for the offence punishable under Section 324 of
IPC, however, the evidence on record clearly establishes that, the victim sustained simple injury due
to the act of the accused by biting her left hand, which is evident from the wound certificate at
Ex.P3. On re-appreciation of evidence on record, the prosecution has established the guilt of the
accused for the offence punishable under Sections 341, 504, 506 of IPC, and the conviction for the
aforesaid offences cannot be faulted with.
18. The accused was in judicial custody for more than 22 months. The offence punishable under
Section 323 of IPC is for a maximum period of one year or with fine or both. The prosecution having
established the guilt of the accused for the offence punishable under Section 323 of IPC, it would
suffice if the accused is sentenced to undergo SI for a period of one year with fine.

Lokesh vs The State Of Karnataka on 11 July, 2023
19. Insofar as the payment of fine amount, in the light of the interim order granted by this Court, the
accused has deposited 50% of the total fine amount, which comes to Rs.1,35,250/-. It would suffice
that, the said fine amount is adjusted to the fine amount to be paid by the accused for the offence of
which he is held guilty for the offence punishable under Sections 341, 504, 506, 323 of IPC .
20. The accused having already served the sentence for about 22 months, it would suffice that the
remaining period of sentence is hereby set off. Accordingly, I pass the following:
ORDER
i) Criminal appeal is allowed in part.
ii) The impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence insofar as it relates to
conviction for the offence punishable under Sections 307, 354-A, 376 read with
Section 511 of IPC and Section 8 and 18 of the POCSO Act is hereby set aside and the
accused is acquitted of the said offences.
iii) The accused is convicted for the offence punishable under Section 323 of IPC and sentenced to
pay fine of Rs.1,14,250/- and the same is adjusted out of the fine amount already deposited by the
accused in the light of the order passed by this Court, and the conviction of the accused for the
offences punishable under Sections 504, 506 and 341 of IPC is confirmed.
- 10 -
NC: 2023:KHC-K:5260
iv) Out of the total fine amount, a sum of Rs.75,000/- to be released in favour of the victim viz: PW1
and the balance amount to be released in favour of the State Government.
