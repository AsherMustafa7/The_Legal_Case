IX. Summons issued under Section 50(3) of PMLA:
Sl.No. Case No.
2. The respondents on service of notice of these writ petitions have appeared and
filed their statement of objections and have denied the averments made in the
petition. In W.P.No.38642/2016 it has been contended that Ankola Police Station
had registered an FIR 245/2013 against Mr.Vivek Kumar and three unknown persons
for the offence punishable Under Section 302, 353 & 307 IPC read with Section 34
IPC and Section 25 & 27 of the Arms Act for killing Sri R.N.Naik, an Industrialist and
Co-
operative leader from Ankola and on completion of investigation, charge sheet has been filed under
various provisions of IPC, Indian Arms Act, 1959 (for short 'Arms Act') and Karnataka Control of
Organised Crime Act, 2000 ('KCOCA' for short) against Sri Bannanje Raja @ BR and 11 others for
indulging in underworld activities and during course of investigation, it was unearthed that the
money required for the said illegal activities was arranged from Dubai through Hawala channels by
person named Sri Hajee Ameen Basha operating from Dubai and the offences under IPC and Arms
Act as indicated in the charge sheet being scheduled offences under Section 2(1)(y) of PML Act, a
prima-facie case of money laundering having been made out, an Enforcement Case Information
Report ('ECIR' for short) was registered by the Directorate of Enforcement (for short 'ED'). It is
further contended that supplementary charge sheet filed, Mr.Hajee Ameen Basha and three others
were added as accused for indulging in underworld activities involving life threats, extortion,
murder and supply the money through Hawala channels for criminal activities.
3. It is further contended that second respondent is conferred with the powers under section 5(1) of
PML Act read with Rule 3 of Rules to pass provisional attachment order. It is also contended that
under section 5(5) of PML Act, a complaint has been filed before the adjudicating authority and
same is pending and now adjudicating authority now having issued show cause notice under section
8 of the Act, the petitioners without replying to the same, cannot seek remedy in these writ petitions
and as such, the petitions are liable to be dismissed.
4. In W.P.Nos.38642/2016, 15917/2013 & 15974/2013, 15918/2013 & 15961/2013, 23176- 77/2016,
33740/2016, 24480/2018, 41176/2017 and 24444/2015, the contesting respondents have filed their
statement of objections traversing the writ petition averments wherein it is contended that writ
petitioners have alternate remedy of filing an appeal when there is a final order passed under
Section 26 of PML Act and where the provisional order is passed, it requires to be confirmed under
Section 8(3), as otherwise, such provisional attachment would get spent itself. Hence, without there
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 38
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
being a challenge to the confirmatory order by filing an appeal, the present writ petitions where the
order confirming the provisional attachment has been passed is not require to be entertained.
5. It is contended that the impugned notices issued under Section 8 is in consonance with Section 8
of PML Act. It is also contended that dehorse the report under Section 173 CrP.C., the authorities
under PML Act are empowered to conduct independent investigation and as such, the final report of
the police cannot by itself form the basis for the respondent - authorities to exercise the power. It is
further contended that Directorate of Enforcement would initiate prosecution separately by filing a
complaint under Section 45(1) read with Section 3 and 4 for the offence of money laundering and
not for schedule offence. It is also contended that offence of money laundering is an independent
offence. It is contended that proceedings initiated under PC Act by the Lokayukta or CBI are entirely
different from the proceedings initiated by respondents for the offence punishable under PML Act.
It is also contended that money laundering offence is a continuing offence as it involves three stages
namely, placement, layering and integration. On the issue of retrospective effect or continuing
offence, it is contended that in case of a continuing offence, the ingredients of the offence continued
i.e., endure even after the period of consummation, whereas, in an instantaneous offence, offence
takes place once and for all, when the same actually takes place. In such cases, there is no continuing
offence even though the damage resulting from the injury may itself continue. Hence, the
amendments made under the Act neither created the new offence nor enhanced the punishment nor
changed the procedure or forum of trial to the prejudice of accused. It is also contended that it
would only be a procedural in nature and can have retrospective effect.
6. By relying upon circular No.8/2015 issued by the Director of Enforcement, it is contended that
Deputy Director is authorized to issue order of provisional attachment of properties and
accordingly, provisional orders of attachment have been issued. Contending that Deputy Director is
empowered to issue provisional attachment and also file a complaint under Section 5(5) of the Act
under authorization issued by the Director (delegation of power) the orders of provisional
attachment is sought to be sustained. It is also contended, it would suffice if the authority has
recorded in its file the "reasons to believe" that such person/s is/are in possession of proceeds of
crime or involved in money laundering, it would meet the requirement of Section 8(1) and it is to be
read along with Section 8(2), which only mandates issuance of notice to show cause. Contending
that PML Act is a special enactment and would prevail over any other enactment inconsistent
therewith and also contending that when both Acts are special Acts, the later Act would prevail, they
have sought to repel the contentions raised. The entertainment of "reasonable belief" is sufficient for
provisional order of attachment to be passed. It is further contended that "person" referred to in
Section 5 is not restricted to a person accused of a crime.
7. It is further contended that expression "any property" occurring in sub-section (1) of Section 5
encompasses not only the property of a person who is accused of a schedule offence but any other
person who involves himself in money laundering and such person can also be roped in for the
purposes of investigation and attachment of his property under Section 5 of the PML Act. Hence, the
person who is not charged of a predicate offence would also come within the sweep of PML Act.

Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
8. Insofar as the absence of full quorum consisting of Chairman and two members to constitute an
Adjudicating Authority raised by the petitioners as a ground to assail the impugned order as one
without jurisdiction is rebutted by contending as Sections 6(13), 6(14) & 6(15) would clearly indicate
that in the event of vacancy in the office of Chairperson due to death, resignation or otherwise or if
the Chairperson of the adjudicating authority is unable to discharge his functions due to absence,
illness or any other causes, the senior most member of the adjudicating authority would discharge
the functions of chairperson until the date on which new chairperson is appointed in accordance
with the provisions of the Act to fill such vacancy. Referring to Section 6(5)(a & b), it is contended
that if the Bench hearing the original complaint consists of only one member, it would satisfy the
mandate of law and the order passed by such adjudicating authority consisting of one member
cannot be rejected.
9. It is also contended that Section 5 empowers the Director to "AUTHORISE" Officers not below
the rank of Deputy Director for the purposes of Section 5 of the PML Act and the Director of
Enforcement as such would be empowered to authorize all Deputy Directors of Enforcement to
attach the property under Section 5. It is also contended that under Section 49(1) of PML Act, the
Central Government has appointed the Deputy Director of Foreign Exchange Management Act as
the Deputy Director for the purposes of PML Act by order dated 06.02.2005 which has been duly
gazetted on 13.09.2005.
On these grounds amongst others raised in the statement of objections, respondents have sought for
dismissal of writ petitions.

Prasanna Kumar, Ashok M Patil, N Sukumar Jain, Reshma Thammaiah, Jidesh Kumar M.D.,

11. It is the contention of Sri P N. Manmohan, learned Advocate appearing for petitioners in
W.P.Nos.38642/2016, 27705/2017 & 28586-587/2018 that respondents have proceeded to pass the
impugned order of attachment on the basis of assumptions and presumptions namely, on the
ground that petitioners have invested the amount in purchasing the property as indicated in the
impugned order as though it is from proceeds of the crime. He would submit that Section 5 of the
PML Act provides an explanation which enables the authority to attach the property if any person is
in possession of proceeds of crime or a person being charged of having committed a scheduled
offence and if such person is likely to transfer or deal with the said property in any manner which
may result in frustrating any proceedings relating to confiscation of such proceeds of the crime and
when petitioners are neither accused nor having been charged for any of the schedule offence and
there being no prima-facie material against petitioners, impugned order could not have been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 40
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
passed. He would contend that provisional order cannot be given retrospective effect and in the
instant case, the alleged offence has taken place in the year 2013 and as on the said date, the offence
alleged did not find a place in the Schedule to the PML Act and as such, impugned order is liable to
be set aside. He would draw the attention of the court to contend that accused Ameen Basha was
absconding and based on his call details, proceedings against petitioners has been initiated on the
ground they have purchased the properties from the monies generated through proceeds of crime.
He would submit there is no dispute to the fact that all these monies having been transferred on-line
and properties were purchased in Mangalore even prior to the offence alleged i.e., schedule offence.
He would draw the attention of the court to the expression "has reason to believe" would acquire
significance for initiating proceedings and such reasons are not forthcoming under the impugned
orders. He would submit that Section 22 of PML Act draws a presumption that when the properties
standing in the name of a particular person, it shall be presumed that property belongs to that
person. In the light of said presumption, it is not open for the respondents to say that consideration
paid by the petitioners for purchase of the property is to be construed as proceeds of crime. He
would further contend that to record "reasons to believe" there should be basis and if not, it would
be without jurisdiction.
11.1) He would also contend that offence has occurred in India and money is transferred from Dubai
and there is no compliance of Section 2(1)(ra) of PML Act. When money was transferred from Dubai
i.e., outside India, the offence has not occurred at all. He would also contend Section 55 of PML Act
deals with definition of 'Contracting State' and section 56 refers to agreement between foreign
countries and section 57 deals with letter of request to contracting state in certain cases and reading
of these provisions together does not indicate that any offence has been committed by the
petitioners at Dubai, which is a condition precedent for invoking proceedings under PML Act as
indicated in Section 2(1)(ra) of PML Act. Therefore, very initiation of proceedings is bad in law.
11.2) His next limb of argument is, prior to 2013 amendment, Section 5(a) and Section 2(u) defined
proceeds of crime and against whom proceedings can be initiated and it included only a person who
was accused of the offence alleged. However, by 2013 amendment, it took away said requirement
and the provision included 'any person' and thus, whether a person is accused or otherwise is
sufficient for proceeding under the PML Act. The alleged incident having taken place prior to the
amendment, the amended provision cannot be made applicable or in other words, petitioners
cannot be proceeded for an offence which was not in existence and thereby the action of the
respondents would be hit by Article 20 of the Constitution of India. He would also contend that
alternate remedy of appeal which has been canvassed by the respondents to stave off the claim of the
petitioners is liable to be rejected as the issue raised in the writ petitions is one of jurisdiction and as
such, he prays for allowing the writ petition by quashing the impugned orders.
He has relied upon the following judgments in support of his contentions:

Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
12. Sri Swaroop Anand, learned Advocate appearing for petitioners in W.P.No.15917/2013 &
15974/2013 and 15918 & 15961/2013 would contend that petitioner in W.P.No.15917/2013 was
accused No.9 in a scheduled offence numbered as Spl.C.C.135/2011 and FIR pertaining to said
charge sheet was filed on 01.12.2010 in Crime No.57/2010 and after investigation, charge sheet
came to be filed in July, 2011. Offences alleged against petitioner is under 420 & 506 IPC. Offences
that are alleged against petitioner in the scheduled offence pertaining to the period 2007-08.
Provisional order of attachment was passed on 25.09.2012; he would contend that allegations
against the petitioner for the predicate offence is that he was a broker and was responsible for
disbursement of certain compensation to certain people for lands that came to be acquired and
agency which was responsible for disbursement of compensation had taken the assistance of the
accused, who had felicitated for payment of bribe and in that regard, it has been alleged that
petitioner was responsible for cheating certain land owners of compensation. He would contend that
scheduled offences alleged against petitioner has been quashed on 03.11.2016 by this court in
Crl.P.No.2313/2016 and when there is no predicate offence pending against petitioner, question of
proceedings under PML Act does not arise. He would fairly submit that prosecution has challenged
the said order of quashing before Hon'ble Supreme Court and same is pending. A provisional order
of attachment came to be passed as against petitioner on 25.09.2012 under section 5(1) of PML Act
and as on the said date, 2013 amendment had not come into force. Under section 5(1) of PML Act,
the basis for initiation of proceedings is that a person should have been charged of a schedule
offence and having realized certain amount as proceeds of crime and should have attempted to
project said money as untainted money. He would submit that as on that date of complaint having
been filed, petitioner was not an accused for the predicate offence and no charges had been made
against him. When petitioner was not charged for the scheduled offence and criteria prescribed
under section 5(1) of the Act being absent, question of the authority being satisfied or having
reasons to believe that property had been purchased from the proceeds of crime, is erroneous.
12.1) He would also submit that mere filing of final report under Section 173 of Cr.P.C. would not
tantamount to charging the petitioner of a predicate offence. He would contend that criteria for
issuance of show cause notice under Section 8(1) of PML Act is that adjudicating authority upon
receipt of complaint under Section 5(5) of PML Act should have "reason to believe" that petitioner
has committed an offence under Section 3 or being in possession of proceeds of crime, which aspect
should be forthcoming from the complaint filed under Section 5(5) of PML Act and such order
should also be a speaking order as to how the adjudicating authority has arrived at a primafacie
case. Records do not disclose petitioner was in possession of proceeds of crime or having committed
an offence under Section 3 and even if any reasons are assigned, it ought to be communicated to the
petitioner under Section 8(1) which is not forthcoming from the notice dated 18.10.2012
(Annexure-C). He would contend that reading of clause (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 8 of
PML Act would indicate that order confirming the provisional attachment passed under sub-section
(1) of Section 5 would become final only on conclusion of trial and passing of confiscation order by a
Special court. Hence, he would contend impugned notice dated 28.03.2018 (Annexure-F) is
premature, highly illegal, arbitrary and liable to be quashed.
12.2) He would also submit that pursuant to impugned notice issued, petitioner had appeared before
the adjudicating authority and had filed a detailed reply on 10.12.2012 (Annexure-D), pursuant to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 43
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
which, matter was finally heard and reserved for orders on 03.01.2013 i.e., before Amendment Act 2
of 2013 came into force with effect from 15.02.2013 and the order of confirmation came to be passed
by the adjudicating authority after extracting the verbatim language found in the amended Section
8(3) as amended by Act 2 of 2013. He would contend that prior to Amendment Act 2 of 2013 came
into force, Section 8(3) as it stood and amended under Act No.21/2009 with effect from 01.06.2009
where the words "schedule offence before a court" was substituted with the words "offence under
this Act" and as such, the proceedings could not have been initiated against petitioners.
12.3) He would contend that entire crux of PML Act would revolve around the authorities exercising
jurisdiction by virtue of Section 2(u), which broadly defines "proceeds of crime" as referred to in the
penal provision Section 3. He would draw the attention of the court to the said provision pre and
post amendment, to contend that that prior to 2013 amendment, the endeavour of PML Act was to
completely co-relate the proceedings under PML Act to a schedule offence. He would contend that
requirement under Section 5(1) was that a person should be charged for the schedule offence.
Section 3 would indicate that a person should have knowingly received the proceeds of the crime
and this read along with Section 8(3) would confer the provisional attachment during the
subsistence of the proceedings before the jurisdictional court for the schedule offence. He would
contend that adjudicating authority decides under sub-section (2) that any property is involved in
money laundering, would confirm the attachment of property made under sub-section (1) of Section
5 as per the procedure contemplated under Section 8(3) of PML Act. He would draw the attention of
the court to post and pre amendment of sub-section (3) of Section 8 to contend that it is Sine qua
non that there should exist a proceeding under the Act relating to an offence under the Act, more
particularly a complaint under Section 45 of the Act should exist for an offence under Section 3
which is punishable under Section 4. Contending that by operation of law, when the provisional
attachment was confirmed on 22.02.2013, there was no complaint filed by respondent under
Section 45 of the Act for an offence under Section 3 punishable under Section 4. Hence, contending
that by virtue of sub-section (3) of Section 5, order of attachment made under sub-section (1) on
25.09.2012 cease to exist after the expiry of the period specified in sub-section (1) of Section 5 and
as such, it is liable to be quashed.
12.4) He would contend that complaint under Section 45 of PML Act was filed against petitioner in
March, 2014 and referring to Section 5(3) and Section 8(3)(b) as it stood prior to Amendment
carried out by Act 2 of 2013, he would contend that power of confiscation after confirmation of
provisional attachment was taken away. He would submit that sub-section (5) of Section 8 earlier
provided power of confirmation again back to the adjudicating authority, in the event of Special
court forming an opinion that such person is guilty of offence under Section 3, in which event,
petitioner had a one more chance to appear before the adjudicating authority and demonstrate as to
why the properties were not involved in the offence of money laundering. Thus, he would contend
the power to confiscate again vested back with the adjudicating authority, but by virtue of 2013
amendment, said power was taken away from the adjudicating authority and same was conferred
with the trial courts. Hence, he would contend, trial Court had to simultaneously decide as to
whether such person was guilty of the offence of money laundering under Section 3 and as to
whether properties that were attached were entitled for confiscation under Section 8(5). He would
also contend, two fold criteria for confirmation under Section 8(3) as per 2013 amendment is that

Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
firstly, there should exist proceedings for an offence under this Act and secondly, such provisional
order of attachment would become final upon order of confiscation being passed by the Special
Court. In this background, he would contend that in the instant case, firstly, there was no complaint
that was existing against the petitioner for an offence under the Act and secondly, there was no
complaint filed under Section 45 against the petitioner, as a result of which, the order of attachment
by operation of law as contemplated under Section 5(3) would get extinguished. He would also
contend that in case of petitioner, confirmation has not happened in terms of Section 8(3). Hence,
by operation of law, provisional attachment order dated 25.09.2012 passed against petitioner stood
extinguished.
12.5) He would submit that confirmation of attachment order should be read in terms of Section
8(3) and on account of the procedural defect under Section 8(3), the provisional attachment stood
automatically vacated or in other words, it has not continued by operation of law. He would submit
that requirement of Section 8(3) is, there should be an offence necessarily in existence under the
Act. He would submit that if the authorities had invoked 2009 amendment against petitioner, there
would have been absolutely no hurdle, as the provision then existing would specifically discloses
that existence of scheduled offence would suffice for confirmation. However, respondent -
authorities have specifically invoked the provisions as found in Amendment Act 2 of 2013 and on
account of attachment having not continued in terms of Section 8(3), by operation of law, Section
5(3) would surface and the provisional order of attachment passed under Section 5(1) would
automatically extinguish.
He has relied upon the following judgments in support of his contentions:

Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
13. It is the contention of Sri Udaya Holla that in W.P.Nos.4215/2017, 6159/2017, 6173/2017 &
8261/2017 that confirmation of provisional order of attachment passed by the adjudicating
authority on 21.02.2013 which is subsequent to amending Act of 2013 i.e. Act 2 of 2013 and the
language employed in the amended Section 8(3) has been applied and it does not satisfy the
requirement of Section 8(3), inasmuch as, there is no complaint under Section 45 of the Act for an
offence under Section 3 punishable under Section 4 of PML Act. In the instant case, he would
contend that complaint under Section 45 was filed on 24.3.2014 and thus by operation of law as
contemplated under Section 5(3), the provisional order of attachment in the instant case cease to
operate. Hence, the consequential notice issued is also bad in law.
13.1) Insofar as W.P.Nos.4215/2017, 6159/2017, 6173/2017 and 8261/2017 he would contend that
PML Act is a complete code by itself. He would also contend that impugned communication issued
to Association of Mutual Funds of India - AMFI being a company, is not a person and/or a listed
entity as mentioned in Section 54 of PML Act and the said provision enlists "certain officers" who
are to assist the authorities in the enforcement of the Act and it makes it clear that only officers who
are appointed under the statute and as such, Section 54 has no application. He would also contend
that AMFI is also not a "reporting entity" as defined under Section 2(wa) as indicated in Section
54(j) of the PML Act and as such, the purported exercise of jurisdiction by first respondent is illegal
and void.
13.2) He would also contend that it is only the Director or any other officer not below the rank of
Deputy Director authorized by him for the purpose of Section 17(1A) has the authority to exercise
the power on the basis of the information in his possession and has reason to believe. He would
contend that notice is issued by the Assistant Director who has no jurisdiction and as such, the
impugned communication is illegal, void and without jurisdiction and therefore, liable to be
quashed.
13.3) He would submit that within 30 days from the seizure or freezing, respondent No.1 has to take
steps to make an application in terms of Section 17(4) of PML Act for retention or continuation of
the order of freezing and such measures having not been taken, the proceedings are liable to be
quashed.
13.4) He would further contend before exercising the power of freezing or seizure, it is mandatory
requirement of respondent No.1 to provide its reasons to believe in writing and same is the mandate
under Section 17(1) of the PML Act. Hence, he has prayed for allowing the writ petitions.
He has relied upon the following judgments in support of his contentions:

14. Sri Kiran S Javali, learned Advocate appearing for petitioners in W.P.Nos.17894/2015,
18557/2017, 19313/2016, 24444/2015 27744/2018, 36309/2017, 48031-33/2017, 33740/2016,
36310/2017, 46318/2017, 23176-77/2016 & 39889/2014 has contended as under:
(a) That first proviso to Section 5(1) of PML Act as existed prior to 2013 amendment
would indicate that basis for arriving at a conclusion there are "reasons to believe" to
attach the property is traceable to report forwarded to a Magistrate under Section 173
of Cr.P.C. and this would be the foundation and in other words, if the final report
under Section 173 Cr.P.C. is not forwarded, the attachment proceedings cannot be
resorted to. He would contend that in the instant cases that proceedings initiated
prior to 01.06.2009 is void, inasmuch as, it is only from the said date, Section 13(1) of
PML Act was included into the schedule and only from that date, it would constitute a
crime for the purposes of PML Act and not prior to that and as such, proceedings
initiated under the PML Act prior to 01.06.2009 is void ab initio. He would that the
FIRs came to be filed subsequent to 01.06.2009 and as such, the proceedings
initiated under the PML Act are bad in law.
(b) He would also contend that under the unamended Section 8 of PML Act, confiscation can take
place only if the guilt of the accused has been proved before competent court and post 2013
amendment, the Special court has been given the power to confiscate the property which has been
attached. He would further contend that in Section 2(y) "schedule offence" has been defined and
under clause (ii) the monetary limit had been fixed at Rs.30 lakhs till 14.05.2015 and from
15.05.2015 it has been fixed at Rs.1 crore or more. He would submit that Clause (ii) was substituted
by Act 29 of 2009 with effect from 1.06.2009 and after Act, 2 of 2013 the schedule as indicated in
clause (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 2(y) has substantially changed and that it will have to be examined
on case to case basis, the entry in the schedules existing as on those dates and which relates to the
final report under Section 173 of Cr.P.C.
(c) He would draw the attention of the court to Section 5 to contend that initially order of
attachment was for a period of 90 days which was increased to 150 days and then to 180 days.
Secondly, by amending Act 2 of 2013 with effect from 15.02.2013, Sub-Section (1) of Section 5, the
expression "the Director" came to be inserted, which expression was not found earlier. He would
contend that by amending Act 22 of 2009, the proviso came to be amended. He would draw the
attention of the court to Sections 8 & 5 pre amendment of 2013, to contend that prior to 15.02.2013,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 47
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
the proceedings were with the adjudicating authority both for consideration of provisional
attachment order and confiscation of the property thereafter. However, post 15.02.2013, it is only
the provisional attachment order that is going to be passed by the adjudicating authority and
confiscation of the same would lie to the Special court. Thus, area of consideration of confiscation is
totally changed post 15.02.2013. Hence, he would contend that if an applicant is going before the
adjudicating authority with respect to matters or assets acquired prior to 1.6.2009 and if the
proceedings have to continue, law would be that adjudicating authority can provisionally attach the
property and await results of the 7predicate offence and if the law that stood prior to 15.02.2013 is
applied, the provisional attachment ceases after acquittal and if convicted, still the such person is
required to be heard before ordering confiscation of the property attached. He would also contend
the situation has totally changed now making it mandatory for such person to face criminal trial in
respect of a crime where final report presented by the investigating authority alleging that there is
schedule offence. Thus, respondent- authorities retrospectively are proceeding against the
petitioners for a crime which did not exist under this Act prior to 1.6.2009. He would submit that
earlier situation under this Act was that confiscation or prosecution are separate and distinct which
is how it was under section 8(5) and 8(6) prior to 15.02.2013 and post 15.02.2013, and now
petitioners are made to face trial under the PML Act for the offence which did not exist and the
respondent- authorities are attempting to make non-existing offence as a crime on the date he did
not exist.
(d) He would contend that respondents wants the petitioner to go before the authority and submit
that there is no authority provided under section 8 and there is an appeal under section 26 of the Act
and thereafter to the High Court. All these proceedings post 15.02.2016 will be restricted or limited
only to the provisional attachment. Satisfaction of the authority to the existence of some material for
him to derive satisfaction that there is a crime and these are proceedings of crime, he cannot do
anything more than that. Then, the question that would arise would be which is the law to be
applied? The law to be applied as on that date when the crime allegedly took place as set out in the
final report under Section 173 or ECIR registered by the Enforcement Directorate based on report
under Section 173 or the law on the date the proceedings are going on under Section 8 before the
adjudicating authority or law when the appeal is pending before appellate authority under Section
26.
(e) He would submit that proceedings initiated prior to 15.02.2016 which provided for confiscation
only after the prosecution is over in the schedule offence is no longer available under the Act and
such person is now compulsorily required to face trial. These proceedings are not just proceedings
for confiscation, it is proceedings only as prelude to the prosecution. These aspects of the matters
are to be adjudicated by this court as they are not admittedly within the jurisdiction of the
adjudicating authority or appellate authority and thereby such person is made to face trial which
was not in existence prior to 15.02.2016 or 01.06.2009. The scenario has changed from 1.7.2005,
6.3.2009, 15.3.2013 & 29.3.2018. If that is the position and petitioners are before this court in the
year 2018, then, this court will have to look at the law existing as on 29.03.2018 and the next
question would be as to what position of law as on that date will have to be applied, has to be gone
into. Thus, it would mean, all these contentions will have to be urged before the Special court
constituted under Section 43 and not before the adjudicating authority or the appellate authority on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 48
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
the ground of they are doing only confirming the order of attachment.
(f) He would draw the attention of the court to Section 24, which provides for burden of proof. He
would submit that prior to 15.02.2013, it was made applicable only when a person is accused of
having committed an offence under Section 3 of the Act and now the burden of proof has changed.
The petitioners are in a situation prior to 15.02.2013 which provision then existed cast the burden of
proof was applicable only to a person accused of offence under Section 3 and there was no such
proceedings initiated are pending against the petitioners at the relevant point of time. Consequently,
Section 24 as it then stood would be available to the petitioners. However, the respondents would
now say 'no' to the petitioners namely, they are contending that existing Section 24 is to be applied.

15. Sri Arvind Kamath, learned Senior counsel appearing for petitioner in
W.P.No.5269/2017 would contend that the property purchased by the petitioner is
under sale deed dated 19.10.2000 and the consideration has been paid by the
petitioner from her lawful funds and lawfully borrowed money. He would submit that
petitioner has constructed a house and has been residing there along with his family
members and primafacie, it would establish that schedule property was acquired by
the petitioner by lawful means. He would also contend that certain transactions that
took place during September to October, 2010 has been co-related to the proceeds of
crime under the impugned order dated 03.01.2017 (Annexure-B) and well before
September, 2010 the loan borrowed by the petitioner had also been settled with the
Bankers, secured creditor and there being no relationship between the acquisition of
the schedule property and the proceeds of crime, the provisional attachment order
dated 03.01.2017 (Annexure-B) is liable to be set aside. He would further contend
that the respondents have erroneously concluded that proceeds of crime were utilized
to clear the debts against the schedule property i.e., repayment of Rs.1.2 crores to
M/s.Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, inasmuch as, the petitioner
had already completed acquisition of the property by a registered sale deed and
thereafter on the request of her husband, she had borrowed a loan of Rs.1.2 crores
from M/s.Cholamandalam Investments and Finance Company and then lent the said
amount to the company M/s.Ignis Technology Solultions Private Limited, of her
husband of which, she was also a Director and the said loan was neither borrowed for
acquisition of the property or for repayment of the loan borrowed for such
construction. On the other hand, it was borrowed as a personal loan by the petitioner
lent to the company. He would contend that respondent is empowered to initiate
action under Section5 of PML Act only in respect of proceeds of crime and the
property purchased by the petitioner was not out of the proceeds of crime. Hence,
contending that authority has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings under PML Act
has sought for allowing the writ petition.

16. Sri R Nagendra Naik, learned counsel appearing for petitioner in
W.P.No.42157/2016 would contend that Section 5 does not contemplate enquiry and
summoning of accused at the stage of adjudication of provisional attachment does
not arise and hence, the impugned notice is liable to be quashed. He would also
submit Section 8 provides for enquiry and under Section 8, the adjudicating
authority decides that property is involved in money laundering and thereafter 90
days time is allowed for investigation and criminal case can be registered if required
only after decision of the adjudicating authority.
He has relied upon the following judgment in support of his contentions:

ANOTHER.
17. Sri Nagendra Naik, learned counsel appearing along with Sri Muniyappa in W.P.No.24480/2018
would contend that Section 50 of PML Act does not authorize the Assistant Director to freeze the
Bank account. He would contend that proviso to subsection (5) prohibits the authorities mentioned
thereunder from impounding any records without recording reasons for doing so, by referring to
Rule 6 of the Prevention of Money Laundering (Forms, Search and Seizure or Freezing and the
manner of forwarding the reasons and material to the Adjudicating Authority, Impounding and
Custody of Records and the Period of Retention) Rules, 2005. Hence, he has prayed for allowing the
writ petition by quashing the impugned order.
18. Sri Vijayakumar Bajantri, learned counsel appearing for petitioner in W.P.No.13160-66/2017
would contend that petitioner who was tried for the offence punishable under Section 13(1)(e) and
13(2) of PC Act has been acquitted on 23.02.2017 and as such, there being no predicate offence,
proceedings initiated against the petitioner under PML Act is liable to be quashed. He would also
contend that FIR against the petitioner for the offence punishable under Section 13(1)(e) and 13(2)
of PC Act was registered on 30.06.2010 and provisional order of attachment was passed on
20.10.2016 and prior to the attachment, the proceedings under PML Act has been initiated under
Section 3 by issuance of notice dated 15.09.2010 (Annexure-F) on which date, Section 13 of PC Act
did not find a place in the schedule to PML Act and it was included by Act 2 of 2013 with effect from
15.02.2013 and there being no criminal case in existence as on the date the proceedings under PML
Act was initiated, the amended provision could not have been made applicable to the petitioner.
Hence, the proceedings initiated against petitioner is liable to be quashed.
19. Sri Aniyan Joseph, learned counsel appearing for petitioners in W.P.Nos.28027/2018 &
35991/2018 would reiterate the contentions raised by the learned Senior Advocates who have
challenged the provisional attachment order and consequential possession notice.
19.1) He would submit in W.P.No.35991/2018 that provisional order of attachment was passed on
27.03.2014 and confirmed on 15.12.2014 against which, appeal has been filed and is pending before

the appellate authority and yet notice dated 07.06.2018 has been issued to take possession of the
property which has been called in question in W.P.No.28027/2018 and he has prayed for allowing
the writ petition, contending interalia that Sri T Basavaraj (petitioner in W.P.No.35991/2018) was
working in Department of Education, Government of Karnataka as a teacher and retired on
30.09.2012 as District Education Officer and just prior to his retirement on 25.06.2009 an FIR in
Crime No.9/2009 was registered on 25.05.2009 by the Lokayukta Police, Mysore and after
investigation, charge sheet has been filed on 25.05.2013 for the offence punishable under Section
13(1)(e) and 13(2) of PC Act alleging that he had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known
source of income. It is also contended that house has been constructed and the predicate offence was
not a schedule offence under the PML Act at the time of registration of FIR and Section 13 of PC Act
was inserted a schedule offence with effect from 01.06.2009 and as such, the proceedings initiated
against the petitioner is liable to be quashed. Hence, on these grounds, he has prayed for both the
petitions being allowed. In support of his submissions, he has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble
Apex Court in the matter of KALPANATH RAY vs STATE (THROUGH CBI) reported in (1997)8 SCC
732.
20. Sri B S Sachin, learned counsel appearing for petitioner in W.P.No.57756/2016 has sought for
quashing of the provisional order of attachment dated 30.06.2016 contending interalia that said
order has been passed on assumptions and presumptions and the petitioner has sold the property
bearing Sy.No.40/5(P) and 40/8 of Idya village, Mangalore Taluk measuring 19 cents which is a
non-agricultural property in the year 2012 and the mineral water plant is not sold and the petitioner
is no way concerned with the transactions of Sri.Dyana Antony Paul and others and petitioner has
been wrongly arrayed as a party to the proceedings. Hence, he has prayed for quashing of the
provisional order of attachment.
He would also reiterate the contentions raised by the learned Advocates who have hitherto argued.
21. Sri Sanketh Yenagi, learned Advocate appearing for petitioner in W.P.No.14158/2017 has prayed
for quashing of the provisional order of attachment including the complaint lodged in
O.C.No.683/2017 (Annexure-B) and the consequential notice dated 14.02.2017, contending interalia
that the property/assets which are sought to be attached were acquired prior to 01.06.2009 namely,
it was acquired on 19.07.2004 and the offences alleged are on the basis of investigation by CBI
which was committed prior to 2009 namely, prior to the insertion of provisions of PC Act to the
schedule of PML Act. Hence, he has sought for quashing of the provisional order of attachment,
complaint and consequential notice.
22. Sri Vinaya Keerthi, learned Advocate appearing for petitioner in W.P.No.62182/2016 has sought
for quashing of the order dated 22.07.2016 (Annexure-C) whereunder the provisional order of
attachment came to be confirmed, contending interalia that constitution of adjudicating authority is
without a judicial member and as such, impugned order is liable to be set aside. It is also contended,
the order of attachment is without notice to the respondent. Hence, he has prayed for quashing of
the impugned order.

confirmation thereof is erroneous, contrary to Section 8 of PML Act on the ground that it is not a
party in the complaint before the adjudicating authority, since the petitioner Bank as a secured
creditor, has a claim over the fixed deposits. He has also reiterated the contentions raised by Sri
Udaya Holla, learned Senior counsel appearing for petitioners in the connected matters.
24. Sri K.M.Nataraj, learned Additional Solicitor General of India appearing for the respondents
would contend that PML Act is targeted at money or source of proceeds of crime, which a person
derives from a particular offence. It is contended that such person might have acquired some assets
through tainted means or illegally and when such person comes before the society and claims that
said money was acquired by proper means, then he is guilty of this offence. He would submit that we
are not at all concerned about other offence/s. A person might have committed it long back.
Incorporation of certain offences in the schedule is to bring it within the net of PML Act i.e.,
proceeds of that crime is also brought within the purview of this Act. Unless it is brought within the
schedule, proceeds of crime even by assuming that he has acquired some wealth by wrong means,
then, he is not under the provisions of PML Act. He would submit that at different points of time, by
amendment, scheduled offences have been incorporated so that proceeds of crime arising out of that
particular offence also is an offence under this Act. Hence, he brings to the notice of the court
Section 3 to contend that offence under the PML Act is connected with the proceeds of the crime and
not the crime. He would submit that when a person projects the property secured by illegal means as
untainted property, same would be brought under the net of PML Act, as it amounts to money
laundering. Hence, he contends that the offence indicated under Section 3 is a standalone offence
and it has nothing to do with the scheduled offence committed. Hence, the argument of the
petitioners that condition precedent to bring money laundering within Section 3, there must be
scheduled offence, is erroneous. He would submit that Section 498A of IPC is not a scheduled
offence under PML Act. By assuming that he has acquired some property and even he projects it as
untainted property, he is not guilty of money laundering, but in respect of scheduled offence, when
he projects it as untainted property, he is guilty of offence punishable under PML Act. Therefore,
offence under PMLA is stand alone offence and as such person will be tried independently by the
court, he may be guilty or he may not be guilty, it is irrelevant.
24.1) He would submit that a person might have acquired vast properties in the name of third
parties and there may be couple of people involved in activities and said person might be tried under
the PC Act and on being tried for the offence punishable under PC Act he may be punished for the
offence under PC Act at that point of time. He submits that under PML Act, the authorities are
targeting two things. One is property which may be the subject matter of the proceedings under PC
Act or IPC which may be in the hands of somebody else. Now if third party knowingly acquires or
possess or projects it as untainted property, same is brought under Section 3 of PML Act. Therefore,
double jeopardy concept propounded by the learned counsel appearing for petitioners that such
person was already tried under the PC Act at some point of time and at that time, the provision of
PC Act was not there in the schedule, has no legs to stand under this Act. He would submit present

Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
affairs are covered by the present law or in other words present affairs are determined on the basis
of existing law. As of now, Section 3 would indicate that either acquiring, projecting or concealment,
of the proceeds of crime is an offence. So far as money laundering is concerned, concealment of
proceeds of crime is an offence. Section 2(u) mandates by virtue of scheduled offence some proceeds
of crime if knowingly acquired or in possession or acquisition, it would become crime and projecting
any activity connected to it, is an offence under Section 3 of PML Act. That is how Section 3 is to be
read.
24.2) He would submit that any schedule offence which may be under the IPC or any notified
offence, then such person will be tried independently for the offence that was existing at that point
of time. By different enactments, what is targeted is proceeds of activities that such person may
acquire some property and if it is projected as untainted or knowingly in possession of such property
and attempt is made to bring it or thrust into the main stream, entire focus would be that by virtue
of such activity, then such person will be guilty of the offence specified under Section 3 and liable for
punishment under Section 4.
24.3) He would submit that under the provisions of the PML Act, a person who is found guilty of the
offence, the property will be confiscated to the Government and it becomes property of the
Government. He would contend for invoking Section 5 of the PML Act, such prescribed authority
will have to meet with three (3) requirements namely, (i) he has reason to believe; (ii) has material
on the basis of which he has reason to believe; and, (iii) such material should be in his possession.
Then, in such an event he may by order in writing provisionally attach such property for a period not
exceeding 180 days from the date of order. He would submit that Section 5 and Section 8(a) cannot
be read in isolation as sought to be made out by the counsel for the petitioners. He would submit
that a provision in a statute must be read word to word and sentence to sentence and not in
isolation.
24.4) He would also submit that by Act 2 of 2013 it clarifies that the adjudicating authority while
confirming the order of attachment made under sub-section (1) of Section 5 or retention of property
or records seized or frozen under Section 17 of 18, such order would continue during the pendency
of the proceedings relating to any offence under the PML Act or under the corresponding law of any
other country before the competent court of criminal jurisdiction outside India, as the case may be
vide clause
(a) of sub-section (3) of Section 8. Thus, by clarification in 2013 amendment it only clarifies the
position as to what period the confirmation order of attachment should continue.
24.5) He would draw the attention of the court to Section 8(4) of PML Act to contend that the
Director or any other officer authorized by him would be required to take possession of the property,
where the provisional order of attachment is confirmed and it is a statutory mandate without any
discretion to the authorities. He would submit that in some of the writ petitions possession notice
have been challenged and the authorities having no discretion at all, they are bound by the mandate
of Section 8(4) to take possession forthwith on provisional order being confirmed. He would submit
that possession means physical possession and repelling the contention raised by Sri. Nagendrda
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 54
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
Naik by relying upon judgment of Madras High Court in THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR & OTHERS vs
A.KAMARUNNISA GHORI & OTHERS (M.A.No.1/2012 in W.A.No.2137/2012 and M.P.No.2/2012
in W.A.No.2138- 2140/2012, decided on 11.07.2012) to contend that 2013 amendment was not
available at that time and said judgment was rendered on 11.07.2012 i.e., much before Act 2 of 2013
came into force. He would submit that language employed under Section 8(4) by 2009 amendment
is different from the language employed in Section 8(4) post 2013 amendment. Therefore, language
of the provision as found in Section 8(4) 'shall forthwith take possession of attached property' came
to be amended by inserting the expression 'possession of the property attached under Section 5 or
frozen under sub-section (1-A) of Section 17, in such manner as may be prescribed." The Prevention
of Money Laundering (Taking Possession of Attached or Frozen Properties Confirmed by the
Adjudicating Authorities) Rules, 2013, having come into force w.e.f. 19.08.2013 would govern the
issue relating to the manner in which possession of such movable or immovable properties is to be
taken, vide Rule 4 and 5 respectively. Hence, he would contend that the contentions raised by the
learned Advocates appearing for the petitioners that taking possession would only mean
constructive possession, would not hold water and the prescription in which possession of the
property has to be taken as indicated in sub-section (4) of Section 8, has resulted in 2013 Rules
being framed and if the intention of the parliament was only to include constructive possession and
not physical possession, they would have said so. Hence, he would contend that a delegated
amendment partakes the character of a statutory provision. Section 5(4) also makes it very clear that
at the initial stage only attachment is permitted and the authority has not been allowed to take
possession and such person is allowed to enjoy the property and only when provisional order of
attachment is confirmed, possession can be taken by depriving enjoyment of the property, in the
manner prescribed namely, as per 2013 Rules. Hence, it is contended that KHAMARUNNISA's case
relied upon by the petitioners has no application at all to the present scenario by virtue of
amendment of the Act and also having regard to the Rules made thereunder. Even otherwise, he
would contend that observation made in KAMARUNNISA's case is referable to that particular
judgment only and has no universal application. He would further submit that his argument on this
proposition is fortified by referring to Section 2(t). He would draw the attention of the court to
proviso to Section 8(4), Section 8(5) and 8(6) of the PML Act to contend that attachment and
confirmation would depend upon conclusion of a trial under the PML Act and not depending upon
the trial or outcome of the scheduled offence. He would submit that sub-section (5) & (6) of Section
8 is a complete answer to this proposition. By drawing the attention of the court to sub-section (7),
(8) and (9) of Section 8 of PML Act he would submit that the same deals with the consequences of
property that has been confiscated to the Government and till such time the steps prescribed under
sub-section (1) to (4) are all steps in aid of further proceedings, which are to take place under the
provisions of the PML Act and therefore, the authorities under the PML Act are holding the property
so attached are seized or frozen as statutory trustees, ultimately to achieve the object of the PML
Act.
24.6) He would read Section 10 of PML Act which relates to management of properties confiscated.
He would also invite the attention of the court to Section 23 and 24 of the PML Act, which relates to
the presumption in interconnected transactions and upon whom the burden of proof lies. He would
contend that under Section 23 the adjudicating authority and the special court is empowered to
presume that where money laundering involves 2 or more interconnected transactions and 1 or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 55
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
more such transactions is or are proved to be involved in money laundering, such authority or court
can draw presumption, shall otherwise proved or rebutted. To illustrate this issue, he would contend
that one transaction when it had taken place in 2010 or 2012 and out of the proceeds, such person
had acquired some property and there is a connection with the proceeds of crime, it can be
presumed by the authority or court, as the case may be that remaining transactions form part of
such interconnected transactions. In other words, he would submit the person who claims that such
transactions are not interconnected is required to prove the said fact. He would also draw the
attention of the court to Section 24 of PML Act, which places the burden of proof on the person
charged with the offence of money laundering to prove that the money is not relatable to proceeds of
crime and same is not used for money laundering. He would submit that unless the contrary is
proved, presumption is that such proceeds of crime are involved in money laundering.
24.7) He would contend that under Section 26 of PML Act first appeal lies to the appellate tribunal
and under Section 42 an appeal lies to the High Court against the decision of the appellate tribunal
and thereby, two (2) layers are provided under the PML Act to an aggrieved person. He would also
submit that PML Act is a complete code for redressal of the grievance with two (2) layered
mechanism.
24.8) He would contend that in respect of the offences punishable under Sections 3 & 4 of PML Act,
special courts are constituted under Chapter VII whereunder we get a clue with regard to offences
which had taken place even before commencement of the Act. He would draw the attention of the
court to Section 44 of PML Act to contend that such special courts would not only conduct trial of
the offence punishable under Section 4 but also try an offence other than offence referred to in sub-
section (1) of Section 43 which means that the offence under the PML Act as well as offence under
any other enactment to which such persons may be charged. He would submit that Section 48
prescribes the authorities under the PML Act and sub-section (2) of Section 49 empowers the
Central Government to authorize the Director or an Additional Director or a Joint Director or a
Deputy Director or an Assistant Director appointed under sub-section (1) to appoint other
authorities below the rank of an Assistant Director. He would also draw the attention of the court
sub-section (2) of Section 50 to contend that power of investigation is conferred upto the Assistant
Director or any officer as may be appointed under Section 49(2) including the Director. He would
submit sub-section (3) of Section 50 is in paramateria with Section 104 of Customs Act. He would
also draw the attention of the court to Section 54 of the PML Act where certain officers are
empowered and required to assist the authorities in the enforcement of the PML Act.
24.9) By referring to Chapter IX he would contend that Reciprocal Arrangement for assistance in
certain matters and procedure for attachment and confiscation of property has been provided and it
is an enabling provision when there is cross border implications or matters falls under contracting
state where the Government of India takes the assistance of other countries. He would submit that
this Chapter has to be read along with provisions of the PML Act and not in exclusion. By reading
Section 56 of PML Act, he would submit that it is an enabling provision to enter into agreement with
foreign countries and it does not exclude other provisions of the PML Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 56
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
24.10) He would further submit that reading of Section 60 of PML Act would indicate that whatever
orders that are passed under the PML Act, would be applicable in a contracting state or in India. He
would submit by interpreting Chapter IX that it cannot be said that order of attachment is vitiated
though reciprocal agreement provides otherwise. He would submit that where an order of
attachment has been passed and it is to be executed in a contracting state by virtue of reciprocal
agreement with another country, Section 60 would come to the assistance and in such
circumstances, a letter of request to a court or an authority in the contracting state for execution of
such order will be issued.
24.11) He would submit that these are the salient features of the PML Act under which authorities
pass order. There are three streams of proceedings namely, (1) scheduled offence that will be
independently tried i.e., independent offence; (2) offence under the Act i.e., which is Money
Laundering is totally a standalone offence; and, (3) in aid of the proceedings under Sections 3 & 4
read with offence indicated in Section 44 and all these ultimately depend upon the result of Chapter
III i.e., with regard to attachment that comes into play. Ultimately, attachment under Section 5 and
8 depends upon trial of the offence under the PML Act.
24.12) He would draw the attention of the court to Section 8(5) and 8(6) to contend that conviction
is not required and if a finding has been recorded by the court that there is offence of money
laundering, it would suffice. He would also submit that once a complaint is filed, it is for the special
court to take cognizance of the offence under Section 3 and proceed with the matter as prescribed
under Section 44 of the PML Act. Where the complaint is filed for the offence under Section 3, what
is targeted is only the projection and whether such person who is accused of money laundering, had
amassed wealth or not would not be the criteria at all and this distinction has to be borne in mind.
24.13) He would submit that in some of the matters, the order of attachment or its confirmation
thereof has not been challenged and only the statutory notice issued under sub-section (4) of Section
8 is challenged.
24.14) He would also submit that constitutional validity of Section 8 which has been challenged in
W.P.Nos.15917/2013 and 15918/2013 has already been upheld by three judgments of this court in
W.P.Nos.14649/2014 c/w 19732/2014 dated 28.01.2016 and contends that the said ground has to
fail. He would also draw the attention of the court to the judgment of Ramraju's case and to the
judgment of Usha Agarwal rendered by Sikkim High Court to contend that in the writ petitions filed
in W.P.No.15917/2013 what has been challenged is only notice issued under Section 8(4) which is a
consequential notice and the order of provisional attachment and its confirmation thereof has not
been challenged and as such said writ petitions are liable to be dismissed. He would also submit that
petitioner has nowhere contended that the authority who has issued the notice is without
jurisdiction.
24.15) He would also contend that in some of the writ petitions only possession notice has been
challenged and against order of attachments the appeals are pending before the appellate authority
and on the ground that there was no sitting of the appellate authority and they are likely to be
dispossessed they had approached this court and they have obtained interim orders by suppressing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 57
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
the fact the appellate authority had in fact being conducting the proceedings. He would submit that
taking possession would mean physical possession and the authorities have recourse to Rule 3 and 5
of Rules 2013 and as such the petitioners are not entitled to the reliefs sought for.
24.16) He would submit that arguments of Sri. Nagendra Naik canvassed with regard to symbolic
possession in W.P.No.20307/2017 by referring to KAMARUNNISSA's case would be inapplicable to
the facts on hand, inasmuch as, there are two parts in the said judgment namely, it was rendered on
11.07.2012 in the background of 2009 amendment and even otherwise, said judgment has been
stayed by the Division Bench. He would also submit that except physical possession aspect rendered
thereunder, entire judgment is against the contentions raised by him.
24.17) He would also refer to the arguments canvassed by Sri. Manmohan, learned counsel
appearing for petitioners with reference to cross border implication to contend Chapter IX is only an
enabling provision namely, it would enable to execute the order of attachment and connected issues
by entering into reciprocal arrangement with any other country and it would not take away the effect
of authority to pass the order of attachment. He would submit that provisions in Section 55 to 61 of
PML Act is not to weaken other provisions of the PML Act. He would submit that with regard to
retrospectivity Sri Manmohan has relied upon the judgment in the case TECH MAHINDRA in
support of his contention and the prayer in the said proceedings was for quashing criminal case and
the appeal filed before the Division Bench as dismissed as not maintainable and the Hon'ble Apex
Court has observed that on facts the impugned order did not call for interference. He would submit
that the two judgments rendered by the Delhi High Court in the matter of AJANTA MERCHANTS
AND ARUN KUMAR MISHRA by relying upon TECH MAHINDRA's case has been challenged and
stayed. He would contend that TECH MAHINDRA's case came to be examined in the context of
criminality i.e., Section 3 criminal proceedings visa-vis knowledge of the person who commits
offence, on merits by examining the facts and arriving at a conclusion that the petitioner had no
knowledge.
24.18) He would also rebut the contentions raised by Sri Uday Holla with regard to the authority of
the Assistant Director to freeze the account and contends that Section 17 has no application at all as
it is not a case of search or seizure. He would submit Section 54 is an added safeguard during
investigation. He would also submit that the impugned communication issued to AMFI to give
certain information has not questioned the said communication and both the banks and AMFI have
furnished the information, but the petitioners have contended that under Section 54 AMFI is not
required to give information and under Section 17 of PML Act Assistant Director has no jurisdiction.
He would submit that during course of investigation the authority has right to secure the
information from anyone and it is a statutory obligation for such of those authorities prescribed
under Section 54 to assist during investigation. By relying upon the judgment of the Calcutta High
Court in Rose Valley Real Estate and Constructions Ltd. V. Union of India he has prayed for
rejection of said writ petition. By drawing the attention of the court to the impugned communication
issued to AMFI and Bank, he would contend that they need not be reporting entity and by virtue of
interim order granted the petitioners have withdrawn all the amounts and as such the petitioners
are bound to disclose the amount which has been withdrawn by them.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 58
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
24.19) He would also contend what is challenged is either provisional order or confirmation order or
consequential notice. Hence, we are not concerned about prosecution of the case. Since Sections 44,
45 & 46 falling under Chapter VII deals with criminal proceedings, whereas, the order of attachment
and its confirmation thereof would fall under Chapter III and under Chapter III, limited
examination is to be made. He would submit that only with the intention of protecting the property
as otherwise, it may frustrate the proceedings, the safeguard is provided under Chapter III. The
authorities who act under Chapter III are only statutory trustees who would preserve the property.
By drawing the attention of the court to Section 8(3), he would submit that investigation is not a
condition precedent for purposes of criminal prosecution. The authorities are empowered to file a
criminal case or leave at that. He would refer to Section 8(5) to contend that there would be no
necessity for separate confiscation order being passed and on conclusion of a trial of an offence
under the Act, if the Special court finds that the offence of money laundering has been committed, it
can order such property involved in the money laundering or which has been used for the
commission of money laundering to stand confiscated to the Central Government. He would further
contend that under Section 8(3), first it is confirmation of attachment and then, continue the
investigation for a period not exceeding 90 days and thereafter file a complaint before the Special
court which is the purport of 2018 amendment.
24.20) He would also submit that proceedings relating to provisional attachment and its
adjudication for confirmation is not an appeal proceedings, but original proceedings and as such,
the petitioners cannot be heard to contend that under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India,
this court is required to examine the said proceedings in threadbare. He would submit that
confiscation would arise only after conclusion of trial and in none of the cases which are before this
court the said issue has not arisen and as such, the principles as applicable to confiscation including
the provisions thereof would have absolutely no bearing on these proceedings.
24.21) He would also contend that even a financial institution not being a reporting entity, the
proceedings can be proceeded and it is a matter of investigation. Hence, officers authorized to
investigate can seek information from any person whether it is governmental body or private body
and this being one step of the investigation. He would rely upon ROSE VALLEY's judgment to
support his submission in this regard. He would also submit that Assistant Director is the
competent authority to issue notice and by referring to sub-section (2) of Section 50 he would
contend incidental power of investigation for the purposes of the Act is to ensure enforcement of the
provisions of the Act. Hence, he prays for dismissing the writ petitions.
He has relied upon the following judgments in support of his contentions:
i) 2015(3)CLJ(CAL)536: ROSE VALLEY REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTIONS
LTD. AND OTHERS vs.. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS.
ii) 2018 SCC ONLINE MAD 3138: SMT.

General of India and has prayed for dismissal of the writ petitions.
26. Sri M.B.Nargund, learned Additional Solicitor General of India appearing for respondents by
reiterating the contentions raised by the learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the Revenue,
would contend even if proceedings relating to predicate offence is closed, the proceedings under the
PML Act would not come to an end. He would also contend that constitutional validity of Section
8(4) has been challenged before the Madras High Court in W.P.No.3176/2020 and same has been
negatived by the Division Bench by order dated 17.02.2020 and as such, he prays for rejecting
similar contention raised with regard to constitutional validity of Section 8(4) of PML Act. He would
further contend the writ petitions filed by the Directors and ex-employees of Devas Multimedia
Limited namely, W.P.Nos.6159/2017, 6173/2017, 8261/2017 & 4215/2017 are premature since only
information has been sought from the Bank. He would contend that power to seek such information
by the authorities is traceable under Sections 54 and 55 of the Act and as such, said writ petitions
are liable to be dismissed as not maintainable. In support of his submissions, he has relied upon the
following judgments:
i) AIR 1952 SC 324 - SHAMARAO V PARULEKAR vs DISTRICT MAGISTRATE,
THANA, BOMBAY AND OTHERS
ii) W.P.No.3176/2020 DECIDED ON 17.02.2020 - TRIAD TRADING SERVICES P
LTD.
vs UNION OF INDIA & ANOTHER REPLY ARGUMENTS:
27. Sri. Nagendra Naik, learned Advocate would submit that provisions of PMLA is borrowed from
Cr.P.C. He would submit that Section 46 of PMLA is corresponding to Section 105A(c). He would
draw the attention of the court to Section 105C and 105E which is traceable to Section 5 of PML Act.
Hence, he would contend that the intention of the legislature was to make the offence under PML
Act as a criminal offence and not as a civil offence. He would submit that the proceedings would
commence with a charge that a person has committed an offence under Section 3 resulting in
provisional attachment, its confirmation, adjudication and thereafter prosecution. He would
contend that under first proviso of Section 5(1) a report has to be forwarded to a Magistrate under
Section 173 of Cr.P.C. or a complaint has to be filed by a person authorized to investigate the offence
mentioned in that schedule, before a Magistrate or court for taking cognizance of the scheduled
offence and this being the intention of the legislature, the incorporation of second proviso by 2015
amendment it cannot take away the right vested to an applicant. Hence, he prays for allowing the
writ petitions filed by him.
28. Mr.Swaroop Anand, learned Advocate appearing for petitioners would contend that possession
notice issued under Section 8(4) has been challenged and the crux of the matter is confirmation of
the provisional attachment. Section 8(2)(a) and 8(2)(b) mandates twin requirement and only upon
completion of these requirements, the provisional attachment is confirmed. He would submit that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 62
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
under Section 8(3)(a) as it stood on 2009, the reason for believing was directly co-related to the
schedule offence, which does not find a place in Section 8(3)(a) after amendment by Act 2 of 2013
and the definition of 'proceeds of crime' having remained unamended, the condition precedent for
attachment of the properties is proceeds of crime should be relatable to schedule offence. He would
submit that constant feature in the amendments carried out to Sections 3, 5 & 8 is that legislature
has ensured that the aspect of mens rea is taken away. He would further submit by virtue of the
amendment, if a person receives something without knowing the fact that what he has received is
proceeds of crime, the very fact that it is in my possession is sufficient to constitute an offence under
Section 3 and requirement of scheduled offence has been decoupled both under Section 5 as well as
under Section 8.
28.1) He would also contend that additional feature under Section 8 is that there is added safeguard
that has now been introduced for confirmation of provisional order of attachment and there has to
be necessarily a proceeding for the offence under the Act subsisting on the date of confirmation.
Enactment of Prevention of Money Laundering Act would not fall within the fiscal statute, it would
definitely be a penal statute. The colour of PML Act being a fiscal statute could have been attributed
to it prior to 2013 amendment since it had the attributes of a fiscal statute. Subsequent to 2013
amendment, there has been a conscious effort to ensure that procedure for attachment is directly
linked to commencement of proceedings for an offence of money laundering within the scope of the
enactment. A plain reading of Section 8(3)(a) prior to 2018 amendment would indicate that
complaint under Section 45 should exist for conformation to be made thereunder. Now relaxation
has been granted to the respondents and they can continue their investigation for a period not
exceeding 90 days or proceedings under the Act. He would contend that authorities under the Act
have to complete their investigation within 90 days from the date of confirmation and initiate
proceedings under this Act failing which by virtue of Section 5(3), order of confirmation would lapse
by operation of law. He would submit that in W.P.Nos.15917/2013 & 15974/2013 and 15918/2013 &
15961/2013, petitioners have been issued with a notice under Section 8(4) upon confirmation order
that has been passed against them. Petitioners were heard by the adjudicating authority prior to
2013 amendment coming into force but an order has been passed by the adjudicating authority in
terms of 2013 amendment without giving an opportunity of hearing and they have specifically
invoked language of the amended Section 8(3)(a) under the order of confirmation passed on
22.02.2013 and subsequent to which impugned possession notice under Section 8(4) has been
issued. He would submit that only if the requirement of Section 8(3) is met, question of issuing
notice under Section 8(4) would arise. He would submit that twin requirements indicated under
Section 8(3) will have to be met namely, there should be proceedings under the Act as on the date of
confirmation and meeting of the requirement prescribed under clause (b) is also a condition
precedent insofar as the order of confirmation of provisional attachment to become final. He would
submit order of confiscation has to be passed in terms of Section 8(5) which is done only by the
Special court constituted under section 43 after 2013 amendment. A plain reading of Section 8(3)
makes it amply clear that now upon fulfilment of entire conditions stipulated under Section 8(3),
notice under Section 8(4) can be invoked, failing which notice issued under Section 8(4) would be
premature and dehors the jurisdiction conferred on the authorities.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 63
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
28.2) He would submit that contention raised with regard to alternate remedy available to the
petitioners under Section 26 is concerned, would be against an order of provisional attachment and
confirmation of such provisional attachment, but not against a notice issued under Section 8(4).
Hence, he contends that writ petitions are maintainable.
28.3) He would submit that provisional order of attachment was passed on 25.09.2012 under
Section 5(1), in pursuance of the same, complaint came to be filed on 5.10.2012 in terms of Section
5(5) before the adjudicating authority and on 18.10.2012 notice under Section 8(1) was issued by the
adjudicating authority, for which petitioners have filed reply on 10.12.2012 before the adjudicating
authority. Subsequently, order of confirmation in terms of Section 8(3) as amended by 2013
amendment was passed by the adjudicating authority on 22.02.2013 and immediately petitioner has
preferred an appeal in No.444/2013 wherein petitioner has taken a specific contention that order of
adjudicating authority by operation of law has lapsed because there is no proceedings for an offence
under the Act amongst other contentions. He would submit that on issuance of impugned notice on
28.03.2013 under Section 8(4), writ petition has been filed on 03.04.2013 and interim relief was
granted. It is thereafter, the Prevention of Money Laundering (Taking Possession of Attached or
Frozen Properties Conferred by the Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2013 which has come into force
with effect from 19.08.2013 and subsequently during March, 2014 the authorities have initiated
proceedings under Section 45 of PML Act. He would submit that initiation of proceedings has been
challenged before this court in W.P.No.14549/2016 by invoking Article 226 of Constitution of India
read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. In the appeal filed against the order of confirmation of attachment,
the Appellate tribunal has adjourned the same and is awaiting orders in W.P. 14549/2016. Hence,
he prays for allowing the writ petitions.
29. Sri P.N.Manmohan, learned Advocate appearing for petitioners would rely upon the RAMA
RAJU's case to contend as to whether the provisions of PML Act is penal in nature has not been
considered and the petitioner not being connected with any offence, merely based on message found
in her mobile phone, she sought to be prosecuted and according to the authorities, the offence has
been committed in India and money has come from abroad and for this, there should be compliance
of Section 2(ra). He would submit that even according to the authorities, the money has come from
abroad and as such, the petitioners cannot be brought within the purview of PML Act. He would
contend that either offence should have committed in India and amount should be transferred
outside India for Section 2(ra) being attracted and as such, the proceedings against the petitioners
cannot be continued. He would further submit that there are no reason whatsoever to believe that
petitioner is associated with the offence and by relying upon TECH MAHINDRA's case, he would
contend that the language used in Section 3 is "knowingly" and "directly or indirectly" and these
ingredients are not to be found insofar as petitioners are concerned and as such, the proceedings are
bad in law. He would also submit that Section 3 as well as Section 5(1)(a) refers to "proceeds of
crime" which is referable to schedule offence and as such, the contention of learned ASG that
scheduled offence has no relevance to the money laundering is an argument which ought not to be
accepted.
30. Having heard the learned Advocates appearing for parties, I am of the considered view that
following points would arise for my consideration:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 64
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
(i) Whether sub-section (4) of Section 8 of PML Act is violative of Article 14 and
Article 300A of the Constitution of India and as such proceedings initiated against
petitioners under PML Act are liable to be quashed?
(ii) Whether the proceedings initiated under the PML Act by the authorities would be
bad in law or without jurisdiction for want of existence of predicate offence or offence
prescribed under the Schedule to the PML Act not being in existence on the date of
initiation of proceedings under PML Act?
OR Whether the offence of money laundering under Section 3 of PML Act is a stand alone offence?
(iii) Whether the proceedings initiated by the authorities under PML Act and passing orders of
provisional attachment and its confirmation thereof is liable to be set aside or quashed on account of
any procedural lapse prescribed under Sections 5 and 8 of PML Act?
(iv) Whether the notice/s issued by the authorities to take possession of the property on provisional
order of attachment being confirmed is liable to be set aside?
(v) Whether writ petitions are liable to be dismissed on the ground of petitioners having not availed
the alternate remedy of appeal available under Section 25 and under Section 42 of PML Act?
(vi) What order?
31. In order to examine and adjudicate the points formulated herein above, in the background of
rival contentions raised, it would be apt and appropriate to narrate the historical background
resulting in birth of PML Act, 2002.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND LEADING TO ENACTMENT OF PML ACT, 2002:
32. Since Money Laundering was an international phenomenon, having felt Trans National
Co-operation is of critical importance in the fight against this menace, a number of initiatives were
taken to deal with the problem at the international level. The major international agreements
addressing money laundering include the United Nations Convention against illicit trafficking in
drugs and psychotropic substances, which is popularly known as Vienna Convention and the
Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, search, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of
crime. The role of financial institutions in preventing and detecting money laundering has also been
the subject of pronouncements by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation Supervisory
Practices, the European Union and the International Organization of Securities Commissions.
33. The Vienna Convention was the first major initiative in the prevention of Money laundering held
in December, 1988, which laid down the ground work for efforts to combat money laundering by
obliging the member States to criminalize the laundering of money from drug trafficking, apart from
promoting international co- operation in investigation amongst others. The Council for Europe
Convention in 1990 made an attempt to establish a common policy on money laundering and it laid
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 65
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
down principles for international co-operation among the member States and the purpose of this
convention was to facilitate international co-operation as regards investigative assistance, search,
seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of all types of criminality, particularly serious crimes such
as drug offences, arms dealing, terrorist offences etc., which generate large profits.
34. During December, 1988 the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
Practices, a statement came to be issued of principles which aimed at encouraging the Banking
sector to adopt common position in order to ensure that Banks are not used to hide or launder funds
acquired through criminal activities. Its statement of principles did not restrict itself to drug related
money laundering, but also extended to all aspects of laundering through banking system. In effect,
it sought to deny the banking system to those involved in money laundering by the application of the
four basic principles namely, identifying the customer, compliance with the laws, co-operation with
law enforcement agencies and adherence to the Statement.
35. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-Governmental Body established at G-7
Summit in Paris in 1989 with the objective to set standards and promote effective implementation of
legal, regulatory and operational measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and
other related threats to the integrity of the International Financial System . In 1990 a report was
issued containing set of 40 recommendations to fight against money laundering. In October, 2001 8
special recommendations came to be issued to deal with the issue of terrorist financing and during
October, 2004, 9 special recommendations was published for further strengthening the agreed
international standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
36. The initiatives under the aegis of the United Nations are:
(i) United Nations Political Declaration and Action Plan against Money-
Laundering 1988;
(ii) United Nations Global Programme against Money Laundering;
(iii) United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
1988;
(iv) International Convention for
Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism 1999;
(v) United Nations Convention against
Organised Transnational Crimes 2000 and
(vi) United Nations Convention against Corruption 2003."

Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
37. India being a party at the United Nations Convention, felt there being urgent need for the
enactment or a comprehensive legislation interalia for preventing money laundering and connected
activities as it posed a serious threat not only to the financial system of the country but also a threat
to integrity and sovereignty and as such, for preventing money laundering and connected activities,
confiscation of proceeds of crime, setting up of agencies and mechanisms for co-ordinating,
measures for combating money laundering etc., and keeping in view the Basel Statement of
Principles, enunciated in 1989 as well as the recommendations of FATF at G-7 1989 Summit, the
Prevention of Money Laundering Bill , 1988 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 04.08.1988. After
being referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and on receipt of the said report, which came
to be accepted by the Central Government, resulted in introduction of the said Bill in both the
Houses of the Parliament and was passed by both the Houses and received the assent of the
President on 17.01.2003. Thus, the birth of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (Act 15
of 2003) took place and it came into the statute book on its publication in the Gazette on
01.07.2005.
38. The statement of objects and reasons as outlined for enacting PML Act are:
(a) The United Nationals Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances, to which India is a party, calls for prevention of laundering
of proceeds of drug crimes and other connected activities and confiscation of
proceeds derived from such offence.
(b) The Basle Statement of Principles, enunciated in 1989, outlined to basic policies
and procedures that banks should follow in order to assist the law enforcement
agencies in tackling the problem of money laundering.
(c) The Financial Action Task Force established at the summit of seven major
industrial nations, held in Paris from 14th to 16th July, 1989 to examine the problem
of money laundering has made forty recommendations, which provide the foundation
material for comprehensive legislation to combat the problem of money laundering.
The recommendations were classified under various heads. Some of the important
heads are---
(i) Declaration of laundering of monies carried through serious crimes a criminal
offence;
(ii) To work out modalities of disclosure by financial institutions regarding reportable
transactions;
(iii) Confiscation of the proceeds of crime;
(iv) Declaring money laundering to be an extraditable offence;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 67
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
and
(v) Promoting international co- operation in investigation of money-laundering.
(d) The Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action adopted by United
Nations General Assembly by its Resolution No.S- 17/2 of 23rd February, 1990, inter
alia, calls upon the member States to develop mechanism to prevent financial
institutions from being used for laundering of drug related money and enactment of
legislation to prevent such laundering.
(e) The United Nations in the Special Session on countering World Drug Problem
Together concluded on 8th to the 10th June, 1998 has made another declaration
regarding the need to combat money laundering. India is a signatory to this
declaration."
39. Keeping the aforesaid object in mind, which the Parliament has envisaged to
achieve by the aforesaid enactment, I proceed to adjudicate the points formulated
hereinabove.
RE. POINT NO.(i) & (iv):
40. In W.P.Nos.15917/2013 & 15974/2013 and W.P.Nos.15918/2013 & 15961/2013,
petitioners have sought for declaring sub-section (4) of Section 8 of PML Act as
unconstitutional and in W.P.Nos.39889/2014, 27744/2018, 24444/2015 and
35991/2018 petitioners have sought for quashing of possession notices issued by
authorities to take physical possession of properties which have been attached.
Discussion on these two (2) points would overlap and as such, they are taken together
for adjudication.
41. Before embarking upon adjudication on merits, the parameters and principles
governing the issue of a construction of a statute and the adjudicating mechanism to
be adopted when constitutionality of an enactment or its provisions is under
challenge, requires to be addressed in the background of judicial pronouncements.
42. A construction which reduces the statute to a futility has to be avoided. The
principle expressed in the maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat i.e., liberal
construction should be put upon written instruments so as to uphold them, if
possible and carry into effect the intention of parties has to be adopted. (See Broom's
Legal Maxims 10th Edition, page 361, Craies on Statutes (7th edition), page 95 and
Maxwell on Statutes (11th edition) page 221. ) A statute or a provision in any
enactment must be so construed to make it effective and operative. The Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of CIT vs S.TEJA SINGH reported in AIR 1959 SC 352, have held
that a statute is designed to be workable and interpretation thereof by a court should
be to secure that object unless crucial omission or clear direction makes that end
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 68
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
unattainable. It has been further held that courts will have to reject that construction
which will defeat the plain intention of the legislature, even though there may be
some inexactitude in the language used in the enactment.
43. The Hon'ble Apex Court in MOHAN KUMAR SINGHANIA vs UNION OF INDIA
reported in AIR 1992 SC 1 has reiterated the principles indicated in Nokes vs.
Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries (1940) 3 All E.R 549) referred to in Pye vs.
Minister for Lands for N.S.W. -(1954)3 All.E.R 514) wherein it was held that if the
choice is between two interpretations, the narrower of which would fail to achieve the
manifest purpose of the legislation, we should avoid such a construction which would
reduce the legislation to futility, and should rather accept the bolder construction,
based on the view the parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing
about an effective result.
44. Time and again, Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of judgments has held that
whenever it is possible to do so, it must be done to construe the provisions which
appear to conflict so that they harmonise. The court must ascertain the intention of
the legislature by directing its attention not merely to the clauses to be construed but
to the entire statute.
45. Hon'ble Apex Court in SHASHIKANT SINGH vs TARAKESHWAR SINGH &
ANOTHER reported in (2002)5 SCC 738 has held that it is the duty of courts of
justice to try to get at the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the
whole scope of the statute to be construed.
It has been further held :
"8. When a statute is passed for the purpose of enabling something to be done, and
prescribes the way in which it is to be done, it may be either an absolute enactment or
a directory enactment. The difference being that an absolute enactment must be
obeyed or fulfilled exactly, but it is sufficient if a directory enactment be obeyed or
fulfilled substantially. No universal rule can be laid down as to whether mandatory
enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an implied
nullification for disobedience. it is the duty of courts of justice to try to get at the real
intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to
be construed (Craies on Statute Law, 7th Edn., pp. 260-62)
12. On facts, the court could not have intended while concluding the trial against
Chandra Shekhar Singh, to nullify its earlier order directing issue of warrants against
Respondent 1. The construction to be placed on a provision like this has to commend
to justice and reason. It has to be a reasonable construction to promote the ends of
justice. The words "could be tried together with the accused" in Section 319(1) cannot
be said to be capable of only one construction. If it was so, approach to be adopted
would be different since the intention of Parliament is to be respected despite the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 69
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
consequences of interpretation. There is, however, a scope for two possible
constructions. That being the position, a reasonable and common sense approach
deserves to be adopted and preferred rather than a construction that would lead to
absurd results of Respondent 1 escaping the trial despite passing of an order against
him on the court's satisfaction under Section 319(1) and despite the fact that the
proceedings against him have to commence afresh. In this view, the fact that trial
against Chandra Shekhar Singh has already concluded is of no consequence insofar
as Respondent 1 is concerned."
46. The constitutional validity of any law is to be tested in the teeth of law laid down by Hon'ble
Apex Court in:
(1) BHANUMATHI vs STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH, THROUGH ITS PRINCIPAL
SECRETARY AND OTHERS - (2010) 12 SCC 1; and (2) STATE OF BIHAR &
OTHERS vs BIHAR DISTILLERY LIMITED AND OTHERS -
(1997)2 SCC 453.
whereunder it came to be held that while judging the constitutionality of an enactment, the court
should (a) try to sustain validity of impugned law to the extent possible and it can strike down the
enactment only when it is impossible to sustain it; (b) the court should not approach the enactment
with a view to pick up holes or to search for defects of drafting or for the language employed; (c) the
court should consider that the Act made by the legislature represents the will of the people and that
cannot be lightly interfered with; (d) the court should strike down the Act only when the
unconstitutionality is plainly and clearly established; (e) the court must recognize the fundamental
nature and importance of legislative process and accord due regard and deference to it.
47. In R.S.RAGHUNATH vs STATE OF KARNATAKA AND ANOTHER reported in AIR 1992 SC 81
it has been observed by Hon'ble Apex Court:
12........ "The court must ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its
attention not merely to the clauses to be construed but to the entire statute; it must
compare the clause with the other parts of the law, and the setting in which clause to
be interpreted occurs."....
48. As noticed hereinabove, the constitutional validity of sub-section (4) of Section 8
of PML Act is under challenge. Contending said provision is in violation of Article 14
of the Constitution of India and dispossessing a person from the property without
due process of law would be in violation of Article 300A of the Constitution of India,
petitioners have prayed for said provision being struck down. Section 8 of PML Act
and corresponding amendments effected thereto reads as under:
Act of 15 Act of 22 of Act of 13 of
Act of 2 of 2013
of 2003 2009 2018

49. A plain reading of sub-section (4) of Section 8 would indicate that where the
provisional order of attachment is made under sub-section (1) of Section 5 has been
confirmed under sub-section (3), the Director or any other officer authorized by the
Director is empowered to take possession of the property so attached forthwith. By
Act, 2 of 2013 after the words "shall forthwith take the", the words "possession of the
attached property under Section 5 or frozen under sub-section (1-A) of Section 17, in
such manner as may be prescribed" came to be substituted. The proviso thereto also
came to be added which would indicate that if it is not possible to take possession of a
property frozen under sub-section (1-A) of Section 17, the order of confiscation shall
have the same effect as if the possession of the property had been taken.
50. A plain reading of sub-section (5) of Section 8 of PML Act would indicate that on
conclusion of a trial of an offence under the Act, if the Special Court finds that offence
of money laundering has been committed, it can order that such property involved in
the money laundering or which has been used for commission of an offence of money
laundering to stand confiscated to the Central Government. Thus, it would emerge
from these provisions that even if the Special court finds that offence under the Act
has not been committed and yet, if such property has been used for commission of
the offence of money laundering, even in such circumstances, the Special court can
order for confiscation of the property so attached.
51. At this juncture, it would be useful to notice that expression 'proceeds of crime'
has been defined to include 'property'. The expression 'property' has been defined
under clause (v) of Section 2(1) of the Act which defines property to mean "any
property or assets of every description" and this is clarified in the Explanation thereto
which came to be inserted by Act 2 of 2013. It reads :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 81
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
"Explanation - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the term
"property"
includes property of any kind used in the commission of an offence under this Act or any of the
scheduled offences."
Plain reading of above explanation would indicate that property includes "property of any kind used
in the commission of an offence under the Act" or "any of the scheduled offences". Even under
sub-section (5) of Section 8, the property which can be confiscated to the Central Government after
conclusion of a trial of an offence under the Act, includes property involved in money laundering or
which has been used for commission of an offence of money laundering. Thus, harmonious reading
of Sections 2(u), 2(v) and sub-section (5) of Section 8, it can be held without any iota of doubt that
expression "proceeds of crime" would not only include money used in the commission of an offence
under the Act but also the schedule offence. Thus, money laundering by itself is to be treated as a
'stand alone' offence, notwithstanding the schedule offence, if the circumstances warrant.
52. From yet another angle, the challenge to the validity of sub-section (4) of Section 8 ought to fail
for the reasons morefully indicated herein below:
53. On confirmation of an order of provisional attachment under Section 8(4) of PML Act, the
authorities specified thereunder would be empowered to take possession of the property so
attached. If the Special court arrives at a conclusion after trial, relating to an offence under the Act
that offence of money laundering has been committed, it can order for confiscating such property
involved in money laundering or which has been used for money laundering. Under sub-section (6)
of Section 8, if the Special court after trial finds that offence of money laundering has not taken
place or the property is not involved in money laundering, it can order for release of such property
to the person so entitled to receive it.
54. Section 8 as amended by the Amendment Act 2 of 2013 cannot be said to be arbitrary or violative
of fundamental right of a person, even if the proceedings are continued for trial of scheduled offence
resulting in acquittal and the alleged proceeds of crime pertained to that scheduled crime. It is to be
further noticed that mandate of sub-section (4) of Section 8 to the authorities is to take possession
of the property forthwith which is attached under Section 5 or frozen under sub-section (1-A) of
Section 17 on the provisional order of attachment made under sub-section (1) of Section 5 has been
confirmed under sub-section (3). The authorities have no discretion at all and they are bound to take
possession and the expression "possession" referred to in sub-section (4) refers to physical
possession. The judgment of the KAMARUNNISA's case relied upon by petitioners was rendered on
11.07.2012 i.e., pre 2013 amendment i.e., prior to Act 2 of 2013 coming into force. The amendment
which was brought to sub-section (4) of Section 8 namely, the expression "possession of the
property attached under Section 5 or frozen under sub-section (1-A) of Section 17 in such manner as
may be prescribed" was not found in sub-section (4) as it stood in the year 2009. Hence, the
judgment of KAMARUNNISA would not come to rescue of the petitioners.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 82
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
55. It is in the aforesaid background. the Rules namely, The Prevention of Money Laundering
(Taking Possession of Attached or Frozen Properties Confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority)
Rules, 2013 (for short 'Possession Rules, 2013') , which was made in exercise of the power vested
under sub-section (2) of Section 73 of PML Act which came into force with effect from 19.08.2013
will have to be seen. In the matter of KAMARUNNISA's case where Section 8(4) came to be
interpreted, neither the amended sub-section (4) nor the 2013 Rules were in force and as such the
interpretation extended to the word "possession" as found in sub-section (4) was held to be
constructive possession only. It is in this background, the Parliament introduced by Act 2 of 2013 to
interpret possession, to mean the possession as prescribed. The delegated legislation partakes the
character of a statutory provision. In fact, Section 5(4) would make it expressly clear that even
where the immovable property is attached, it does not prevent the person interested of its
enjoyment. However, when the provisional order of attachment is confirmed under sub-section (2)
of Section 8, the possession of such property has to be taken by the authorities specified thereunder
by the mandate of sub- section (4) of Section 8 and thereby deprive such person from the enjoyment
of the property. However, taking physical possession of such property is by the prescribed mode
namely, as prescribed under Rule 5 of Possession Rules, 2013. Hence, this court is of the considered
view that judgment of KAMARUNNISSA's case would have no application to the present scenario by
virtue of the Amendment Act i.e., Act 2 of 2013 and also having regard to the Possession Rules,
2013.
56. It can be further noticed that under sub-section (5) of Section 20, it enables the special court to
release all the property other than the property involved in money laundering to the person from
whom such property was seized or the persons entitled to receive it, after passing the order of
confiscation under sub-section (5) or sub-section (7) of Section 8. In other words, the special court
would adjudicate as to whether the property which has been provisionally attached and same having
been confirmed and arrived at a conclusion that such property was not involved in money
laundering is to be released or retained.
57. A conspectus reading of sub-sections (3), (4), (5), (6) of Section 8 along with Sections 20 and 21
of the PML Act and Rule 5 of Possession Rules 2013, it would clearly emerge that the stages of
confirmation of an order of provisional attachment, retention of the property so attached and the
seizure of the attached property and its possession being taken are all intermediatory stages prior to
confiscation. Thus, where the property is provisionally attached or record is seized from the
ownership, control or possession, of a person accused of an offence under Section 3 or not so
accused, the attachment, retention and the eventual authority to order confiscation of the property
would be dependent and contingent upon proof of guilt and finality of an order of conviction of a
person of the offence of money laundering under Section 3 or on conclusion arrived at by the Special
court that property so attached, retained and possession taken thereof was the property which had
been used for the commission of the offence of money laundering. The scheme of the Act empowers
the authorities under the Act to tentatively assume or form opinion after having recorded their
reasons to believe that any person is in possession of any proceeds of crime to provisionally attach
the property, its confirmation thereof, as well as taking possession of such property to secure the
interests of the State.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 83
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
58. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of STATE OF GUJARAT vs MOHAN LAL JITAMALJI
PORWA reported in (1987)2 SCC 364 while examining the expression "reasonable belief" found in
Section 123 and 135(1) read with Section 111 of Customs Act, 1962 has held:
"4. P.W.1 Superintendent of Customs xxx made of smuggled gold. Whether or not the
official concerned seized the article in the "reasonable belief" that the goods were
smuggled goods is not a question on which the court can sit in appeal. The law to this
effect has been declared in no unambiguous terms in PUKHRAJ vs D.R.KOHLI - AIR
1962 SC 1539. This court has administered caution to the courts not to sit in appeal in
regard to this question and has observed that if prima facie there are grounds to
justify the belief the courts have to accept the officer's belief regardless of the fact
whether the court of its own might or might not have entertained the same belief. The
law declared by this court is binding on the High Court and it was not open to the
High Court to do exactly what it was cautioned against by this court."
It has also been held that entire community is aggrieved if the economic offenders who are ruining
the economy of the State are not brought to book and the cause of the community deserves equal
treatment at the hands of the court in the discharge of its judicial function. The community or the
State is not a persona-non-grata whose cause may be treated with disdain.
59. PML Act was brought to prevent money laundering and confiscation of property derived from or
involved in money laundering. The statement of objects and reasons of the PML Act would clearly
indicate that PML Act is a complete code in itself, clearly defining the offence, the Scheme of
attachment of properties which are involved in the offence of money laundering and the hierarchy of
authorities before whom the matters would be taken up. The PML Act read as a whole would
indicate that same was brought to ensure that proceeds of crime are attached and offenders who
participate and assist in the commission of crime do not enjoy the benefits of the property which is
relatable to the crime. The PML Act envisages attachment of all properties involved in the offence of
money laundering and the proceeds of such crime would also come within the sweep of the PML
Act.
60. The issue which would fall for consideration by this court would be, whether eviction of the
occupant of a property or in other words, taking possession of the property which is provisionally
attached and thereafter confirmed, would be violative of Article 14 of Constitution of India or does it
amount to depriving a person of his property rights guaranteed under Article 300A of the
Constitution of India.
61. The Hon'ble Apex Court in YOGENDRA KUMAR JAISWAL vs. STATE OF BIHAR reported in
(2016) 3 SCC 183 has held:
"151. We are absolutely conscious that the said judgment was delivered in a different
context. What is prohibited under Article 20(1) is imposition of greater punishment
that might have been imposed and prohibition of a conviction of any person for
violation of law at the time of commission of the act. We repeat at the cost of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 84
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
repetition that confiscation being not a punishment does not come in either of the
categories. Thus viewed, the property of an accused facing trial under the 1988 Act
could be attached and there can be administration by third party of the said property
and eventual forfeiture after conviction. The term "attachment" has been understood
by this Court in Kerala State Financial Enterprises Ltd. v. Official Liquidator [Kerala
State Financial Enterprises Ltd. v. Official Liquidator, (2006) 10 SCC 709] in the
following manner: (SCC p. 713, para 11) "11. The word 'attachment' would only mean
'taking into the custody of the law the person or property of one already before the
court, or of the whom it is sought to bring before it'. It is used for two purposes: (i) to
compel the appearance of a defendant; and
(ii) to seize and hold his property for the payment of the debt. It may also mean
prohibition of transfer, conversion, disposition or movement of property by an order
issued by the court."
152. The legislature has though it property to change the nature and character of the interim
measure. The property obtained by ill-gotten gains, if prima facie found to be such by the authorized
officer, is to be confiscated. An accused has no vested right as regards the interim measure. He is not
protected by any constitutional right to advance the plea that he cannot be made liable to face
confiscation proceedings of the property which has been accumulated by illegal means. That being
the litmus test, the filament of reasoning has to rest in favour of confiscation and not against it.
Therefore, we are of the considered view that the provision does not violate any constitutional
assurance."
62. By incorporating Article 300A to the Constitution by 44th Amendment Act, 1978, it has resulted
in: (1) the right to hold property to be a fundamental right; and (2) it has been left to the legislature
to deprive a person of his property by the authority of law. The deprivation of property may take
place in various types such as confiscation or revocation of a proprietary right granted by a private
proprietor or seizure of goods or immovable property from the possession of an individual or
assumption of control of business. The expression "save by authority of law" would indicate that
executive cannot deprive a person of his property without specific legal authority. If the State sought
to acquire the property of an individual it could do only by making a law, and on payment of amount
by way of compensation for such expropriation. Thus, in effect it would clearly indicate that no
person can be deprived of his property, save by authority of law. In other words, if the property
belonging to a person is taken away by the State by exercising its executive power without legal right
to do so, then only Article 300A would be attracted or such person can complain of violation of
Article 300A of the Constitution of India and not otherwise.
63. Under Section 8(5) of the PML Act the Special Court is empowered to confiscate such property
after arriving at a conclusion that the offence of money laundering has been committed or such
property has been used for commission of the offence of money laundering. In that view of the
matter, it cannot be gainsaid by any of the petitioners that property which has been provisionally
attached and said provisional order of attachment having been confirmed, the possession of such
property cannot be taken under Section 8(4) of the PML Act or frozen under sub-section (1A) of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 85
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
Section 17. It is only the beneficial enjoyment of the property by the owner or the occupier which is
taken away by the authority by virtue of express provision namely Section 8(4). There is no
confiscation of the property or the owner of the property is not deprived of his title, which could
happen only under sub-section (5) of Section 8. Hence, at the stage of either the provisional order of
attachment passed under Section 5(1) or its confirmation thereof under Section 8(3), can it be
construed as a person of having been deprived of his right, title and interest over the property. These
stages as noticed hereinabove being intermediary stages before confiscation, the question of
deprivation of the property right to its owner by virtue of Article 300A of the Constitution does not
arise at all. Hence, contention raised in that regard is liable to be rejected and it is accordingly
rejected.
64. For the reasons aforestated, this court is unable to accept the contention raised by learned
Advocate appearing for petitioners that sub-section (4) of Section 8 of PML Act falls foul of either
Article 14 of the Constitution of India or Article 300A of the Constitution of India. Hence, Point
Nos.(i) and (iv) is answered against the petitioners and it is held that sub-section (4) of Section 8 is
intra- vires of the Constitution of India.
RE. POINT Nos.(ii) & (iii):
65. It takes me to the next contention raised by the learned Advocates appearing for the petitioners
namely, as to whether proceedings under the PML Act can be initiated by the authorities even
though offence specified under the Schedule not being in existence or in other words, even though
FIR is not registered for the offences specified in the schedule to the PML Act, against such person
who is facing the proceedings under the PML Act? Point Nos.(ii) & (iii) are interlinked. Hence, they
are taken up together for consideration, adjudication and being answered, since any opinion
expressed on either of them is likely to overlap.
66. Before embarking upon the journey of addressing these two points, it would be apt and
appropriate to notice the statutory provisions which would reflect on the findings that would be
recorded by this Court. Hence, the relevant provisions which are pressed into service and which are
likely to be noticed by this court while adjudicating these two points, namely, Sections 2(na), 2(p),
2(ra), 2(u), 2(y), 2(wa), 3, 4, 5 together with corresponding amendments brought about have been
tabulated herein below.

67. The main thrust of the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates appearing for the parties is
that the provisions of The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short 'PC Act') did not find a place
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 90
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
in the Schedule to the PML Act or in other words, Section 13 of PC Act came to be added to the
Schedule of the PML Act with effect from 01.06.2009 by Act 21 of 2009 and as such the offences
which had occurred prior to 01.06.2009 cannot be brought under the sweep of the PML Act or it
cannot be made applicable retrospectively. It has been further contended that for invoking the
provisions of PML Act, a person must have committed a schedule offence; there must be proceeds of
crime; either accused or a third party must be in possession of such proceeds of crime; must be
projecting that money or property as untainted; and there must be reasonable belief or
apprehension in the mind of the authority that such property will be concealed, transferred or dealt
with, resulting in frustrating the confiscation proceedings and only when these ingredients are
present, the proceedings under the PML Act can continue and not otherwise.
68. The PML Act is a special enactment having been enacted to deal with ever increasing menace of
money laundering. The provisions of the PML Act have over-riding effect over provisions in other
statutes or in other words, the provisions of PML Act prevail over anything inconsistent contained in
any other law. It is trite law that when two Acts are Special Acts, in such an event it is the later act
which will prevail. Hon'ble Apex Court in SOLIDAIRE INDIA LIMITED vs FAIRGROWTH
FINANCIAL SERVICES reported in JT 2001(2) SC 642 and in BANK OF INDIA VS. KETHAN
PAREKH reported in (2008) 8 SCC 148 has held when both Acts are Special Acts, it is subsequent
legislation which will have a over- riding effect. It was further observed by Hon'ble Apex Court that
cases might arise where both the enactments have the non-obstante clause, then in that event the
proper perspective would be that one has to see the subject and dominant purpose for which the
special enactment was made and in case the dominant purpose is covered by that contingencies,
then notwithstanding that the act might have come at a later point of time, the earlier enactment
prevails and the intention of law makers can be ascertained by looking to the objects and reasons.
69. In RAMA RAJU's case referred to supra, it has been further held that "unit of interpretation is
the Act as a whole and such of those provisions which are considered for interpretation but in the
context of the provisions of the Act." It is also held that the words of a statute, passed after the date
of a treaty and dealing with the same subject-matter, are to be construed, if they are reasonably
capable of bearing such a meaning, as intended to carry out the treaty obligation and not to be
inconsistent with it.
70. The said order passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh is a subject matter of challenge
before the Hon'ble Apex Court and that there is no interim order against the order passed by the
Andhra Pradesh High Court. This Court is in full agreement with the views expressed by the High
Court of Andhra Pradesh and do not find any good and valid ground to take any view contrary to the
view expressed by High Court of Andhra Pradesh.
71. In fact, the High Court of Gujarat in the matter of ALIVE HOSPITALITY AND FOOD PRIVATE
LIMITED VS. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS, 2013 SCC OnLine Guj 3909, has expressed its view
that it is in agreement with the views expressed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in B.RAMA
RAJU's case including the conclusions drawn thereunder. It has been further held:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 91
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
"10. Upon threadbare analysis and consideration of contentions of law viz.
jurisdiction and powers under Sections 5 and 8 of the PML Act, violation of rights of
the petitioners under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India,
inapplicability of provisions of penal nature with retrospective effect in the facts and
circumstances of the case and absence of any ingredients to bring the alleged
transaction about subject property within the definition of 'criminal proceeds',
property' and 'value of the property', etc. a complete answer is given by a Division
Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of B. Rama Raju.
11. In view of the above, I am in complete agreement with the conclusions drawn by
the Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of B. Rama Raju
[supra] whereby the contention that the definition of "proceeds of crime" [Section
2(1)(u)] is too broad and is therefore arbitrary and invalid since it subjects even
property acquired, derived or in the possession of a person not accused, connected or
associated in any manner with a crime and thus places innocent persons in jeopardy,
does not merit acceptance."
72. Section 2(p) defines "money laundering" and it has the same meaning as assigned to it in Section
3. A plain reading of Section 3 of PML Act would indicate that whosoever directly or indirectly
attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any
process or activity connected with the "proceeds of crime" including its concealment, possession,
acquisition or use and projecting or claiming it as untainted property would be guilty of the offence
of money laundering. The punishment for money laundering is prescribed under Section 4, which
shall not be less than three (3) years, but may extend upto 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. The
proviso to Section 4 would also indicate that if the proceeds of crime involved in money laundering
relates to any offence specified under paragraph 2 of Part A of the schedule, the punishment can
extend upto 10 years.
73. Section 2(u) defines the term "proceeds of crime" meaning any property derived or obtained,
directly or indirectly by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence or
the value of any such property or where such property is taken or held outside the country, then the
property equivalent in value held within the country. By Finance Act, 28 of 2016 the words "or
where such property is taken or held outside the country, then the property equivalent in value held
within the country" came to be inserted. By Act 13 of 2018, after the words "within the country" the
words "or abroad" came to be added. Thus, the definition of "proceeds of crime" as amended give a
wider ambit to include value of specific property equivalent in value held outside the country as well.
For instance, if a person in India is being labeled for having proceeds of crime in a country outside
India, then, in such a scenario, his property situated in India shall be attached even though it may
not have a relation to the proceeds of crime. The 2018 amendment has extended the ambit, wherein,
the authorities can now proceed against such property equivalent to proceeds of crime held outside
the country.
74. Thus, the expression "proceeds of crime" means any property derived or obtained directly or
indirectly by any person, as a result of criminal activity, related to a scheduled offence or the value of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 92
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
such property. The expression 'property' is elucidated in Clause (v) of Section 2, as any property or
assets of every description, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or immovable, tangible or
intangible and includes deeds and instruments evidencing title to, or interest in, such property or
assets, wherever located. Section 2 (u), therefore, does not envisage either mens rea or knowledge
that the property is a result of criminal activity. If any property, which includes value of the
property, is "proceeds of crime" then any transfer in terms of Section 2(za) requires examination to
verify as to whether it is by way of a money-laundering operation involving the process of
placement, layering or integration. Such property could be subjected to attachment and
confiscation. The Section, however, does not presuppose knowledge of the proceeds being of
criminal activity. Properties apart from the "proceeds of crime" are not liable to attachment, neither
is it included in the ambit of the Act. All that the Section is concerned with is the "proceeds of crime"
and does not extend to property not so involved.
75. A plain reading of the definition of "money laundering" as indicated in Section 2(p) would
indicate, it has not undergone any change and it has the same meaning as assigned to it under
Section 3. Whereas, Section 2(y) which defines "schedule offence" has undergone amendment
namely, sub-clause (ii) was substituted by Act No.21 of 2009. For the words "thirty lakh rupees or
more" was substituted by the words "one crore rupees or more".
76. The expression "schedule offence" is defined under Section 2(y), which means - (i) the offences
specified in Part-A of the Schedule; or (ii) the offences specified under Part-B of the Schedule if the
total value involved in such offences is one crore rupees or more; or (iii) the offences specified under
Part-C of the Schedule. Section 5 relates to attachment of the property involved in money
laundering. Thus, it is evident from the aforesaid provision of the PML Act that commission of a
schedule offence is not a fundamental precondition for initiating proceedings under the PML Act,
since the offence of money laundering is independent of schedule offence. From a plain reading of
the PML Act or on a conjoint reading of the provisions of the PML Act, it would leave no manner of
doubt that it deals only with laundering of money acquired by committing the scheduled offence. To
put it differently, the PML Act deals only with the process or activity with the proceeds of crime
including its concealment, possession or use. The PML Act has been enacted to prevent money
laundering and to provide for confiscation of property derived from or involved in, money
laundering.
77. Article 20 of the Constitution prohibits conviction except for violation of a law in force at the
time of commission of an offence. In other words, there cannot be prosecution under the PML Act
for laundering of money acquired by committing the schedule offences prior to the introduction of
the PML Act. Therefore, the time of commission of scheduled offences would not be relevant in the
context of the prosecution under the PML Act. What would be relevant in the context of prosecution
is the time of commission of the act of money laundering. The question would be, whether a person
involved in money laundering as provided under Section 3 of the PML Act has indulged in the said
act or not has to be decided by the competent authority. What is the date of laundering of money
will have to be decided on facts of each case and there cannot be any prescribed straight jacket
formula. This is an important fact which the authority will have to examine and it is a mixed
question of law and fact.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 93
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
78. A person acquiring assets through illegal means who comes before the society and claims that
said money was acquired by proper means, then he would be guilty of the offence of money
laundering. A person might have committed an offence long back and the proceeds of it is being
placed, layered or sought to be integrated to the main stream of economy, then also, he is said to
have committed the offence of money laundering. Incorporation of certain offences in the Schedule
is to bring it within the net of PML Act namely, proceeds of that crime within the provisions of the
Act. For constituting an offence under Section 3 of PML Act, it is the connection of transaction to
proceeds of crime which is sufficient and not the crime.
79. The main object of PML Act is to ascertain the proceeds of crime which involved in money
laundering and attachment, confirmation and confiscation of the proceeds of crime in the form of
properties and also to punish the offenders of money laundering. The date of acquisition of
properties is immaterial but the date of projecting the proceeds of crime as untainted properties
would only have to be ascertained by conducting investigation.
80. What is targeted by Section 3 is 'laundering of money' and therefore, the date of 'laundering'
would be relevant. The expression 'laundering' as found in Section 3 comprises of involvement in
any process or activity by which the illicit money is being projected as untainted. Thus, the relevant
date is not the date of acquisition of illicit money but the dates on which such money is being
processed by projecting it as untainted.
81. The offence of money laundering is not covered under any other provisions of law. This Court in
W.P.No.5299/2019 & connected matters disposed of on 29.08.2019 has held that a reference to
criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence has wider connotation and it may extend to a person
who may not be the offender but may be connected with criminal activity. It has been further held:
"25. The PML Act being a special enactment contemplates a distinct procedure at the
initial stage and thereafter provide for initiation of prosecution in order to achieve
the special purpose envisaged under the Act and as such, it cannot be construed that
proceedings under the PML Act is to be equated with prosecution initiated under the
criminal proceedings for the offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code. Thus,
initiation of action under the PML Act cannot have any implication or impact in
respect of registration of other cases either under the Indian Penal Code or any other
penal laws.
26. The offence of money laundering under Section 3 of the Act is an independent
offence. A reference to criminal activity relating to a schedule offence has wider
connotation and it may extend to a person, who is connected with criminal activity
relating to schedule offence, but may not be the offender of schedule offence. It is in
this background, it has to be necessarily held that money laundering is a stand alone
offence under the PML Act. In this background, when Section 44 of the PML Act is
perused, it would clearly indicate that special court may take cognizance of the
offence upon a complaint by authorized signatory, which means cognizance will be
taken of an offence which is separate and independent. The object of issuance of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 94
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
summons is to trace or ascertain the proceeds of crime if any and to take steps in that
regard like attaching the proceeds of crime if proved in a given case.
27. Even in case of a person who is not booked for a scheduled offence but is later
booked and subsequently acquitted for the offences punishable under different
enactments, prescribed under Part 'A' to Part 'C' of the Schedule, still such person can
be proceeded under PML Act. In other words, proceedings can be against persons
who are accused of a scheduled offence or against persons who are accused of having
committed an offence of money laundering and also persons who are found to be in
possession of the "proceeds of crime". It is not necessary that a person has to be
prosecuted under the PML Act only in the event of such person having committed
schedule offence. The prosecution can be independently initiated only for the offence
of money laundering as defined under Section 3 read with section 2(p) which
provides that "money laundering" having the meaning assigned to it under Section 3
of the Act."
"23. In other words, the proceedings under PML Act are independent, separate,
distinct and different from the proceedings initiated for scheduled offences by other
law enforcement agencies. PML Act is a stand alone enactment which differentiates
the Schedule offence and the money laundering offence separately. To put it
differently, if the investigation for the predicate offence is conducted by the
authorities so empowered under the enactments and if for various reasons such
proceedings were to be closed or dropped, then, proceedings under PML Act would
not automatically disappear or is not required to be dropped.
24. Even in case of proceeds of crime not being in possession of the alleged offenders,
but if it is sought to be projected as an untainted money and sought to be ploughed
into the economy, which ultimately derails the economy of the country, then,
authorities under the PML Act would be empowered to proceed under the provisions
of PML Act. As to whether it is proceeds of crime or its use or concealment or
acquisition is to be decided only by the adjudicating authority after verifying the facts
and circumstances that would be unraveled by verifying the relevant records and
documents during the course of investigation. The mere suspicion of the authorities
that proceeds of crime is being ploughed into main stream of the economy as
untainted money is sufficient enough for the authorities to investigate and examine
and this can be done only by collecting the information, recording the statements
who might not be the offender also."
82. In the light of aforestated analysis, this Court is of the considered view that existence of a
predicate offence for initiation of proceedings under the PML Act is not a condition precedent or in
other words, the offence under Section 3 of the PML Act is a stand alone offence. Hence, the
presence of a schedule offence as prescribed under the PML Act would not be condition precedent
for proceeding against such person under the PML Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 95
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
83. A plain reading of Section 5 of the PML Act would indicate where the Director or any other
officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorized by the Director for the purposes of said
section has reason to believe, to be recorded in writing, on the basis of material in his possession
would proceed to pass an order in writing provisionally attaching such property of any person who is
in possession of any proceeds of crime and if such proceeds of crime are likely to be concealed,
transferred or dealt with any manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings relating to
confiscation of such proceeds of crime. Every order of attachment made under sub-section (1) of
Section 5 shall cease to have effect after the expiry of the period specified in that said sub-section
(i.e., 180 days) or on the date of an order made under sub-section (2) of Section 8, whichever is
earlier. The first proviso to sub- section (1) would indicate that no such order of attachment can be
made unless, in relation to the schedule offence, a report of which has been forwarded to a
Magistrate under Section 173 of Code of Criminal Procedure or a complaint has been filed by a
person authorized to investigate the offence mentioned in that schedule as indicated thereunder.
However, second proviso to Section 5(1) would indicate that notwithstanding anything contained in
first proviso, any property of any person may be attached under Section 5 if the authorities specified
in sub-section (1) has reason to believe that such property involved in money laundering if not
attached immediately is likely to frustrate the proceedings under the PML Act. Section 5 mandates
that the officers specified thereunder should forward a copy of the order of provisional attachment
immediately along with the material in his possession to the adjudicating authority in a sealed
envelope in the manner prescribed and the adjudicating authority is required to keep such order and
material for such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (3) of Section 5 would indicate that order
of attachment made under sub-section (1) shall cease to have effect after the expiry of the period
specified thereunder or on the date of an order made under sub- section (2) of Section 8, whichever
is earlier. Sub-section (4) of Section 5 entitles the person interested in the property to enjoy the said
property which has been attached under sub-section (1). The authorities specified under sub-section
(5) of Section 5 are required to file a complaint stating the facts of such attachment before the
adjudicating authority.
84. It is contended that clause (b) of Section 5(1) of PML Act would indicate the legislative intent is
that attachment, adjudication and confiscation proceedings are to be initiated only against such
person who having been charged of/having committed a scheduled offence is in possession of
proceeds of any crime, which are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt with etc., is an
argument which requires to be considered for the purposes of rejection, inasmuch as, the second
proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 5 enables the authority referred to in sub- section (1) of Section
5 to attach any property of any person, in the event of such property involved in money laundering,
if not attached or the non-attachment is likely to frustrate any proceedings that may be initiated
under the PML Act. Second proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 would indicate that
notwithstanding anything contained in Clause (b), "any property" of "any person" may be attached.
This provision came into force by Act 21 of 2009 with effect from 06.03.2009. The second proviso to
Section 5(1) enjoins that any property of any person may be attached if the specified authority
therein has reason to believe on the basis of material in his possession that if such property is not
attached, it is likely to frustrate any proceedings under the PML Act. Thus, non-obstante clause in
second proviso clearly excludes clause (b) of Section 5(1). It is this clause (b) that incorporates or
mandates the requirement that the proceeds of crime should be in possession of a person who is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 96
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
charged of having committed a schedule offence, for initiating proceedings for attachment and
confiscation. Thus, reading of second proviso to clause (b) would clearly indicate that it excludes
clause (b) of Section 5(1). In other words, the legislative intent to exclude clause (b) of Section 5(1) in
the circumstances provided under the second proviso, is clear and unambiguous. To put it
differently, if other conditions set out in Section 5 of the PML Act are satisfied, any property of any
person could be proceeded against for attachment, adjudication and confiscation. In fact, the
definition of the expression "person" under Section 2(s) is not restrictive definition limited to a
person charged of having committed a schedule offence only and it includes "any other person" also.
85. The adjudicating authority on being satisfied and having reason to believe that any person has
committed an offence under Section 3 or in possession of proceeds of crime, would serve a notice
under Section 8(1) of not less than 30 days on such person by calling upon him to indicate the
sources of his income, earning or assets, out of which or by means of which he has acquired the
property attached. The adjudicating authority would thereafter pass an order by recording a finding
whether all or any of the properties referred to in the notice under sub- section (1) or involved in
money laundering. Thereafter the adjudicating authority would confirm or annul the provisional
order of attachment.
86. Thus, on a conspectus reading of Section 8(1), (2) and (3) it would emerge therefrom that on an
provisional order of attachment being passed under Section 5(1), such person would receive the
notice of not less than 30 days under sub-section (1) of Section 8 calling upon him to indicate the
sources of his income, earning or assets, out of which or by means of which he has acquired the
property attached. Such person is required to demonstrate before the adjudicating authority as to
why the said order of attachment should not be continued or confirmed. The adjudicating authority
on consideration of the reply, would arrive at a conclusion either confirming the provisional order of
attachment or annul the same. Sub-section (4) of Section 8 authorizes the authorities specified
thereunder to take possession of the property attached under Section 5 and on conclusion of trial of
an offence under the PML Act, such property would stand confiscated to the Central Government if
the Special Court finds that the offence of money laundering has been committed vide Section 8(5).
In the event of the Special Court arriving at a conclusion that money laundering has not taken place
or the property is not involved in money laundering, it would order release of such property to the
person entitled to receive it as indicated under Section 8(6). In the event of trial not being proceeded
for the reason of death of accused or the accused being declared a proclaimed offender or for any
other reason or having commenced trial, it could not be concluded, the Special Court on an
application filed by the Director or a person claiming to be entitled for possession of a property can
pass appropriate orders regarding confiscation or release of such property involved in the money
laundering after having regard to the material before it. Section 8(8) prescribes that where property
has been confiscated to the Central Government under sub-section (5) the Special Court can also
direct the Central Government to restore such confiscated property or part thereof of a claimant
with a legitimate interest in the property, who may have suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of
money laundering.
87. Yet another contention raised in W.P.No.24444/2015 is that, amendment made to Section 8(3)
to 8(6) has resulted in substantial rights accrued to the petitioner being extinguished. In other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 97
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
words, petitioner has prayed for unamended provisions of Section 8(3) to 8(6) being applied.
88. By amending Act 2 of 2013, Section 2(1)(ia) was inserted and the expression "scheduled offence
before a court and" found in clause (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 8 was substituted by the
expression "any offence under this act before a court or under the corresponding law of any other
country before the competent court of criminal jurisdiction outside India, as the case may be;". The
said amendment came into force from 15.02.2013.
89. As could be seen from clause (2)(1)(ia) the expression "corresponding law" has been defined
indicating the offences alleged to have been committed in any foreign country, should be
corresponding to the scheduled offence under the PML Act. A plain reading of this provision would
indicate that the parliament has only envisaged or has thought fit in its wisdom to rely on the
scheduled offences of the PMLA for holding person guilty in foreign jurisdictions and not leave out
the persons, who have committed the scheduled offences in India, by considering them as not guilty,
when both have indulged in money laundering activity. On an harmonious reading of both
provisions would imply that "any offence under this act before a court" would include any of the
scheduled offences, named under the act in terms of Section 2(1)(y) of the PML Act. Thus, intention
of the parliament by bringing an amendment to Section 8(3)(a), is to include the offenders who are
charged of scheduled offences committed in foreign jurisdictions, and have either laundered money
in India or have ploughed the proceed of crime in India. Thus, when the intention of the parliament
is gathered from this amended section, it would leave no manner of doubt, that intention of the
parliament was not to leave out the domestic offenders out of the ambit of scheduled offences, and
to bring only those charged under Section 8(3)(a) as amended.
90. The amended provision of Section 8(3)(a) uses the phrase "any offence under this act before a
court", and the use of expression "any offence" pre-supposes more than one offence which means
the scheduled offence defined under Section 2(1)(y) and not narrowly to mean only the offence of
money laundering as defined under Section 3 which is punishable under Section 4 as speciously
contended by the petitioners.
91. The proper and rational meaning to be attached to clause (a) in sub-section (3) of Section 8 is,
that once the provisional attachment order passed under Section 5, is confirmed by the adjudicating
authority under Section 8(3), the attachment would continue till the conclusion of proceedings
relating to any offence under PML Act. It does not mean that confirmation of provisional
attachment will not have any force if no proceedings relating to the offence of money laundering are
pending before Special Court on the date of confirmation.
92. The Finance Minister while introducing Bill No.133 of the Prevention of Money Laundering
(Amendment) Bill, 2011 in his notes on clause relating to Section 8 has made the following
explanation at clause (6):
"This clause seeks to amend section 8 of the Act relating to adjudication to delink the
attachment from of the property to the pendency of the proceedings relating to the
Scheduled offence and link it to the money laundering offence. It further seeks to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 98
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
delink the attachment to conviction. It also seeks to broaden the scope of seizing by
also enabling freezing of property and documents which cannot be seized. It also
seeks to take away the powers of the adjudicating authority to release the attached
properties, where the scheduled offence itself is found not to have been committed or
the attached property is not involved in money-laundering and vest the same with the
Special Court."
93. In the light of the aforestated analysis, this court is of the considered view that contention of the
petitioners with regard to applicability of unamended Section 8(3)(a) would not hold water and it is
liable to be rejected and accordingly it stands rejected.
94. The Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the matter of B RAMA RAJU vs UNION
OF INDIA reported in (2011) 3 ALD 443 (DB) having examined as to whether the provision of
Sections 5 and 8 of PML Act is in violation of Articles 14, 21 & 300A of the Constitution of India, has
held in the negative. It came to be held:
"25. In our considered view the petitioners' contention proceeds on a misconception
of the relevant provisions of the Act. Against transactions constituting money-
laundering, the provisions of the Act contemplate two sets of proceedings; (a)
prosecution for the offence of money- laundering defined in Section 3 with the
punishment provided in Section 4; and (b) attachment, adjudication and confiscation
in the sequential steps and subject to the conditions and procedures enumerated in
Chapter 111 of the Act. Section 2 (p) defines the expression "money-laundering" as
ascribed in Section 3. Section 3 defines the offence of Money-Laundering in an
expansive locus as comprehending direct or indirect attempt to indulge; assist, be a
party to or actually involved knowingly in any process or activity connected with the
proceeds of the crime and projecting it as untainted property. On proof of guilt and
conviction of the offence of Money- Laundering, the punishment provided in Section
4 of the Act would follow after a due trial by the Special Court;
which is conferred exclusive jurisdiction qua Section 44, Chapter VII of the Act. The
prosecution, trial and conviction for the offence of money- laundering are the
criminal sanction administered by the Legislation and effectuated by a deprivation of
personal liberty as a disincentive to a malfeasant. The second matrix of proceedings
targets the "proceeds of crime" defined in Section 2(u); as any property derived or
obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating
to a scheduled offence or the value of any such property, for initial attachment and
eventual confiscation.
26. Chapter III of the Act enables the specified authority, if he has reasons to believe
(the reasons to be recorded in writing), on the basis of material in possession of the
authority that any person charged of having committed a scheduled offence (Section
5(1)(b)) or even if not so charged (second proviso to Section 5(1)) is in possession of
proceeds of crime and such proceeds are likely to be concealed, transferred etc., in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 99
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
manner as may frustrate any proceedings relating to confiscation of such proceeds of
crime under Chapter III, to provisionally attach (Section 5(1));
confirm an order of provisional
attachment after a process of
adjudication (Section 8(3)); and
eventually pass an order confiscating such property (Section 8(6)).
27. On the afore-stated scheme the provisions of the Act, the prosecution under the
Act; and attachment and eventual confiscation proceedings are distinct proceedings.
These two sets of proceedings may be initiated against the same person if he is
accused of the offence of money-laundering. Even when a person is not so accused,
the property in his possession may be proceeded against for attachment and
confiscation, on a satisfaction by the appropriate and competent authority that such
property constitutes proceeds of crime.
28. In our considered view, the provisions of the Act which clearly and
unambiguously enable initiation of proceedings for attachment and eventual
confiscation of property in possession of a person not accused of having committed
an offence under Section 3 as well, do not violate the provisions of the Constitution
including Articles 14, 21 and 300-A and are operative proprio vigore."
95. The offence of money laundering under Section 3 of the PML Act is an offence independent of
predicate offence and to launch prosecution under Section 3 of the PML Act, it is not necessary that
a predicate offence should also have been committed. In fact, Section 3 criminalizes the possession
or the conversion of the proceeds of crime, which includes projecting or claiming the proceeds of
crime as untainted property. The element of mens-rea is inherent in the section as against the
provision of Section 2(u), thereby preventing prosecution of any innocent person.
96. The expression "proceeds of crime" as defined under Section 2(u) would not merely include the
property derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence but also
the value of any such property. Thus, contention of the petitioners that where proceeds of crime has
been transferred by virtue of several transactions and thereby several persons having absolutely no
knowledge or information as to the previous knowledge of criminality attached to the property
cannot be proceeded is an argument which cannot be accepted inasmuch as, the authorities under
the Act are empowered to proceed against each and all of such consequential transactions, thus,
bringing within the scope of Chapter III of the Act, all the properties involved in the transactions.
97. It would not be out of context to refer at this juncture itself Sections 23 and 24 of the PML Act.
For the purposes of convenience, said provisions are extracted herein below:
"23. Presumption in inter-connected transaction.-- Where money laundering involves
two or more inter-connected transactions and one or more such transactions is or are
proved to be involved in money-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 100
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
laundering, then for the purposes of adjudication or confiscation [under section 8 or
for the trial or the money-laundering offence, it shall unless otherwise proved to the
satisfaction of the Adjudicating Authority or the Special Court], be presumed that the
remaining transactions form part of such inter-connected transactions.
24. Burden of Proof.--In any proceeding relating to proceeds of crime under this
Act,--
(a) in the case of a person charged with the offence of money-laundering under
section 3, the authority or Court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that
such proceeds of crime are involved in money laundering; and
(b) in the case of any other person the Authority or Court, may presume that such
proceeds of crime are involved in money-
laundering."
98. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR INDIA vs AMRATHLAL
PRAJIVANDAS reported in (1994)5 SCC 54 while considering the validity of provisions of the
Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 (SAFEMA) has
observed:
"The relatives and associates are brought in only for the purpose of ensuring that the
illegally acquired properties of the convict or detenu, acquired or kept in their names,
do not escape the net of the Act. It is a well- known fact that persons indulging in
illegal activities screen the properties acquired from such illegal activity in the names
of their relatives and associates. Sometimes they transfer such properties to them,
may be, with an intent to transfer the ownership and title. In fact, it is immaterial
how such relative or associate holds the properties of convict/detenu - whether as a
benami or as a mere name-lender or as a bona fide transferee for value or in any
other manner. He cannot claim those properties and must surrender them to the
State under the Act. Since he is a relative or associate, as defined by the Act, he
cannot put forward any defence once it is proved that that property was acquired by
the detenu whether in his own name or in the name of his relatives and associates."
In fact, the aforesaid judgment has been referred to in RAMA RAJU's case referred to supra and
concluded as under:
"46. The object of the Act is to prevent money-laundering and connected activities
and confiscation of "proceeds of crime" and preventing legitimizing of the money
earned through illegal and criminal activities by investments in movable and
immovable properties often involving layering of the money generated through illegal
activities, i.e., by inducting and integrating the money with legitimate money and the
expression "proceeds of crime" expansively to sub- serve the broad objectives of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 101
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
Act. We thus do not find any infirmity in the provisions of the Act."
99. The expression "proceeds of crime" covers any property derived or obtained directly or indirectly
by any person, as a result of criminal activity, related to a scheduled offence or the value of such
property. The expression 'property' is elucidated in Clause (v) of Section 2, as any property or assets
of every description, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or immovable, tangible or
intangible and includes deeds and instruments evidencing title to, or interest in, such property or
assets, wherever located. Section 2(u), therefore, does not envisage either mens rea or knowledge
that the property acquired is a result of criminal activity.
100. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of KARTAR SINGH vs STATE OF PUNJAB, reported
1994 SCC (Cri) 899 has held that in a criminal action, the general conditions of penal liabilities are
indicated in the word maxim "actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea" i.e., the act alone does not
amount to guilt, it must be accompanied by a guilty mind. But there are exceptions to this Rule and
the reason for this is that the legislature, under certain situations and circumstances, in its wisdom,
may think it so important, in order to prevent a particular act from being committed to forbid or
rule out the element of mens rea as a constituent part of a crime or of adequate proof of intention or
actual knowledge. It has been further held that unless a statute either expressly or by necessary
implication rules out mens rea in cases of this kind, the element of mens rea must be read into the
provisions of the statute itself.
101. An argument is also canvassed on behalf of the respondents - revenue that the offence of money
laundering is a continuing offence, since it also punishes possession of property acquired from crime
and therefore, there is no question of retrospective criminalization.
102. In the case of STATE OF BIHAR vs. DEOKARAN NENSHI reported in (1972) 2 SCC 890 the
Apex Court has distinguished as to what constitutes a continuing offence which is distinguishable
from the offence which is committed once and for all. It has been held:
"5. A continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is
distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all. It is one of those
offences which arises out of a failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement
and which involves a penalty, the liability for which continues until the rule of it
requirement is obeyed or complied with. On every occurs and reoccurs, there is the
offence committed. The distinction between the two kinds of offences is between an
act or omission which constitutes an offence once and for all and an act of omission
which continues and therefore, constitutes a fresh offence every time or occasion on
which it continues. In the case of a continuing offence, there is thus the ingredient of
continuance of the offence which is absent in the case of an offence which takes place
when an act or omission if committed once and for all."
103. Having regard to the aforesaid authoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
when the scheme of PML Act is seen that money laundering is a continuing offence and as such
question of it being made retrospective effect does not arise.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 102
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
104. The process of money laundering involves three (3) stages namely, placement, layering,
integration. In the case of a continuing offence the ingredient of the offence continued i.e., endure
even after the period of consummation, whereas in a instantaneous offence, the offence takes place
once and for all, when the same actually takes place. In such cases, there is no continuing offence
even though the damage resulting from injury may itself continue. The amendments brought about
under the PML Act by Act 20 of 2005, 21 of 2009, 2 of 2013, 28 of 2016 and 13 of 2018 neither
create the new offence nor enhance the punishment nor they have changed the procedure or forum
of trial to prejudice of the accused and it is only procedural in nature and as such it would have
retrospective effect as the offence is continuing one. In other words, the money laundering offence is
a continuing offence.
105. Thus, in case of the proceeds of crime are being projected as being untainted and thereby
ploughing such tainted money to the economy of the country, it would definitely have delirious
effect and impact on the economy and as such the offence which has been committed and
continuing would not wipe-out the offence committed on the premise that act is prospective and
cannot have retrospective effect. It would be that date when a person is found involved in any
process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting as untainted property, which
would be the relevant date for the purposes of prosecution under Section 3 of the PML Act and not
the date when the scheduled offence was committed. What is being targeted by Section 3 is the
"laundering" of money which would be relevant. The expression "laundering" as used in Section 3
comprises of involvement in any process of activity by which the illicit money is being projected as
untainted. In that view of the matter, the relevant date is not the date of acquisition of illicit money
but the dates on which such money is being processed and projected it as untainted.
106. The High Court of Mumbai, in the matter of RADHA MOHAN LAKHOTIA vs. DEPUTY
DIRECTOR PMLA, reported in 2010 SCC OnLine Bom 1116, while examining the question as to
whether Section 5 can be invoked against a person who is not named as an accused in the
commission of a scheduled offence?, has discussed the definition of the expression "person"
occurring in Section 2(s) and held that on conjoint reading with Section 5(1), wherein the expression
"any person" is referred that proceeds of crime may be or can be in possession of "any person", be it
a person charged of having committed a scheduled offence "or otherwise". It has been further held:
"11. The question is whether section 5 can be invoked against a person who is not
named as an accused in the commission of a scheduled offence? Sub-section (1) of
Section 5 will have to be read as a whole conjointly with the other provisions of the
Act already referred to hitherto, including section 8 thereof. Section 5 authorises the
Director or any other officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorised by
Director for the purposes of the said section to resort to action of "attachment of
property" if he has reason to believe and the reason of such belief has been recorded
in writing arrived at on the basis of material in his possession. That action is intended
to freeze the proceeds of crime, which property, is derived or obtained directly or
indirectly as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence or value of
any such property until the criminal action for the scheduled offence is taken to its
logical end against the accused named therein. The proceeds of crime means any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 103
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
property or assets of every description, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or
immovable, tangible or intangible and includes deeds and instruments evidencing
title to, or interest in, such property or assets, wherever located -- which has been
derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of criminal activity relating to a
scheduled offence or the value of such property. The proceeds of crime may be or can
be in possession of "any person" Be it a person charged of having committed a
scheduled offence "or otherwise" In the case of any other person in possession of
proceeds of crime, if it is also found that he has directly or indirectly attempted to
indulge or knowingly assisted or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any
process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it as
untainted property, he shall be liable to be prosecuted for offence under section 3
read with section 4 of the Act of 2002 -- in addition to suffering the action of
attachment of the proceeds of crime in his possession. Attachment of proceeds of
crime in possession of any person (other than the person charged of having
committed a scheduled offence) will, therefore, be legitimate within the sweep of
Section 5 of the Act of 2002. In our opinion, the thrust of section 5 is to attach every
property involved in money-laundering irrespective of whether it is in possession of
the person charged of having committed a scheduled offence or any other person-
provided however it must be shown to be proceeds of crime and further, that
proceeds of crime are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt with in any manner,
which may result in frustrating any proceedings relating to confiscation of such
proceeds of crime under the Act.
12. Going by the definition of "person"
occurring in Section 2(s) and on conjoint reading of section 2(u), which also refers to "any person"
coupled with the purpose and intent for which the enactment has been brought into force, accepting
the argument of the appellants would result in a pedantic approach and limiting the plenitude of
action of attachment and confiscation of proceeds of crimes only in the hands of the persons who
have been charged of having committed a scheduled offence and none else. Whereas, the Act has
come into being to prevent money laundering and to provide for confiscation of property derived
from or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. It
is the outcome of the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action, as annexed to the
resolution S-17/2 adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its seventeenth special
session on the twenty-third day of February, 1990.
It has come into being also on account of the Political Declaration adopted by the Special Session of
the United Nations General Assembly held on 8th to 10th June, 1998 which called upon the
Members States to adopt national money-laundering legislation and programme. The term "money-
laundering" has the same meaning assigned to it in Section 3 of the Act of 2002. It essentially refers
to the tainted property which is derived from criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. Such
tainted property may travel at different levels or by way of circular transactions for being eventually
projected as untainted property in the hands of or possession of person other than the person
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 104
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
charged of having committed a scheduled offence. That involves direct or indirect involvement of
person or persons other than the person(s) accused of having committed a scheduled offence. Such
other person(s) may directly or indirectly attempt to indulge or knowingly assist or knowingly is a
party or is actually involved in any process or activities connected with the proceeds of crime and
projecting it as untainted property. If such is the nature of activity, the Act of 2002 is intended to
deal with the same sternly. In a given case a person can be in possession of any proceeds of crime
without his knowledge that the property held by him is tainted. That person may not face
prosecution under section 3 of the Act of 2002. But even in his case, an order of attachment of the
proceeds of crime can be invoked and later end up with confiscation thereof depending on the
outcome of the criminal action against the person charged of having committed a scheduled offence.
The action of attachment is not in relation to a person as such but essentially to freeze the proceeds
of crime. The interpretation given by the Appellants, if accepted would be destructive of the said
legislative intent. Suffice it to observe that the term "person"
appearing in clause (a) of Section 5(1) of the Act cannot be limited to the person who has been
charged of having committed a scheduled offence. If that was the intent of the legislature, there was
no reason to insert clause (a). In that case, the Legislature would have simply provided for any
person who has been charged of having committed a scheduled offence and in possession of any
proceed of crime, such proceeds of crime can be attached and confiscated, subject to fulfillment of
the specified conditions."
107. Hence, this Court is of the considered view that contentions raised by the petitioners to quash
the proceedings on the ground of the proceedings initiated against them is without jurisdiction for
want of either there being no predicate offence or on the date of launch of proceedings under the
PML Act, the predicate offence referred to in the schedule was not incorporated in the schedule and
as such, there would be retrospective application of law cannot be accepted, inasmuch as, the
offence of money laundering as indicated under Section 3 of PML Act is a stand-alone offence. It is
to be further noticed that the proceedings initiated by the authorities by passing an order of
provisional attachment and its confirmation thereof would not fail or lapse on account of any
procedural irregularity for the reasons indicated herein above. Hence, this court holds that point
Nos.(ii) and
(iii) are to be answered against the petitioners and they are accordingly answered.
RE: POINT NO.(v):
108. It is contended by the respondents that on provisional orders of attachment being passed, show
cause notices have been issued and even without filing objections to the said show cause notices by
explaining as to why the provisional order of attachment should not be confirmed, petitioners have
invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court by challenging either the provisional orders of
attachment or consequential show cause notice issued and as such the writ petitions are not
maintainable. It is also contended that where the provisional orders have been confirmed by the
adjudicating authority, the aggrieved person has a right of appeal to the appellate tribunal and in
case of the order passed by the tribunal dismissing the appeal, the aggrieved party can yet again file
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 105
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
one more appeal to this court and without exhausting the said alternate remedies available under
the PML Act the petitioners have approached this court by filing the writ petition and as such the
petitions are liable to be dismissed on the ground of petitioners having not availed the alternate
remedy available under the PML Act.
109. Countering the said arguments, it has been contended by the petitioners that on account of
there being challenge to the constitutional validity as well as the jurisdictional issue having been
raised, the writ petitions are maintainable.
110. This court, while examining similar issue of exercise of writ jurisdiction, had an occasion to
consider the said issue in the matter of BANGALORE TURF CLUB vs UNION OF INDIA,
MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND OTHERS reported in ILR 2015 KAR 1825 and after referring to
catena of judgments referred to thereunder, it came to be held:
"20. It is well settled law that when an alternate or efficacious remedy is available to a
litigant same should be exhausted before invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction and
when such jurisdiction is invoked the existence of adequate alternate remedy will be
taken note of before issuing writ or exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction. Where
such alternate remedy is available it would be normal to refrain thereof. However,
writ Courts would not lose sight of the fact that a writ in the nature of certiorari will
issue, provided the requisite grounds exist and mere existence of alternate remedy
would not per se act as a barrier to the issuance of such writs. The exercise of
extraordinary jurisdiction by the writ Court would depend upon variety of individual
facts which is pre-eminently one of discretion. No flexible rule can be laid down or in
other words there cannot be any straight jacket formula in this regard."
111. The Hon'ble Apex Court in WHIRLPOOL vs REGISTRAR OF TRADE MARKS, MUMBAI AND
OTHERS reported in (1998)8 SCC 1 has held, that issue of prerogative writs under Articles 226 of
the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the Constitution. It
has also been held that having regard to the facts of the case, the High Court has discretion to
entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The availability of an alternate remedy would not
operate as a bar to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction namely, where the writ petition has been
filed to enforce the fundamental rights or where there has been violation of fundamental rights or
where there has been violation of principles of natural justice or where the order or proceedings is
wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is under challenge. It has been further held:
"15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts
of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But the
High Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which is that if an
effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court would not normally
exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been consistently held by this
Court not to operate as a bar in atleast three contingencies, namely, where the writ
petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or
where there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or where the order

or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.
There is a plethora of case law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic
whirlpool, we would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the
constitutional law as they still hold the field."
112. A plain reading of Section 5, 8, 26 and 42 of PML Act would indicate that under sub-section (1)
of Section 5 the authorities specified thereunder are empowered to pass an order provisionally
attaching such property on the reasonable belief that any person is in possession of any proceeds of
crime; and such proceeds of crime are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt with any manner
which may result in frustrating any proceedings relating to confiscation of such proceeds of crime.
Every order of attachment made under sub-section (1) of Section 5 shall seize to have effect after the
expiry of the period specified in that said sub-section (180 days) or on the date of an order made
under sub-section (2) of Section 8, whichever is earlier. The authorities specified under sub-section
(5) of Section 5 are required to file a complaint stating the facts of such attachment before the
adjudicating authority. The adjudicating authority on being satisfied and having reason to believe
that any person has committed an offence under Section 3 or in possession of proceeds of crime,
would serve a notice of not less than 30 days on such person by calling upon him to indicate the
sources of his income, earning or assets, out of which or by means of which he has acquired the
property attached. The adjudicating authority shall thereafter pass an order by recording a finding
whether all or any of the properties referred to in the notice under sub-section (1) or involved in
money laundering. Thereafter the adjudicating authority would confirm or annul the provisional
order of attachment. Thus, on a provisional order of attachment being passed, such person would
receive the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 8 to reply to the same and demonstrate before the
adjudicating authority as to why the said order of attachment should not be continued or confirmed.
After consideration of the reply, the adjudicating authority were to arrive at a conclusion that
provisional order of attachment is to be confirmed, it would proceed to confirm the same under
Section 8(2). This order of confirmation is appealable before the appellate tribunal under Section 26
of PML Act. In the event of the appellate tribunal were to either confirm, vary, modify or set aside
the order of adjudicating authority, the aggrieved person would be at liberty to challenge the same
by filing further appeal under Section 42 before this court within sixty days from the date of
communication of the decision. Thus, sufficient safeguards protecting the interests of the aggrieved
persons including granting of opportunity to file reply to the provisional order of attachment is
found in the provisions aforestated and as such this court is of the considered view that these
provisions would provide ample opportunity to the aggrieved person to challenge the order passed
by the authorities and as such it cannot be gainsaid, there would be violation of principles of natural
justice or on that ground the writ petition would be maintainable.
113. In the writ petitions filed at Sl.No.I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII and IX, the challenge is not only to the
provisional order of attachment but also to the confirmation order of attachment, notice issued
seeking information from the Banks and financial institutions, consequential notices issued to
comply with the confirmation order of attachment, consequential notice for handing over possession
of the properties issued, summons issued under Section 50(3) and the remand application filed
before the Special Judge of PMLA Court and as such on the short ground of the petitioners having
not availed the remedy provided under Section 8, 26 and 42 of the PML Act, the writ petitions are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 107
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
liable to be dismissed. However, this court desist from doing so for the reason, the grounds urged in
some of the writ petitions would touch upon the very jurisdiction of the authority to adjudicate and
the procedural aspects alleging violation of principles of natural justice being involved and as such
this court has proceeded to adjudicate the writ petitions on merits also. Hence, in the facts obtained
in the present case Point No.(v) is answered in the negative.
RE. POINT NO.(vi) IN THE MATTER OF
W.P.Nos.4215/2017, 6159/2017, 6173/2017 &
8261/2017:
114. In these writ petitions the company as well as former Directors and ex-employees have
challenged the communication issued by the Chief Director of Enforcement Directorate to the Chief
Executive Officer of the Association of Mutual Funds of India (for short "AMFI"), contending
interalia that it is a colourable exercise of power without jurisdiction and arbitrary.
115. It is the contention of Sri. Uday Holla, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners that in W.P.No.6159/2017, there is no provisional order of attachment passed, yet the
impugned letter dated 06.01.2017 (Annexure-A) is issued by the Assistant Director, Directorate of
Enforcement to AMFI calling upon the noticee to furnish details of investments made by the
petitioner-company in mutual funds/fixed maturity plans of various asset management companies,
who are members of the noticee. He would draw the attention of the Court to the said
communication to contend that AMFI is not a government organization nor an instrumentality of
State and it is not a profit organization. He would contend that Section 2(na) of the PML Act deals
with 'investigation' to be conducted by the authorities designated thereunder and the impugned
communication has been issued by a person other than who is authorized to conduct investigation.
He would also draw the attention of the court to Section 54(j) of PML Act to contend that AMFI is
not one of the authorities notified thereunder. He would further contend that "reporting entity" as
defined under Section 2(wa) of the PML Act would not take within its sweep the notice, as it is an
association, which is not carrying any profession of banking or being a financial institution or
intermediary or a person carrying on a designated business or profession, as indicted thereunder.
He would also contend that under Section 17 it is only the Director or Deputy Director who can
order for such seizure and the impugned communication which is issued by the Assistant Director is
without jurisdiction. He would also contend that Assistant Director has no power to freeze the
account except under Section 17(1A) of the PML Act. In substance he would contend that;
(i) officer who has issued the impugned communication has no jurisdiction;
(ii) AMFI is not a reporting entity nor does it fall within the ambit of Section 54; and,
(iii) the officer issuing the impugned communication must have reason to believe that money
laundering exits, which is not forthcoming from the impugned communication.
He would further contend that petitioners in W.P.Nos.6159/2017, 6173/2017 and 8261/2017 have
ceased to be the Directors and employee of the company and their life savings in mutual funds have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 108
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
been frozen and under the guise of investigation which exercise cannot be undertaken. Hence, he
has prayed for allowing the writ petitions.
116. At the outset it requires to be noticed that petitioner in W.P.No.4215/2017 has strangely
contended that there is no provisional order of attachment having been passed, though such
provisional order came to be passed on 27.02.2017 under Section 5(1) of the PML Act. In fact, a
show cause notice dated 20.02.2017 under Section 8 of the PML Act has also been issued by the
adjudicating authority (PMLA), New Delhi to the petitioner. The provisional order of attachment
dated 27.02.2017 as well as the show cause notice dated 20.02.2017 came to be challenged before
this court in W.P.No.11544/2017 and said writ petition came to be dismissed vide order dated
06.10.2017. The copy of the said order has been filed by the learned counsel appearing for the
respondent along with memo dated 09.11.2017 which discloses this court had held that writ petition
filed against a provisional order of attachment is not maintainable. As such contention raised by the
learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner with regard to there being no provisional order
passed would not hold water and said contention is liable to be rejected. On this short ground alone,
this writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
117. By the impugned communication first respondent has called upon second respondent to inform
its members to furnish information about any investment having been made by the
petitioner-company with the members of the second respondent in mutual funds/other plans and if
so to furnish the details thereof. The second respondent has also been informed that such
investments should not be redeemed or released until further instructions are issued as per Section
2(na) and Section 54 of the PML Act. Thus, it would be apt and appropriate at this stage to extract
Section 2(na) of the PML Act, which reads:
"2(na) "investigation" includes all the proceedings under this Act conducted by the
Director or by an authority authorized by the Central Government under this Act for
the collection of evidence;"
118. A conjoint reading of Section 2(u) and 3 would make it explicitly clear that authorities under the
PML Act are empowered to investigate any allegation relating to any activity connected with
"proceeds of crime" including its concealment, possession, acquisition or use and projecting or
claiming the same to be untainted property. Any person who directly or indirectly attempts or
indulges or knowingly assists or is a party in such process is said to have committed an offence
under PML Act.
119. Investigation as defined under Section 2(na) is an inclusive definition. Chapter III, IV and V of
PML Act provide for exercise of powers by the investigation agencies. Sections 16 to 18, Section 20
and 21 of the PML Act provide such authorities the powers to survey, seizure and retention or
proceeds of crime or any record or property relating thereto upon recording reasonable belief as
postulated under the said provisions. Section 12 and 12A of the PML Act casts duty upon the
"reporting entities" namely, banks and financial institutions to maintain records of transactions,
identities of persons, entering into such transactions and report the same to the authorities under
the PML Act. Section 19 of the PML Act provides for power to arrest. Sections 5, 8 and 9 of the PML
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 109
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
Act provide for attachment of proceeds of crime or records/properties related thereto upon
recording reasonable belief thereto and eventual confiscation of such attached/retained properties.
Section 54 of the PML Act provides for duty of certain officers and others to assist the authorities for
enforcement of the PML Act. Officers of "reporting entities" i.e., banks and financial institutions
would fall in the aforesaid category.
120. Now turning my attention to the issue raised about lack of jurisdiction on the part of first
respondent to make request to the second respondent-AMFI for not redeeming/releasing the
investments that has been made by the petitioner with the members of AMFI, will have to be
examined in the background of Section 2(na), which defines "investigation". As already noticed
hereinabove, the said definition is an inclusive definition and would empower the investigating
agency to take recourse to not only proceedings under the PML Act but also to all incidental and
consequential acts that may be necessary for effectively pursuing such proceedings under the Act
and to ensure collection of evidence. The investigation commences as soon as the authority decides
to take the first step whether by way of seeking evidence or by way of seeking explanation from the
person concerned who is said to have indulged in money laundering. It is not necessary that it
should commence with the communication of such acquisition to the person concerned. Nor is there
any rule of justice or fair play which requires the authority to seek the comments of the person
concerned before embarking upon an investigation. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of
DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT VS DEPPAK MAHAJAN reported in AIR 1994 SC 1775 has
held that the word "investigation" cannot be limited only to police investigation but on the other
hand, the said word is with wider connotation and flexible so as to include the investigation carried
on by any agency whether he be a police officer or empowered or authorized officer or a person not
being a police officer under the direction of a Magistrate to make an investigation vested with the
power of investigation. The prime object of an investigation for an offence of money laundering is
that the investigating agency must be empowered to take immediate steps so that monies credited in
suspicious account are not allowed to be withdrawn and thereby rendering the proceedings to be
initiated under the PML Act otiose or infructuous. There may be instances that during the course of
such investigation carried out by the authorities under the PML Act, to lay their hands on suspicious
transactions and/or go in such of trial of monies in the accounts maintained by "any person" who is
being investigated for the offence under the PML Act. Thus, when this process of investigation has
commenced namely, the authorities are attempting to trace, identify and verify the source of such
monies invested or deposited from such accounts, if permitted to be withdrawn, the investigation
would lose its purpose and it may become an exercise in futility. It is to prevent such contingencies,
the investigating agency must be necessarily held to possess the incidental power to request a
reporting entity namely, banking company, financial institution, intermediary or a person carrying
on a designated business such information as may be necessary. Thus, the expression
"investigation" as found in the PML Act will have to be necessarily held as an inclusive definition
and it would take within its sweep all such incidental and consequential powers, which would be
necessary to achieve the ultimate end i.e., collection of evidence and consequently, achieving the
object of the Act.
121. In fact, the issue relating to the Assistant Director having issued the impugned communication
being without power does not arise, inasmuch as, the notice in question has been issued by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 110
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
Assistant Director and there is no prohibition under Section 54 of the PML Act for the said authority
issuing the impugned communication. In fact, under Section 48 of the PML Act the authorities
specified thereunder who would exercise the power under the PML Act includes the Assistant
Director.
122. The Director of Enforcement has been appointed vide Notification No.GSR 441 (E) dated
01.07.2005 by the Government of India, by virtue of the powers conferred under Section 49(1) of the
PML Act by authorizing him to exercise the exclusive powers conferred under Sections 5, 8, 16 to 21,
26(1), 45, 50, 57, 58A, 58B, 60, 62 and 63 and therefore, he becomes an authority as indicated under
Section 48. The said Director has the exclusive power under Section 5 to "authorize" officers not
below the rank of Deputy Director for the purpose of Section 5 and the Director of Enforcement in
his capacity as Director under PML Act has indeed "authorized" all Deputy Directors of
Enforcement to provisionally attach the property in respect of cases registered for investigation in
their respective zones in accordance with PML Act and Rules made thereunder vide Notification
F.No. T- 1/HQ/03/PMLA/207 dated 07.02.2007. In fact, the Central Government in exercise of its
power conferred under Section 49(1) has appointed the Deputy Director under Foreign Exchange
Management Act, 1999, as the Deputy Director for the purpose of PMLA vide order S.O.1274(E) in
F.No.6/2/2005-ES which has been duly notified in the Gazette of India Extraordinary, Part-II,
Section-3(ii) in No.961 on 13.09.2005.
123. Investigation encompasses the power of the authority to summon or call for documents from
the reporting entities. Section 2(wa) defines 'reporting entity' as:
"(wa) "reporting entity" means a banking company, financial institution,
intermediary or a person carrying on a designated business or profession;"
(emphasis supplied)
124. Section 12 of the PML Act mandates that the reporting entity should maintain records of all its
transactions and the details specified in clause (a) to (d) of sub-section (1) should be confidential
and to be maintained for a period of five (5) years and insofar as, the record of documents specified
in clause (e) of sub-section (1) such records are to be maintained for a period of five (5) years after
the business relationship between the client and the reporting entity has ended or the account has
been closed, whichever is later. Section 12A empowers the Director to call from reporting entity any
of the records referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 12 and additional information as he considers
necessary.
125. Under Section 54 of the Act officers specified in clauses (a) to (j) are empowered and required
to assist the authorities under PML Act. This Section neither prohibits nor prevents the power of the
investigating authority to call for information or records from a banking company, financial
institution, intermediary or a person carrying on a business or profession. The acts which are
necessary and incidental for exercise of a statutory power are to be inferred by necessary
implication, as otherwise, such statutory power would be of no use. The second respondent being an
financial institution and also falling within the expression of "intermediary" would definitely fall
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 111
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
within the parameters of "reporting entity" as defined under Section 2(wa) of the PML Act and as
such the contention raised by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner cannot be
accepted and it is liable to be rejected and accordingly, it stands rejected.
126. A feeble attempt has been made in W.P.No.24444/2015 and few other connected matters that
adjudication by single member of the adjudicating authority is bad in law by referring to Section
6(2) of PML Act. Said contention would not stand to rhyme or reason for the simple reason that
answer lies in Section 6(5) (a) &
(b), whereunder it is clearly indicated that jurisdiction of the adjudicating authority may be
exercised by benches thereof; and, a bench can be constituted by the Chairperson of the adjudicating
authority with one or two members, as the Chairperson may deem fit. Hence, this court is of the
considered view that constitution of a bench hearing the original complaint or its adjudication
thereof consisting of one member cannot be found fault with. It can be further noticed that under
sub-section (13) of Section 6, if the vacancy arises in the office of the Chairperson by reason of death,
resignation or otherwise, the senior most member would act as the Chairperson and such
Chairperson would exercise the power as provided under Section 6 of the PML Act.
127. For the reasons indicated herein above, this Court is of the considered view that contentions
raised by the petitioners challenging the action of the respondents in initiating the proceedings
under the PML Act cannot be accepted and same stands rejected.
RE: W.P.NO.27705/2018:
128. In this writ petition, the order dated 16.12.2016 Annexure-AA passed by respondent No.3 is
under challenge, whereunder respondent No.3 has confirmed the attachment of the property i.e.,
immovable property at Serial No.1 at Table No.1 of the Provisional Order of Attachment dated
30.06.2016.
129. A bare reading of the Provisional Order of Attachment dated 30.06.2016 would disclose that
under Schedule-A, movable property was sought to be attached and in the words of authority
passing the Provisional Order of Attachment, it would clearly disclose that what was sought to be
attached was "Amount of Rs.1,21,50,000/- paid as advance by Mr. Dyani Antony Paul (petitioner) to
M/s. Prime Housing Development Company, Mangalore for proposed purchase of three flats
(bearing No.114, G09 &
313) at Divya Deepa Residency, Shivbagh, Kadri, Mangalore." It is not in dispute that these three
flats had never been attached and as such question of confirming attachment of immovable property
namely three flats would not arise.
130. The language as found in Section 8(1) when read along with Section 8(3), would clearly disclose
that the adjudicating authority would adjudicate the claim relating to the "property attached" under
sub-section (1) of Section 5 or seized or frozen under Section 17 or Section 18. Expression "such
property" refers to the property which has been attached under Section 5(1) of the Act. Until and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189681311/ 112
Mr Dyani Antony Paul vs Union Of India on 11 December, 2020
unless the property has been attached under Section 5(1), question of confirming the attachment of
the property made under sub-section (1) of Section 5 would not arise. In other words, for confirming
the attachment, the property requires to be attached under Section 5(1) as otherwise, the
adjudicating authority under Section 8 would not get jurisdiction to adjudicate such attachment.
131. In the instant case, as noticed hereinabove, it would clearly disclose what was sought to be
attached under Provisional Order of Attachment dated 30.06.2016 (Annexure-V) was the movable
property namely a sum of Rs.1,21,50,000/- paid by the writ petitioner to M/s Prime Housing
Development Company, Mangalore and not flats bearing Nos.114, G09 & 313 at Divya Deepa
Residency, Shivbagh, Kadri, Mangalore which is purported to have been confirmed. In that view of
the matter, confirming the order of attachment of immovable property referred to in Serial No.1 of
the Provisional Order of Attachment at Schedule-A did not arise. In other words, order of
confirmation was an order without jurisdiction. Hence, same is liable to be set aside and
accordingly, order of confirmation dated 16.12.2016 (Annexure-AA) passed by third respondent is
quashed. However, it requires to be clarified that quashing of confirmation order does not prevent
the respondent authorities from proceeding in accordance with law, if they so desire and all
contentions of both parties are kept open.
For the reasons aforestated, I proceed to pass the following:
ORDER
(i) W.P.Nos. 38642/2016 C/W 15917/2013, 15918/2013, 39889/2014, 17894/2015,

48031/2017, 24480/2018, 27744/2018, 28027/2018, 35991/2018 are dismissed.
(ii) W.P.No.27705/2018 is allowed. The order of confirmation dated 16.12.2016
(Annexure-AA) is quashed. Respondents are at liberty to proceed against petitioners
in accordance with law, as observed herein above.
(iii) No order as to costs.
