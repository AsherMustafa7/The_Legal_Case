ORDER
The petitioner has come forward with this Writ Petition, seeking a direction to the first respondent
to make necessary amendment in the petitioner's date of birth as 23.09.1963 instead of 06.06.1960
in the petitioner's SSLC Marks Statement bearing No.A000198, dated 18.05.1976 and Transfer
Certificate (T.C.) of the third respondent School on the basis of the petitioner's Birth Certificate
dated 26.09.1963 issued by the fourth respondent by considering the petitioner's representation
dated 08.10.2020 within the time stipulated by this Court.
2.By consent of both parties, this Writ Petition is taken up for final disposal at the stage of
admission itself.
3.Ms.Lakshmi Prasanna, learned Government Advocate accepts notice on behalf of the respondents
1 to 3. Since no http://www.judis.nic.in adverse order is going to be passed against the 4th
respondent, notice to the 4th respondent is dispensed with.
4.According to the petitioner, at the time of his admission in the Primary School, his parents had
inadvertently given his date of birth as 06.06.1960. After completion of 5th standard, he joined in
the third respondent School and his Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) bearing
No.A000198 issued by the first respondent on 18.05.1976 and Transfer Certificate carry his date of
birth as 06.06.1960. Later, he came to know that his original date of birth is 23.09.1963 and his
birth was duly registered with the fourth respondent Corporation on 26.09.1963. Therefore, he
applied for Birth Certificate. Thereafter, he has sent a representation dated 08.10.2020 to effect the
actual date of birth as 23.09.1963 instead of 06.06.1960 in his SSLC and Transfer Certificate to the
respondents 1 to 3. Since no effective steps have been taken in this regard,the petitioner has
approached this Court, seeking aforesaid prayer.
5.This Court is of the considered view that now the petitioner has crossed 60 years based on his date
of birth, namely, 06.06.1960. Now, after several decades, he wants to change his date of birth as
23.09.1963. According to the petitioner, school http://www.judis.nic.in record shows his date of
birth as 06.06.1960, whereas Birth Certificate issued by the fourth respondent Corporation shows as
23.09.1963. Now a days almost all persons have two date of births and the request of alteration of
date of birth after joining government service is mushrooming on the very safe ground that the
parents had furnished the wrong date of birth at the time of school admission during childhood.

Though there is no much harm in having two date of births the actual date of birth must be disclosed
at least for marriage purposes so as to avoid difference of opinion /suppression of facts to the better
half in future.
6. The Date of birth entered in corporation record or municipality etc., may be correct. But the date
of birth given to the school alone has to be taken into account for schooling, employment etc. If the
alteration of date of birth is considered suitably based on the records found in
Corporation/Municipality and later if it is found that upon consideration the person seeking such
alteration was not eligible to be admitted in the School, entire qualification would become invalid
and appointment secured on the basis of the said qualification would be non est in the eye of law
and he /she can be removed from service without giving any terminal benefits.

7. In this case, the petitioner who is 60 years old seeks for correction of his date of birth for the
reasons best known to him, without disclosing the fact as to what for such correction is required at
this distraught point of time. Of course, such plea cannot be entertained at the stage and if it is
allowed, then everybody will knock the doors of this Court with similar request in one way of the
other after several decades.
8. Hence, finding no merits in the petition, the writ petition is dismissed. No costs.
