proceedings on behalf of the Tamilnadu Housing Board to acquire 212 acres of land including the

08.01.1993 and 11.01.1993 respectively. The subject land has been sub divided as survey No.929/1A
to an extent of 1.08.0 hectare and survey No.979/1B to an extent of 0.08.0 hectare owned originally

as contemplated under Section 30 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in LAOP.No.630 of 1996 on the
file of the Sub Court, Hosur.
4. The grounds raised by the petitioner in this Writ Petition have already been settled by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the judgment reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129 in the case of Indore
Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors etc., which held as follows :-
“366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue
as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 1894 as if it has not been repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of authorities for
five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has
not been taken nor compensation has been paid.
In other words, in case possession has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no
lapse. Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no
lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not include a
deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in proviso to Section
24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of land holdings then all

D.Ganesan vs State Rep. By Its Secretary on 13 December, 2021
beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the
Act of 1894 shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.
In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis has not been fulfilled, interest under Section 34 of the said Act can
be granted. Non-deposit of compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land acquisition
proceedings. In case of non- deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five years or more,
compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date of notification
for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the Act
of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to
non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by
tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or
who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had
lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not part of
Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Act of 1894 and as
contemplated under Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has
been passed on taking possession under Section 16 of the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is
no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken
there is no lapse under Section 24(2).
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case
authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years
or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with
concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has
to be excluded in the computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of
concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of
enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive stale and time- barred claims and
does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or
mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.”
5. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India settled all proposition of law in the above judgment
including the grounds raised by the petitioner.
That apart, the acquisition proceedings have been completed and the subject land was taken over by
the government and the same was handed over to the requisition body. Further the requisition body
also deposited the compensation as awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer. Therefore, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26642443/ 4
D.Ganesan vs State Rep. By Its Secretary on 13 December, 2021
petitioner failed to satisfy the twin requirements under Section 24 (2) of the New Act, i.e., the
physical possession of the land was not taken and the compensation has not been
paid/tendered/deposited in accordance with law.
In view of the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the issues raised by the
petitioner were settled and therefore, the acquisition proceedings have not been lapsed by operation
of law under Section 24 (2) of the new Act i.e., Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. In view of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis settled position of law, the writ petition is devoid of merits and
liable to be dismissed.
6. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is
closed. No order as to costs.
