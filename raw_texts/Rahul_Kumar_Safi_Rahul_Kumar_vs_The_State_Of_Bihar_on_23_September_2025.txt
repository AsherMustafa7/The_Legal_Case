Rahul Kumar Safi @Rahul Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 23 September, 2025
Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, whereby and whereunder the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-1st cum Special Judge (SC/ST), Madhubani has not taken cognizance
against the respondents for the offence under sections 147, 341, 323, 427, 379, 504/34 of the Indian
Penal Code and Section 3(i)(r), 3 (i) (G), 3 (2) (va) of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
3. As per the prosecution case, As per prosecution case, the complainant (appellant) was working in
the shop of one Ikwal Ansari and the said shop is situated near Jaihind Cinema Chowk and the shop
of respondent no.2/Arun Chandra Panjiyar is situated in front of his shop. One customer went to the
shop of respondent no.2 and returned back and took articles from the shop of Md. Ikwal Ansari.
After half an hour, the respondents armed with deadly weapons came at the shop of Md. Ikwal
Ansari and abused with offensive language and when the same was protested by the owner of the
appellant the respondents brutally assaulted Md. Ikwal Ansari by various weapons. They also looted
away the articles from the shop and destroyed the materials kept in the said shop. Respondent no.2
looted Rs.8,000/- from the cash bag of Md. Ikwal Anshari. It is further alleged that when the
appellant came to rescue Md. Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1607 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 Ikwal
Ansari, the respondents assaulted him with lathi and danda in the presence of several persons.
Respondents abused the appellant by his caste name. It is further alleged that respondent nos. 2 and
4 spat on the mouth of appellant. The appellant sustained injury and was treated by the doctor. It is
further alleged that respondents gave threatening to the appellant to send jail very soon.
4. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that there is specific allegation against the respondents
regarding assault, abuse by caste name and spitting on the mouth of the appellant. It is submitted
that the trial court has not taken in consideration any specific materials which were stated by the
enquiry witness during course of enquiry. It is submitted that the trial court has not applied its
judicial mind and has dismissed the complaint petition without taking into account the material
available on record. It is submitted that the present appellant is aggrieved by the order dated
20.01.2024 passed by the trial court as there was sufficient material to take cognizance.
5. Learned counsel for the respondent nos. 2 to 7 as well as learned Special P.P. for the State submits
that the trial court has given ample opportunity to produce the enquiry witness and complainant
was also examined on S.A. He further Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1607 of 2024
dt.23-09-2025 submits that the learned trial court has made query to complainant upon which the
complainant replied that he has no knowledge whether the treatment was meted out to the injured
or not. On the said count, credibility of statement of complainant is on question mark. It is
submitted that other witnesses have stated that dispute has taken place between the parties
regarding the customer. It is submitted that while dismissing the complaint petition, the concerned
court has recorded the finding that the occurrence took place at the shop of Ikwal Ansari but he has
neither filed complaint petition nor gave his evidence rather he used his employee as a complainant
to file complaint against the accused persons. In this way, the learned trial court has given reason
that provision of SC/ST Act has been misused by the complaint in the light of given facts and
circumstances of the present case and finally the concerned court has recorded that, prima facie, no
case is made out against Respondent Nos. 2 to 7 in the light of the present facts and circumstances
of the case and, hence, the complaint petition has been dismissed under Section 203 of Cr.P.C.

6. From perusal of the order dated 20.01.2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-1st cum
Special Judge, Madhubani arising out of C.R. No. 35 of 2023, it appears Patna High Court CR. APP
(SJ) No.1607 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 that the learned trial court has well explained the reasons for
which the complaint petition has been dismissed. The court has recorded the finding that the
appellant, who has filed the complaint, is an employee of the shop of Md. Ikwal Ansari and belongs
to a particular community and he has no knowledge whether the injured was treated or not and
other witnesses stated that dispute arose on the issue of customer. The trial court has recorded that
the occurrence took place at the shop of Md. Ikwal Ansari and he has not given any evidence and he
has not filed any complaint petition rather he used the employee who belongs to a particular
community for misusing the provisions of SC/ST Act.
7. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it is very much relevant that the trial court
has given ample opportunity to the appellant to produce enquiry witnesses in support of complaint
petition and the trial court has recorded the finding that prima facie no case is made out against
Respondent Nos. 2 to 7 after discussing all the enquiry witnesses. Furthermore, the contentions
raised by the learned counsel appearing for Respondent Nos. 2 to 7 and learned Special P.P. are
quite tenable and sustainable in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case. The order
passed by the learned trial Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1607 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 court is
justified and legal.
8. In the light of the discussions made above, I find no reason to differ from the finding recorded by
the learned trial court while passing the impugned order dated 20.01.2024.
9. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed at the stage of admission itself.
