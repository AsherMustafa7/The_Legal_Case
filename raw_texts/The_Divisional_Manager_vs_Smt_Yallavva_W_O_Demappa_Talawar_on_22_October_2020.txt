3. Aggrieved by the judgment and award passed in MVC No.236/2016 by the Senior Civil Judge and
Addl.M.A.C.T., Saundatti, at Saundatti, (for short "the tribunal") dated 16.03.2017, the Insurance

road, a Tractor and Trailer bearing Reg.No.MH-44/D-2482 and MH-09- K-9397 were parked in a
dangerous manner loaded with Sugarcane crop. The same was parked without light or signal
cautioning the approaching vehicles. As it was night, the deceased dashed against the same, which

6. The petitioners are the mother and sister of the deceased. The deceased was a bachelor.
Respondent No.1 is the owner of the Tractor and Trailer. Respondent No.2 is the insurance company
with which the Tractor and Trailer have been insured.
7. On the ground that the accident occurred due to negligent parking of Tractor and Trailer in the
middle of the road, the petitioners preferred MVC No.236/2016 against the respondents.
8. After service of summons, respondent No.1 did not appear before the Tribunal. Respondent No.2
appeared through its counsel and filed its written statement denying the liability.
9. After completion of the pleadings, the Tribunal framed issues and recorded the evidence. The
petitioners examined two witnesses and got marked documents at Exs.P.1 to P.10. Respondent No.2
examined one witness and got marked one document as Ex.R.1.
10. The Tribunal based on the evidence came to the conclusion that the accident was caused due to
rash and negligent parking of the Trailer bearing Reg.No.MH-44/D-2482 and MH-09-K-9397 and
as the Tractor and Trailer were duly insured with respondent No.2 - Insurance Company, has
awarded a compensation of Rs.30,35,144/- in favour of the petitioners to be paid by respondent
No.2. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Tribunal, the respondent No.2 - insurance company is in
appeal.
11. The grounds of appeal urged by the appellant -
Insurance Company are that the deceased went and dashed against the parked Tractor and Trailer
and thereby, he is guilty of contributory negligence. It is further contended that the Tribunal took
income of the deceased at Rs.20,000/- per month when no proof of income was produced and same
is on the higher side. It is further stated that the deceased was a bachelor and 50% of the income
arrived at ought to have been deducted towards personal expenses but the Tribunal has deducted it
at 1/3rd of the income.
12. Learned counsel for the petitioner No.1 has appeared and contends that the order of the Tribunal
is justified and has sought for dismissal of the appeal.
13. It is noticed that the Tribunal has analyzed all the documents including Complaint, FIR,
Panchanama, Hand Sketch map and the inquest panchanama placed before it and has duly
considered evidence let in. It has correctly noticed that the accident happened during night and the
parking of the Tractor and Trailer without any indication in the middle of the road was an act of
negligence and the sketch also indicates that the place of accident has tyre marks of the motor cycle
which indicate that the deceased has applied brakes and tried to avoid the accident but could not.
Thus, it has to be held that the accident happened due to the negligent parking of the Tractor and
Trailer in the middle of the road without giving any indication.
14. However, it is seen that the Tribunal has taken the income of the deceased at Rs.20,000/- per
month even when there was no documentary proof adduced as to his income. Under the said

The Divisional Manager, vs Smt. Yallavva W/O. Demappa Talawar, on 22 October, 2020
circumstances, the Tribunal ought to have taken the income as fixed by the Karnataka State Legal
Services Authority as the income of the deceased. The accident happened in the year 2012. The
notional income fixed for the said year is Rs.6,500/- per month. The deceased was aged about 25
years at the time of the accident and was a Bachelor and the multiplier applicable would be "18". As
per the law laid down in National Insurance Company vs. Pranay Sethi and others, reported in AIR
2017 SC 5157, 40% of the total income has to be added to his future prospects. Hence, the total
income of the deceased comes to Rs.9,100/- (Rs.6,500 x 40%). Out of the said total income, 50% of
the income has to be deducted towards personal expenses. Thus, total income of the deceased comes
to Rs.4,550/-. Hence, the compensation awarded towards 'Loss of dependency' comes to
Rs.9,82,800/- (4,550 x 12 x
18).
15. As per the law laid down in Magma General Insurance Company Limited vs. Nanu Ram reported
in 2018 SCC 1546, the petitioners are mother and sister of the deceased and both of them are
entitled to 40,000/- each towards loss of love and affection. Further they are entitled for a sum of
Rs.30,000/- towards funeral expenses. Thus, in all petitioners are entitled to a compensation of
Rs.10,92,800/-.
16. The judgment of the Tribunal is accordingly modified.
The apportionment of the compensation in terms of percentage is as determined by the Tribunal.
Any amount deposited by the Insurance Company herein shall be transmitted to the Tribunal for
disbursement. Office to draw the decree accordingly. No order as to costs.
