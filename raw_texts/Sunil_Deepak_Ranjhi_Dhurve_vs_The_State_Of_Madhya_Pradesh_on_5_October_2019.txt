2. The facts, in brief, giving rise to this appeal are that on 5.8.2012 the complainant Metram (PW-4),
father of the prosecutrix (PW-6) lodged a missing person report about her minor daughter from
14.7.2012 in the police station Aathner, District Betul. During enquiry of missing person, on
18.9.2012 the prosecutrix was recovered from the house of the appellant / accused situated at
Gautampura, Bhopal and statement of the prosecutrix (PW-6) was recorded in which she stated that
on 14.7.2012 she was standing on the road for going to Hidli for studying in Class 10 th, at that time,
the appellant / accused came over on the motorcycle which was taken from one Sumat Kumar for a
short pe- riod and told the prosecutrix that he is going to Aathner and he will drop the prosecutrix at
Hidli and he forcibly took her on her motorcycle and did not leave her at Hidli and took her to
Aathner and then Bhopal on the motorcycle and kept her in his house situated at Gautampura,
Bhopal and committed sexual intercourse with her several times with- out her consent and also
committed marpeet and the motorcycle was also not returned. Thereafter, FIR (Ex.P/9) at crime no.
184/12 under Sections 363, 366, 376 and 406 of the IPC was registered against the ap- pellant /
accused. After investigation was over, charge sheet was filed before the concerned Magistrate who
on its turn committed the case to the Court of Session for trial and the appellant was tried for the
offence under Sections 363, 366, 376 (1) and 406 of the IPC by First Additional Sessions Judge,
Betul. The defence of the appellant was that he is inno- cent. He has been falsely implicated in the
case. In defence he has not produced any witness. After trial, learned trial Court acquitted the ap-
pellant / accused of the charge under Section 363 of the IPC but con- victed and sentenced the
appellant as mentioned above. Hence, this appeal.
3. Learned counsel appointed on behalf of the Legal Aid has con- tended that looking to the evidence
available on record against the ap- pellant and period of custody of the appellant, he does not want
to challenge the finding of conviction recorded by the trial court and his only prayer is that the
appellant has completed more than 7 years in the imprisonment as he is in jail since 19.9.2012. The
incident took place on 14.7.2012 and at that time, the offence under Section 376 (1) of the IPC was
not punishable with minimum imprisonment of 10 years, therefore, in such circumstances, the
sentence may be reduced to the minimum period of 7 years prescribed for the offence under Section
376 of the IPC and the appellant has completed the aforesaid period, hence, the appellant be
released forth with.
4. Learned GA appearing for the State has contended that the ap- pellant / accused has committed
sexual intercourse forcibly with the prosecutrix without her consent or will. Hence, his conviction is
based on legal evidence and finding of the conviction is not impeachable. So far as the sentence part
is concerned, looking to the facts and circum- stances of the case exercising discretionary powers the
Court may pass appropriate orders and the sentence may be reduced proportionately.
5. Having considered the aforesaid contentions of learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of
the record, from the statement of the prosecutrix (PW-6) it is found proved that she was forcibly
abducted and thereafter forcible sexual intercourse was committed with her by the appellant
without her consent or will. Her statement is also sup- ported by her father Metram (PW-4) and also
by medical evidence of Dr. Lipi Padmakar (PW-10). Hence, the finding with regard to conviction un-
der Sections 366, 376 (1) and 406 of the IPC is hereby affirmed.

6. So far as the sentence part is concerned, from the facts and cir- cumstances of the case, in view of
this court, the ends of justice will be met by punishing the accused with minimum sentence of 7
years pre- scribed under Section 376 of the IPC as this is not a case which requires 10 years rigorous
imprisonment.
7. Consequently, the criminal appeal is partly allowed. The convic- tion of the appellant recorded by
the trial Court under Sections 366, 376 (1) and 406 of the IPC is hereby affirmed and the sentences
awarded un- der Sections 366 and 406 of the IPC are also affirmed. However, so far as the jail
sentence awarded under Section 376 (1) of the IPC is con -
cerned, it is reduced and modified to 7 years RI with fine of Rs.5000/-, in default further additional
5 months RI. Both the sentences shall run con- currently.
8. As the appellant has undergone the above period being in jail since 19.9.2012, if the appellant is
not required in any other case, he be released forth with subject to payment of fine amount.
9. A copy of this judgment be sent to the trial court with record and the jail authority for necessary
action.
CC as per rules.
