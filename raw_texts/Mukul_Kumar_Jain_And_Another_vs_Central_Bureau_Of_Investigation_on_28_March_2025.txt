bearing No.28882/2024, filed by the applicant-petitioners seeking urgent interim
relief, is pending before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. Since the matter

pendency of the instant application and further stay all the proceedings arising out of
the instant FIR dated 11.03.2022 till the final disposal of the instant application."
7. The facts of the case are that a First Information Report was lodged on 11.3.2022 as F.I.R. No.
RC0072022A0001 of 2022, Police Station ACB Dehradun, District Dehradun, under Sections 120B
r/w sections 420, 467, 468, 471 I.P.C., Sections 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of Prevention of Corruption Act,
1988, by Mr. Asheesh Agarwal, Branch Manager, Bank of India, Meerut Branch, Anand Bhawan,
Kothi No. 346, Khair Nagar, Meerut, U.P. against Mukul Jain, Mrs. Priyanka Jain, M/s Mahaveer
Fording Pvt. Ltd. Meerut , M/s Ashray Enterprises (Guarantor) through its Proprietor Smt. Priyanka
Jain and unknown public servant(s) & private person(s) with the allegations that M/s Mahaveer
Forging Pvt. Ltd., Meerut was availing credit facilities to the tune of Rs.742.00 Lacs from Syndicate
Bank, Defense Colony Branch, Meerut. The said loans were taken over by the Bank of India, Meerut
Branch on 17.3.2011 with enhanced credit facilities Term Loan (T.L.) of Rs.3 Crore and Cash Credit
(CC) limit of Rs. 13 Crore. Thus on 17.03.2011, the total credit facility amounting to Rs. 1732.17 Lakh
were sanctioned by Bank of India to M/s Mahaveer Forgings Pvt. Ltd. The borrower company has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110650356/ 6
Mukul Kumar Jain And Another vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 March, 2025
created Equitable mortgage of eight properties. As per the terms and conditions, borrower company
was required to change the land use of Agricultural land to Non-agricultural land within 30 days
period after first disbursement. The accused borrower in respect of three properties situated at
Village Bhuwa, Pargana Hastinapur, Tehsil Mawana submitted three fake and forged orders under
Section 143 of Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform Act with the bank related to
change of land use. Further Mukul Jain and Smt. Priyanka Jain had consented for cancellation of
sale deed related to the mortgaged property situated at Village Kashi Pargana & District Meerut
comprising of two sale deeds number 2872 and number 2874, without any permission and
intimation to the bank. Accordingly the court concerned at Meerut cancelled the sale deeds vide
order 11.02.2015 which resulted in the bank being deprived of its security. The Directors of the
company removed the plant and machinery which were hypothecated/charged to the bank without
informing the bank and thereby deprived the bank of the security. It is further alleged that Foreign
Bills of Rs.250 lacs purchased by the Bank remained unpaid. The company could not advise the
status of overseas consignment sent by it. The Foreign Bills submitted by the company turned out to
be fake and no amount could be recovered by the bank. The account of the company thus turned
into NPA on 15.09.2014 causing wrongful loss to the tune of Rs. 21,10,49,257.12 and declared fraud
on 25.06.2020.
8. Subsequent to lodging of the F.I.R. the matter was investigated by the respondent/C.B.I. and a
charge sheet no. 05 of 2023 dated 30.12.2023 was submitted with the following details:-

9. On the said charge sheet the court of Special Judicial Magistrate (CBI), Ghaziabad vide order
dated 03.01.2024 directed the matter to be listed for arguments for cognizance. Subsequently vide
order dated 01.03.2024 the court of Special Judicial Magistrate (CBI), Ghaziabad took cognizance
upon the said charge sheet and summoned the accused persons.
10. It appears from the records that Anticipatory Bail Applications were filed by the applicants and
the same were deferred by Special Judicial Magistrate (CBI), Ghaziabad vide order dated 14.3.2024
on certain defects in the said anticipatory bail applications. Aggrieved by the said orders dated
14.3.2024 an Application U/S 482 No. 11034 of 2024 (Mukul Jain and another vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation) was filed before this Court which was disposed of vide order dated 06.8.2024 passed
by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court keeping it open for the applicants to raise their objections
before the court concerned on the date fixed regarding jurisdiction to decide the anticipatory bail
application filed by the applicants and the court concerned was directed that before deciding the
application for anticipatory bail filed by the applicants on merits, it shall first answer this question
and then proceed with the matter. The order passed therein is extracted herein below:-
"Heard Mr. Manish Gupta, Advocate along with Mr. Shiv Sagar Singh, the learned
counsel for applicants and Mr. Gyan Prakash Srivastava, the learned Deputy Solicitor
General of India assisted by Mr. Sanjay Kumar Yadav, the learned counsel
representing C.B.I. This application under Section 482 CrPC has been filed
challenging the order dated 14.03.2024, passed by Special Judge, C.B.I. Court,
Ghaziabad in Anticipatory Bail Application nos.1918 of 2024 and 1919 of 2024,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110650356/ 8
Mukul Kumar Jain And Another vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 March, 2025
whereby court below has deferred the hearing of anticipatory bail applications filed
by applicants on the ground that there are certain defects in the applications for
anticipatory bail filed by applicants.
Learned counsel for applicants contends that though first information report which
was lodged against applicants was also under the Prevention of Corruption Act but,
subsequently, C.B.I. has submitted the police report dated 30.12.2023 in terms of
Section 173 (2) CrPC (charge-sheet), but the applicants have not been charge-sheeted
under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
It is further contended by the learned counsel for applicants that during the pendency
of anticipatory bail application filed by applicants, non-bailable warrants have been
issued against applicants.
However, the Court finds from the record that subsequently, court below has passed
an order dated 14.03.2024 whereby it has been observed that though applicants were
repeatedly given opportunity to remove the defect but it appears that they
intentionally delaying the proceedings therefore it directed that one last opportunity
is granted to the applicants to remove the defects and further submit affidavit
regarding their whereabouts before court concerned. The above order dated
14.03.2024 has not been challenged in this application under Section 482 CrPC by
moving an amendment application.
Considering the above and also the law laid down by the Apex Court in Srikant
Upadhyay And Others Vs. State of Bihar And Another, 2024 SCC OnLine 282, no
interim protection can be provided by this Court in favour of applicants, as
non-bailable warrants have been issued against applicants by court below.
Considering the facts as noted herein-above, it is hereby directed that court below
shall decide the application for anticipatory bail filed by applicants bearing nos.1918
of 2024 and 1919 of 2024 on the next date fixed in aforementioned applications for
anticipatory bail. The anxiety expressed by the learned counsel for applicants is that
the court hearing the application for anticipatory bail of applicants does not have
jurisdiction to decide the anticipatory bail. Admittedly, the application for
anticipatory bail was filed by applicants before the Sessions Judge, which has been
transferred by the Sessions Judge to the Special Judge, C.B.I. Court. It is well settled
that the Sessions Judge cannot try the jurisdiction of Special Judge, C.B.I. Court.
However, it shall be open to the applicants to raise their objection before court below
on the date fixed in the matter regarding the jurisdiction to decide the anticipatory
bail application of applicants and the court below is directed that before deciding the
application for anticipatory bail filed by applicants on merits shall first answer this
question and then proceed with the matter.

Mukul Kumar Jain And Another vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 March, 2025
With the aforesaid direction/observation, this application stands disposed off
finally."
11. The Anticipatory Bail Application of the applicant no. 2/Priyanka Jain numbered as Anticipatory
Bail Application No.690 of 2024, Registration No. 1919 of 2024, stood rejected by the court of
In-charge, Special Judge (Anti-Corruption), C.B.I., Ghaziabad vide order dated 16.8.2024 on the
ground that despite granting time to the accused Priyanka Jain to file her own affidavit in the same,
no such affidavit has been filed and thus disposal of the said anticipatory bail application is not
possible. The Supplementary Affidavit dated 22.10.2024 has been filed on behalf of the applicants
bringing on records the order dated 16.8.2024 passed in the said Anticipatory Bail Application
No.690 of 2024, Registration No. 1919 of 2024, Priyanka Jain vs. C.B.I. Although the perusal of the
order dated 06.8.2024 passed in the 482 Cr.P.C. petition filed on behalf of the accused Mukul Jain
and Smt. Priyanka Jain is concerned, the same goes to show that two Anticipatory Bail Applications
numbered as Anticipatory Bail Application No. 1918 of 2024 and 1919 of 2024 were the subject
matter therein, but the records of the present case and the documents as placed during arguments
do not show the fate of the anticipatory bail application of the applicant no. 1/Mukul Kumar Jain as
there is nothing on record to show as to what happened in the same.
12. At this point it would be relevant once again to reiterate the fact that Criminal Misc. Application
U/S 482 No. 11034 of 2024 (Mukul Jain and another vs. C.B.I.) was filed on behalf of both the
applicants challenging the order dated 14.03.2024 passed in the said two anticipatory bail
applications but the fate of the anticipatory bail application filed on behalf of the applicant no.
1/Mukul Kumar Jain is not disclosed. Further a 3rd Supplementary Affidavit dated 03.1.2025 has
been filed on behalf of the applicants, perusal of which particularly its paragraph nos. 2, 3 and 4
would go to show that Red Corner Notice was initiated against the applicant by the Indian
Authorities in furtherance to the non bailable warrants and a Blue Notice was issued for the present
offence in pursuance of which the applicant was detained by the authorities in Dubai on 02.1.2025
and was taken into custody for a period of 15 days. Further para-4 of the same goes to show that
request for extradition of the applicant in India has also been made by the Government. Even at this
point of time, it is relevant to state that the said affidavit is vague inasmuch as it states that it has
been filed on behalf of the applicants and the applicants in the present application u/s 482 Cr.P.C.
are two accused being Mukul Kumar Jain and Smt. Priyaka Jain but paragraph nos. 2, 3 and 4 did
not, in any manner in specific terms, clarify as to which of the applicant was detained and taken into
custody. The same only refers to the accused as "the applicant". Annexure No. SA-1 annexed to the
same was perused from which it then transpires that the applicant no. 1 Mukul Kumar Jain was
detained. Paragraph nos. 2, 3 and 4 are extracted herein below:-
"2. That during the pendency of the instant application u/s 482 CrPC which was
preferred primarily on the ground that the Ld. Trial Court has exceeded its
jurisdiction in trying the matter at hand having no offence made out under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the Applicant was detained by the authorities in
Dubai on 17.12.2024 and was taken into custody on 19.12.2024 for a period of 15
days.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110650356/ 10
Mukul Kumar Jain And Another vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 March, 2025
3. That the primary reason cited by the authorities in Dubai for detention and further
custody is the requirement of the Applicant by the Indian authorities under a Red
Corner Notice initiated further to the NBW and the Blue Notice issued for the offence
under consideration in the instant Application u/s Section 482 CrPC. Copy of the
detention and custody notice/proceedings are annexed herewith and marked as
Annexure SA-1 to the third Supplementary Affidavit.
4. That the Applicant has not committed any crime in Dubai and the detention in
Dubai is only on the ground of the Red Corner Notice issued on the recommendation
of the Respondent CBI for seeking the extradition of the Applicant in India."
13. Further Annexure No. SA-2 of the said supplementary affidavit goes to show that the same is a
judgement and order dated 06.11.2024 passed by the A.S.J./Special Judge, Special Court,
Anti-Corruption, CBI, Court No. 3, Ghaziabad in Criminal Revision No. 217 of 2024, Mukul Kumar
Jain and another vs. CBI, which was preferred against the order dated 01.3.2024 passed by the court
of Special Magistrate, CBI, Ghaziabad in Criminal Case No. 06 of 2024, C.B.I. vs. Mukul Jain and
others, which was decided and the said revision stood dismissed. A perusal of the said judgement
and order goes to show that in its paragraph no. 2 that learned counsel for the C.B.I. was heard and
the entire records including the precedents/circulars supplied by the parties were considered. It
further shows that no one appeared on behalf of the revisionist despite several opportunities. The
court then proceeded to decide the revision on its merits on the basis of material available before it.
The present application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has thus been filed by the applicants before this
Court with the aforesaid prayers.
14. At the very outset, learned counsel for the C.B.I. while placing paragraph nos. 7, 8 and 9 of the
supplementary counter affidavit dated 26.2.2025 has submitted that the present application u/s 482

Mukul Kumar Jain And Another vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 March, 2025
16. Learned counsels for the applicants submitted that submission of charge sheet in the present
matter is not being challenged but the only challenge is of jurisdiction in the matter and not on
merits. He submits that their submissions are not at all touching the merits of the matter but only
on the ground of jurisdiction.
17. Learned counsels for the applicants submitted as under:-
(1) The First Information Report is beyond jurisdiction as the same was lodged at
Dehradun whereas the matter pertains to District Meerut.
(2) The present F.I.R. is the second F.I.R. as an application for lodging of F.I.R. was
initially moved which was returned and then the present application was given which
was registered.
(3) Cognizance and issuance of non-bailable warrants are beyond territorial
jurisdiction.
(4) The order dated 06.8.2024 passed in Application U/S 482 No.11034 of 2024 by
this Court has not been complied with by the Special Judge and an order dated
16.8.2024 has been passed.
(5) The judgement and order of the Additional Sessions Judge concerned dated
06.11.2024 dismissing the said revision is against the jurisdiction of the court.
(6) The present petition be allowed and prayers as prayed for by the applicants be
granted.
18. Learned counsel for the C.B.I. submitted as under:-
(1) The prayer in the present petition is vague inasmuch as there is a challenge to the
cognizance order and all the proceedings but the charge sheet is not being challenged
and the only challenge of the order of cognizance on the basis of jurisdiction at this
stage cannot be looked into.
(2) Even the judgement of the revisional court dated 06.11.2024 challenging the
order dated 01.03.2024 which is also challenged herein is not under challenge.
(3) The order of cognizance merges with the judgement and order of the revisional
court and thus the present petition u/s 482 Cr.P.C. is not maintainable.
(4) The present petition be dismissed.
19. After having heard learned counsels for the parties and perusing the records and looking to the
facts of the matter as stated above, at the very outset, it is clear that the challenge in the present
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110650356/ 13
Mukul Kumar Jain And Another vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 March, 2025
matter has been argued to be not on merits of the matter subsequent to filing of charge-sheet,
cognizance and summoning on it but only on the ground of competence of the court concerned on
the ground of jurisdiction. The arguments that the present F.I.R. is a second F.I.R. is fallacious
inasmuch no previous F.I.R. on the present issue and subject matter has been lodged. The present
F.I.R. is the first report on the issue and the matter. Further in so far as the jurisdiction of the
revisional court is concerned, at the very inception it would be relevant to point out that the order
taking cognizance dated 01.3.2024 which is also impugned herein, was under challenge therein and
the said revision was dismissed. The said dismissal was on merits and the judgement and order
passed therein clearly mentions in it that despite repeated opportunities no one appeared on behalf
of the revisionist and then the court proceeded to examine the matter on merits and passed the
judgement and order therein. The court was seized with the said revision and it has decided the
same on its merit as despite several opportunities no one appeared on behalf of the revisionist. The
same is in consonance with the settled principles of law. In so far as non-compliance of the order
dated 06.8.2024 passed in the said Application U/S 482 No.11034 of 2024 of the applicants is
concerned, there is nothing on record to show that as to what happened in the anticipatory bail
application of the applicant no. 1/Mukul Kumar Jain. The only disclosure is with regards to the
anticipatory bail application filed by the applicant no. 2/Priyanka Jain which can be culled out from
Annexure No. SA-1 as annexed in the said supplementary affidavit whereas in the paragraphs of the
same, the pleading is vague and it refers to the applicant although the said 482 Cr.P.C. petition was
filed by both the two applicants challenging the orders passed in their respective anticipatory bail
applications. Learned counsels for the applicants have categorically clarified that they do not
challenge the charge sheet on its merits but challenges the jurisdiction of the court concerned on the
ground of its jurisdiction. Charge sheet in the matter has been submitted against the applicants as
absconders. Paragraph-7 of the counter affidavit of the C.B.I. states that the applicants neither
joined the investigation nor co-operated in the investigation and further they have also not obeyed
the orders of the trial court concerned and then non bailable warrants have been issued against
them. There is no rebuttal to the same since learned counsel for the applicants had, on 27.2.2025,
submitted that they did not propose to file any rejoinder affidavit to the counter affidavit of the
C.B.I. The facts thus remains that the status of the applicants even during investigation was as
absconder and they did not co-operate in the investigation and even not joined the investigation.
After submission of charge-sheet and taking cognizance on it and summoning, they again failed to
abide by the orders of the court concerned and then non bailable warrants were issued against them.
It is not the case that the applicants were unaware of the present case and proceedings against them
but from records it appears that they were well aware of the case and proceedings against them and
even then they chose to abscond and not join the proceedings at any stage. Further it transpires
from the Supplementary Affidavit dated 03.1.2025 filed on behalf of the applicants and paragraphs
no. 7, 8 and 9 of the counter affidavit of the C.B.I. that the applicants are not even in the country and
are outside the country.
20. Law protects those who respect it and abide by it. A person flagrantly violating law cannot be
equated with a person following the process of law. A person avoiding the process of law cannot be
let to ventilate his grievance as per his choice for selective stages as per his sweet will. The settled
principle of law is that inherent powers are to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection and
cannot be exercised in a routine manner, much less for the convenience of the accused. This Court is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110650356/ 14
Mukul Kumar Jain And Another vs Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 28 March, 2025
cognizant of the scope of Section 482 Cr.P.C. and the various pronouncements on the issue of
inherent powers of a Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. In a given matter, like the present one, the
conduct of the accused-applicants would acquire importance and this Court finds that both the
accused-applicants never joined the investigation which concluded in filing of a charge sheet against
them as an absconder and again they are absconding from the trial court despite knowledge of the
proceedings and thus are not entitled to invoke the inherent powers of this Court for seeking
quashing of proceedings. They cannot short circuit the legal system and provision and thus gain
advantage.
21. In view of the said facts and total non cooperation of the applicants in the investigation,
vagueness of the pleadings, the conduct of the applicants in not joining the investigation and not
co-operating therein due to which charge sheet was submitted against them as absconders,
intentional efforts to avoid the courts orders as would appear from the order of the revisional court
and the fact that charge sheet is not being challenged on its merits coupled with the fact that the
order of taking cognizance dated 01.3.2024 being challenged in a revision which stood dismissed on
its merits, no ground for interference is called for.
22. The present Criminal Misc. Application U/S 482 Cr.P.C. is dismissed.
