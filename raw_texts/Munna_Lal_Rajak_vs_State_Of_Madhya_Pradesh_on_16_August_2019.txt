THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
WA.1326.2019
(Munna Lal Rajak, Vs. The State of M.P. & Ors.)
1
Gwalior, Dated:-16.08.2019
Shri Shivendra Singh Raghuvanshi, learned counsel for the
appellant.
Shri Pratip Visoriya, learned Government Advocate, for
respondent/State.
Additional documents filed vide IA.3902/2019 are taken on record.
Order dated 26.07.2019 passed in Writ Petition No.3842/2019 is taken exception of in this appeal
under Section 2(1) of Madhya Pradesh Uchcha Nayalaya (Khand Nyayapeeth Ko Appeal)
Adhiniyam, 2005.
Precise case of the petitioner before Writ Court was that although the petitioner was classified as a
Supervisor; however, the respondents have taken the work of "Ameen" for which the petitioner was
sent for training and fixed salary was given to the petitioner. On these facts, it was stated that the
petitioner, in fact, being a Class IV employee, therefore his age of superannuation is 62 years;
whereas, he is being retired on attaining the age of 60 years w.e.f. 01.04.2019 treating him to be
Class III employee.
Learned Single Judge, by impugned order, declined to cause any indulgence on the findings:
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH WA.1326.2019 (Munna Lal Rajak, Vs.
The State of M.P. & Ors.) "The only question for determination in the present petition
is that whether the petitioner was a Class-III employee or Class-IV employee.
It appears that on 04/10/2018 the petitioner had made a representation to the Chief
Engineer for retiring him on attaining the age of 62 years and in the said
representation, he had claimed himself to be a permanent skilled supervisor. Thus,

Munna Lal Rajak vs State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 August, 2019
the case of the petitioner himself is that he is a permanent skilled supervisor, which
according to the petitioner himself, is a Class -III post. If the petitioner was being
paid the fixed salary, then it is a separate cause of action and the status of the
petitioner cannot be adjudicated on the basis of salary which he was being paid but
the status of the petitioner has to be adjudicated on the basis of post which he is
holding. Undisputedly, the petitioner was a permanent Skilled Supervisor, which is a
Class III post.
One Ramjilal Prajapati had filed a writ petition claiming that his age of retirement is
62 years and the writ petition was dismissed by order dated 13/07/2016 against
which he had filed a Writ Appeal No.308/2016 and the same was allowed by order
dated 03/04/2017. However, the order passed in Writ Appeal No.308/2016 was
reviewed by this Court in Review Petition No.587/2017 and the order dated
03/04/2017 passed in Writ Appeal No.308/2016 was recalled and the writ appeal
filed by Ramjilal Prajapati was dismissed and accordingly, it is submitted by the
counsel for the respondents that the petitioner is not entitled for the relief prayed for.
Furthermore, by circular dated 03rd May, 2017, it has been held that the Class-III
employees would retire after attaining the age of 60 years. Accordingly, this Court is
of the considered opinion that the respondents did not commit any mistake in
retiring the petitioner after the age of 60 years as he is a Class-III employee."
Petitioner takes exception to the order contending inter alia that with the State
constituting a new service of "Sthai Karmi" as per policy brought in vogue on
07.10.2016 and the petitioner having been classified as 'Skilled' in said service in
place of daily wager who are THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
WA.1326.2019 (Munna Lal Rajak, Vs. The State of M.P. & Ors.) Class IV, and his
entitlement to serve till 62 years of age. To substantiate the contention, petitioner has
adverted to the Circular No.F 5-1/2013/1/3 dated 07.10.2016. The said Circular lays
down the policy relating to regularization of workmen classified as permanent (dk;Zjr
nSfud osru Hkksxh Jfedksa ds fy, ^^LFkk;h dfeZ;ksa dks fofu;fer djus dh ;kstuk).
Close look at the policy reveals that it does not make any provision as to what shall be
the age of superannuation of the personnels designated as "Sthai Karmi".
The said aspect, however, was later on spelt out vide Circular C-5-1-2013-1-3 dated
03.05.2017 which made provision for extension of various benefits to "Sthai Karmis"
including age of superannuation.
Clause I of the Circular envisages:

foHkkx THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH WA.1326.2019 (Munna Lal
Rajak, Vs. The State of M.P. & Ors.) In the present case, as it is the petitioner's own
admission that he was working against the post of Supervisor, which is a Class III
post in Regular Establishment, no error can be found either in the decision taken by
the Authority in retiring him on attaining the age of 60 years, nor with the decision
by learned Single Judge, as would warrant any indulgence.
However, not without a caveat, learned Single Judge found that the petitioner's retirement was
stayed by an interim order and till date of decision i.e. 26.07.2019 was discharging his duties by
virtue of said interim order. Learned Single Judge while dismissing the petition directed for
recovery of salary for the extended period by relying on the decision in "Style (Dress Land) Vs.
Union Territory, Chandigarh and another [(1999) 7 SCC 89]" which related to Excise Duty levied on
the petitioner therein which was stayed, the duty was later found to be justified and since the
petitioner was found to have the benefit of keeping back the payment of duty were held to be liable
for interest, which Hon'ble Supreme Court declined to interfere observing that "Holding otherwise
would be against public policy."
In our considered opinion, the case of a workman having worked for extended period under an
order of the Court cannot be equated with that of manufacturer who holds back the Excise Duty.

Munna Lal Rajak vs State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 August, 2019
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH WA.1326.2019 (Munna Lal Rajak, Vs. The State of
M.P. & Ors.) Workman having put his labour is entitled for the wages, the denial of which may
tantamount to "begar" which is contrary to our Constitutional philosophy. Article 23 of the
Constitution mandates:
"23. Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour.-
(1) Traffic in human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced labour are
prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in
accordance with law.
(2) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from imposing compulsory service
for public purpose, and in imposing such service the State shall not make any
discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste or class or any of them."
Division Bench of Allahabad High Court in "Sita Ram Yadav V. District Inspector of Schools,
Jaunpur and another [1990 LAB. I.C. 1025]", has observed:
"14. We see no justification for non-payment of the salary to the petitioner for the
period for which he has worked. He is entitled for the salary for the period beyond
last terminus date of approval for the duration for which he has worked. The matter
has to be viewed seriously in view of the fact that non-payment of salary amounts not
only deprivation of the right of livelihood covered under Art. 21 of the Constitution,
but it also breaches the mandate under Art.23 of the Constitution."
Similarly, dwelling upon the aspect as to whether Article 23 of the Constitution is wide enough to
include in its sweep exploitation of a Government servant or employees of instrumentality of State,
in "Shri Mukesh Chandra Vs. State of U.P. and others [2000 LAB.
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH WA.1326.2019 (Munna Lal Rajak, Vs. The State of
M.P. & Ors.) I.C. 1000]" it was observed by the learned Single Judge of Allahabad High Court in
paragraphs 12 and 13:
"12. The article prohibits begar and other similar form of forced labour. The meaning
of these expression and the ambit and scope of the article has been discussed in detail
in People's Union for Democratic Rights (supra). The Court held that the sweep of the
article was very wide and unlimited as the Constitution makers were endeavouring to
bring about socio-economic regeneration with a view to reach social justice to
common man. The Court held that the article struck at forced labour in whichever
form it manifested itself because it was violative of human values. The Court took
notice of social conditions prevailing in our society and observed that poverty and
unemployment resulted in unequal bargaining power leading to Hobson's choice
either to starve or submit to exploitative terms dictated by the employer giving rise to
legitimate presumption that when a person provides labour of service to another

Munna Lal Rajak vs State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 August, 2019
person against receipt of remuneration which is less than the minimum wage he is
acting under force of such compulsion which drives him to work though he is paid
less than what be is entitled to receive. The Court having explained, forced labour
thus extended its scope by applying it to situations where a person was forced by
economic considerations to accept lesser remuneration and held that :
"The word 'force' must therefore be construed to include not only physical or legal
force but also force arising from the compulsion of economic circumstances which
leave no choice of alternatives to a person in want and compels him to provide labour
or service even though the remuneration received for it is less than the minimum
wages Act."
13. This decision was rendered by the apex court on a public interest litigation filed for benefit of
workers engaged by the contractors to whom the work of construction was entrusted by Delhi
Development Authority or Union of India for completing projects during Asiad. The entire decision
was based on admission by the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH WA.1326.2019
(Munna Lal Rajak, Vs. The State of M.P. & Ors.) Union of India that even though it paid the
minimum wages of Rs. 9/25 per worker to the contractor he deducted Rs. 1/- as his commission.
The worker thus received one rupee less. The importance of the decision lies in that it explains the
scope of Article 23. It has been extended to any form of begar or forced labour either due to
economic compulsion or otherwise. The words and expressions used in the article are of wide sweep.
They were construed broadly by the apex court. The word begar has been described by Molesworth
as "labour or service extracted by a Government or person in power without giving remuneration for
it." It was approved by the apex court in People's Union for Democratic Rights (supra). Therefore,
the article is wide enough and extends to actions of the Government if it results in taking service
without paying any or full remuneration. In Suraj v. State of M. P., AIR 1960 MP 303 the salary of a
teacher was stopped as he was not willing to work against the terms of his appointment. The Court
held that begar includes taking work without remuneration even temporarily. It was observed "To
ask a man to work and then not to pay him any salary or wages savours of begar." Similarly, if the
Government or its instrumentality pays lesser amount than the amount fixed for a particular job
then it is as much begar as paying nothing.........."
We respectfully agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge of Allahabad High Court.
In view whereof, in the case at hand, as the petitioner had worked for the period from his actual date
of retirement till the date of passing of order in Writ Petition by virtue of an interim order, he cannot
be deprived of the wages of said period. He will be entitled for the wages as a right; though the
period shall not be counted for other retiral dues. Consequently, the direction for recovery of the
salary for THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH WA.1326.2019 (Munna Lal Rajak, Vs. The
State of M.P. & Ors.) the period from 01.04.2019 till the decision in Writ Petition is set aside.
Appeal is disposed of finally in above terms. No cost.
