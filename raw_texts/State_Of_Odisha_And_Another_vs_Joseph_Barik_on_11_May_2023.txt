CORAM:
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
JUSTICE G. SATAPATHY
ORDER
Order No. 11.05.2023
02. 1. In all these writ appeals by the State of Odisha against the corresponding orders of the learned
Single Judge, a common question arises for consideration viz. whether during the pendency of a
criminal case against the government servant in the Court of the Special Judge (Vigilance), and
notwithstanding exoneration of the said employee in the departmental proceedings, could the
learned Single Judge have ordered grant of either ad hoc or regular promotion to the government
servant subject to the outcome of the criminal proceedings?
2. One other common factor that requires to be noticed is that except in W.A. No.596 of 2023 where
the impugned order under challenge Location: High Court of Orissa, Cuttack Date: 14-May-2023
10:25:39 was passed by the learned Single Judge after completion of pleadings in the writ petition,
in all the other appeals the impugned order under challenge was passed by the learned Single Judge
on the very first date of hearing of the writ petition without an opportunity to the State of Odisha to
file its reply.
3. This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties.
4. There is no dispute in that the criminal case involving the Respondents in the present appeals is
still pending before the Court of the Special Judge (Vigilance) at various stages. In some cases, even
a charge sheet is yet to be filed and in other charges may or may not have been framed; in certain
other cases, trial is in progress.
5. Learned counsel appearing for the respective Respondents argue that on account of the long years
of the pendency of the criminal case and with the impending prospect of many of the Respondents
superannuating in the immediate future, one equitable solution would be for this Court to direct the
Appellants (State of Odisha) to grant them 'ad hoc' promotions. In support of such plea, reliance
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166597489/ 8
State Of Odisha And Another vs Joseph Barik on 11 May, 2023
placed on an interim order passed by this Court on 27th March, 2023 in W.A. No.321 of 2022.
6. However, it is pointed out by Mr. Khuntia, learned Additional Government Advocate (AGA) that
in W.A. No.321 of 2022 the Respondent had been exonerated in the departmental proceedings and
the report sent by the Special Judge, Vigilance to this Court Location: High Court of Orissa, Cuttack
Date: 14-May-2023 10:25:39 showed that the trial in T.R. Case No.50 of 2014 was progressing very
slowly with only three witnesses having been examined. Accordingly, this Court in the said case
directed the trial Court to conclude the entire trial and deliver the judgment on or before 1st August,
2023. It is in those circumstances that no interim order was passed by the Diviion Bench staying the
order of the learned Single Judge. The said writ appeal has been directed to be listed on 10th August,
2023.
7. Apart from the fact that the aformenetioned order is an interlocutory one peculiar to the facts
noted, as far as the present batch of cases is concerned, departmental proceedings are still pending
in some and in all the cases criminal proceedings are pending.
8. The Court has been shown a compilation of Office Memoranda (OMs) and Notifications issued by
the Government of Odisha from time to time. These include OM dated 18th February 1994, 4th July
1995, 1st November 1997, 28th January 1999, 28th May 2012, 29th April 2017 and 17th June
2021issued by the General Administration Department. None of them envisages or permits grant of
promotion to a government servant either on regular or on ad hoc basis during the pendency of a
criminal case involving such government servant.
9. Further in terms of the law explained by the Supreme Court in Union of India v. K.V. Janaki
Raman (1991) 4 SCC 109, State of Punjab v. Chamanlal Goel (1995) 2 SCC 570, the judgment of this
Location: High Court of Orissa, Cuttack Date: 14-May-2023 10:25:39 Court dated 5th October, 2016
in W.P.(C) No.19909 of 2015 (State of Odisha v. Somanath Sahoo) and the judgment dated 26th
April, 2017 in W.P.(C) No.22393 of 2015 (State of Odisha v. Anil Kumar Sethi), there is no right of
the government servant to be considered for promotion during the pendency of either departmental
proceedings or criminal proceedings or both against such government servant.
10. The plea of the learned counsel appearing for the Respondents that they should be granted at
least one 'ad hoc promotion' is also without any legal basis in light of the above OMs and the settled
position in law.
11. It is clarified that as and when the criminal proceedings end in favour of the government servant
by way of an acquittal and such government servant also stands exonerated from the departmental
procewedings then notwithstanding the superannuation of such government servant, the notional
benefits attaching to the promotion that is due to the government servant would be calculated and
the pension fixed accordingly.
12. In the light of the above orders of the Government, it is not possible for this Court to sustain the
impugned orders of the learned Single Judge in the present cases directing the Appellants to grant
regular promotion to the Respondents even with the caveat that such promotion would be subject to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166597489/ 9
State Of Odisha And Another vs Joseph Barik on 11 May, 2023
the outcome of the criminal case against such government servant. The said impugned orders of the
learned Single Judge are accordingly hereby set aside.
Location: High Court of Orissa, Cuttack Date: 14-May-2023 10:25:39
13. It will of course be open to the Respondents to request the criminal Courts concerned to expedite
the proceedings and bring the trials to an early conclusion.
14. The writ appeals are accordingly allowed, but in the circumstances, with no order as to costs.
