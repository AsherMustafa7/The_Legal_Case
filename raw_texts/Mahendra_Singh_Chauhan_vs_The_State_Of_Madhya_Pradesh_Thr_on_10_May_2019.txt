3. The accused Vimal Singh, Dharmendra Shrivas and Jagdish Garg were absconding and therefore,
charge sheet under Section 299 of Cr.P.C. was filed against the above mentioned accused persons.
4. The necessary facts for the disposal of the present appeal in short are that the Registry of the High
Court, Gwalior Bench, suspected that some stamp papers which have been filed by way of Court fee
appears to be counterfeited. Therefore, the Treasury Office, was requested to verify the same. On
verification, the said stamp papers were found to be counterfeited. Therefore, a request was made
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 to the Collector, Gwalior to look into the matter. The Add.
Collector, Gwalior, in its turn wrote a letter to the Superintendent of Police for investigation, and the
Superintendent of Police, Gwalior, forwarded the matter to the Police Station University, which was
received by the S.H.O., on 19-3-2007, containing the allegations that it appears that Vinod Singh
Yadav, the Stamp Vendor, is most probably involved in making of forged stamp papers. Therefore,
the police was directed to look into the matter and if so required, to lodge the F.I.R. and inform the
Principal Registrar of this High Court.
5. Along with the letter, a photo copy of enquiry report submitted by the Treasury Office, Gwalior
was also annexed. A report was received that the stamp papers sold by Vinod Singh Yadav bearing
No. 017977, 017893,017958 to 017969 and which were annexed with S.A. No. 1366/07, S.A. No.
199/07, F.A. No. 32/07 by way of Court fee, appears to be different from the original stamp papers.
As per the record of the Treasury, the said Stamp Papers were also not sold to Vinod Singh Yadav.
Accordingly, the police registered the F.I.R. in crime No. 65/2007 against Vinod Singh Yadav, for
offence under Sections 420,467, 468, 471, 472, 255, 258,259,260 of I.P.C. and under Section 69 of
Indian Stamp Paper Act read with Rule 39 of M.P. Stamp Paper Rules, 1942. The police, during
investigation, arrested the remaining appellants and seized incriminating material including
Counterfeit stamp papers. After completing the investigation, the CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 &
259/18 police filed the charge sheet against the appellants. Three accused persons were absconding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 4
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
therefore, proceedings under Section 299 of Cr.P.C. was taken against the absconding accused
persons.
6. The Trial Court by order dated 9-3-2010, framed charges for offence under Sections
255,256,257,258, 259, 261, 420, 467, 468,471, 472 of I.P.C. and under Section 69 of Indian Stamp
Paper Act read with Rule 39 of M.P. Stamp Paper Rules, 1942.
7. The appellants abjured their guilt and pleaded not guilty.
8. The prosecution, in order to prove its case, examined Rajendra Prasad Bhatnagar (P.W.1), Amrit
Minj (P.W.2), P.P. Shrivastava (P.W.3), Rakesh Shrivastava (P.W.4), Pramod Saxena (P.W.5),
Rampal (P.W.6), Neeraj Shrivastava (P.W.7), R.S. Ahirwar (P.W.8), Ahsan Qureshi (P.W.9), Udai
Pratap singh (P.W.10), Harish Kumar Gurnani (P.W.11), Mukesh Sharma (P.W.12), Poonam Soni
(P.W.13), R.N. Gupta (P.W.14), Hotam Singh (P.W.15), V.D. Purdare (P.W.16), M. Mazumdar
(P.W.17), Machal Singh (P.W.18), M. Fraklin (P.W.19), Jagdish Sharma (P.W.20), Badan Singh
Baghel (P.W.21), Mohan Krishna Verma (P.W.22), Laxmandas Agrawal (P.W.23), Rajeev Sharma
(P.W.24), Virendra Kumar Garud (P.W.25), Aditya Singh Tomar (P.W.26), Rakesh Gupta (P.W.27),
P.B. Kamlaskar (P.W.28), Umesh Mishra (P.W.29) and N.K. Upadhayaya (P.W.30).
9. The appellants, examined Vinod Kumar Verma (D.W.1/Appellant himself), and Mohanlal
Agrawal (D.W.2).
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
10. The Trial Court by judgment and sentence dated 22-12-2017, passed in S.T. No. 105/2007, has
convicted the appellants for the offence(s) mentioned above and has awarded the sentence as
mentioned above.
11. Challenging the judgment and conviction recorded by the Trial Court, it is submitted by the
Counsel for the appellants Vinod Verma, Mahendra Singh Chauhan, and Rakesh Garg, that the only
incriminating evidence against them is the seizure of so called counterfeit stamp papers and seals,
whereas it is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant Vinod Singh Yadav, that nothing was seized
from him.
12. It is next contended by all the Counsels that the independent witnesses of seizure have not
supported the prosecution case and no Rojnamcha Sanha was filed to show that the investigating
officer had ever gone to the houses of the appellants for effecting seizure. Even the investigating
officer was not in a position to give the description of the houses of the appellants. Further, the
appellants were not in exclusive possession of their houses, as their family members were also
residing in the same house. The record of Malkhana has not been produced. Further V.P. Kamlaskar
(P.W.28) has failed to establish that the stamp papers seized from the possession of appellant Vinod
Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan were fake/counterfeit. Further, the investigation has acted in
a malafide manner and they have picked and CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 choose
because Ms. Poonam Soni, Clerk of Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi Advocate, and Shri Neeraj Shrivastava,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 5
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
Advocate have not been made an accused.
13. Per contra, it is submitted by the Counsel for the State that it was found that certain fake stamp
papers were used for payment of Court Fee in three Appeals, therefore, the matter was referred to
the Treasury. A report was received that the stamp papers which were filed by way of Court Fee,
were never issued to Stamp Vendor Vinod Singh Yadav and they were fake. Further, no explanation
has been given by the appellants Vinod Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan, as to how they came
in possession of the fake stamp papers. So far as Vinod Singh Yadav is concerned, the fake stamp
papers were sold by him to Ms. Poonam Soni and Neeraj Shrivastava Advocate. Further, Rakesh
Garg was found in possession of a fake seal. Thus, the Court below after meticulously marshalling
the evidence available on record, has recorded the conviction of the appellants. Further, the
prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that the stamp papers seized from the
possession of the appellants as well as found in Court record were counterfeit.
14. Heard the learned Counsel for the parties.
15. According to the prosecution story, during the checking of judicial record, the Registry of the
High Court, Gwalior Bench, suspected that in some of the cases, the stamp papers appears to be
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 suspicious. Therefore, the Treasury Office, Moti Mahal,
Gwalior was asked to examine the genuiness of the stamp papers. After receiving the report from the
Treasury Officer, by letter dated 19-3-2007, Ex. P.22, the then Collector, Gwalior was requested to
take necessary action in the matter according to law under intimation of this Registry. Accordingly,
the complaint was forwarded to the Superintendent of Police by the office of Collector, Gwalior by
letter dated 19-3-2007, Ex. P.21. Resultantly, the F.I.R., Ex. P.23 was lodged on 19-3-2007 for
offence under Sections 420,467,468,471,472,255,258,259 and 260 of I.P.C. and also under Section
69 of Indian Stamp Paper Act, 1899 and Rule 39 of M.P. Stamp Paper Rule, 1942.
Seizure of 7 Counterfeits/fake stamp papers from the possession of appellant Vinod Verma
16. According to the prosecution story, the appellant Vinod Verma, made a confessional statement,
Ex. P.7 and accordingly, 7 counterfeit Stamp Papers were seized from his possession vide seizure
memo Ex. P.11. The seizure was made in the presence of independent witnesses namely Rakesh
Shrivastava (P.W.4) and Pramod Saxena (P.W.5).
17. However, in the Trial, Rakesh Shrivastava (P.W.4) and Pramod Saxena (P.W.5) didnot support
the prosecution case, with regard to the place of seizure and were declared hostile for limited
purposes. It is submitted that therefore, the seizure of 7 Counterfeit Stamp papers from the
possession of the appellant Vinod Verma, has not been CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
proved beyond reasonable doubt, as the evidence of N.K. Upadhyaya, I.O. (P.W.30), is not reliable.
18. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the appellant Vinod Verma.
19. Independent witnesses of seizure namely Rakesh Shrivastava (P.W.4) and Pramod Saxena
(P.W.5) have not supported the prosecution case and they have turned hostile. They have stated that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 6
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
the stamp papers and seals were seized in the Police Station, therefore, they were declared hostile
for limited purposes and were cross- examined by the Public Prosecutor. However, the question for
determination is that even if the independent witnesses have turned hostile, then whether the
evidence of police personals can be relied upon or not?
20. The Supreme Court in the case of Madhu Vs. State of Karnataka reported in (2014) 12 SCC 419
has held as under :
"17. The learned counsel for the appellants has vehemently argued that in some of the
recoveries, though a large number of people were available, but only police personnel
were made recovery witnesses. Thus, the whole prosecution case becomes doubtful.
18. The term "witness" means a person who is capable of providing information by
way of deposing as regards relevant facts, via an oral statement, or a statement in
writing, made or given in court, or otherwise. In Pradeep Narayan Madgaonkar v.
State of Maharashtra this Court dealt with the issue of the requirement of the
examination of an independent witness, and whether the evidence of a police witness
requires CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 corroboration. The Court held that
though the same must be subject to strict scrutiny, however, the evidence of police
officials cannot be discarded merely on the ground that they belong to the police
force and are either interested in the investigation or in the prosecution. However, as
far as possible the corroboration of their evidence on material particulars should be
sought. (See also Paras Ram v. State of Haryana; Balbir Singh v. State; Kalpnath Rai
v. State; M. Prabhulal v. Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Ravindran v. Supt.
of Customs.)
19. Thus, a witness is normally considered to be independent unless he springs from
sources which are likely to be tainted and this usually means that the said witness has
cause to bear such enmity against the accused so as to implicate him falsely. In view
of the above, there can be no prohibition to the effect that a policeman cannot be a
witness or that his deposition cannot be relied upon if it inspires confidence."
21. The Supreme Court in the case of Govindaraju Vs. State reported in (2012) 4 SCC 722 has held as
under :-
"67. We are certainly not indicating that despite all this, the statement of the police
officer for recovery and other matters could not be believed and form the basis of
conviction but where the statement of such witness is not reliable and does not
inspire confidence, then the accused would be entitled to the benefit of doubt in
accordance with law. Mere absence of independent witnesses when the investigating
officer recorded the statement of the accused and the article was recovered pursuant
thereto, is not a sufficient ground to discard the evidence of the police officer relating
to recovery at the instance of the accused. [See State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) v. Sunil]
Similar would be the situation where the attesting witnesses turn hostile, but where
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 7
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
the statement of the police officer itself is unreliable then it may be difficult for the
court to accept the CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 recovery as lawful and
legally admissible. The official acts of the police should be presumed to be regularly
performed and there is no occasion for the courts to begin with initial distrust to
discard such evidence."
22. The Supreme Court in the case of Baldev Singh v. State of Haryana, reported in (2015) 17 SCC
554 has held as under :
"10. There is no legal proposition that evidence of police officials unless supported by
independent evidence is unworthy of acceptance. Evidence of police witnesses cannot
be discarded merely on the ground that they belong to police force and interested in
the investigation and their desire to see the success of the case. Prudence however
requires that the evidence of police officials who are interested in the outcome of the
result of the case needs to be carefully scrutinised and independently appreciated.
Mere fact that they are police officials does not by itself give rise to any doubt about
their creditworthiness.
11. Observing that no infirmity is attached to the testimony of police officials merely
because they belong to police force and that conviction can be based on the testimony
of police officials in Girja Prasad v. State of M.P., it was held as under: (SCC pp.
632-33, paras 25-27) "25. In our judgment, the above proposition does not lay down
correct law on the point. It is well settled that credibility of witness has to be tested
on the touchstone of truthfulness and trustworthiness. It is quite possible that in a
given case, a court of law may not base conviction solely on the evidence of the
complainant or a police official but it is not the law that police witnesses should not
be relied upon and their evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in
material particulars by other independent evidence. The presumption that every
person acts honestly applies as much in favour of a police official as any other person.
No infirmity attaches to the testimony of police CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 &
259/18 officials merely because they belong to police force. There is no rule of law
which lays down that no conviction can be recorded on the testimony of police
officials even if such evidence is otherwise reliable and trustworthy. The rule of
prudence may require more careful scrutiny of their evidence. But, if the court is
convinced that what was stated by a witness has a ring of truth, conviction can be
based on such evidence.
26. It is not necessary to refer to various decisions on the point. We may, however,
state that before more than half-a-century, in Aher Raja Khima v. State of Saurashtra,
Venkatarama Ayyar, J. stated: (AIR p. 230, para 40) '40. ... The presumption that a
person acts honestly applies as much in favour of a police officer as of other persons,
and it is not judicial approach to distrust and suspect him without good grounds
therefor. Such an attitude could do neither credit to the magistracy nor good to the
public. It can only run down the prestige of the police administration.'
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 8
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
27. In Tahir v. State (Delhi), dealing with a similar question, Dr A.S. Anand, J. (as His
Lordship then was) stated: (SCC p. 341, para
6) '6. ... Where the evidence of the police officials, after careful scrutiny, inspires
confidence and is found to be trustworthy and reliable, it can form basis of conviction
and the absence of some independent witness of the locality to lend corroboration to
their evidence, does not in any way affect the creditworthiness of the prosecution
case."
(emphasis in original)
23. The Supreme Court in the case of Girja Prasad v. State of M.P., reported in (2007) 7 SCC 625 has
held as under :
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 "25. In our judgment, the above proposition
does not lay down correct law on the point. It is well settled that credibility of witness
has to be tested on the touchstone of truthfulness and trustworthiness. It is quite
possible that in a given case, a court of law may not base conviction solely on the
evidence of the complainant or a police official but it is not the law that police
witnesses should not be relied upon and their evidence cannot be accepted unless it is
corroborated in material particulars by other independent evidence. The
presumption that every person acts honestly applies as much in favour of a police
official as any other person. No infirmity attaches to the testimony of police officials
merely because they belong to police force. There is no rule of law which lays down
that no conviction can be recorded on the testimony of police officials even if such
evidence is otherwise reliable and trustworthy.
The rule of prudence may require more careful scrutiny of their evidence. But, if the court is
convinced that what was stated by a witness has a ring of truth, conviction can be based on such
evidence.
24. Thus, it is clear that if the evidence of Police personal is found to be reliable, then the case of the
prosecution cannot be thrown overboard, merely by saying that the independent witnesses of
seizure have not supported the prosecution case.
25. Now, the next question for determination is that whether the evidence of N.K. Upadhayaya
(P.W.30) is reliable or not?
26. Challenging the verasity of the evidence of N.K. Upadhyaya (P.W.30), it is submitted by the
Counsel for the appellant Vinod Verma, that the police has not filed the rojnamcha sanha to prove
that the Investigating Officer had ever gone to the house of the appellant CRA-6426/17, 124/18,
181/18 & 259/18 Vinod Verma. N.K. Upadhyaya (P.W.30), has failed to even describe the location of
the house. By referring to the paragraph 13 of the cross examination of N.K. Upadhayaya (P.W.30),
it is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant Vinod Verma, that this Witness could not state that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 9
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
at which place, the appellant Vinod Verma was arrested. Similarly, by referring to para 18 of his
cross examination, it is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant Vinod Verma, that the
investigating officer, has admitted that when he reached the house of the appellant, it was open and
the members of the family of the appellant Vinod Verma were residing. Thus, it is submitted that the
appellant Vinod Verma was not in exclusive possession of the house. Further it is submitted that the
investigating officer could not say that whether the house of Vinod Verma was a single storey or was
a multi storey house. He also could not point out that from which place, the appellant Vinod Verma
had taken out the counterfeit stamp papers. He further admitted that he had not taken the
signatures of the appellant Vinod Verma, on the stamp papers which were seized from his
possession. He has further admitted in para 19 that a Malkhana register is maintained in the Police
Station, but the same was not produced. Thus, it is submitted that the prosecution has failed to
prove that the counterfeit stamp papers were seized from the possession of the appellant Vinod
Verma.
27. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
appellant Vinod Verma. It is not the case of the appellant Vinod Verma, that apart from his family
members, any other outsider is also residing in his house. It is the case of the prosecution, that the
appellant Vinod Verma had taken out the counterfeit stamp papers from his house. Thus, it is clear
that the appellant Vinod Verma was aware of the fact that, where the counterfeit stamp papers have
been kept. It is not the case of the appellant Vinod Verma, that any other family member was
involved. Thus, where the house is occupied by the family members of the accused, and the accused
after making confessional statement, takes out the counterfeit stamp papers from his house, then it
can be inferred that it was the appellant Vinod Verma, who was in exclusive possession of the
counterfeit stamp papers, because he had an exclusive knowledge about the place where the
counterfeit stamp papers were kept. So far as the inability of this witness to depose that whether the
house of the appellant Vinod Verma was single storey or double storey, in the considered opinion of
this Court, no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution. The seizure was made on
20-3-2007, whereas this witness was examined on 7-9-2017 i.e., after more than 10 years. With the
passage of time, the memory of a witness is liable to fade, and under these circumstances, this Court
is of the considered opinion, that no advantage to the appellant Vinod Verma can be given, if the
witness was unable to answer that whether the house of Vinod Verma was CRA-6426/17, 124/18,
181/18 & 259/18 single storey or double storey. Further a suggestion has been given by the appellant
himself that when this witness reached the house of appellant, it was open and there were other
members of family. It is next contended by the Counsel for the appellant, that N.K. Upadhayaya
(P.W.30) has merely stated in his examination in chief, that the confessional statement made by the
appellant Vinod Verma is Ex. P.7, whereas he should have narrated the entire facts, which were
disclosed by the appellant Vinod Verma in his confessional statement. Once again, it is clarified that
since, the evidence of this witness was recorded after more than 10 years of investigation, therefore,
no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution. Further, the appellant Vinod Verma
didnot raise any objection at the time, when the confessional statement was being marked as
exhibit.
28. The Supreme Court in the case of R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder Vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami &
V.P. Temple reported in (2003) 8 SCC 752 has held as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 10
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
"20. The learned counsel for the defendant-respondent has relied on Roman Catholic
Mission v. State of Madras in support of his submission that a document not
admissible in evidence, though brought on record, has to be excluded from
consideration. We do not have any dispute with the proposition of law so laid down
in the abovesaid case. However, the present one is a case which calls for the correct
position of law being made precise. Ordinarily, an objection to the admissibility of
evidence should be taken when it is tendered and not subsequently. The objections as
to admissibility of documents in CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 evidence
may be classified into two classes: (i) an objection that the document which is sought
to be proved is itself inadmissible in evidence; and (ii) where the objection does not
dispute the admissibility of the document in evidence but is directed towards the
mode of proof alleging the same to be irregular or insufficient. In the first case,
merely because a document has been marked as "an exhibit", an objection as to its
admissibility is not excluded and is available to be raised even at a later stage or even
in appeal or revision. In the latter case, the objection should be taken when the
evidence is tendered and once the document has been admitted in evidence and
marked as an exhibit, the objection that it should not have been admitted in evidence
or that the mode adopted for proving the document is irregular cannot be allowed to
be raised at any stage subsequent to the marking of the document as an exhibit. The
latter proposition is a rule of fair play. The crucial test is whether an objection, if
taken at the appropriate point of time, would have enabled the party tendering the
evidence to cure the defect and resort to such mode of proof as would be regular. The
omission to object becomes fatal because by his failure the party entitled to object
allows the party tendering the evidence to act on an assumption that the opposite
party is not serious about the mode of proof. On the other hand, a prompt objection
does not prejudice the party tendering the evidence, for two reasons: firstly, it
enables the court to apply its mind and pronounce its decision on the question of
admissibility then and there; and secondly, in the event of finding of the court on the
mode of proof sought to be adopted going against the party tendering the evidence,
the opportunity of seeking indulgence of the court for permitting a regular mode or
method of proof and thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, is
available to the party leading the evidence. Such practice and procedure is fair to both
the parties. Out of the two types of objections, referred to hereinabove, in the latter
case, failure to raise a prompt and timely CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting on formal proof of a
document, the document itself which is sought to be proved being admissible in
evidence. In the first case, acquiescence would be no bar to raising the objection in a
superior court."
29. Thus, where the admissibility of a document is not in a question, but merely its mode of proof is
challenged, then the said objection must be taken at the time of marking of said document as exhibit
because in such a situation, the opposite party shall have an opportunity to correct the mode of
proof. Marking of exhibit is a procedure and the procedural rights can be waived by any party. Thus,
if no objection was raised by the accused at the time when the confessional statement of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 11
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
appellant Vinod Verma was being marked as exhibit, then in the considered opinion of this Court,
no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution, as the appellants had waived their right
to challenge the mode of proof. Further so far as the question of non-filing of Rojnamcha Sanha is
concerned, it is well established principle of law that defective investigation would not discard the
direct ocular/circumstancial evidence.
30. The appellant Vinod Verma, has examined himself as Defence Witness No.1 and has stated that
he is an Advocate by profession and is a practicising lawyer. He was called by the police personals at
Police Station University. N.K. Upadhayaya (P.W.30) had never CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 &
259/18 visited his house nor any stamp paper was seized from his possession at his house and the
entire proceedings against him is forged. However, in his evidence, this witness has not stated that
no stamp paper was ever seized from his possession. The seizure memo Ex. P.11 bears the signature
of this witness which has not been explained by him. Once, an accused has appeared as a witness,
then he is required to explain each and every circumstance. When an accused examines himself as a
defence witness, then he has to be treated like any other prosecution or defence witness and any
admission made by the accused as a defence witness would certainly amount to an admission of
incriminating material and his evidence may go against him. It can be safely said that by filing an
application under Section 315 of Cr.P.C. to appear as a defence witness, the accused, impliedly
waives his rights as an accused and he is liable to suffer the consequences of his action if the
statements in his evidence are found to be self-criminative. Once, an accused decides to appear as
defence witness, then he enjoys the status of like any other witness and in view of Section 132 of
Evidence, he cannot claim any immunity to answer a question. Even leading questions tending to
implicate him can also be put in the cross examination. Thus, after having appeared as a defence
witness, the entire burden was on the appellant Vinod Verma, to explain all the incriminating
circumstances against him. Vinod Verma (D.W.1) has merely stated that the Stamp Papers were not
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 seized at his house, however, he has not stated that no
Stamp paper was seized from him at all. He has merely stated that he was called in the Police Station
University but has not stated that he was forced to sign the seizure memo. It is further submitted by
the Counsel for the appellant Vinod Verma, that since, the signatures of the appellant Vinod Verma
were obtained on the seizure memo Ex. P.11, therefore, it is hit by Section 162 of Cr.P.C., and even if
the appellant as defence witness has not explained his signatures on the seizure memo, Ex. P.11, it
cannot be said that the appellant has failed to explain an incriminating circumstance. Considered
the submission made by the Counsel for the appellant Vinod Verma.
31. Section 162 of Cr.P.C., reads as under :
"162. Statements to police not to be signed: Use of statements in evidence.-- (1) No
statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation
under this Chapter, shall, if reduced to writing, be signed by the person making it;
nor shall any such statement or any record thereof, whether in a police diary or
otherwise, or any part of such statement or record, be used for any purpose, save as
hereinafter provided, at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under
investigation at the time when such statement was made:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 12
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
Provided that when any witness is called for the prosecution in such inquiry or trial
whose statement has been reduced into writing as aforesaid, any part of his
statement, if duly proved, may be used by the accused, and with the permission of the
Court, by the prosecution, to contradict such witness in the manner provided by
Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872); and when any part of such
statement is CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 so used, any part thereof may
also be used in the re-examination of such witness, but for the purpose only of
explaining any matter referred to in his cross-examination.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any statement falling within
the provisions of clause (1) of Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872),
or to affect the provisions of Section 27 of that Act.
Explanation.--An omission to state a fact or circumstance in the statement referred to in sub-section
(1) may amount to contradiction if the same appears to be significant and otherwise relevant having
regard to the context in which such omission occurs and whether any omission amounts to a
contradiction in the particular context shall be a question of fact.
(Underline applied)
32. Thus, from the plain reading of Section 162(2) of Cr.P.C., it is clear that the provisions of this
Section have not been made applicable to the proceedings under Section 32 of Evidence Act or
Section 27 of Evidence Act. Therefore, if the investigating officer had obtained the signatures of the
appellant Vinod Verma, on the seizure-memo, Ex. P.11, then it cannot be said that it would hit by
Section 162 of Cr.P.C.
33. The Supreme Court in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Teja Ram reported in (1999) 3 SCC 507
has held as under :
"28. Learned counsel in this context invited our attention to one step which PW 21
(investigating officer) had adopted while preparing the seizure-memos Ex. P-3 and
Ex. P-4. He obtained the signature of the accused concerned in both the
seizure-memos. According to the learned counsel, the aforesaid action of the
investigating officer was illegal and it has vitiated the seizure. He invited our
attention to Section CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 162(1) of the Code which
prohibits collecting of signature of the person whose statement was reduced to
writing during interrogation. The material words in the sub-section are these:
"162. (1) No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an
investigation under this Chapter, shall, if reduced to writing, be signed by the person
making it;"
No doubt the aforesaid prohibition is in peremptory terms. It is more a direction to the investigating
officer than to the court because the policy underlying the rule is to keep witnesses free to testify in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 13
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
court unhampered by anything which the police claim to have elicited from them. (Tahsildar Singh
v. State of U.P. and Razik Ram v. Jaswant Singh Chouhan.) But if any investigating officer, ignorant
of the said provision, secures the signature of the person concerned in the statement, it does not
mean that the witness's testimony in the court would thereby become contaminated or vitiated. The
court will only reassure the witness that he is not bound by such statement albeit his signature
finding a place thereon.
29. That apart, the prohibition contained in sub-section (1) of Section 162 is not applicable to any
proceedings made as per Section 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872. It is clearly provided in sub- section
(2) of Section 162 which reads thus:
"Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any statement falling within the
provisions of clause (1) of Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), or
to affect the provisions of Section 27 of that Act."
30. The resultant position is that the investigating officer is not obliged to obtain the signature of an
accused in any statement attributed to him while preparing seizure-memo for the recovery of any
article covered by Section 27 of the Evidence Act. But if any signature has been obtained by an
investigating officer, there is nothing wrong or illegal about it. Hence, we cannot find any force in
the contention of the CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 learned counsel for the accused that
the signatures of the accused in Exs. P-3 and P-4 seizure-memos would vitiate the evidence
regarding recovery of the axes.
34. Thus, it is held that after appearing as a defence witness, the appellant Vinod Verma, lost all his
rights available to an accused and he cannot claim the privilege of maintaining silence and therefore,
failure on his part to explain his signatures on the seizure-memo, Ex. P.11, would certainly go
against him.
35. Therefore, in the considered opinion of this Court, the prosecution has established beyond
reasonable doubt that 7 stamp papers were seized from the possession of the appellant Vinod
Verma, by seizure-memo Ex. P.11.
Seizure of 5 Counterfeit Stamp Papers and three seals from the possession of Mahendra Singh
Chauhan
36. As per the prosecution story, on confessional statement of the appellant Mahendra Singh
Chauhan, Ex. P.9, 5 counterfeit stamp papers and three seals of Vinod Singh Yadav, were seized
from the possession of the appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan vide seizure- memo, Ex. P.10.
Rakesh Shrivastava (P.W.4) and Pramod Saxena (P.W.5) are the seizure witnesses, but they have
stated that the stamp papers and seals were seized in the police station and therefore, they were
declared hostile for limited purposes and were cross examined by the Public Prosecutor.
37. To challenge the seizure of 5 counterfeit stamp papers and 3 CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 &
259/18 seals, the Counsel for the appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan, submitted the similar
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 14
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
arguments, which were advanced by the Counsel for the appellant Vinod Verma. The only
distinction between the case of the appellant Vinod Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan is that
Mahendra Singh Chauhan didnot appear as a defence witness.
38. By referring to para 14 of the evidence of N.K. Upadhayaya (P.W.30), it is submitted by the
Counsel for the appellant Mahendra Singh Yadav, that he was arrested on 20-3-2007 at about 17:25,
Ex.P.4, whereas the confessional statement was recorded at 15:30, thus, it is clear that Mahendra
Singh Chauhan was not in custody at the time of recording of confessional statement. Considered
the submission made by the Counsel for the appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan.
39. Section 27 of Evidence Act reads as under :
"27. How much of information received from accused may be proved.--Provided that,
when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received
from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of
such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to
the fact thereby discovered, may be proved."
40. The word "arrest" and the word "custody" are two different words and denotes two different
situations and cannot be clubbed together. The Supreme Court in the case of Vikram Singh v. State
of Punjab reported in (2010) 3 SCC 56 has held as under :
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 "40. In State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya
this is what a Constitution Bench had to say while examining the scope and
applicability of Section 27. The Bench relying on the observations made by the Privy
Council in Pakala Narayana Swami v. King Emperor observed as under: (Deoman
Upadhyaya case, AIR pp. 1128-29, para 7) "7. Section 27 of the Evidence Act is one of
a group of sections relating to the relevancy of certain forms of admissions made by
persons accused of offences. Sections 24 to 30 of the Act deal with admissibility of
confessions i.e. of statements made by a person stating or suggesting that he has
committed a crime. By Section 24, in a criminal proceeding against a person, a
confession made by him is inadmissible if it appears to the court to have been caused
by inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge and proceeding
from a person in authority. By Section 25, there is an absolute ban against proof at
the trial of a person accused of an offence, of a confession made to a police officer.
The ban which is partial under Section 24 and complete under Section 25 applies
equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a
criminal trial was at the time of making the confession in custody. For the ban to be
effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the
confession. The expression, 'accused person' in Section 24 and the expression 'a
person accused of any offence' have the same connotation, and describe the person
against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding. As observed in
Pakala Narayana Swami v. King Emperor, by the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 15
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
(AIR p. 52) '... Section 25 covers a confession made to a police officer before any
investigation has begun or otherwise not in the course of an investigation.'
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 The adjectival clause 'accused of any offence'
is therefore descriptive of the person against whom a confessional statement made by
him is declared not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that person at the
time of making the statement for the applicability of the ban. Section 26 of the
Evidence Act by its first paragraph provides: '26. Confession by accused while in
custody of police not to be proved against him.--No confession made by any person
whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it be made in the immediate
presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.' By this section, a
confession made by a person who is in custody is declared not provable unless it is
made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate. Whereas Section 25 prohibits proof
of a confession made by a person to a police officer whether or not at the time of
making the confession, he was in custody, Section 26 prohibits proof of a confession
by a person in custody made to any person unless the confession is made in the
immediate presence of a Magistrate. Section 27 which is in the form of a proviso
states:
'27. How much of information received from accused may be proved.--Provided that,
when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received
from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of
such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to
the fact thereby discovered, may be proved.' The expression, 'accused of any offence'
in Section 27, as in Section 25, is also descriptive of the person concerned i.e. against
a person who is accused of an offence, Section 27 renders provable certain statements
made by him while he was in the custody of a police officer. Section 27 is founded on
the principle that even though the evidence relating to confessional or other
statements made by a person, whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, is tainted
and therefore CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 inadmissible, if the truth of the
information given by him is assured by the discovery of a fact, it may be presumed to
be untainted and is therefore declared provable insofar as it distinctly relates to the
fact thereby discovered. Even though Section 27 is in the form of a proviso to Section
26, the two sections do not necessarily deal with evidence of the same character. The
ban imposed by Section 26 is against the proof of confessional statements. Section 27
is concerned with the proof of information whether it amounts to a confession or not,
which leads to discovery of facts. By Section 27, even if a fact is deposed to as
discovered in consequence of information received, only that much of the
information is admissible as distinctly relates to the fact discovered. By Section 26, a
confession made in the presence of a Magistrate is made provable in its entirety."
41. Mr Sharan has, however, referred us to Section 46(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to argue
that till the appellants had been arrested in accordance with the aforesaid provision they could not
be said to be in police custody. We see that Section 46 deals with "arrest how made". We are of the
opinion that the word "arrest" used in Section 46 relates to a formal arrest whereas Section 27 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 16
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
Evidence Act talks about custody of a person accused of an offence. In the present case the
appellants were undoubtedly put under formal arrest on 15-2-2005 whereas the recoveries had been
made prior to that date but admittedly, also, they were in police custody and accused of an offence at
the time of their apprehension on 14-2-2005.
42. Moreover, in the light of the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Deoman Upadhyaya case
and the observation that the words in Section 27 "accused of any offence" are descriptive of the
person making the statement, the submission that this section would be operable only after formal
arrest under Section 46(1) of the Code, cannot be accepted. This argument does not merit any
further discussion."
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
41. Thus, it is clear that although the appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan was formally arrested
after the making of confessional statement and recovery, but as he was an accused of an offence and
was under custody, therefore, the recovery cannot be said to be bad being contrary to Section 27 of
Evidence Act.
42. Vinod Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan were arrested on the same day from different
places. N.L. Upadhayaya (P.W.30) has stated that the appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan had
produced 5 counterfeit stamp paper and 3 seals from his house.
43. By a detailed discussion, this Court has already come to a conclusion that the evidence of N.K.
Upadhayaya (P.W.30) is reliable, and therefore, it is held that the prosecution has succeeded in
establishing beyond reasonable doubt, that 5 counterfeit stamp papers and 3 seals were seized from
the possession of the appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan vide seizure-memo, Ex. P.10.
44. It is next contended by the Counsel for the appellants that no seizure was made from the
appellant Vinod Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan, in the presence of independent witnesses,
therefore, the seizure is doubtful.
45. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the appellants.
46. It is well established principle of law that non-examination of independent witnesses by the
prosecution, would not give any dent to CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 the prosecution
case.
47. The Supreme Court in the case of Sadhu Saran Singh Vs. State of U.P. reported in (2016) 4 SCC
357 has held as under :
"29. As far as the non-examination of any other independent witness is concerned,
there is no doubt that the prosecution has not been able to produce any independent
witness. But, the prosecution case cannot be doubted on this ground alone. In these
days, civilised people are generally insensitive to come forward to give any statement
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 17
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
in respect of any criminal offence. Unless it is inevitable, people normally keep away
from the court as they find it distressing and stressful. Though this kind of human
behaviour is indeed unfortunate, but it is a normal phenomena. We cannot ignore
this handicap of the investigating agency in discharging their duty. We cannot derail
the entire case on the mere ground of absence of independent witness as long as the
evidence of the eyewitness, though interested, is trustworthy."
48. The Supreme Court in the case of Jodhan Vs. State of M.P. reported in (2015) 11 SCC 52 has held
as under :
"35. Another limb of submission which has been propounded by Mr Sharma is that
the prosecution has deliberately not examined other independent material witnesses
who were present at the spot and, therefore, the whole case of prosecution becomes
unacceptable. In this context, it would be profitable to refer to what has been held in
State of H.P. v. Gian Chand. In the said case, the three-Judge Bench has opined that:
(SCC p. 81, para 14) "14. ... Non-examination of a material witness is again not a
mathematical formula for discarding the weight of the testimony available on record
howsoever natural, trustworthy and convincing it may be. The charge of withholding
a material witness from the court levelled against the CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 &
259/18 prosecution should be examined in the background of the facts and
circumstances of each case so as to find whether the witnesses are available for being
examined in the court and were yet withheld by the prosecution."
It has been further ruled therein that the court is required to first consider and assess the credibility
of the evidence available on record and if the court finds that the evidence adduced is worthy of
credence, the testimony has to be accepted and acted upon though there may be other witnesses
available, who could also have been examined but not examined.
36. In Takhaji Hiraji v. Thakore Kubersing Chamansing, it has been opined that if the material
witness, who unfolds the genesis of the incident or an essential part of the prosecution case, not
convincingly brought to the fore otherwise, or where there is a gap or infirmity in the prosecution
case which could have been supplied or made good by examining a witness who though available is
not examined, the prosecution case can be termed as suffering from a deficiency and withholding of
such a material witness would oblige the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution,
but if there is an overwhelming evidence available, and which can be placed reliance upon,
non-examination of such other witnesses may not be material. Similarly, in Dahari v. State of U.P.,
while dwelling upon the issue of non-examination of material witnesses, it has been succinctly
expressed that when the witness is not the only competent witness, who would have been fully
capable of explaining the factual score correctly and the prosecution stood fully corroborated by the
medical evidence and the testimony of other reliable witnesses, it would be inappropriate to draw an
adverse inference against the prosecution."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 18
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
49. Thus, it is held that merely because the investigating agnecy had not made seizure in presence of
any independent witness, the prosecution case cannot be thrown overboard.
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
50. It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellants Vinod Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan,
that as there is no evidence that the appellants had counterfeited the Stamp Papers or made any
counterfeit stamp paper or sold any Counterfeit Govt. Stamp or had effaced any Govt. Stamp,
therefore, their conviction under Sections 255,257,258 and 261 I.P.C. is bad. Considered the
submissions made by the Counsel for the appellants. This Court has already come to a conclusion
that the seizure of 7 and 5 counterfeit stamp papers from the possession of appellant Vinod Verma
and Mahendra Singh Chauhan has been proved. Although the appellant Vinod Verma had appeared
as a defence witness, but he has not explained as to how he came in possession of the counterfeit
stamp papers. Similarly, the appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan has failed to explain his possession
of Counterfeit Stamp papers. Under these circumstances, it can be said that the appellants Vinod
Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan had also committed offence under Sections 255,257,258 and
261 I.P.C.
Whether the stamp papers seized from the possession of Appellants Vinod Verma and Mahendra
Singh Chauhan were Counterfeit Stamps or not?
51. Counterfeit Stamp Papers which are marked as Article 10 to 15 were seized from the possession
of appellant Mahendra Singh Chauhan whereas Counterfeit Stamp Papers which are marked as
Article A-19 to 25 were seized from the appellant Vinod Verma.
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 These counterfeit stamp papers were sent for examination.
V.P. Kamlaskar (P.W.28), Chief Manager, Security Printing Press, Hyderabad has stated that the
stamp papers were found to be fake/counterfeit. The report is Ex. P.39. Challenging the evidence of
V.P. Kamlaskar (P.W.28), it is submitted by the Counsel for the appellants, that this witness has not
clarified as to how he came to the conclusion that the stamp papers were counterfeit. He has tried to
avoid the questions by saying that it is secret and cannot be disclosed. This witness has stated that
the counterfeit stamp papers were examined by comparing with the original stamp papers, but
declined to disclose the differences on the ground that the same is secret. It is submitted by the
Counsel for the appellants that thus, the prosecution has failed to prove that the stamp papers seized
from the possession of the appellants were counterfeit stamp papers. Considered the submissions
made by the Counsel for the appellants. In para 5 of his cross-examination, this witness has
admitted that he has not pointed out the differences between the original stamp papers and the
counterfeit stamp papers. However, it was clarified by this witness on his own that since, the report
is a secret report, therefore, the differences were not mentioned. In the considered opinion of this
Court, the answer given by this witness was correct. In order to disclose the differences between the
original stamp paper and the counterfeit stamp paper, this witness was required to explain in detail
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 about the security features of the original stamp papers, and
according to this witness, the same is secret. Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion, that the
report Ex. P.39 given by this witness, clearly establishes that the stamp papers seized from the

possession of the appellants were counterfeit stamp papers. Seizure of seal from the appellant
Rakesh Garg
52. According to prosecution story, one seal was seized from the possession of appellant Rakesh
Garg by seizure-memo Ex. P.20. The impression of the said seal was also affixed on the
seizure-memo, Ex.P.20 and according to the impression, the said seal was of Asstt. Treasury Officer,
Moti Mahal Treasury, Gwalior. Udai Pratap Singh (P.W.10) who is the seizure witness, has
supported the prosecution story and has stated that Rakesh Garg was arrested by arrest memo Ex.
P.19 and the seal, Article 36 was seized from his possession by seizure-memo, Ex. P.20. This witness
was cross examined in detail, however, nothing could be elicited from this witness, which may make
his evidence unreliable. It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant, that the prosecution has not
examined Bhagwanlal who was the another seizure witness, therefore, an adverse inference should
be drawn against the prosecution, and secondly the seal was not sent for examination. Considered
the submissions made by the Counsel for the appellant Rakesh Garg. Udai Pratap Singh (P.W.10)
has supported the prosecution story in toto. It is well established principle of law CRA-6426/17,
124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 that it is the quality of the witness which matters and not the quantity. The
Supreme Court in the case of Yanob Sheikh Vs. State of W.B. reported in (2013) 6 SCC 428 has held
as under :
"20. We must notice at this stage that it is not always the quantity but the quality of
the prosecution evidence that weighs with the court in determining the guilt of the
accused or otherwise. The prosecution is under the responsibility of bringing its case
beyond reasonable doubt and cannot escape that responsibility. In order to prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt, the evidence produced by the prosecution has to be
qualitative and may not be quantitative in nature. In Namdeo v. State of
Maharashtra, the Court held as under:
(SCC p. 161, para 28) "28. From the aforesaid discussion, it is clear that Indian legal
system does not insist on plurality of witnesses. Neither the legislature (Section 134
of the Evidence Act, 1872) nor the judiciary mandates that there must be particular
number of witnesses to record an order of conviction against the accused. Our legal
system has always laid emphasis on value, weight and quality of evidence rather than
on quantity, multiplicity or plurality of witnesses. It is, therefore, open to a
competent court to fully and completely rely on a solitary witness and record
conviction.
Conversely, it may acquit the accused in spite of testimony of several witnesses if it is not satisfied
about the quality of evidence. The bald contention that no conviction can be recorded in case of a
solitary eyewitness, therefore, has no force and must be negatived."
(emphasis in original)
21. Similarly, in Bipin Kumar Mondal v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130738893/ 20
Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
State of W.B., this Court took the view: (SCC p. 99, para 31) "31. ... In fact, it is not the number [and]
quantity, but the quality that is CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 material. The
time-honoured principle is that evidence has to be weighed and not counted.
The test is whether the evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, credible and trustworthy [and
reliable]."
53. Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion, that non- examination of another witness of
seizure namely Bhagwanlal would not give any dent to the prosecution case.
54. It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant Rakesh Garg, that since, the seal was not sent for
examination, therefore, it cannot be held that a forged seal was seized from the possession of the
appellant Rakesh Garg. However, during the course of argument, it was accepted, that the
impression of seal was also taken on the seizure memo Ex. P/20 and it has also been accepted that
the appellant Rakesh Garg, had no authority to keep the said official seal in his possession. He has
not explained as to how, he came in possession of the said seal. Thus, it is held that the prosecution
has succeeded in establishing that the seal of Asstt. Treasury Officer, Treasury Office, Moti Mahal,
Gwalior was seized from the possession of the appellant Rakesh Garg.
Seizure of Register as well as evidence against the appellant Vinod Singh Yadav, Stamp Vendor
55. The appellant Vinod Singh Yadav, was undipustedly having license of Stamp Vendor and was
carrying on his business in the High Court premises.
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
56. The allegations are that during verification, the registry of this Court got suspicious about some
stamp papers, and therefore, an enquiry was got done from the Treasury Office, Gwalior and it was
reported by the Treasury Office, that the stamp papers are fake. Accordingly, a request was made to
the Collector, Gwalior to take action and in its turn, the office of Collector, Gwalior instructed the
Superintendent of Police, Gwalior to take action and accordingly, F.I.R. was lodged.
57. 59 suspicious stamp papers were made available by the High Court to the investigating officer
out of which 51 have been found to be counterfeit stamp papers. Poonam Soni (P.W.13) was declared
hostile and in cross-examination by the Public Prosecutor, She has admitted that the stamp papers,
Article 26 to Article 33 were purchased by her from Vinod Singh Yadav. It was also admitted by this
witness that Vinod Singh Yadav is a stamp vendor and is doing business in the Court premises. The
appellant was also identified by this witness in the dock. Thus, it is clear that the prosecution has
succeeded in establishing the fact that counterfeit Stamp Papers Article 26 to Article 33 were sold by
Vinod Singh Yadav. It was also admitted by this witness that counterfeit stamp papers i.e., Article 26
and Article 28 were filed in a Writ Petition (Pramesh Chaturvedi Vs. State of M.P.) and Article
27,29,30 were filed in a case of Sanjeev Dwivedi Vs. State of M.P. and Counterfeit stamp papers i.e.,
Article CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 31 to 33 were filed in the case of Krishna Gopal
Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and all these cases were filed by the office of Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi.

Mahendra Singh Chauhan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 10 May, 2019
Neeraj Shrivastava (P.W.7), who is also a practicising lawyer, had admitted that counterfeit stamp
paper, Article 34 was purchased by him, but he didnot disclose that from whom he had purchased
the said stamp paper. He was declared hostile and in cross- examination by the Public Prosecutor,
he admitted that the seal and signature of the stamp vendor has been affixed on the stamp paper.
Further, it is clear from sale register, Article 6 seizued from the possession of the appellant Vinod
Singh Yadav, there is a clear mention that a stamp papers were sold to Shri Neeraj Shrivastava,
Advocate (PW-7).
58. Vide seizure-memo, Ex. P.8, 4 stamp papers, stamp sale register and license were seized from
the possession of the appellant Vinod Singh Verma. The Stamp Sale Register, has been proved by
Rakesh Shrivastava (P.W.4) and it is marked as Article A 6. In the said Stamp Sale Register, there is
mention of certain serial No.s of the Stamp Papers which were sold to Poonam Soni. Thus, the
evidence of Poonam Soni (P.W. 13) that stamp papers were purchased from the appellant Vinod
Singh Yadav, finds full corroboration.
59. Thus, it is clear that not only the seizure of counterfeit stamp papers as well as seizure of seal
from the possession of the appellants Vinod Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan has been proved
by the CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18 prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, but it has also
been proved that the said stamp papers were counterfeit stamp papers. No explanation has been
given by the appellants Vinod Verma and Mahendra Singh Chauhan, as to how they came in
possession of the same. Similarly, Rakesh Garg has not given any explanation as to how he came in
possession of the seal of Asstt. Treasury Officer. Similarly, the prosecution has succeeded in
establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant Vinod Singh Yadav, had sold the
counterfeit stamp papers. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion, that the prosecution
has established the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly, the appellant
Rakesh Garg is held guilty of committing offence under Section 256 of I.P.C. and the appellants
Mahendra Singh Chauhan, Vinod Verma and Vinod Singh Yadav are held guilty of committing
offence under Sections 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 261, 420 ,467, 468, 471,472 of I.P.C. and under
Section 69 of Indian Stamp Paper Act read with Rule 39 of M.P Stamp Paper Rules.
60. So far as the question of sentence is concerned, this Court is of the view that the Trial Court has
already adopted a very lenient view, because by counterfeiting the Govt. Stamp, the appellants have
tried to weaken the Indian Economy. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion, that the
sentence awarded by the Trial Court does not call for any interference.
CRA-6426/17, 124/18, 181/18 & 259/18
61. Resultantly, the Judgment and Sentence dated 22-12-2017 passed by VIIth A.S.J., Gwalior in
Sessions Trial No. 195 of 2007 is hereby affirmed.
62. The appellants are in jail.
63. These appeals fail and are hereby Dismissed.
