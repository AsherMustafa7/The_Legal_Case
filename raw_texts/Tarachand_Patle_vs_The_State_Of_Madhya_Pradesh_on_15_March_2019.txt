Jabalpur, Dated : 15-03-2019
Shri Vasant R. Daniel, Advocate for the appellant.
Shri Satyam Agrawal, Advocate for the respondent/Lokayukta.
Heard on admission.
Appeal is arguable, hence admitted for final hearing. Also heard on I.A. No.4223/2019, an
application under section 389(1) of the Cr.P.C.
The appellant has been convicted for the offence punishable under Sections 7, 13(1)(d) r.w. 13(2) of
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and sentenced to the maximum period of four years R.I. with
total fine of Rs.10,000/- alongwith default stipulations.
As per prosecution case, the appellant is a Government Servant and he was posted as District
Education Officer at Seoni. It is alleged against the appellant that he demanded illegal gratification
of Rs.25,000/- from the complainant Vijay Kedare through co-accused Prakash Chandra
Kamleshiya.
The complainant lodged a complaint in this regard before the Lokayukta Police, Jabalpur against the
appellant and co-accused. Thereafter, co-accused Prakashchand was caught red handed. After
investigation, challan has been filed.
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant has been falsely implicated in this case.
He was on bail during the trial and he did not misuse the liberty granted to him. It is alleged against
the appellant that he demanded a sum of Rs.25,000/- from the complainant. He did not receive any
amount from the complainant and no recovery has been made from the appellant. There are
material contradictions or omissions in the statement of witnesses. There are fair chances of success
of this appeal and if application of the appellant is not accepted then, appeal filed by him may turn 2
CRA-2003-2019 infructuous. Under these circumstances, the appellant prays for bail and
suspension of jail sentence.
Learned counsel for the respondent opposes the application. Keeping in view the submissions made
by learned counsel for the parties and looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the
view that the appellant may be enlarged on bail, consequently, I.A. No.4223/2019 is hereby allowed.
