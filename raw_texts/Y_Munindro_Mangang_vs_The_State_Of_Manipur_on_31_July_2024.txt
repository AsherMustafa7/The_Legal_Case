the Government of Manipur issued O.M. dated 10.09.2020 thereby ordering that the crucial date for
determining the eligibility criteria for promotion of all posts under the State Government would be
as per applicable Recruitment Rules of the said Service/Post. It was further included in the said
memorandum that if the RRs are silent, the crucial date for the aforesaid purpose would be 1 st April

Mr. Anjan Prasad Sahu, learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the following decisions along
with its relevant portions:
(a) 2022 Livelaw(SC) 553; Krishna Rai(Dead) through LRs & ors vs. Benaras Hindu
University through Registrar & ors.
"22. Page No. 6 - However, the Division Bench fell in error in applying the principle
of estoppel that the appellants having appeared in the interview and being
unsuccessful proceeded to challenge the same and on the ground alone, allowed the
appeals, set aside the judgment of the Learned Single Judge. The Division bench
having approved the reasoning of the Learned Single Judge, ought not to have
interfered in the judgment of the Learned Single on a technical plea. The Division
Bench ought to have considered that the appellants were Class IV employees working
from 1977 onwards and expecting them to have raised serious objection or protest at
the stage of interview and understanding the principles of changing the Rules of the
game, was too far fetched, unreasonable and unwarranted.

WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro Mangang v. State of Manipur & Ors Page 10 [13] Mr. Shyam
Sharma, learned G.A submitted that by the present writ petition, the petitioner challenged the
proceedings of the Departmental Promotion Committee and the impugned order dated 13.04.2022

31.08.2022 giving promotion with retrospective effect from 12.01.2022 as done in the case of the
private respondents who were recommended against the clear vacancy. After acceptance of the
promotion to the post of Executive Engineer, the main relief for the petitioner has become
infructuous and he cannot challenge the DPC proceedings which recommended him for promotion

Mangang v. State of Manipur & Ors Page 13 that the promotee Assistant Engineers who were
promoted on 29.12.2016 will be eligible on 29.12.2019 as per the failing clause and hence, their
crucial date will be on 01.04.2020. It is submitted that the promotion of the direct recruit Assistant
Engineers was against the recruitment rules and the relevant O.M. of 2020. [17] Mr. H.S Paonam,
learned senior counsel for respondent Nos. 7 and 11 (who are some of the direct recruit Assistant

(promotee Assistant Engineers who are represented by Mr. Y. Nirmolchand, learned senior counsel)
could not challenge the three promotion orders dated 13.04.2022 by which they were also promoted
to the post of Executive Engineer. It is pointed out that the private respondents (Promotee Assistant
Engineers) have not filed any writ petition challenging the impugned orders dated 13.04.2022 and
DPC proceedings. They cannot challenge the promotion of the direct recruit Assistant Engineers to
the post of Executive Engineer and they were also promoted by the same orders. Learned senior
counsel further submits that writ petition has become infructuous after the appointment of the

promotion to the post of Executive Engineer has been satisfied by this subsequent development i.e.
orders dated 31.08.2022 giving the same date of retrospective promotion as done in the case of
others. Hence, the petitioner has not suffered any disability or loss in the length of service. After

Munindro Mangang v. State of Manipur & Ors Page 14 petitioner, the cause in the writ petition does
not survive any longer and it is barred by the of principle of approbate and reprobate. It is submitted
that it is the settled proposition of law that a person cannot partly challenge the impugned order and
accept some part. It is urged that a writ petition may be dismissed on this ground alone.
[18] On merit, Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for respondent Nos. 7 and 11 submitted that
the crucial date as per OM dated 15.05.2014 is 1st October of the recruitment year. For vacancy
arising in the year 2019-20, the crucial date for considering the eligibility will be 1st October in

crucial date of 1st April 2020 as per O.M. dated 10.09.2020 would not be applicable in case of the
vacancies arising in the year 2019-20.
[20] Mr. H.S Paonam, learned senior counsel for the promotees further submitted that even if the
O.M. of 2020 prescribing crucial date on 1st April is to be accepted for the sake of argument, the
direct recruit Assistant Engineers will be eligible in terms of the Rules 7(iv) of Manipur Civil
Engineering Service(PWD), Rules 2016 and the relevant portion is reproduced as under:

are not short of the requisite qualifying or eligibility service by more than half of such
qualifying or eligibility service or two years, whichever is less."

Assistant Engineers are considered eligible in terms of the failing clause, the senior direct recruit
Assistant Engineer are to be considered in terms of the provisions of Sub-rule(iv) of Rule 7. Hence, if
the argument of the petitioner that O.M. of 2020 which prescribed crucial date as 1st April is
accepted, the direct recruit Assistant Engineers are also otherwise eligible for promotion to the post
of Executive Engineer. It is submitted that the direct recruit Assistant Engineers are eligible both
under the OMs of 2014 and 2020 notwithstanding the crucial date falls on 1st April or 1st October of
the recruitment year. [22] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for respondent Nos.7 and 11

reprobate and the relevant portions are reproduced as follows:-

Sadananda Halo and Mohd. Mustafa. Reliance was also placed on D. Sarojakumari v.
R. Helen Thilakom, (2017) 9 SCC 478. That in WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro
Mangang v. State of Manipur & Ors Page 16 the present case, none of the writ
petitioners was selected on merit and they were not even on the waiting list,
therefore, the writ petitions filed by them were not maintainable on the ground of the
same being devoid of any locus.
"67. Thus, Courts while exercising the power of judicial review cannot step into the
shoes of the Selection Committee or assume an appellate role to examine whether the
marks awarded by the Selection Committee in the viva- voce are excessive and not
corresponding to their performance in such test. The assessment and evaluation of
the performance of candidates appearing before the Selection Committee/Interview
Board should be best left to the members of the committee. In light of the position
that a Court cannot sit in appeal against the decision taken pursuant to a reasonably
sound selection process, the following grounds raised by the writ petitioners, which
are based on an attack of subjective criteria employed by the selection
board/interview panel in assessing the sustainability of candidates, namely, (i)that
the candidates who had done their post-graduation had been awarded 10 marks and
in the viva-voce, such PG candidates had been granted either 18 marks or 20 marks
out of 20. (ii) that although the writ petitioners had performed exceptionally well in
the interview, the authorities had acted in an arbitrary manner while carrying out the
selection process, would not hold any water. "69. It is therefore trite that candidates,
having taken part in the selection process without any demur or protest, cannot
challenge the same after having been declared unsuccessful. The candidates cannot
approbate and reprobate at the same time. In other words, simply because the result
of the selection process is not palatable to a candidate, he cannot allege that the
process of interview was unfair or that there was some lacuna in the process.
Therefore, we find that the writ petitioners in these cases, could not have questioned
before a Court of law, the rationale behind recasting the selection criteria, as they
willingly took part in the selection process even after the criteria had been so recast.
Their candidature was not withdrawn in light of the amended criteria. A challenge
was thrown against the same only after they had been declared unsuccessful in the
selection process, at which stage, the challenge ought not to have been entertained in
light of the principle of waiver and acquiescence.

Paonam, learned senior counsel for some of the direct recruit Assistant Engineers
and has opposed the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner as well as Mr. Y.
Nirmolchand, learned senior counsel for some of the promotee Assistant Engineers.
Mr. Julius Riamei learned counsel, has raised the points of maintainability of the writ
petition and says that the writ petition is not maintainable and has become
infructuous as the petitioner was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer during
pendency of the writ petition vide order dated 31.08.2022 on the basis of the
recommendation of the same DPC and he has accepted his promotion and his
seniority was fixed by the said order. It is further clarified that the petitioner is also
given promotion from the same date of effective, i.e, from 12.01.2022 as done in the
other respondents who were recommended against the clear vacancy.
[24] Mr. D Julius Riamei has also relied upon the recent judgement and order of the
Hon'ble apex Court in the cases of R.N.Gosain Vs.Yashpal Dhir reported in (1992) 4
Supreme Court Cases 683 and State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Srikant Chaphekar
reported in (1992) Supreme Court Cases 689.
WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro Mangang v. State of Manipur & Ors Page 18 [25]
Mr. Anjan Prasad Sahu, learned counsel for the petitioner has rebutted the plea of the
Mr. H.S. Paonam, learned senior counsel for the direct recruit Assistant Engineers to
the fact that the recruitment rules applicable on the date of recruitment will be
considered by the DPC and not the relevant Rules at the time of arising of the vacancy
and it is clarified that OM of 2020 which prescribed crucial date of 1st April will be
attracted in the present case as the DPC was conducted in the year 2022. Since the
direct recruit Assistant Engineer did not have requisite 6(six) years regular service in
the grade of Assistant Engineer as on 01.04.2020 they are not eligible for considering
against the vacancies arising in the year 2019- 20 in terms of the O.M. 19.09.2020.
The O.M. dated 19.09.2020 also supersedes all others O.M. including the O.M. dated
15.05.2014. Hence, the direct recruit Assistant Engineers are not eligible for
promotion against the vacancy arising in the year 2019-20. Reliance is placed in the
recent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Himachal
Pradesh v. Raj Kumar : (2023) 3 SCC 773 holding the appointment is to be made as
per the rules prevailing on the date of consideration.
[26] This Court has considered pleadings of the parties and the submission made at
the bar and the relevant law in this regard for deciding the issue involved in the
present writ petition, the following points of determination are framed by this Court.
(a) Whether a person can challenge a portion of the recommendations of the
departmental proceedings after he has subsequently accepted the recommendation
made by the DPC WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro Mangang v. State of Manipur
& Ors Page 19 for his promotion in terms of the principles of approbate and
reprobate?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176793960/ 11
Y. Munindro Mangang vs The State Of Manipur on 31 July, 2024
(b) If so, whether the relevant rule for deciding crucial date of for promotion should
be date of vacancy or date of recruitment?
[27] From the record of the case, it is seen that the DPC meeting held on 12.01.2022 has considered
the case of the petitioner as well as private respondents for promotion to the posts of Executive
Engineer in PWD, Manipur. [28] As per relevant recruitment rules, it is 6(six) years of regular
service in the grade of Assistant Engineer for degree holders, 9(nine) years for diploma holders, 6/7
years for AMIE certificate holders. In case none is available, by the failing clause, an Assistant
Engineer who has a combined length of 17(seventeen) years of regular service in the grade of
Assistant Engineers and Section Officer out of which 3(three) years regular service in the grade of
Assistant Engineer is eligible for promotion to the post of Executive Engineer. As per of OM dated
15.05.2014, the crucial date for deciding the eligibility criteria is 1st October of the recruitment year
and as per the O.M. dated 10.09.2020 it is 1st April of the recruitment years. For the vacancy arising
in the year 2019-20, the DPC considered the O.M. dated 15.05.2014 and held that the direct recruit
Assistant Engineers of 2014 and the promotee Assistant Engineers of 2016 batch were eligible for
promotion in terms of the main rule i.e. 6(six) years regular service for direct recruit degree holders
and failing clause of 17(seventeen) years for the promotee Assistant Engineers of 2016 batch.
Accordingly, vide the three orders all dated 13.04.2022 and on the recommendation of the DPC, 38
(thirty-eight) Assistant Engineers were promoted WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro Mangang v.
State of Manipur & Ors Page 20 to the posts of Executive Engineer. Since the names of the petitioner
and another were kept in seal covered by the DPC due to their involvement in criminal case and his
name was not included in the list of promoted officers, the petitioner challenged the impugned
orders dated 13.04.2022 along with the proceedings of the Departmental Promotion Committee on
the ground that he was eligible and the direct recruit Assistant Engineers were not eligible for
promotion to the post of Executive Engineer in terms of the office memorandum dated 10.09.2020
which prescribed 1st April as crucial date for considering herein the eligibility criteria. It is alleged
that the direct recruit Assistant Engineers did not complete 6(six) years regular service as on
01.04.2020 as they were only appointed on 08.09.2014. However, after the closure of the criminal
case against the petitioner, he was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer vide order dated
31.08.2022 giving retrospective effect from 12.01.2022 (as done in the case of other candidates
recommended by the DPC against the clear vacancy) and the petitioner accepted the promotion. In
spite of raising objection by the respondents of the maintainability of the writ petition by the
subsequent event of his acceptance of the promotion to the post of Executive Engineer, the
petitioner still insists that writ petition is still maintainable as the direct recruit Assistant Engineers
were not eligible and cannot be promoted to the post of Executive Engineer.
[29] Learned Counsel for the respondents have raised the maintainability of the writ petition on the
principle of approbate and reprobate to the effect that once WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro
Mangang v. State of Manipur & Ors Page 21 a person has participated in the selection process and
accepted the result of the committee, he/she cannot challenge the departmental proceedings. [30]
On perusal of the case record, it is clear that the petitioner challenged the three impugned orders all
dated 13.04.2022 by filing the present writ petition on 24.05.2022, as his name was not included in
any of the three impugned promotion orders. The petitioner was perhaps under the assumption that
he was not considered for promotion by the DPC and this is why the petitioner prayed in the petition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176793960/ 12
Y. Munindro Mangang vs The State Of Manipur on 31 July, 2024
in the prayer no. (iii) for issuing a writ in the nature of mandamus directing to appoint him and
others on promotion to the post of Executive Engineers for the vacancy year 2019-2020 with all
consequential benefits. Additionally, the petitioner also prayed for quashing the promotion orders of
the private respondents. No reason is given in the prayer for quashing the promotion of promotee
Assistant Engineers of 2016 batch (like the petitioner herein) who are other wise eligible under the
'failing clause'. At the time of the filing of the writ petition, the petitioner was not aware of the fact
that his name was also recommended by the DPC, but kept under sealed cover due to his
involvement in criminal case. Due to this lack of information, the writ petition was filed
immediately. If the petitioner knew that he was also recommended by the DPC and his
recommendation was kept under sealed cover, he would have made representation for opening the
sealed cover. However, upon opening of the sealed cover after closure of criminal case, the petitioner
was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer vide order dated 31.08.2022 during the pendency of
the writ petition giving retrospective effect from WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro Mangang v.
State of Manipur & Ors Page 22 12.01.2022 as done in the case of private respondents
recommended against clear vacancies. It is not in dispute that the petitioner has accepted his
promotion to the post of Executive Engineer.
[31] This Court is of the considered opinion that upon his acceptance of the promotion order dated
31.08.2022, the main relief for the petitioner for his promotion to the post of Executive Engineer
has been satisfied. After his acceptance of the promotion order on the recommendations of the DPC,
the petitioner can no longer agitate the writ petition for quashing the proceedings of the DPC
recommending him and other private respondents for promotion to the posts of Executive Engineer.
The same will be against the settled principle of approbate and reprobate.
[32] In the case of Workmen v. Food Corpn. of India: (2023) 8 SCC 116, Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that a person cannot accept and reject the same thing. Para 16 is reproduced below:
16. In Union of India v. N. Murugesan: (2022) 2 SCC 25, this Court pointed out that
the phrases "approbate" and "reprobate" mean that no party can be allowed to accept
and reject the same thing, as the principle behind the doctrine of election is in-built
in the concept of approbate and reprobate, that is, a person cannot be allowed to have
the benefit of an instrument while questioning the same. It was noted that an element
of fair play is in-built in this principle and it is a species of estoppel dealing with the
conduct of a party.
[33] In view of the settled principles law of approbate and reprobate, the petitioner upon his
acceptance of the subsequent promotion to the post of the WP(C)No.386 of 2022: Y. Munindro
Mangang v. State of Manipur & Ors Page 23 Executive Engineer on the same recommendations of
the DPC along with the case of other private respondents, he cannot agitate the writ petition
challenging the recommendations of the DPC and promotion orders of the private respondents.
Accordingly, the answer to the first issue is answered in negative. Since the first issue is decided
against the petition, the second issue is not required to be dealt in the present petition.

Y. Munindro Mangang vs The State Of Manipur on 31 July, 2024
[34] In the circumstances, the writ petition is dismissed as barred by the principles of approbate and
reprobate. Parties are to bear their own costs.
