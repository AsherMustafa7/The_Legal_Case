IN THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
AT JABALPUR
WP No. 1967 of 2023
(PRADEEP SINGH TOMAR Vs MADHYA PRADESH KARMCHAARI CHAYAN MANDAL BHOPAL AND
OTHERS)
Dated : 25-01-2023
Shri Surendra Verma - Advocate for the petitioner.
Shri Piyush Dharmadhikari - Advocate for the State.
In the present petition, challenge is to non-grant of relaxation in the
maximum age to the petitioner who claims to belong to EWS category and is an
aspirant for various posts advertised vide Advertisement No.32/2022
(Annexure-P/2), in which the last date for submitting application form was
19.01.2023.
The question as to whether the relaxation in maximum age available to
SC/ST and OBC can be claimed by EWS category candidates, is required to
be adjudicated in this case.
Since the petitioner has approached this Court by filing this petition on
19.01.2023 which was before expiry of last date (19.01.2023) for submission of
application forms vide Annexure-P/2, this Court is inclined to entertain this
petition.
The petitioner, on the last date of submission of application form i.e. on
19.01.2023 vide Annexure-P/2, was aged about 45 years 3 months old based on
his date of birth i.e. 28.09.1977. Pertinently, it is pointed out by referring to
clause 9.4(2) and 9.5(iii) of Madhya Pradesh Junior Service (Joint Qualifying)
Examination Rules, 2013 that the relaxation in the maximum age has been
extended to 48 years.
By way of an interim relief, it is directed that the respondent No.1 shall
open the portal only to accept the application form of the petitioner on-line, if the same is submitted
within 2 days latest by 04:00 p.m. on 28.01.2023.
The candidature of the petitioner, if received as aforesaid, shall be considered but the result shall not
be declared without leave of the Court.
