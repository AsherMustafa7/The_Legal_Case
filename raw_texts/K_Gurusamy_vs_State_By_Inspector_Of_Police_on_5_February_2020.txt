2.The facts of the case are briefly stated hereunder:-
2.(1). The case of the prosecution is that the appellant, who worked as Stamping
Inspector, Srivilliputhur, Virudhunagar District, during the period from 15.05.2003
to 21.09.2005 is a Public Servant, as defined under Section 2 (c) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act. P.W.2 one Jeevanandham, who was having a welding workshop at
Maharajapuram, Virudhunagar District and http://www.judis.nic.in2/32 CRL. A.
(MD) NO. 205 of 2015 was also running a Chicken & mutton stall, for which, he was
using weighing table-scale. On 19.09.2005, he went to the Milk Producers'
Co-operative Society at Watrap, where the Stamping Inspector was camping and at
about 11.00 a.m., approached the appellant for the purpose of stamping his weighing
table-scale. At that time, the appellant demanded Rs.200/- as bribe. P.W.2 informed
that he had not brought the amount and the appellant asked him to come by 05.00
p.m on 20.09.2005 to the same Society.
Since P.W.2 was not inclined to give bribe, on 20.09.2005 at about 10.00 a.m., he had given a
complaint against the appellant to the Additional Superintendent of Police, Vigilance and Anti
Corruption Department, Virudhunagar District, which is marked as Ex.P.2.
2.(2). The complaint was forwarded to one Mr.A.G.Jacob, the Inspector of Police, Vigilance and Anti
Corruption, Virudhunagar, who registered a case in Crime No.7 of 2005, for the offence under
Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. On 20.09.2005, at about 10.00 a.m., P.W.2
went to the Vigilance Office. Thereafter, the Police had enlisted the service of P.W.3 and
P.W.4-public servants to be witness at about 11.00 a.m. The phenolphthalein test was demonstrated
and Entrustment Mahazar / Ex.P.5 was prepared. P.W.4 kept the powdered Two Hundred Rupees

K.Gurusamy vs State By Inspector Of Police on 5 February, 2020
(MD) NO. 205 of 2015 the very same day, at about 02.30 p.m., the trap team comprising P.W.2,
P.W.3 and P.W.4 and the Police team left to Watrap in the two Government vehicles and at about
03.30 p.m., they reached the Milk Producers' Co-operative Society, Watrap. P.W.2 and the official
witness viz., P.W.2 took the weighing table-scale and met the appellant. Due to heavy crowd, the
appellant directed P.W.2 to come to his office at Srivilliputhur to get stamp on the next day.
Thereafter, P.W.2 and P.W.3 along with the trap team reached the Vigilance Office, P.W.2 returned
the trap amount and the trap amount was kept custody in the Vigilance Office, the proceedings were
recorded. Thereafter, On 21.09.2005 at about 08.15 a.m., P.W. 2 reached the Vigilance office
followed by the two official witnesses viz., P.W.3 and P.W.4. The trap amount was handed over to
P.W.2. Again the Entrustment Mahazar / Ex.P.6 was prepared. P.W.2 along with P.W.3, P.W.4 and
trap team went to the appellant's office at about 10.15 a.m. P.W.2 handed over the application form
along with weighing table-scale machine. The weighing table-scale was verified and charge of
Rs.20/- was paid and the receipt was issued. After that, the appellant demanded the bribe amount of
Rs.200/- which was handed over by P.W.2 and the appellant received the same and kept the bribe
amount in his table drawer. Thereafter, P.W.2 and P.W.3 came out of the office at about 12.00 noon
and gave the pre- arranged signal to the trap team, immediately, P.W.4 along with
http://www.judis.nic.in4/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 A.G.Jacob, the Trap Laying Officer and
the trap team entered the office of the appellant, the appellant was sitting in a chair in the Office.
The Inspector of Police introduced himself and the two official witnesses to the Stamping Inspector,
the appellant got perplexed. Thereafter, phenolphthalein test was conducted on both hands of the
appellant and the solution turned pink colour and the sodium carbonate solution was poured in the
bottle, labelled and sealed and thereafter, the Inspector of Police, directed the appellant to produce
the currency notes of Rs.200/-. The appellant took the notes from the table drawer and the numbers
tallied with the numbers already recorded in the Entrustment Mahazar. The Recovery Mahazar was
prepared and the appellant was arrested at about 01.15 p.m. Thereafter, the search was conducted at
the residence of the appellant and on examination of witnesses and on receipt of analysing reports
and after obtaining the sanction order, the charge sheet came to be filed against the appellant.
3. In order to prove the case, on the side of the prosecution as many as 14 witnesses were examined
as PW.1 to PW.14 and 23 documents were marked as Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.23 and three material objects
were marked as M.O.1 to M.O.3. On the side of the accused, no witness was examined nor any
document was marked.
http://www.judis.nic.in5/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015
4. When the appellant was questioned u/s 313 Cr.P.C. about the incriminating circumstances
appearing against him, he denied the same.
5. The learned trial Judge on completing the trial and considering the oral and documentary
evidence and upon hearing both sides, convicted and sentenced the accused as aforesaid, resulting

Submissions:-

K.Gurusamy vs State By Inspector Of Police on 5 February, 2020
6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant made the following submissions:
(cid:128) In the case of trap, vital aspects viz., demand, acceptance and recovery are sin qua
non to prove the charge. In this case, demand and acceptance have not been proved.
The bribe amount is shown to be recovered from the table drawer and not from the
appellant. The appellant was later forced to hand over the bribe amount and hence,
the phenolphthalein test turned positive.
http://www.judis.nic.in6/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 (cid:128) P.W.2 / the decoy had
not supported the case of the prosecution and he was declared hostile.
(cid:128) P.W.3 / accompanying witness, who was examined in chief in part and thereafter,
he could not be examined, since he passed away Hence, there is no evidence to show
that the appellant made any demand and received the bribe amount and there is no
evidence by any means for the actual trap. (cid:128) The Lower Court on a wrong notion,
placing heavy reliance on the evidence of P.W.4, who is the other witness, who had
not accompanied P.W.2-the decoy, who was standing outside the office of the
appellant, narrated the happenings, in the absence of P.W.3, as though P.W.3 had
informed him. In view of P.W.3 could not be examined and had not deposed about
the same, P.W.4's narration becomes a hearsay evidence and this part of evidence
was recorded with objection. The trial Court had not given any reason for overruling
the objection made. (cid:128) On 19.09.2005 and 20.09.2005, the appellant was camping at
Milk Producers' Co-operative Society, Watrap, during that time, lot of traders and
businessmen, were there for sealing of their tables-scales and weighing stones.
Further, from the http://www.judis.nic.in7/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015
evidences of P.W.2 to P.W.4 and as per Ex.P.6 / Entrustment Mahazar, it could be
seen that on 20.09.2005, when P.W.2 along with P.W.3 had gone for sealing the
table-scale, the appellant sent them back, due to work load and crowd. Had the
appellant demanded the bribe amount, he would have received the same on the same
day and would not have sent back P.W.2. Thus, it is seen that there is no demand by
the appellant. In order to substantiate his submissions, the learned counsel relied on
the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India through
Inspector, CBI Vs. Purnandu Biswas reported in (2006) 1 SCC (Cri) 520. The relevant
portions of the judgment are extracted hereunder:-
“36.In this case, demand of illegal gratification by the Respondent has not been
proved.
Furthermore, Section 20 of the Act is not attracted as the Respondent had been
charged for commission of an offence under Section 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2)
of the Act.
37. M. Narsinga Rao vs. State of A.P. relied upon by Mr. Sharan, was rendered having
regard to the contention raised therein that it was not enough that some currency
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7017946/ 4
K.Gurusamy vs State By Inspector Of Police on 5 February, 2020
notes were handed over to the public servant to make it as acceptance of gratification;
prosecution has a further duty to prove that what was http://www.judis.nic.in8/32 CRL. A. (MD)
NO. 205 of 2015 paid amounted to gratification. Such a question does not arise for consideration in
this case.” (cid:128) Ex.P.5 and Ex.P.6 are the Observation Mahazars dated 20.09.2005, for returning back
the bribe amount, which was kept under safe custody. As per Ex.P.7 / Entrustment Mahazar, dated
21.09.2005, P.W.2 handed over an amount of Rs.200/-, which was marked as M.O.1. If that being
the case, on 21.09.2005, how can P.W.2 was in possession of Rs.20/- in addition to trap amount of
Rs.200/-, made payment for verification of the table-scale as could be seen from Ex.P.3 and Ex.P.4.
There is no explanation or clear evidence to show that this twenty Rupees was in possession of
P.W.2 and was kept separately. This amount of Rs.20/-, whether was kept along with the trap
amount or separately, ruling out the possibility of notes coming in contact with each other and the
same would have been the reason for the appellant's hand washes turning pink in colour.
(cid:128) From the Recovery Mahazar-Ex.P.12, it is seen that there is nothing on record to show that the
appellant had demanded and accepted the bribe amount. P.W.4 had given an exaggerated version
against the appellant and the lower Court http://www.judis.nic.in9/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of
2015 had wrongly placed heavy reliance on his evidence, which is contrary to the documentary
evidence and to the attendant circumstances. In order to substantiate his submissions, the learned
counsel relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Dashrath Singh
Chauhan Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation reported in AIR 2018 SCC 4720. The relevant portion
of the judgment is extracted hereunder:-
"32.Since in order to attract the rigors of Sections 7, 13(2) read 13(1)(d) of PC Act, the
prosecution was under a legal obligation to prove the twin requirements of “demand
and acceptance of bribe money by the accused”, the proving of one alone but not the
other was not sufficient. The appellant is, therefore, entitled for acquittal from the
charges framed against him under the PC Act too. “ (cid:128) The lower Court has failed to
look into the fact that in the application / Ex.P.8 dated 21.09.2005, it is found that
the weighing table-scale had been purchased from one Chinnasamy Nadar
Hardwares, No.39, Nethaji Road, Srivilliputhur, through bill No.376, dated
21.09.2005. Thus, the weighing table was purchased only on 21.09.2005 and
produced for inspection on the same day. In such http://www.judis.nic.in10/32 CRL.
A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 circumstances, the demand on 19.09.2005 is proved to be
false.
(cid:128) P.W.2 in his evidence does not mention anything about he being accompanied with
P.W.3. Further P.W.2's evidence is very categorical that on 21.09.2005, he along with
the trap team had left the office after 02.00 p.m. According to the Recovery Mahazar,
the trap had commenced at 12.00 noon and the recovery proceedings completed by
01.15 p.m on
21.09.2005. Further, he does not whisper anything with regard to any demand of bribe made by the
appellant. Further, when the Trap laying Officer entered into the office, P.W.2 was asked to leave the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7017946/ 5
K.Gurusamy vs State By Inspector Of Police on 5 February, 2020
place and only on the next day, he produced Ex.P.2 to Ex.P.4 to the Trap Laying Officer. (cid:128) P.W.4,
the other official witness was examined only for the purpose of Entrustment proceedings and
Mahazars viz., Ex.P.5 to Ex.P.7 and the Recovery Mahazar / Ex.P.12, after the trap was completed
and admittedly, it is submitted that P.W.4 was not available inside the office of the appellant, when
the trap amount was handed over. Further P.W.4 in his evidence states that there are two
application forms handed over by P.W.2 and http://www.judis.nic.in11/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of
2015 in this case, only one application form viz., Ex.P.8 had been produced.
(cid:128) P.W.2 admits that he along with P.W.3 had taken weighing table-scale and weighing table-stones
for verifying and sealing. But, in this case, no verification of weighing stones done and shown
recovery.
(cid:128) P.W.4 states that he had not seen any other weighing scale or weighing stones in the appellant's
office, which is contrary to Ex.P.14 to Ex.P.17 viz., Register, Cash Bill and other documents. P.W.4
further states that he is not aware of what is the type of the table scale, model name and number. (cid:128)
P.W.5 admits about the purchase of the weighing table-scale mentioned in Ex.P.8 on 21.09.2005.
(cid:128) P.W.1 had not asked any explanation as to how the weighing table-scale, which has been
purchased on 21.09.2005, could have been brought by P.W.2 on 19.09.2005 and non production of
any application form dated 19.09.2005. http://www.judis.nic.in12/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of
2015 (cid:128) In Ex.P.1 which is sanction for proceedings, the place of trap is Milk Producers' Co-Operative
Society, on 21.09.2005, the trap has taken place inside the office of the appellant, which clearly
shows non application of mind by P.W.1, when he issued Ex.P. (cid:128) In order to substantiate his
submissions, the learned counsel relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Trilok Chand Jain Vs. State of Delhi reported in (1975) 4 SCC 761. The relevant portion of the
judgment is extracted hereunder:-
“11.Another aspect of the matter which has to be borne in mind is that the sole
purpose of the presumption under Section 4(1) is to relieve the prosecution of the
burden of proving a fact which is an essential ingredient of the offences under Section
5 (1) (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 161, Penal Code. The
presumption therefore can be used in furtherance of the prosecution case and not in
derogation of it. If the story set up by the prosecution inherently militates against or
is inconsistent with the fact presumed, the presumption will be rendered sterile from
its very inception, if out of judicial courtesy it cannot be rejected out of hand as still
born. “ http://www.judis.nic.in13/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 (cid:128) In order to
substantiate his submissions, the learned counsel further relied upon the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Gulam Mahmood A.Malik Vs. State of
Gujarat reported in 1981 SCC (Cri) 586. The relevant portion of the judgment is
extracted hereunder:-
“7. The High Court while agreeing with the trial Court that the evidence of Natvarlal
is suspicious and that it cannot be acted upon without sufficient corroboration found
that the testimony of the Panch witness was acceptable and afforded sufficient
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7017946/ 6
K.Gurusamy vs State By Inspector Of Police on 5 February, 2020
corroboration. The High Court based the conviction mainly on the ground that
marked notes were recovered from the person of the accused and that Panch witness
has spoken to the recovery of the money. In assessing the evidence of a witness the
entire background of the prosecution story should be kept in mind. It is seen the
complainant has no regard for truth and his preferring a false complaint about
payment of bribe on Jule 7, 1972 and making the present complaint after tea days of
the alleged demand cannot be ignored. In the circumstances, we do not think that it
was safe for the High Court to base the conviction solely on the testimony of the
panch witness. The trial Court has given convincing reasons as to why the evidence of
the panch witness cannot be accepted. In reversing the order of acquittal the High
Court must find sufficient grounds for holding that the appreciation of the evident by
the trial Court is unsupportable. On going through the evidence in the case, We feel
that the trial Court http://www.judis.nic.in14/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 was
right is not accepting testimony of the complainant and the panch witness and the
High Court was not justified in interfering with the order of acquittal.”
7. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent made the
following submissions:-
(cid:128) In this case, the case came to be registered on the complaint of P.W.2, who is the
decoy and Ex.P.2 is the written complaint, in which, it is clearly mentioned that
P.W.2 met the appellant on 19.09.2005, along with the weighing table-scale and at
that time, the demand of bribe amount of Rs.200/- has been made by the appellant,
further, unless the bribe amount is paid, the weighing table-scale would not be
verified and sealed. Thereafter, he lodged a complaint on 20.09.2005. P.W.3 and
P.W.4 were summoned through Ex.P.21 and Ex.P.22. They appeared before the
respondent at about 11.30 a.m. Both of them were introduced to P.W.2. They made
some queries with P.W.2 and got satisfied about the complaint. They were made
aware of the significance of trap and the methodology was explained to them, the

p.m. Since the appellant had expressed his inconvenience on 20.09.2005, P.W.2 and
P.W.3 came back around 05.00 p.m. for the reason it was too crowded and the
appellant had asked P.W.2 to come on 21.09.2005. Hence, the trap team returned
back to the Vigilance Office and the trap amount was kept under safe custody and the
proceedings were recorded as Ex.P.6. Thereafter, on the very next day, in the
morning at about 08.30 a.m., P.W.2 along with accompanying witnesses and the trap

accused-appellants. A presumption under Section 20 of the Act becomes obligatory.
It is a presumption of law and casts an obligation on the court to apply it in every case
brought under Section 7 of the Act. The said presumption is a rebuttable one. In the
present case, the explanation offered by the accused-appellants has not been
accepted and rightly so. There is no evidence on the base of which it can be said that
the presumption has be rebutted.” (cid:128) In order to substantiate his submissions, the
learned Additional Public Prosecutor further relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Mohd. Iqbal Ahmed Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh
reported in AIR 1979 SC 677. The relevant portion of the judgment is extracted

http://www.judis.nic.in20/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 “The order of sanction
is a prerequisite as it is intended to provide a safeguard to a public servant against
frivolous and vexations litigants, but simultaneously an order of sanction should be
construed in a pedantic manner and there should not be a hypertechnical approach
to test its validity. The contention of the appellant, therefore, fails and is rejected.” (cid:128)
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor further relied on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. G.K.Ghosh reported
in 1984 1 SCC
254. The relevant portion of the judgment is extracted hereunder:-
“In case of an offence of demanding and accepting illegall gratification, depending on
the circumstances of the case, the Court may feel safe in accepting the prosecution
version on the basis of the oral evidence of the complainant and the police officers
even if the trap witnesses turn hostile or are found not to be independent. When
besides such evidence there is circumstantial evidence which is consistent with the
guilt of the accused and not consistent with his innocence, there should be no

difficulty in upholding the conviction.” (cid:128) The learned Additional Public Prosecutor
further relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of
Madhya Pradesh Vs. Jiyalal reported in (2009) 15 SCC http://www.judis.nic.in21/32
CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015
72. The relevant portion of the judgment is extracted hereunder:-
“7. In the case before us, even if it were to be accepted that there has been an “error,
omission or irregularity' in the passing of the sanction order, the learned single judge
of the High Court has not made a finding which shows that a serious failure of justice
had been caused to the respondent. In the absence of such a finding it was not correct
for the High Court to set aside the conviction and sentence given by the Special
Judge.” (cid:128) The learned Additional Public Prosecutor further relied upon the judgment
of the Hon'ble Kerala High Court in the case of Cyril Joseph Vs. State of Kerala in
Crl.A.No.34 of 2012.
The relevant portion of the judgment is extracted hereunder:-
“15. The next point to be considered is whether the evidence referred to in the
foregoing is sufficient to hold that the prosecution has succeeded in establishing the
offence charged against the accused. On the other hand, the question is whether the
presumption under Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, is available
for the prosecution. Counsel for the accused argued that PW.1/ de facto complainant
turned hostile and stated that the accused never demanded any bribe, that there is no
evidence of demand of the bribe by the accused and that therefore the presumption
under Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act cannot be raised in this case. I
am unable to agree. In M.Narasinga Rao v.
http://www.judis.nic.in22/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 State of Andhra
Pradesh (AIR 2001 SC 318) the Apex Court has held that once the prosecution has
established that the gratification is paid and the accused has accepted the same, the
presumption under sec.20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act can be raised. In
Narasinga Rao's case, the de facto complainant and an independent witness turned
hostile and did not support the prosecution. Even then the Apex Court has raised a
presumption under sec.20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and observed
that the condition for drawing a legal presumption under sec.20 is that during trial it
should be proved that the accused has accepted or agreed to accept any gratification.
In the present case I have found that the prosecution has succeeded in proving that
the accused has accepted the bribe. That being so, the contention of the accused that
as PW.1, the de facto complainant did not support the prosecution, the presumption
under sec.20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act cannot be raised, has only to be
rejected. “ (cid:128) The trial Court on appreciation of the evidence had rightly convicted the
accused in this case, which not to be interfered with.

8. This Court has carefully considered the submissions made on either side and the
entire oral and documentary evidence.
http://www.judis.nic.in23/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015
9. Discussions:-
9.(1). Considering the rival submissions made on either side and the materials
available on record, it is seen that, in this case, the decoy witness namely P.W.2 had
not supported the case of the prosecution.
9.(2). The accompanying witness viz., P.W.3, who was examined in chief, in part and
thereafter, he could not be examined, since he passed away. Hence, his evidence is
not complete and it cannot be acted upon.
9.(3). P.W.2 in his evidence had not mentioned anything about the demand of bribe.
On 20.09.2005 and he had gone to the Vigilance office, lodged a complaint at about
10.00 a.m.
9.(4). It is seen from Ex.P.13, that the First Information Report had been registered
immediately at the same time and no discreet enquiry had been made to find out the
antecedents of the appellant on the allegations made by P.W.2. Further, P.W.2 states
that, when he reached the spot at about 11.00 a.m., two official witnesses were
present in the Vigilance office, which is contrary to http://www.judis.nic.in24/32
CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 Ex.P.21 and Ex.P.22. The request was made for
appearance of P.W.3 and P.W.4 only at about 11.30 hours.
9.(5). P.W.2 does not elaborate anything with regard to the entrustment proceedings
and verification by P.W.3 and P.W.4.
Further in his evidence, P.W.2 has categorically stated that it was P.W.4 viz., Veerasamy, who
accompanied him, when he proceeded to the office of the appellant on 20.09.2005. According to the
records and the evidence of other witnesses, it is P.W.3 / Pitchai, who accompanied him and not
P.W.4.
9.(6). Further P.W.2 states that on 21.09.2005, at about 02.00 p.m., they left the office of the
Vigilance and reached the office of the appellant. But as per Ex.P.12 / Recovery Mahazar, the
handing over of the trap amount was at 12.00 noon. By that time, the trap team had entered into the
office of the appellant and phenolphthalein test was conducted and the Police recovered the bribe
amount and the recovery proceedings have been recorded through Ex.P.12 / Recovery Mahazar and
the proceedings had commenced at 12.00 noon and completed by 1.15 a.m. Further P.W. 2 admits
that he had taken weighing table-scale and weighing stones along with him and Ex.P.3, Ex.P.4 and
Ex.P.8 only mentions about http://www.judis.nic.in25/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 the
weighing table-scale and there is no document to show the weighing stones.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7017946/ 11
K.Gurusamy vs State By Inspector Of Police on 5 February, 2020
9.(7). P.W.2 in his evidence admits that he had taken the weighing stones. But the weighing stones
were not verified.
9.(8). Further, as could be seen from Ex.P.8, the weighing table-scale has been purchased by P.W.2
from A.Chinnasamy Nadar Hardwares, No.39, Nethaji Road, Srivilliputhur, through bill No.376
dated 21.09.2005. When the weighing table-scale itself had been purchased only on 21.09.2005,
there could be no necessity for demand to be made on 19.09.2005 and subsequent to it on
20.09.2005. Further P.W.2's certain case is that on 19.09.2005, when he met the appellant, he had
taken the weighing table-scale and weighing stones for stamping becomes highly doubtful.
9.(9). It is to be seen that in the entrustment mahazars / Ex.P5 and Ex.P.7, there is only mention of
Rs.200/- being placed in the shirt pocket of P.W.2 and there is no other money. But, it is strange to
know that P.W.2 had made payment of Rs.20/- and obtained cash receipt / Ex.P.3 for verification
and stamping fee for the weighing table-scale. Where P.W.2 had kept this Twenty Rupees
http://www.judis.nic.in26/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 note, the possibility of mix up with the
phenolphthalein smeared notes very much there and could be the reason for hand wash of the
appellant answering positive.
9.(10). P.W.2 admits that the penalty charge for late verification of weighing stones would be around
at Rs.200/-. The collection of penalty charge is also admitted by P.W.1, the sanctioning authority
and the other witnesses from the Labour Department.
9.(11). P.W.6 used to collect the fee amount from the appellant, deposit it in the Bank, he admits that
on the date of occurrence, as per the records, the total amount collected is Rs.338/-. But, there was
only Rs.228/- available. Had the appellant was in the habit of collecting extra money, then there
could have been excess amount than Rs.338/-. But in this case, it is admitted that the amount
recovered from the drawer of the appellant is the stamping fee, which he was entitled to collect.
Apart from this, there is no other implication of the appellant in this case.
9.(12). The only witness implicates the appellant is P.W.4. This witness was examined for the
purpose of pre-trap and post-trap proceedings and he was standing along with the Trap
http://www.judis.nic.in27/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 Laying Officer outside the office
during the trap on 21.09.2005. It is admitted case that he had entered into the office after getting
signal along with the Trap Laying Officer and he was not privy to the coversation between P.W.2 and
the appellant in the presence of P.W.3. P.W.2 had not supported the case of the prosecution. P.W.3
could not be examined. The Trap Laying Officer also dead. There is no evidence available to show
the happenings during the trap. An attempt has been made through P.W.4 to improve his evidence
as though informed by P.W.3 about the happenings inside the room. In the absence of P.W.3 could
not be examined. The evidence of P.W.4 with regard to in this aspect is only hearsay. As already
stated, P.W.2 had not mentioned about any demand and the entire trap proceedings has been
recorded by way of Recovery Mahazar / Ex.P.12. On perusal of Ex.P.12, nothing is found as stated by
P.W.4 in his evidence and hence, the evidence of P.W.4 becomes uncorroborated both by oral and
material evidence and does not inspire confidence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7017946/ 12
K.Gurusamy vs State By Inspector Of Police on 5 February, 2020
9.(13). On perusal of Ex.P.12, it is seen that there is no mention about any demand and thereafter,
the receipt of bribe amount by the appellant. As stated earlier, based on phenolphthalein test
turning positive alone a person cannot be convicted. Further, in the absence of demand and
acceptance being http://www.judis.nic.in28/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015 proved in this case,
it cannot be said the appellant received any bribe amount.
9.(14). P.W.2 admits that he had taken the weighing stones for verification and sealing. But, no such
stones have been seized. Further P.W.4 states that P.W.2 had submitted two applications one for the
weighing table-scale and another for the weighing stones. In this case, only one application for
weighing scale had been produced. P.W.4 states that other than the weighing scale of P.W.2, he had
not seen any other weighing scale or weighing stones which is contrary to the evidence of other
witnesses.
9.(15). It is also to be seen that no incriminating materials were found on the search of the house on
the residence of the appellant. Thus, from the above, it is clear that sin qua non of demand, has not
been proved in this case as well as the acceptance. The evidence of P.W.4 is with embellishment and
exaggeration and does not inspire confidence. The lower Court had placed heavy reliance on the
evidence of P.W.4, while convicting the appellant, which is not sustainable.
http://www.judis.nic.in29/32 CRL. A. (MD) NO. 205 of 2015
10. Considering the rival submissions as discussed above and the other materials available on
record, this Court is inclined to interfere with the findings of the Trial Court.
Conclusion:-
11. In the result, the Criminal Appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence imposed on the
appellant in Spl.C.C.No.1 of 2014, on the file of the Special Court and Chief Judicial Magistrate
Court for V & AC Cases, Srivilliputhur, Virudhunagar District, dated 18.08.2015, is set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charges framed against him. The bail bonds, if any, executed by the
appellant shall stand cancelled. The fine amounts, if any, paid by the appellants shall be refunded to
him.
