... Respondents
(By Smt. Pramodini Kishan, AGA for R-1 & R-2;
Sri. N.K. Ramesh, Advocate for R-3;
Smt. Sumana Baliga, Advocate for R-4)
This Writ Petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227
of the Constitution of India praying to issue direction to the
respondents and in particular respondent No.4 to
immediately return all the original documents which were
submitted by the petitioner at the time of PG Admission vide
Annexure-C.
These Petitions coming on for preliminary hearing this
day, the Court made the following:
4
ORDER
Though these matters are listed for preliminary hearing, by consent of learned Advocates, it is taken
up for final disposal.
2. The grievance of the petitioners in these petitioners are that fourth respondent- Bangalore
Medical College and Research Centre has not considered the applications (Annexure-A dated
09.07.2018 in W.P.No.29161/2018 and Annexures 'A' and 'B' dated 02.07.2018 and 06.07.2018
respectively in W.P.No.29162/2018) submitted by the petitioners for return of all original
documents submitted by them to the College at the time of joining for the post graduate studies.
3. It is further grievance of the petitioner in W.P.No.29161/2018 that he has been selected for Super
Specialty Course namely, MCH Course in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery by the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences and last date for admission being on 15.07.2018, petitioner is required
to produce the original documents before the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, (for short
AIMS) as otherwise his admission would not be made and there is every likelihood of admission
being cancelled.
4. Whereas, petitioner in W.P.No.29162/2018 contends that she has been admitted as a student of
'Postdoctoral Fellowship in Neuro Infection Course' by the National Institute of Mental Health and
Neuro Sciences (for short NIMHANS) and her admission has been granted subject to original
documents being produced within three weeks from 07.07.2018. It is also stated by petitioner that
she has given her undertaking to the said effect and as such, if the original documents submitted by
petitioner before fourth respondent at the time of her initial admission is not produced before the
NIMHANS within three (3) weeks, petitioner's admission is likely to be cancelled or annulled.

5. Both petitioners have contended that they have worked hard to obtain or secure seat in Super
Specialty courses under and if fourth respondent is not directed to return the documents, their
future would be in jeopardy. Hence, they have prayed for direction being issued to fourth
respondent to return the documents.
6. Smt. Sumana Baliga M., learned counsel appearing for fourth respondent has filed a memo
enclosing therewith communication dated 07.06.2018 by the fourth respondent to the Director of
Medical Education - second respondent herein seeking clarification in respect of claim made by
petitioner's and similarly placed students. In reply, Director of Medical Institution has intimated
fourth respondent and all other Government Medical Colleges that in cases where students have
been admitted by providing subsidized seats, such students would be required to compulsorily
render 1 year compulsory service as contemplated under the Karnataka Compulsory Service
Training by Candidates Completed Medical Courses, 2012 (which has been further amended by Act
No.26/2015) and as such, has called upon the respective colleges to obtain a bank guarantee for
Rs.30 lakhs from such of those students, who are seeking for return of the documents. Hence, she
prays for a direction being issued to the petitioners to furnish such security for return of the
documents. She would also supplement her arguments by contending that fourth respondent may
be granted liberty to incorporate a clause in the 'No Objection Certificate' that would be furnished by
the fourth respondent to the petitioners indicating thereunder that the documents are being
returned 'subject to undertaking' given by the petitioners.
7. Sri N.K.Ramesh, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.3-University submits that since
issue involved in these petitions is between fourth respondent and petitioners, third respondent-
University would have no role to play.
8. Learned Additional Government Advocate would also support the argument of Smt. Sumana
Baliga M., learned counsel and submits that if a direction is issued, there is likelihood of petitioners
not adhering to the amended Act, in the event of validity of the Act being upheld by this Court.
9. Taking into consideration the aforestated facts and the fact that Medical Courses Act, 2012,
referred to supra, has been stayed by this Court in W.P.No.40566/2015 and connected matters as
well as the order dated 28.04.2016 passed in W.P.No.25391/2016 whereunder, petitioners who had
challenged the validity of the amended Act has resulted in concerned Universities being directed to
issue appropriate degree to the eligible candidates and this Court has also directed Karnataka
Medical Council to grant registration certificates to the eligible students/Doctors subject to the
result of the writ petitions, subject to the such candidates/Doctors filing an affidavit before the
Karnataka Medical College that they will abide by the order which may be passed in
W.P.No.40566/2015 and connected matters, without any demur that is to comply with the provision
of the impugned Act and in the event of their failure in the said writ petitions. In the light of
direction having been issued by this Court under similar circumstances in W.P.No.25391/2015 by
order dated 28.4.2016 directing the fourth respondent to consider the claim of petitioners herein
who are similarly placed as that of petitioners herein. This Court is of the considered view, similar
directions if issued conditionally, it would meet the ends of justice and it would also allay the
apprehension of the fourth respondent as well as the State.
