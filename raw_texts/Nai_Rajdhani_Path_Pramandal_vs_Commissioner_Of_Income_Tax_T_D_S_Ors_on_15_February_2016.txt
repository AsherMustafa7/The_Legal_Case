CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE I. A. ANSARI
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI SHARAN SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE I. A. ANSARI) Date: 15-02-2016 In a proceeding under Section
201(1) read with Section 201(1A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ((hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'),
instituted against the petitioner, which is a department of the State Government, constituted to
construct and maintain roads and bridges in the State of Bihar, the respondent No. 3 herein,
namely, Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, TDS Circle, Patna, held that the petitioner had not
deducted income tax, at source, on the payments made to Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited
and Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited ((hereinafter referred Patna High Court
CWJC No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016 to as 'the Corporations') for the period 2012-13, 2013-14 and
2014- 15 and, therefore, raised a demand of Rs. 4,07,33,189/-, Rs.50,99,60,809/- and
Rs.63,51,95,228/- for the period 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 respectively.
2. Aggrieved by the demands so raised, the petitioner filed appeal along with an application for stay

Nai Rajdhani Path Pramandal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax ( T D S ) & Ors on 15 February, 2016
of the demand, before the respondent No.2, namely, Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II,
Patna, on the ground, inter alia, that the payments, made to Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited
and Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited, are in the nature of allotments of funds to
the said Corporations, on the instructions of the Government of Bihar, for the purposes of
construction of roads and bridges and that the same did not constitute a contract for work under
Section 194(1) of the Act.
3. Having preferred an appeal, as indicated above, accompanied by an application for stay of the
demand so raised, before the respondent No.2, namely, Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II,
Patna, the petitioner also filed an application before the respondent No.3, namely, Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, TDS Circle, Patna, for stay of the said demand, but the respondent
No.3, Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, TDS Circle, Patna, rejected the request for stay on the
ground that filing of an appeal is Patna High Court CWJC No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016 not a
sufficient reason to keep a demand in abeyance. However, while the appeal was pending
consideration before the respondent No.2, namely, Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II,
Patna, the respondent No.3, namely, Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, TDS Circle, Patna,
attached the accounts of the petitioner maintained with the District Treasury Officer, Patna, for
recovery of the whole amount, in dispute, totaling to a sum of Rs.1,18,58,89,226/-.
4. Though the appeal is still pending for consideration by the respondent No.2, namely,
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II, Patna, this writ application has been made, under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, by the petitioner seeking, inter alia, issuance of a writ or writs
setting aside and quashing the notice, dated 22.09.2015, as contained in Annexure-4, issued by the
respondent No. 3, namely, Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, TDS Circle, Patna, under Section
226(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, raising the demand as aforementioned for the period 2012-13,
2013-14 and 2014-15.
5. We have heard Mr. D. V. Pathy, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner, and Ms. Archana
Sinha @ Archana Shahi, learned Counsel, appearing for the respondents.
6. Without expressing any opinion on the correctness or the otherwise of the substantial questions
of law, which have been Patna High Court CWJC No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016 raised by the writ
petitioner including the question as to whether the payments made by the petitioner to the
Corporations were in the nature of payment of contract or simple disbursement of amount on behalf
of the State Government, we may point out that it has been submitted, on behalf of the petitioner,
that even if it is assumed that the petitioner was liable to make deduction, at source, of the
payments, which had been made to Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited and Bihar State Road
Development Corporation Limited, the fact of the matter remains, according to Mr. D. V. Pathy,
learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner, that both Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited and
Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited, have filed their returns and, in terms of the
assessments made, taxes have also been paid by the two Corporations, and since the taxes, due from
Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited and Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited,
have already been received by the Income Tax Department, the Income Tax Department ought not
to proceed against the present petitioner under Section 201(1) read with Section 201(1A) of the Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89702620/ 2
Nai Rajdhani Path Pramandal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax ( T D S ) & Ors on 15 February, 2016
and, therefore, the petitioner's account ought not to have been attached and ought to be, now,
released from attachment.
7. Appearing on behalf of the respondents, Ms. Archana Sinha @ Archana Shahi, learned Counsel,
has not been able to Patna High Court CWJC No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016 dispute that in terms
of the assessment made by the said two Corporations, taxes have been paid.
8. In the circumstances indicated above, does it remain legally open to the respondents to insist on
the demands, which have been raised and which stand impugned in the statutory appeal, which the
petitioner has filed? Yet another question is : If, in terms of the assessments, made by the said two
Corporations, the Corporations have already paid taxes, is it legally valid and justified for the
respondents to continue to keep under attachment the account of the petitioner maintained with the
District Treasury Officer, Patna, for the purposes of recovery of the said sum of Rs.1,18,58,89,226/-?
9. Our quest for an answer to the above questions brings us to the Circular No.275/201/95-IT(B),
dated 29.01.1997, which states, " ..... ..... ..... no demand visualized under Section 201(1) of the
Income-tax Act should be enforced after the tax deductor has satisfied the officer-in-charge of TDS,
that taxes due have been paid by the deductee-assessee. However, this will not alter the liability to
charge interest under Section 201(1A) of the Act till the date of payment of taxes by the
deductee-assesee or the liability for penalty under section 271C of the Income-tax Act".
10. A careful reading of the Circular, which we have reproduced above, clearly shows that no
demand, as envisaged by Patna High Court CWJC No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016 Section 201(1) of
the Act, can be enforced against the deductor if the tax, due to be paid by the deductee, has already
been paid by the deductee. In other words, if the deductor (i.e., the petitioner herein), who has to
make deduction at source of the payments made to the deductee (i.e., the Corporations) failed to
make the deduction, will the deductor, i.e., the petitioner herein, remains liable to make the
payment of the tax, which was due by the deductee, i.e., the Corporations?
11. This is the vital question, in the light of the provisions of Section 201(1) of the Act, if the
deductees (i.e., the Corporations) have made the payment of the tax on the amounts, which were to
be deducted, at source, by the deductor (i.e., the petitioner), such payments will not only absolve the
deductees, but also the deductor. This position, emerging from the Circular aforementioned, has
been amply clarified by the Supreme Court by pointing out, in Hindustan Coca Cola Beverate P. Ltd.
v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, reported in, [2007] 293 ITR 226 (SC), that when there is no
dispute that the tax due has already been paid by the deductee-assessee, a proceeding, under Section
201(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, read with Section 201(1A) thereof, is untenable and, therefore,
cannot be continued against the deductor.
12. Giving the Circular, dated 29.01.1997 Patna High Court CWJC No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016
aforementioned, issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, a statutory recognition, a proviso has
been added to sub-Section (1) of Section 201 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which reads as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89702620/ 3
Nai Rajdhani Path Pramandal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax ( T D S ) & Ors on 15 February, 2016
"201. Consequences of failure to deduct or pay.â”€ (1) Where any person, including the
principal officer of a company, â”€
(a) who is required to deduct any sum in accordance with the provisions of this Act;
or
(b) referred to in sub-section (1A) of Section 192, being an employer, does not deduct,
or does not pay, or after so deducting fails to pay, the whole or any part of the tax, as
required by or under this Act, then, such person, shall, without prejudice to any other
consequences which he may incur, be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect
of such tax:
1[Provided that any person, including the principal officer of a company, who fails to
deduct the whole or any part of the tax in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter on the sum paid to a resident or on the sum credited to the account of a
resident shall not be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of such tax if such
residentâ”€
(i) has furnished his return of income under section 139;
(ii) has taken into account such sum for computing income in such return of income;
and
(iii) has paid the tax due on the income declared by him in such return of income,
Patna High Court CWJC No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016 And the person furnishes a
certificate to this effect from an accountant in such form as may be prescribed:]
2[Provided further that] no penalty shall be charged under section 221 from such
person, unless the Assessing Officer is satisfied that such person, without good and
sufficient reasons, has failed to deduct and pay such tax.]"
13. In the light of the proviso to Clause (b) of sub- section (1) of Section 201 of the Act, there can be
no escape from the conclusion that if the person, who fails to deduct, whole or part of the tax, at
source, shall not be deemed to be an assessee in default if in respect of such tax, the deductee has
furnished his return of income under Section 139 of the Act and, while furnishing the return, has
taken into account such sum for computing income in such return of income and has paid the tax
due on the income declared by him in such return of income coupled with a certificate to this effect
from an accountant in such form as may be prescribed.
14. Having, therefore, regard to the factual aspects of the present case and the law relevant thereto,
we are clearly of the view that the respondent No.2, namely, Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals)-II, Patna, is duty bound to take up the appeal at the earliest and if it is found that the
taxes, which were to be deducted, at source, by the present petitioner while making payment to the
said two Corporations, have been paid by the said two Corporations as Patna High Court CWJC
No.16015 of 2015 dt.15-02-2016 deductees, the impugned demands, raised by the respondent No.2,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89702620/ 4
Nai Rajdhani Path Pramandal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax ( T D S ) & Ors on 15 February, 2016
namely, Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II, Patna, shall be set aside and the attachment of
the account of the petitioner, maintained with the Government Treasury, Patna, shall be vacated
without delay.
15. In order to, therefore, taking the controversy, which the present writ petition has raised, to its
logical conclusion in accordance with law, we hereby direct the petitioner to appear before the
respondent No. 2, namely, Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II, Patna, in connection with the
appeal, in question, within a week from today and, within a week thereafter, the appellate authority,
namely, respondent No.2, Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II, Patna, shall, upon examining
the issue, as has been discussed above, pass appropriate reasoned order(s) and do the needful as
warranted by law.
16. With the above observations and directions, this writ petition shall stand disposed of with no
order as to costs.
