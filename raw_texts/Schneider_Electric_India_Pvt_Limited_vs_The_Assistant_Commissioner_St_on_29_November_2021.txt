Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
For Petitioner : Mr.Joseph Prabakar
For Respondents : Ms.Amirta Dinakaran
Govt.Advocate.
ORDER
This is a second round of litigation by the petitioner. Earlier, an assessment came to be passed by
the respondent on 30.11.2018 for the Assessment Year 2014-2015.
2. Since the said order was passed without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, the
petitioner had filed W.P.No.2355 of 2019 stating that the said order was passed in violation of
principles of natural justice as no opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner. The said Writ
Petition was allowed by an order dated 29.01.2019 with the following observations:-
“5. Perusal of the said notice would show that the petitioner was called upon to
appear in person on any working day in the notice time. This Court has already
considered the said aspect and found that such course of providing personal hearing
is not an effective and proper opportunity, since such personal hearing has to be
conducted only after filing the reply. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Therefore,
without expressing any view on the merits of the reasons stated in the impugned
order, this Court is inclined to remit the matter back to the Assessing Officer for
giving an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner and to complete the
assessment thereafter. The petitioner is at liberty to raise all the contentions as raised
in this writ petition before the Assessing Officer at the time of personal hearing.
6. Accordingly, this writ petition is allowed and the impugned order is set aside.
Consequently, the matter is remitted back to the Assessing Officer to re-do the
assessment, after giving due opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner. The
whole exercise shall be done by the Assessing Officer within a period of four weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.”
3. Pursuant to the aforesaid order of this Court, the petitioner filed a reply dated 13.05.2019 which
has culminated in the impugned Assessment Order dated 19.07.2019. In the impugned order, the
respondent has held as follows:-
Rule 7 of the TNVAT Act, 2006 stated that "a registered dealer specified in clause (a)
or (b), whose taxable turnover in the preceding year is two hundred crores of rupees
and above, shall file the above returns on or before 12th of the succeeding month to
the assessing authority in whose https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis jurisdiction his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89468656/ 2
Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
principal place of business or head office is situated. Such return shall be
accompanied by proof of payment of tax."
The Dealer himself accepted that their total turnover exceeds 200 crores if CST sales
taken into account. But the contention of the dealer is CST Sales will not be taken to
to account for calculating Rs.200 crores.
Neither in TNVAT Act or in TNVAT Rule specifies that CST turnover not taken into
account for arriving the total turnover for filing returns.
Hence the reply of the dealer is not accepted and overruled and confirm the proposal
Hence interest under Section 42 (3) of the Act for belated payment of taxes is levied
as under
Interest due : Rs.513205.00 Interest Paid : Rs. Nil
-------------------
Balance : Rs.513205.00
-------------------
A notice in Form of RR is issued.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
4. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that the entire order passed by the respondent is cryptic and is not reasoned and is
therefore contrary to the law made by the Division Bench of this Court in State of
Tamil Nadu Vs. M/s Taher Ali Industries & Projects (P) Ltd., 2016-VIL-548-MAD.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the turnover under the (Central
Sales Tax Act, 1956) CST cannot be clubbed in the returns filed under Section 21 of
the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006 read with Rule 7 of the Tamil Nadu Value
Added Tax Rules, 2007 and therefore, the impugned order passed by the respondent
is liable to be quashed.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner also states that Under Section 21 of the
Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as TNVAT Act,
2006) a dealer is required to file returns in the manner prescribed under Rule 7 of
the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as TNVAT
Rules, 2007) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89468656/ 3
Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention to the Rule 7 of the
Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Rules, 2007 as it stood at the time of its
implementation on 01.01.2007 and as it stood amended with effect from 30th March,
2009.
8. It is submitted that prior to the amendment, an assessee was required to file
returns on or before 20 th of the succeeding month and pay the tax at the time of
filing of the returns.
9. It is further submitted that by virtue of the above amendment to the Rule 7 of the
Rules amended with effect from 30th March, 2009, Sub-
Clause 8 to Rule 7 was introduced, wherein, in case of dealers making electronic payment of tax, the
dealers whose taxable turnover in the previous assessment year was Rs.200 Crores and above was
required to file returns on or before the 14 th of the succeeding month along with the proof of
payment of tax while others were required to file returns on or before 22nd of the succeeding month
along with proof of payment of tax. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
10. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the turnover under the CST and TNVAT
cannot be clubbed for the purpose of Rule 7 of the TNVAT Rules, 2007. He has also drawn attention
to the definition of “taxable turnover” under Section 2(38), the definition of “total turnover” under
Section 2(40) and the definition of “turnover” under Section 2(41) of the TNVAT Act, 2006 and the
definition of “Sale Price” under Section 2(h) and “turnover” in 2(j) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956
(hereinafter referred to as CST Act, 1956)
11. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that though for the purpose of assessment under
CST Act, 1956 the procedure prescribed under TNVAT Act, 2006 is adopted, the two turnover and
assessments are independent of each other and there is no scope for overlapping or including the
turnover into the other for the purpose of Section 21 of the TNVAT Act, 2006 and Rule 7 of the TN
VAT Rules, 2007 and therefore submits that the impugned order is liable to be quashed for the
aforesaid reason apart from being cryptic, non-speaking and unreasoned.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
12. It is submitted that even on first principles of law and on a plain reading of the definitions and
the scheme of the respective enactments and the Rules made therein, it is clear that there is no legal
basis to sustain the impugned order.
13. The learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to Rule 5 of the Central Sales Tax (Tamil
Nadu) Rules, 1957 to substantiate the point that only the date for filing the returns under the
TNVAT Act, 2006 will apply to filing of the returns under the CST Act, 1956 and therefore submits
that barring the above commonality, there is no scope of overlapping between the assessments
under the respective enactments and determining the turnover.

Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
14. The learned counsel for the petitioner finally submits that since the issue in the present Writ
Petition is a pure question of law, the petitioner need not be relegated to work out a remedy before
the Appellate Commissioner in the light of the decision of this Court in National Co.. Private Limited
Vs. Commissioner of Chennai,2008 31 CLT 410.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
15. Appearing on behalf of the respondent, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the
impugned order is well reasoned and requires no interference.
16. The learned counsel for respondent submits that an order of an assessment officer need not be
detailed where a question of law arises and in this case,the officer concerned has come to a correct
conclusion that the turnover under the CST Act, 1956 was to be included for the purpose of Section
21 of the TNVAT Act, 2006 and Rule 7 of the TNVAT Rules, 2007. He therefore submits that the
Writ Petition is devoid of merits and prays for dismissal.
17. The learned counsel for the respondent further submits that in terms of Rule 8 of the TNVAT
Rules, 2007 only certain categories of turnovers are to be excluded and therefore, the petitioner
should have filed for returns in time, in terms of sub-Rule 8 to Rule 7 as amended during the period
in question.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
18. It is submitted that for the purposes of calculating ‘taxable turnover’, which will in turn
determine the filing date as contemplated under Section 21 read with Rule 7, the TNVAT Act not
only defines the term ‘taxable turnover’, but it also provides for the basis and method of arriving at
the taxable turnover.
19. It is submitted that Section 2(40) of the TNVAT Act, 2006 defines total turnover to mean the
aggregate turnover in all goods of a dealer at all places of business in the State, whether or not, the
whole or any portion of such a turnover is liable to tax. In other words, the Act clearly contemplates
the turnover arising as a result of the interstate sales ought to also be taken into account for
calculating total turnover.
20. This is clear from the use of the phrase “turnover in all goods of a dealer at all places of business
in the State”, in Section 2(40) of TNVAT Act, 2006 meaning all sales effected from any place of
business in the State irrespective of whether they are intra state or interstate sales, and the phrase
“whether or not, the whole or any portion of such turnover is liable to tax”.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
21. It is submitted that Section 2(38) defines “taxable turnover” to mean turnover liable to be taxed
as determined after making such deductions from the total turnover in such manner as may be
prescribed. In other words, “taxable turnover” can be arrived at only after making such deductions
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89468656/ 5
Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
as already prescribed under the statute. It is further submitted that Rule 8(2) is the relevant rule
which prescribes the manner and lays out the deductions which are permissible from the total
turnover in order to arrive at the taxable turnover. A combined reading of Rule 8(2), Rule 8(2)(a)
and Rule 8(2)(b) would show that only the following deductions can be made from total turnover.
They are as follows:-
i) All amounts for which goods specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Act are sold; -
This deduction is based on the type of good.
ii) All amounts for which goods exempted by a notification issued by the Government
under Section 30 are sold or purchased, as the case may be, provided the terms and
conditions, if any, for the exemption in the notification are complied with. – This
deduction is based on the type of good which has been exempted by way of
notification.
22. It was submitted that both the above mentioned deductions are
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis purely determined based on the type of goods and whether such a
good is exempted either under the fourth Schedule of the Act or by way of exemption notification.
Nowhere does the Act provide that turnover from CST sales to be deducted in order for one to arrive
at the taxable turnover.
23. It was submitted that if it is well settled law that an Act, including a taxing legislation has to be
read as a whole so as to avoid inconsistency. The learned counsel for the respondent referred to a
decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Innamuri Gopalam and Maddala Nagendrudu and
Others Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, (1964) 2 SCR 888 and in The Commissioner of Income Tax,
Central Calcutta Vs. National Taj Traders, 1980 (1) SCC 370.
24. Secondly, Section 2(38) clearly defines “taxable turnover” as “turnover” in which a dealer is
‘liable to pay tax’, irrespective of whether it is under TNVATAct or CST Act. The definition by itself
only looks into a dealer’s liability to pay tax in general. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
25. It is also submitted that as far as taxation legislations are concerned, nothing can be read in,
implied and there is no room for discovering or imputing any intendment. In this connection, the
learned counsel for the respondent also referred to the decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Ranbaxy Laboratories vs. Union of India, (2011) 10 SCC 292 and in Cape Brandy Syndicate vs. IRC,
(1921) 1 KB 64.
26. Therefore, it is further submitted that for the purposes of determining the dates of filing returns,
the dealer’s taxable turnover (i.e.his/her general liability to pay tax, irrespective of whether it is
under TNVAT Act or CST Act) ought to be taken into account. In the present case, the petitioner’s
taxable turnover (including both under TNVAT Act and CST Act) is greater than 200 crores and as a
result the petitioner should have filed his returns before the 12th of the succeeding month.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89468656/ 6
Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
27. It is submitted that as far as taxation cases are concerned, an assessee can come before the
Hon’ble High Court only on very specific grounds namely, violation of Principles of Natural Justice
and violation of fundamental rights. This has been reiterated in a decision of the Hon’ble
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Supreme Court in Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Chandan
Nagar, West Bengal Vs. Dunlop India Ltd. and others, 1985(1) SCC 260 and in Union of India Vs.
Satyawati Tandon, 2010(8) SCC 110 and in Authorized Officer, State Bank of Travancore and other
Vs. Mathew K.C, 2018(3) SCC 85 and in The Assistant Commissioner of State Tax Vs. Commercial
Steel, C.A.No.5121 of 2021, order dated 3.09.2021.
28. Therefore, as far as the writ jurisdiction is concerned, the petitioner cannot come before this
Hon’ble High Court without exhausting his alternative remedy available under Section 51 of the
TNVAT Act. This was reiterated in another judgment of this Hon’ble High Court where the very
same issue was concerned in International Flavors and Fragrances India Pvt Ltd. Vs. The Assistant
Commissioner (CT), order dated 06.11.2017 in W.P 20633 of 2016, wherein, this Hon’ble High Court
directed the petitioner to go before the Assessing Authorities under Section 51 of TNVAT Act, 2006.
29. The learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in United Bank of Inida Vs. Satyawati Tondon And
Others, (2010) 8 SCC 110. In this connection, the learned counsel for respondent has placed reliance
in the above on account that the scope of writ petition being limited the petitioner should have
relegated to work out the remedy in the manner known to law before the Appellate Commissioner.
30. The learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the following judgments of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court:-
“ i. Whirpool Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Ors., (1998) 8
SCC ii. United Bank of India Vs. Satyawati Tondon and Ors.,(2010) 8 SCC 110.
iii. The Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax and OrsVs. M/s Commercial Steel
Limited, in Civil Appeal No. 5121 of 2021”.
31. The learned counsel for the respondent also referred to Section 9(2) of the CST Act, 1956 to state
that the provisions of TNVAT Act has to be followed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
32. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondent. I have
perused the impugned order and the provisions of law and the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court and of this High Court referred to (supra).
33. A short point that arises for consideration in this writ petition is whether the writ petitioner was
required to include the CST turnover into the VAT turnover under the provisions of the TNVAT Act,
2006?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89468656/ 7
Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
34. Though the petitioner has an alternative remedy, no useful purpose will be served by either
relegating the petitioner to the respondent or to work out the remedy before the Appellate
Commissioner as the issue is one of interpreting of the provision of the two Act.
35. Section 21 of the TNVAT Act, 2006 it reads as under:-
“Filing of returns - Every dealer, registered under this Act, shall file return, in the
prescribed form showing the total and taxable turnover within the prescribed period,
in the prescribed manner along with prescribed documents and proof of payment of
tax. The tax under this Section shall become due without notice of demand to the
dealer on the last date of the period for filing return as prescribed The tax under this
Section shall https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis become due without any notice of
demand of the dealer on the date of receipt of this return or on the last date of the
period for filing return as prescribed, whichever is later”.
36. The manner prescribed for the purpose of Section 21 of the TN VAT Act, 2006 is under Rule 7 of
the TNVAT Rules 2007. Rule 7 as it stood on 01.01.2007 was amended with effect from 24.08.2009.
37. Relevant portions of Rule 7 of the TNVAT Rules, 2007 relevant portions are reproduced below

Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TNVAT Rules,2007 w.e.f. 01.01.2007 (9)*If a dealer having filed a
return, finds any omission or error therein, other than as a result of an inspection or audit or receipt
of any other information or evidence by the assessing authority, he shall file a revised return

to which the return relates. Where, as a result of such revised return, the tax payable by the dealer
increases, the dealer shall furnish along with such revised return, proof of payment of tax and
interest due thereon under sub-section (4) of Section 42 of the Act.
* inserted vide TNVAT Rules,2007w.e.f. 26.08.2009.
38. Thus, a registered dealer specified in clause (a) or (b) Rule 7(1) of the TNVAT Rules, 2007,
whose taxable turnover in the preceding year exceeded two hundred crores of rupees and above was
required file the above returns on or before 12 th of the succeeding month to the assessing authority
in whose jurisdiction his principal place of business or head office was situated. Such return shall be
accompanied by proof of payment of tax.
39. This period for filing return was extended from 12 th of succeeding month to the 14th of the
succeeding month in the case of a registered dealer who made electronic payment of the tax vide the
above https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis amendment. In the case of other dealers making the time
was extended till 22nd of the succeeding month along with proof of payment of tax. Barring the
above, amendment in the year 2009 is of no significance.
40. The expression used is “taxable turnover”. This expression is defined in Section 2(38 ) of the
TNVAT Act, 2006 as follows:-
“Taxable Turnover: It means the turnover on which a dealer shall be liable to pay tax
as determined after making such deductions from his total turnover and in such
manner as may be prescribed”.
41. The “taxable turnover” is that ‘turnover’ on which the a dealer was liable to pay tax as
determined after making such deduction from the total turnover. Permissible deductions are
recognized in Rule 8(2) of the TNVAT Rules 2007. The expression “Turnover” and “Total Turnover”
are defined in Sections 2(41) and 2 (40) of the TNVAT Act, 2006 as follows:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Section 2( 41): Turnover Section 2(40 ): Total
Turnover Turnover : It means the Total Turnover : It means the aggregate amount for
which aggregate turnover in all goods are bought or sold, or goods of a dealer at all
places delivered or supplied or of business in the State, otherwise disposed of in any
whether or not, the whole or of the ways referred to in any portion of such turnover
clause (33), by a dealer or is liable to tax.
through another, on his own account or on account of others whether for cash or for
deferred payment or other valuable consideration, provided that the proceeds of the
sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce, other than tea and rubber
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89468656/ 10
Schneider Electric India Pvt.Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 29 November, 2021
(natural rubber latex and all varieties and grades of raw rubber) grown within the
State by himself or on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner,
usufructuary mortagagee, tenant or otherwise, shall be excluded from his turnover.
42. Thus, for the purpose of determining the date for filing return, it is the “ turnover”
on which the tax is liable to be paid. It is not dependent on the “total turnover” of a
dealer. Whole or part of the such” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis total turnover”
may or may not be liable be tax. However, for the purpose of filing Returns under
Rule 7 (1) and Rule 7(9) of the TNVAT Rules, 2007 on 7th or 14th as the case may be,
the other turnover which are exempted or are not liable to tax are not relevant.
43. Rule 8 of the TNVAT Rules, 2007 which was referred to by the learned counsel
for the respondent is not relevant for determining the due date for filing of the
returns under proviso to Rule 7(1) or under Rule 7(9) of the of the TNVAT Rules,
2007 or for computation of the “taxable turnover” during previous year.
44. Rule 8(1) of the TNVAT Rules, 2007 merely prescribes the procedure for
assessment and arriving at the deduction. As per Rule 8(2) recognizes deductions
while determining “taxable turnover”. Apart from post sale charges and the amounts
specified in the following clauses are to be deducted from the “total turnover” of a
dealer namely:-
“(a) All amounts for which goods are specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Act are
sold ;
(b) All amounts for which goods exempted by the a notification issued by the
Government under https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis section 30 are sold or
purchased, as the case maybe, provided the terms and conditions, if any, of the
exemption notification are complied with.”
45. Rule 8 prescribes a method of determination of “taxable turnover” for the
purpose of payment of tax. It is not to be read to mean that CST “turnover” is to be
included either for determination of tax liability under the TNVAT Act, 2006 or for
filing of Returns under Rule 7 of the TNVAT Rules, 2007 on 12/14 of the succeeding
month as the case may be.
46. Thus, “taxable turnover” under Section 2(38) under TNVAT Act, 2006 can
include only the “turnover” on which a dealer was liable to pay tax under TNVAT Act,
2006as determined after making such deductions from “total turnover” and in such
manner as may be prescribed for determining “total turnover”. The amounts to be
deducted Rule 8(2) of TNVAT Rules, 2007 can never form part of the “taxable
turnover” under Section 2 (38) of the TNVAT Act 2006 for the purpose of Section 21
of the TNVAT Act 2006.

47. The overlap between the CST Act, 1956 and the TNVAT Act, 2006 and the Rules made
thereunder are only for the purpose of following the procedure prescribed under the latter Act for
the former. Barring the above, there is no scope for including one turnover into another either for
determining the tax liability or the determining the due date for filing the Returns, Section 9 of the
CST and Rule made thereunder do not permit any inclusion of the turnover under one tax
enactment into another.
