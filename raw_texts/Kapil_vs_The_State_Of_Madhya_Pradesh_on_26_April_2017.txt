Shri Prasanna Prasad, learned counsel for the

Shri S.K.Mehra, learned counsel for the non-
applicant.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C. against the order dated 03.02.2016 passed by the
Special Judge, (Electricity Act), Indore in Criminal Case
No.57/2005; whereby learned judge partly allowed the
applicant's application filed under Section 65-C of the Indian
Evidence Act and only allowed to file copy of spot memo in
evidence as secondary evidence and rejected the prayer
regarding remaining documents.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to the
disposal of this petition are that applicant filed a complaint
against the non-applicant for the offence under Sections 135,
136, 137, 138, 139, 149 and 150 of Indian Electricity Act and
Section 420 of IPC. On that complaint learned trial court
registered Criminal Case No.57/2005 against non-applicant and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 9
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
tried the case. During trial of the case at the stage of applicant's
evidence applicant filed an application under Section 65-C of
the Evidence Act averring that he filed complaint against the
non-applicant regarding electricity theft. The applicant's
employees checked non applicant's premises on 07.05.2005
and found electricity theft so they prepared spot memo ,interim
assessment order, Final assessment bill, receipt and description
of Bill which were annexed in office file but that file was
missing so copy of that document is taken on record as
secondary evidence in place of original document.
[3] Non-applicant in his reply opposed the prayer.
[4] Learned Trial Court by order dated 03.02.2016
partly allowed the application and only permitted the applicant
to file copy of spot memo as secondary evidence and rejected
the prayer regarding other documents observing that applicant
had not mentioned that the photocopy was made from the
original and it was compared with original. Also name of
person who obtained the photocopy by mechanical process had
not been mentioned. He could not even prove existence of
original. Being aggrieved from that order applicant filed this
petition.
[5] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
document brought on record along with the application filed
under Section 65-C of the Indian Evidence Act had a material
bearing on the facts of the present case and thus it was essential
in the interest of justice to accept the same and allow the
application. The fact narrated in the complaint and evidence
brought on record would fairly demonstrate the clever and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 10
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
ingenious mode and method by which the electricity theft was
made and thus, in totality of circumstances. The learned court
below ought to have accepted the application. Learned trial
court committed mistake in rejecting his prayer.
[6] Learned counsel for the non-applicant opposed the
prayer and submitted that learned trial court rightly right
rejected applicant's prayer.
[7] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by the parties. It appears from the record
that non-applicant is facing trial under Indian Electricity Act,
2003 on the complaint of applicant before the Special Judge
(Electricity Act), Indore in Criminal Case No.57/2005.
Applicant by way of application wants to produce copy of spot
memo and interim assessment order, assessment of Bill, and
description of Bill as secondary evidence.
[8] It appears from the record that applicant wants to
produce photocopy of interim assessment order, assessment of
Bill, and description of Bill as secondary evidence. Learned
trial court on the basis of this court's judgment passed in
Aneeta Rajpoot V/s. Saraswati Gupta reported in I.L.R.
(2013) MP 43 rejected his prayer. This court in that judgement
clearly held that for taking photo copy of any document on
record as secondary evidence besides the satisfaction of section
65(a) it is also required that the photocopy was compared with the
original in terms of section 63 (3) of evidence act.
Since there is no averment in the application filled by
the applicant under section 65c of evidence act that photocopy
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 11
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
was compared with the original and it is an accurate photocopy of
the original and applicant also did not file any affidavit of person
who obtained the said photocopy along with application.
So learned trial court did not commit any mistake
in rejecting applicant's prayer for taking photocopies of some
documents on record as secondary evidence without fulfilling
the requirement of the Section 65 and 63 of the Evidence Act.
So, this petition is disposed of with the direction that applicant
is free to file another application after fulfilling the aforesaid
requirement for taking photocopy as secondary evidence. In
that event trial court shall dispose that application without
considering his earlier application.

This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against the
judgment dated 25.05.2016 passed by the 14th Additional
Sessions Judge, Indore, in Cr.A.No.146/2016; filed
against the judgment of conviction dated 10.02.2016
passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore in
Criminal Case No.42510/2014 whereby Judicial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 14
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Magistrate First Class found appellant guilty for the
offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act
and sentenced him to six months rigorous imprisonment
and also directed him to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as
compensation to the non-applicant/complainant under
Section 357 (3) of the Cr.P.C. and whereby learned ASJ
partly allowed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and
also affirmed the direction of compensation. But set aside
the jail sentence of applicant.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that non-applicant
filed a criminal complaint against the applicant before the
Judicial Magistrate First Class for the offence under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act averring
that non applicant/complainant gave a loan of Rs.81,300/-
to the applicant and for the purpose of payment of said
loan applicant gave cheque No.000002 dated 30.08.2014
drawn on Bank of Baroda, Branch M.G. Road, Indore.
The applicant at the time of issuing the said cheque
promised the complainant that it would be duly paid on
its presentation.
The complainant further averred that on
11.10.2014 on presentation of the said cheque in the
bank, it was dishonoured. After that complainant sent
legal notice demanding the payment of the said amount.
Even after service of that notice on 01.11.2014 applicant
did not pay the amount. So complaint requested that
action be taken against him. On that learned Judicial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 15
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Magistrate First Class took cognizance against the
applicant for the offence under Section 138 of Negotiable
Instruments Act and registered the complaint as a
Criminal Case No.42510/2014 under Section 138 of
Negotiable Instruments Act and tried the matter.
Although applicant took the defence that he did not give
the said cheque to the non-applicant for discharging any
legally enforceable debt or any liability, but after trial
learned trial court held appellant guilty for the offence
under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act and
sentenced him to undergo six months rigorous
imprisonment and pay Rs.1,00,000/ as compensation to
the non-applicant. Being aggrieved from that judgement
applicant filled Cr.A.No.146/2016 before the Sessions
Court, which was disposed of by the 14th Additional
Sessions Judge, Indore whereby he affirmed the
conviction of applicant but set aside the jail sentence and
affirmed the order of compensation. Being aggrieved
from that judgment appellant filed this Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that from the evidence it is clear that applicant did not
give the said cheque to non-applicant for discharging any
legally enforceable debt or any liability. Learned trial
court as well as appellate court without appreciating the
facts wrongly found the appellant guilty for the offence
under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.
[4] By the present Revision Petition, the petitioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 16
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
has assailed the judgment dated 25.05.2016 passed by the
14th Additional Sessions Judge, Indore on the ground that
findings of court below were against the weight of
evidence. There was nothing on record to show that
appellant gave the said cheque to the non-applicant for
discharge of any loan or liability. The grounds raised by
the petitioner in the present petition show that the
petitioner has assailed the order of learned Sessions Judge
on merits.
[5] Section 393 of Cr.P.C. specifically provides
that the judgment and order passed by the appellate court
in an appeal shall be final except in cases provided under
Sections 377, 378 and 384 (4) or Chapter XXX. The case
of the petitioner does not fall under any these three cases.
Thus, the judgment of appellate court has attained finality
and the High Court could interfere under Section 397 of
Cr.P.C. only if there was an issue of correctness, legality
or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or
passed by the Sessions Court or any irregularity of the
proceedings of the Sessions Court. The High Court in its
power under Section 397 cannot act as a court of second
appeal and cannot re-appreciate the entire evidence to
substitute its own opinion against the opinion of the
appellate court. The scope of revision against the
concurrent finding of fact is very limited and ordinarily
the concurrent finding of fact cannot be challenged unless
and until there is gross misreading of evidence or there is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 17
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
manifest error of law or miscarriage of justice. The
revisional jurisdiction does not confer power on the
revisional court to reappreciate the evidence on record.
The Revisional Court can examine the record only to
satisfy itself that the court below had conducted the
proceedings in an appropriate manner and had taken into
account entire evidence before passing the judgment. The
judgment is not to be resorted to as a second appeal.
[6] During arguments, counsel for the petitioner
had only been agitating that the conclusion arrived at by
the trial court as well as by the appellate court was not
correct conclusion and he wanted this court to
reappreciate the entire evidence. I consider that this court
in view of Section 393 of Cr.P.C. cannot re-appreciate the
entire evidence to arrive at a different conclusion than the
one arrived at by the appellate court, therefore, this court
finds no force in this revision, even otherwise from the
statement of complainant/non-applicant, it is clearly
proved that applicant gave the said cheque to the non-
applicant against the loan of Rs.81,300/- taken by her
from non-applicant. So, the revision has no force and
petition is hereby dismissed.

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of private
complaint and proceedings of criminal case No.628/2016
pending before the J.M.F.C., Javad, District Neemuch against
the applicant for the offence under Section 498A and 448 of
the IPC.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to the
disposal of this petition are that non-applicant No.1 filed a
private complaint before the J.M.F.C., Javad, District
Neemuch averring that she is legally wedded wife of
applicant No.1 Ravi and applicants No.2, 3, 4 & 5 are father-
in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law of the
non-applicant respectively. Her marriage was solemnized
with applicant No.1 Ravi on 21.04.2015. After marriage she
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 30
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
lived with applicant and his family members at Village Gujri
Manpur in her matrimonial house but behaviour of applicants
No.1 to 3 was not good with her. They demanded dowry and
harassed her and subjected her to cruelty due to which she left
her matrimonial house 5 to 6 months before filing of the
complaint i.e. 16.04.2016. On 02.04.2016, applicants No.1 to
3 came to her house at Nayagaon and tried to forcibly take
her along and also threatened her. On that complaint learned
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Javad, District Neemuch
recorded statement of complainant/non-applicant Archna
under Section 200 and her witness Mangilal, Rakesh and
Gendubai under Section 202 of Cr.P.C. and by order dated
01.06.2016 took cognizance against applicants No.1 to 5
under Sections 498A and 448 of IPC and registered a private
complaint as Criminal Case No.628/2016 and issued notice to
the applicants for appearance. Being aggrieved from that
order applicants filed this petition.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that
applicants never demanded any dowry from the non-applicant
No.1 and never harassed her for dowry. Non-applicant No.1
filed false complaint against applicants for harassing her.
Earlier also non-applicant No.1 lodged police report against
applicants but police did not take any action on that report
because report was false. So applicant filed this false
complaint before the trial court which is an abuse of process
of court, hence complaint be quashed.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State opposed
the prayer.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 31
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the counsels.
[6] Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of
Haryana and others V/s. Bhajan Lal and others reported in
1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 held that :-
"The power of quashing a criminal
proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and
with circumspection and that too in the rarest of
rare cases. The extraordinary or inherent powers do
not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to
act according to its whim or caprice. The court will
not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to
the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the
allegations made in the FIR or the complaint.
The following categories of cases can be
stated by way of illustration wherein the
extraordinary power under Article 226 or the
inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC can be
exercised by the High Court either to prevent abuse
of the process of any court or otherwise to secure
the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to
lay down any precise, clearly defined and
sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or
rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of
myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should
be exercised :
(1) Where the allegations made in the first
information report or the complaint, even if they
are taken at their face value and accepted in their
entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or
make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information
report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence,
justifying an investigation by police officers under
Sections 156(1) of the Code except under an order
of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made
in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected
in support of the same do not disclose the
commission of any offence and make out a case
against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not
constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non-cognizable offence, no investigation is
permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of
the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 32
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable
on the basis of which no prudent person can ever
reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted
in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding
is instituted) to the institution and continuance of
the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of
the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly
attended with mala fide and/or where the
proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior
motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and
with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge."
Which shows that complaint can only be quashed
when no offence is made out from the averment of the
complaint, while in the complaint prima facie offence under
Section 498-A is clearly made out.
[7] It appears from the record that non-applicant
No.1 clearly averred in her complaint that applicant harassed
her for dowry and subjected her to cruelty. Non-applicant
also gave statement in support of her complaint before the
court and statements of Mangilal (PW-2), Rakesh (PW-3) and
Gendubai (PW-4) also corroborate with the statement of non-
applicant. Whether the allegation made by the non-applicant
No.1 in the complaint is true or not cannot be ascertained at
this stage as it requires evidence.
[8] Learned counsel for the applicants also submitted
that they filed application before Parivar Paramarsh Kendra,
Dhar but non-applicant No.1 did not appear in the Parivar
Paramarsh Kendra, Dhar. He also filed documents in this
regard, but only on the ground that non-applicant did not
appear before the Parivar Paramarsh Kendra, Dhar, it cannot
be said at this stage that non-applicant No.1 filed false
complaint to harass applicants.
[9] Learned counsel for the applicant also placed
reliance on the judgment of this court in Premsingh &
others V/s. Mithlesh Kunwar & others. But the facts of that
case do not match with the instant case. In that case non-
applicant/wife hardly resided with applicants for five days
and then left her matrimonial home and did not return but in
the instant case non-applicant No.1 lived with applicant No.1
Ravi in the matrimonial home for sometime so the judgement
does not help the applicants much . At this stage only on the
basis of documents filed by the applicants along with this
application it cannot be assumed that non-applicant No.1 filed
the complaint just to harass the applicants based on false
allegation. Prima facie offence under Section 498-A is clearly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 33
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
made out from the complaint and statement of complaint and
non-applicant No.1 and her witnesses and the veracity of her
statement cannot be ascertained at this stage as it requires
evidence. Therefore, complaint cannot be quashed, so petition
is dismissed. Applicants are free to raise all objections before
the competent court at the appropriate stage.

24.04.2017
Shri Vaibhav Jain, learned counsel for the
applicant.
None present for the non-applicant even after
service of notice.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C. against the order dated 02.12.2015 passed by the 9th
Additional Sessions Judge, Indore in Cr.R.No.971/2014;
whereby he affirmed the order dated 20.11.2014 passed by the
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Indore in Criminal Case
No.6773/2013; whereby he rejected applicant's prayer to
discharge Criminal Case No.6773/2013.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to the
disposal of this petition are that non-applicant filed a private
complaint for the offence under Section 138 of Negotiable
Instruments Act before the Trial Court averring that he was
having good relation with the petition and, therefore, he has
advanced a loan of Rs.50,000/- to the petitioner. To refund the
said amount, the petitioner has issued a cheque No.222409
dated 18.01.2013 for an amount of Rs.50,000/- drawn on
Centurion Bank of Punjab Limited, Indore to the respondent.
When the said cheque was sent for collection, the said cheque
was dishonoured with a note that "account closed". After that
he sent notice to the applicant for payment of said amount, but
applicant not paid the said amount, so action be taken against
him. On that complaint learned trial court took cognizance
against applicant for the offence under Section 138 of
Negotiable Instruments Act and registered Criminal Case
No.6773/2013. Being aggrieved from that cognizance order
applicant filed an application under Section 204 of Cr.P.C.
before the trial court averring that from bare perusal of the said
cheque it is clear that the said cheque was given on behalf of
partnership firm namely Western Carring Corporation. While
respondent neither sent notice to the said partnership firm nor
implead the said firm as a party in the complaint. In these
circumstances, the complaint filed by the complainant against
only applicant is not maintainable, but learned trial court
rejected the applicant's prayer observing that it is not clear that
the said cheque was given by whom and in which liability,
hence at this stage the petition is not maintainable and rejected
the application against which applicant filed Cr.R.No.971/2014,
which was disposed of by 9th Additional Sessions Judge, Indore
by order dated 02.12.2015 and by that order 9th Additional
Sessions Judge affirmed the lower court's order and rejected
applicant's Revision observing that without impleading
partnership firm as an accused complaint is not maintainable
because there is applicant's sign on the said cheque. Applicant
signed on the said cheque in what capacity is a matter of
evidence. This fact will be decided after recording of evidence.
Being aggrieved from that order applicant filed
Criminal Revision.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
from bare perusal of the said cheque it is clear that the said
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 40
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
cheque was given on behalf of partnership firm namely Western
Carring Corporation. Respondent has not issued any legal
notice to the said partnership firm and not impleaded as an
accused in the complaint. In these circumstances, the complaint
filed by the non-applicant only against applicant is not
maintainable.
Learned trial court committed mistake in taking
cognizance against the applicant overlooking these facts and
learned revisional court also committed mistake in rejecting his
Criminal Revision.
This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by the learned counsel for the applicant. It
appears from the record that non-applicant filed private
complaint averring that applicant took Rs.50,000/- from him.
When he demanded that money from the applicant he gave the
said cheque No.222409 amounting to Rs.50,000/- of Centurion
Bank of Punjab Limited, Indore on 18.01.2013, but said cheque
was dishonoured. Although in the said cheque it is mentioned
that said cheque was given on behalf of Western Carring
Corporation, but it is not a case of the applicant that he gave
money to any partnership firm. He stated that he gave money to
applicant only on the ground that applicant gave cheque of
partnership firm. It is not necessary for complainant to implead
partnership firm as an accused in the complaint.
Learned counsel for the applicant placed reliance
on the Apex Court's judgment passed in Aneeta Hada V/s.
Godfather Travels and Tours Private Limited reported in
(2012) 5 SCC 661, in which Apex Court held that,
"Criminal liability on account of
dishonour of cheque primarily falls on
drawer company and extends to its officers
only when conditions incorporated in
Section 141 stand satisfied - Explaining
import of words "as well as the company"
occurring in Section 141, held, for
maintaining prosecution under Section
141, arraigning of company as accused is
imperative."
He also placed reliance on the Apex Court's
judgment passed in Anil Gupta V/s. Star India Private
Limited and another reported in (2014) 10 SCC 373, in which
Apex Court held that,
"From Section 138 of the Act it is
clear that only the drawer of the cheque
falls within the ambit of Section 138 of the
Act whether human being or a body
corporate or even a firm. The guilt for
offence under Section 138 will be deemed
to be upon other persons connected with
the Company in view of Section 141 of the
Act."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 41
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
He also placed reliance in the judgment passed by
this Court in Kamla Rusiya V/s. State of M.P. And another
reported in 2010 (I) MPWN 93, in which this court held that,
"Section 138 of the Act covers only
those cases wherein the cheque drawn by a
person on an account maintained by him
with a banker for payment of any amount
of money to another person from out of
that account for the discharge, in whole or
in part, of any debt or other liability, is
returned by the bank unpaid, either because
of the amount of money standing to the
credit of that account is insufficient to
honour the cheque or that it exceeds the
amount arranged to be paid from that
account by an agreement made with that
bank."
Cheque was issued on behalf of the firm. The only
fact that respondent had issued the cheque by itself, was not
sufficient to attract penal liability for the offence under Section
138 of Negotiable Instruments Act as he was able to establish
that his authority drawer had seized to continue till the date it
was presented for encashment. In other words the applicant had
failed to prove that the respondent had played some role at the
time when the cheque was dishonoured.

21.04.2017:
Shri Shailendra Mishra, learned counsel for the
petitioners.
Shri Vismit Panot, learned counsel for the
respondent.
This petition has been filed under section 482
Cr.P.C against the order dated 05.03.2015 passed by this
Court in M.Cr.C.No.7239/10 whereby the petition filed
by the petitioner under section 378 (4) Cr.P.C seeking
leave to appeal against the judgment of acquittal dated
17.09.2010 passed by JMFC, Indore in Crimial Case
No.3045/2010 has been rejected.
Brief facts of the case which are relevant for
disposal of this petition are that petitioner filed a private
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 53
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
complaint before JMFC, Indore against the respondent for
the offence punishable under section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act. On that complaint criminal
case No.3045/2010 was registered by the trial court
charges framed under section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act against the respondent. However, after
trial vide judgment dated 17.09.2010 the trial Court
acquitted the respondent from the aforesaid charge. Being
aggrieved by the said judgment, petitioner preferred leave
to appeal under section 378 (4) Cr.P.C before this Court
which was registered as MCRC No.7239/10 and disposed
of by this court by order dated 05.03.2015 after hearing
learned counsel of both the party on merits.
Learned counsel of the applicant submitted that
Before hearing of the said case, petitioner moved an
application dated 04.03.2015 seeking permission to
change his existing counsel but unfortunately that
application could not be placed on record and on
05.03..2015 i.e. the next day the impugned order was
passed by this Court after hearing the existing counsel
Shri A.K.Nalwaya and without considering the
application seeking change of counsel, hence the
petitioner prayed for recall of the order dated 5.3.2015
and fresh hearing of the matter.
On the other hand learned counsel for the
respondent submitted that the impugned order was passed
by this Court after hearing counsel for both the
parties,there was no application for change of counsel on
record till the final disposal of M.Cr.C.No.7239/2010
hence this Court has no jurisdiction to recall the
impugned order.Even otherwise impugned order was
passed by this court on merits. According to section 363
of Cr.PC this court has no power to review its earlier
order and prayed for rejection of the petition.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties and on
perusal of the record, it appears that the order dated
05.03.2015 was passed by this Court after hearing both
the counsel for the parties on merits and there was no
application for change of counsel on record at that
juncture.So It cannot be said that at the time of argument
the counsel for the petitioner Shri A.K.Nalwaya had no
instructions from the petitioner to argue the matter. Even
otherwise this court passed impugned order on merits and
this Court has no jurisdiction to review its earlier order
As held by the Apex Court in the case of Moti Lal v.
State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1994 SC 1544.Hence
the petition has no force and is hereby dismissed.

Vinod Singhal.
Shri Mukesh Kumawat, learned Panel Lawyer
for the respondent/State.
Prosecutrix also appeared in person before the
court and filed an affidavit that she does not want any
action against applicant.
Heard.
Case diary perused.
This is a second bail application filed under
Section 438 of Cr.P.C. for grant of anticipatory bail. His
earlier application was dismissed as withdrawn vide order
dated 20.12.2016.
The applicant apprehended his arrest in
connection with Crime No.373/2016 registered at P.S.
Y.D. Nagar, Mandsaur for the offence under Sections
376, 376(2)(N), 506 & 90 of IPC
As per prosecution case, applicant made
sexual relation with prosecutrix on the pretext of marriage
and duped her from the year 2007 to 2016 and sexually
exploited her. Prosecutrix is having two daughters from
the applicant but now applicant is denying to marry
her.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that prosecutrix wrongly filed report against the applicant.
Prosecutrix is a consenting party. Nothing is required to
be seized from the possession of the applicant. Applicant
is ready to co-operate in the investigation and trial. The
applicant does not have any criminal past except the
present case. In the event of arrest, his reputation will be
diminished. Under these circumstances, applicant prays
for bail.
Learned counsel for the respondent/State
opposed the application.
On due consideration and contentions raised
by the learned counsel for the parties and overall facts
and circumstances of the case, this court is of the
considered view that it is a fit case to allow the applicant's
anticipatory bail, therefore, without expressing any view
on the merits of the case this application is allowed. It is
directed that in the event of arrest in Crime No.373/2016
registered at P.S. Y.D.Nagar, Mandsaur, present applicant
Vinod Singhal S/o Shivraj Singhal shall be released on
bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of
Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Only) with one surety
in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Arresting
Authority (Investigating Officer).
This order will remain operative subject to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 56
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
compliance of the following conditions by the applicant :-
{1} The applicant will comply with all the
terms and conditions of the bond executed by
him.
{2} The applicant will co-operate in the
investigation/trial, as the case may be;
{3} The applicant will not indulge himself
in extending inducement, threat or promise to
any person acquainted with the facts of the
case so as to dissuade him/her from disclosing
such facts to the court or to the Police Officer,
as the case may be;
{4} The applicant shall not commit an
offence similar to the offence of which he is
accused;
{5} The applicant will not seek unnecessary
adjournments during the trial; and
{6} The applicant will not leave India
without previous permission of the trial court/
Investigating Officer, as the case may be.
A copy of this order be sent to the concerned
Station House Officer for compliance.

Criminal Revision No.307/2016
18.04.2017
Shri Akash Rathi, learned counsel for the
applicant.
Shri Himanshu Joshi, learned Panel Lawyer
for the non applicant /State.
Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against the
order dated 10.02.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Sonkachh, District Dewas in S.T.No.319/2014
whereby; learned judge framed charges against applicant/
accused for the offence under Section 467, 468 and 471
of IPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case which are relevant to
the disposal of this petition are that complainant Pooran
Lal lodged a written complaint that he is a residence of
Village Talod, Tehsil Sonkachh, District Dewas and does
farming and 8th Class passed. His brother accused
Atmaram, who is only 6th Class passed, on the basis of his
marksheet of 8th Class got a job of sainik in Home Guards
Department. So action be taken against him. On inquiry
of that report it was found that accused Atmaram got job
in Home Guard Department in the name of Pooranlal @
Atmaram S/o Dhulji on the basis of his brother
Pooranlal's 8th Class marksheet . On that D.G., Home
Guard, wrote a letter to S.P. Dewas for taking action
against co-accused Atmaram. On that Crime No.478/13
was registered at P.S. Sonkachh, District Dewas for the
offence under Section 420, 467, 468 and 419 of IPC
against co-accused Atmaram and Police investigated the
matter. During investigation he found that co-accused
Atmaram impersonated the name of Pooran Lal for
getting job of Home Guard (Sainik) on the basis of
marksheet of his brother complainant Pooran Lal. It was
also found that during enquiry of the complaint filled by
Pooran Lal present applicant prepared forged ration card,
marksheet etc. for showing applicant Atmaram as Pooran
Lal, so Police made him also accused in the case and also
filed charge-sheet against applicant. On that charge-sheet
ST No.319/2014 was registered. During trial of the case
learned A.S.J., Sonkachh framed charge against applicant
under Section 467, 468 and 471 of IPC. Being aggrieved
from that order applicant filed this Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that accused Atmaram on the basis of forged ration card
and other documents entered into Home Guard service 23
years ago and it is alleged that such forged documents
were prepared by the present applicant being Panchayat
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 71
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Secretary whereas the present applicant was appointed as
Panchayat Secretary in the year 2002 and therefore, by
any stretch of imagination, it cannot be said that the
applicant entered some wrong entries in the public record.
There is no evidence against the applicant to connect him
with the crime. There is no evidence that so called forged
documents were prepared by the applicant. Even
otherwise so called forged documents were prepared
much later after appointment of Pooran Lal as Constable
of Home Guard, which was not used in his initial
appointment. The applicant is a Panchayat Secretary of
the Panchayat and has field job and he is not accountable
for any temperament of the record. Learned trial court
without appreciating the fact wrongly framed charges
against applicant.
[4] On the other hand, learned counsel for the
respondent/State submitted that it is not the case of the
prosecution that accused Atmaram got job 23 years ago
on the basis of forged document prepared by applicant.
According to prosecution story during enquiry of the
complaint filled by the Pooran Lal applicant prepared
forged ration card, marksheet etc for showing applicant
Atmaram as Pooran Lal,in the year 2012-13. There are
ample evidence against the applicant on record to frame
charge against him. Learned trial court did not commit
any mistake in framing charge under Section 467, 468
and 471 of IPC.
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the counsel for the parties.
Hon'ble apex court in his judgment passed in
Sajjan Kumar Vs CBI report in (2010) 9 SCC 368
after considering our earlier judgements held as under,
On consideration of the authorities about
the scope of Section 227 and 228 of the Code, the
following principles emerge:-
(i) The Judge while considering the question of
framing the charges under Section 227 of the
Cr.P.C. has the undoubted power to sift and weigh
the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out
whether or not a prima facie case against the
accused has been made out. The test to determine
prima facie case would depend upon the facts of
each case.
ii) Where the materials placed before the Court
disclose grave suspicion against the accused
which has not been properly explained, the Court
will be fully justified in framing a charge and
proceeding with the trial.
iii) The Court cannot act merely as a Post Office
or a mouthpiece of the prosecution but has to
consider the broad probabilities of the case, the
total effect of the evidence and the documents
produced before the Court, any basic infirmities
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 72
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
etc. However, at this stage, there cannot be a
roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the
matter and weigh the evidence as if he was
conducting a trial.
iv) If on the basis of the material on record, the
Court could form an opinion that the accused
might have committed offence, it can frame the
charge, though for conviction the conclusion is
required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt
that the accused has committed the offence.
v) At the time of framing of the charges, the
probative value of the material on record cannot
be gone into but before framing a charge the
Court must apply its judicial mind on the material
placed on record and must be satisfied that the
commission of offence by the accused was
possible.
vi) At the stage of Section 227 and 228, the Court
is required to evaluate the material and
documents on record with a view to find out if the
facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value
discloses the existence of all the ingredients
constituting the alleged offence. For this limited
purpose, sift the evidence as it cannot be expected
even at that initial stage to accept all that the
prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is
opposed to common sense or the broad
probabilities of the case.
vii) If two views are possible and one of them
gives rise to suspicion only, as distinguished from
grave suspicion, the trial Judge will be
empowered to discharge the accused and at this
stage, he is not to see whether the trial will end in
conviction or acquittal.
With the above principles, if we peruse the
charge sheet it cannot be presumed that there is no case at
all to proceed against applicant .It is not the case of the
prosecution that Atmaram got job 23 years ago on the
basis of forged document made by the applicant co-
accused. According to prosecution story during enquiry
of the complaint filled by the Pooran Lal applicant
prepared forged ration card, marksheet etc for showing
applicant Atmaram as Pooran Lal,in the year 2012-13.
There are ample evidence against the applicant on record
to frame charge against him. in this regard. So, in the
considered opinion of this court, learned trial court did
not commit any mistake in framing charge against
applicant under Section 467, 468 and 471 of IPC. The
Criminal Revision has no force. So, this Criminal
Revision is hereby dismissed.

Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against the
order dated 10.02.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Sonkachh, District Dewas in S.T.No.319/2014
whereby; learned judge framed charges against applicant/
accused for the offence under Section 467, 468 and 471
of IPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case which are relevant to
the disposal of this petition are that complainant Pooran
Lal lodged a written complaint that he is a residence of
Village Talod, Tehsil Sonkachh, District Dewas and
doing agriculture work and 8th Class passed. His brother
accused Atmaram, who is only 6th Class passed, on the
basis of his marksheet of 8th Class got a job of sainik in
Home Guards Department, so action be taken against
him. On inquiry of that report it was found that accused
Atmaram got job in Home Guard Department in the name
of Pooranlal @ Atmaram S/o Dhulji on the basis of his
brother Pooranlal's 8th Class marksheet . On that D.G.,
Home Guard, wrote a letter to S.P. Dewas for taking
action against co-accused Atmaram. On that at P.S.
Sonkachh, District Dewas registered Crime No.478/13 for
the offence under Section 420, 467, 468 and 419 of IPC
against co-accused Atmaram and Police investigated the
matter. During investigation he found that co-accused
Atmaram impersonated the name of Pooran Lal for
getting job of Home Guard (Sainik) on the basis of
marksheet of his brother complainant Pooran Lal. It was
also found that during enquiry of the complaint filled by
the Pooran Lal present applicant preparing forged ration
card, marksheet etc for showing applicant Atmaram as
Pooran Lal, so Police also made him accused in the case
and also filed charge-sheet against applicant. On that
charge-sheet ST No.319/2014 was registered. During trial
of the case learned A.S.J., Sonkachh framed charge
against applicant under Section 467, 468 and 471 of IPC.
Being aggrieved from that order applicant filed this
Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that accused Atmaram on the basis of forged ration card
and other documents entered into Home Guard service 23
years ago and it is alleged that such forged documents
were prepared by the present applicant being Panchayat
Secretary whereas the present applicant was appointed as
Panchayat Secretary in the year 2002 and therefore, by
any stretch of imagination, it cannot be said that the
applicant entered some wrong entries in the public record.
There is no evidence against the applicant to connect him
with the crime. There is no evidence that so called forged
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 82
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
documents were prepared by the applicant. Even
otherwise so called forged documents were prepared
much later than appointment of Pooran Lal as Constable
of Home Guard, which was not used in his initial
appointment. The applicant is a Panchayat Secretary of
the Panchayat and he is having the field job and he is not
accountable for any temperament of the record. Learned
trial court without appreciating the fact wrongly framed
charges against applicant.
[4] On the other hand, learned counsel for the
respondent/State submitted that it is not the case of the
prosecution that on the basis of forged document which
was made by the applicant co-accused Atmaram got job
23 years ago. According to prosecution story, during
enquiry of the complaint filled by the Pooran Lal
applicant prepared forged ration card, marksheet etc. for
showing applicant Atmaram as Pooran Lal, in the year
2012-13. There are ample evidence against the applicant
on record to frame charge against him. Learned trial court
did not commit any mistake in framing charge under
Section 467, 468 and 471 of IPC.
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the counsel for the parties.
Hon'ble apex court in his judgment passed in
Sajjan Kumar Vs CBI report in (2010) 9 SCC 368 after
considering earlier judgements reported in (2008) 5 SCC
113 held as under,
"On consideration of the
authorities about the scope of Section
227 and 228 of the Code, the following
principles emerge:-
(i) The Judge while considering the
question of framing the charges under
Section 227 of the Cr.P.C. has the
undoubted power to sift and weigh the
evidence for the limited purpose of
finding out whether or not a prima facie
case against the accused has been made
out. The test to determine prima facie
case would depend upon the facts of
each case.
ii) Where the materials placed before the
Court disclose grave suspicion against
the accused which has not been properly
explained, the Court will be fully
justified in framing a charge and
proceeding with the trial.
iii) The Court cannot act merely as a
Post Office or a mouthpiece of the
prosecution but has to consider the broad
probabilities of the case, the total effect
of the evidence and the documents
produced before the Court, any basic
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 83
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
infirmities etc. However, at this stage,
there cannot be a roving enquiry into the
pros and cons of the matter and weigh
the evidence as if he was conducting a
trial.
iv) If on the basis of the material on
record, the Court could form an opinion
that the accused might have committed
offence, it can frame the charge, though
for conviction the conclusion is required
to be proved beyond reasonable doubt
that the accused has committed the
offence.
v) At the time of framing of the charges,
the probative value of the material on
record cannot be gone into but before
framing a charge the Court must apply
its judicial mind on the material placed
on record and must be satisfied that the
commission of offence by the accused
was possible.
vi) At the stage of Section 227 and 228,
the Court is required to evaluate the
material and documents on record with a
view to find out if the facts emerging
therefrom taken at their face value
discloses the existence of all the
ingredients constituting the alleged
offence. For this limited purpose, sift the
evidence as it cannot be expected even
at that initial stage to accept all that the
prosecution states as gospel truth even if
it is opposed to common sense or the
broad probabilities of the case.
vii) If two views are possible and one of
them gives rise to suspicion only, as
distinguished from grave suspicion, the
trial Judge will be empowered to
discharge the accused and at this stage,
he is not to see whether the trial will end
in conviction or acquittal."
With the above principles, if we perused the
charge sheet it cannot be presumed that there is no case at
all to proceed against applicant. It is not the case of the
prosecution that on the basis of forged document which
was made by the applicant co-accused Atmaram got job
23 years ago. According to prosecution story, during
enquiry of the complaint filled by the Pooran Lal
applicant prepared forged ration card, marksheet etc. for
showing applicant Atmaram as Pooran Lal, in the year
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 84
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
2012-13. There are ample evidence against the applicant
on record to frame charge against him. in this regard. So,
in the considered opinion of this court, learned trial court
did not commit any mistake in framing charge against
applicant under Section 467, 468 and 471 of IPC. The
Criminal Revision has no force. So, this Criminal
Revision is hereby dismissed.

Shri Vitthal Rao Jamra, learned counsel for

Shri Himanshu Joshi, learned Panel Lawyer
for the respondent/State.
This petition has been filed under Section 482
of Cr.P.C. for quashing of FIR of Crime No.0706/2016
registered at P.S. Neelganga, Ujjain for the offence under
Section 498-A, 323 read with Section 34 of IPC.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to
the disposal of this petition are that non-applicant
No.2/complainant Smt. Kamini Akodia lodged a report
before the P.S. Mahila Thana, Indore averring that her
marriage was solemnized on 10.03.2016 with the
applicant according to Hindu customs . After marriage
she went to her matrimonial house and lived with
applicants, but they harassed her for dowry and subjected
her to cruelty. On 12.12.2016, applicants expelled her
from her matrimonial house. Since then she has been at
Indore with her brother. So action be taken against
applicant. On that report Crime No.0/2016 was registered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 85
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
at P.S. Mahila Thana, Indore against applicants and case
was transferred to P.S. Neelganga, Distt. Ujjain where
Crime No.0706/2016 for the offence under Section 498,
323 read with Section 34 of IPC was registered. Being
aggrieved from that report applicants filed this petition.
Learned counsel for the applicants submitted
that there is no legal evidence to connect applicants with
the offence. Applicants have falsely been implicated in
this case by the non-applicant No.2/complainant.
Marriage of applicant No.1 was solemnized with
complainant/non-applicant No.2 on 10.03.2016, after few
days of her marriage applicant No.1 took non-applicant
No.2 to Chhindwara but there non-applicant No.2
doubted that applicant No.1 had relations with his girl
students and tortured applicant. Applicant tried his best
for changing her mind. He took non-applicant no1 to
various tourist places but she created dispute
unnecessarily and on 19.05.2016 went to her parental
house and since then she has been living voluntarily with
her brother at Indore. Applicant filed application under
Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of
conjugal right on 16.09.2016, because of that non-
applicant No.2 lodged a false report against the applicants
in P.S. Mahila Thana, Indore. The applicant No.1 who is
working as Lecturer in P.G. College, Chhindwara never
came to Ujjain on 12.06.2016, so FIR be quashed.
On the contrary, learned counsel for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 86
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
respondent/State submitted that after investigation of FIR
Police found prima facie case against applicants for the
offence under Section 498-A, 323 r/w Section 34 of IPC.
On that Police filed charge-sheet against applicants so
there is no question of quashing of FIR of Crime
No.0706/16.Whether applicant No.1 came at Ujjain on
12.06.2016 or not is a matter of evidence. The document
filed by the applicant along with his petition is not a part
of charge-sheet so it cannot be considered for quashing
the FIR. It is the defence of applicant which is to be
proved by the applicant from his evidence, so at this stage
FIR cannot be quashed.
This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the counsel for the parties.
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of
Haryana and others V/s. Bhajan Lal and others
reported in 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 held that :-
"The power of quashing a criminal proceeding
should be exercised very sparingly and with
circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare
cases. The extraordinary or inherent powers do not
confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act
according to its whim or caprice. The court will not
be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the
reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the
allegations made in the FIR or the complaint.
The following categories of cases can be
stated by way of illustration wherein the
extraordinary power under Article 226 or the
inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC can be
exercised by the High Court either to prevent abuse
of the process of any court or otherwise to secure
the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to
lay down any precise, clearly defined and
sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or
rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of
myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 87
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
be exercised :
(1) Where the allegations made in the first
information report or the complaint, even if they
are taken at their face value and accepted in their
entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or
make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first
information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police
officers under Sections 156(1) of the Code except
under an order of a Magistrate within the purview
of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations
made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence
collected in support of the same do not disclose the
commission of any offence and make out a case
against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do
not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute
only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is
permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of
the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the
FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is
sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar
engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or
the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and
continuance of the proceedings and/or where there
is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned
Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance
of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is
manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the
accused and with a view to spite him due to private
and personal grudge."
Which shows that FIR can only be quashed
where the allegations made in the first information report
or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value
and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 89
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Section 498-A, 323 & 34 of IPC are clearly made out
against applicants. whether allegations made by the non-
applicant No.2 in the FIR are true or not cannot be
ascertained at this stage as it requires evidence.
Although Learned counsel for the applicants
in this regard placed reliance on the Hon'ble Apex
Court's judgment passed in the case of Ram Saran
Varshney and others V/s. State of Uttar Pradesh and
another reported in 2016 Cri.L.J. 1251, in which Apex
Court held that,
"Section 498A - Cruelty and harassment by in-
laws - charge-sheet filed against sisters-in-law -
All sisters-in-law are married and living separately
at different places - No clear allegation leveled
against any of them - Visit of sisters-in-law on
occasions of 'grah pravesh' and 'naming ceremony
of daughter of respondent/wife - Cannot be treated
as occasions where they harassed respondent/wife
- Initiation of proceeding against them and
consequent filing of FIR - Liable to be quashed."
But facts of this case do not match with the
present case regarding the act of applicant no.2. It is
clearly mentioned in the FIR that applicant No.2 beated
and mentally tortured her and the veracity of the
statement can be decided after evidence.
Learned counsel for the applicants also placed
reliance on the Hon'ble Apex Court's judgment passed in
the case of Bhaskar Lal Sharma and another V/s.
Monica reported in (2009) 10 SCC 604, but in this case
Apex Court after evaluating all evidence held that offence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 90
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
under Section 498-A, 406 and 34 of IPC is not made out
against accused from the prosecution evidence. While in
the instant case evidence has to be recorded .
It appears from the record that after
investigation of the report lodged by the non applicant
No.2, police found prima facie case against the applicant
and filed charge-sheet against the applicants so at this
stage only on the basis of documents filed by the
applicant along with this application it cannot be assumed
that respondent No.2 filed the report just to harass the
applicant based on false allegations.
[8] Prima facie offence under Section 498A is
clearly made out from the FIR, . Whether they are true or
not cannot be ascertained at this stage as it requires
evidence, therefore, FIR cannot be quashed. So the
petition is dismissed. Applicant is free to raise all
objections before the trial court at appropriate stage.

Magistrate, Jhabua. Learned Adjudicating Officer after
framing the charge against the appellant under Section 26
(2)(ii) read with Section 52 of Food Safety Act tried him.
After trial he found the appellant guilty for the aforesaid
offence and sentenced him with fine of Rs.5,00,000/-
against which the appellant filed an appeal before the
Sessions Judge and also filed an application under
Section 389 of Cr.P.C. for staying the fine amount during
pendency of appeal. Learned Sessions Judge rejected his
prayer by order dated 27.01.2017 and ordered that said
appeal shall not be heard without depositing the fine
amount. Being aggrieved with the same, appellant has
filed this Criminal Appeal.
[3] The only contention of the learned counsel for
the applicant is that the appellate court admitted the
appeal for final hearing. In that circumstances, appellate
court cannot ordered that appeal shall not be heard
without depositing the fine amount.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State
opposed the prayer and submitted that learned appellate
court did not commit any mistake in ordering that appeal
shall not be heard without depositing the fine amount.
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the parties. It is clear from
the record that learned trial court had already ordered that
the fine amount shall be recoverable as arrear of land
revenue from the appellant and the appellant's license for
selling of food also is suspended till depositing the
amount. Learned appellate court already admitted the
appeal for final hearing. In these circumstances, he cannot
reject the appeal without deciding it on merit. In the case
of Shyam Deo V/s. State of Bihar reported in AIR 1971
SC 1606 the Apex Cour theld that,
"In a criminal appeal it is duty of the
court to go through the records irrespective of
the fact whether the appellant appears or does
not appear, if he appears he is bound to be
heard, if not, the record should be pursued
and the appeal disposed of on the merits,
criminal court under the provisions of Section
386 of the Cr.P.C. cannot be dismissed in
default."
So, in the considered opinion of this court
learned appellate court committed mistake in holding that
without depositing the fine amount the Appeal shall not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 92
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
be heard. So this appeal is partly allowed and it is
directed that the learned appellate court shall hear the
appeal on merit as early as possible irrespective of the
fact whether the appellant deposits the fine amount or not.
Petition is disposed of accordingly.

been dismissed for want of prosecution by order dated

Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
mistakenly the counsel for the petitioner could not mark the
case in the daily cause list, therefore, could not mark his
presence on the said date of hearing. Consequently, in
absence of applicant and his counsel M.Cr.C.
No.2619/2016 was dismissed for want of prosecution. His

This petition has been filed under Section 482
of Cr.P.C. against the order dated 16.11.2016 passed by
the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Barwani in
Criminal Revision No.89/2016 whereby; he affirmed the
order dated 03.10.2016 passed by the Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Rajpur in Criminal Case No.135/2015
whereby; he rejected applicant's application filed under
Section 451/457 of Cr.P.C.for getting interim custody of
vehicle bearing registration No.HR-38-P-9425 sized by
the police in Crime No.435/2015 registered at P.S. Rajpur
for the offence under section 4/6, 9 of M.P. Gowansh
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 97
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Vadh Pratishedh Adhiniyam, 2004 (here-in-after referred
to as "Adhiniyam") and Section 5/180, 3/181 and 66/192
of Motor Vehicle Act.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to
the disposal of this petition are that Police Rajpur seized
Vehicle No.HR-38-P-9425 on illegally carrying, cow-
progeny and registered Crime No.435/2015 for the
offence under Section 4/6, 9 of M.P. Gowansh Vadh
Pratishedh Adhiniyam, 2004 and Section 5/180, 3/181
and 66/192 of Motor Vehicle Act. Applicant filed an
application for getting said vehicle in his interim custody
before the Judicial Magistrate First Class which was
rejected by the order dated 03.10.2016. Being aggrieved
from that order applicant filed Cr.R.No.89/2016 which
was also rejected by the Second A.S.J., Barwani by order
dated 11.06.2011 observing that the proceeding of
confiscation was started by the Collector, so it is not
appropriate to give interim custody of said vehicle to the
applicant. Being aggrieved with that order applicant filed
this petition.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that applicant is a registered owner of the said vehicle.
Only on the ground that confiscation proceeding was
started court cannot deny to give interim custody of
vehicle. Learned trial court as well as appellate court
committed mistake in rejecting applicant's prayer.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State
opposed the prayer and submitted that because
confiscation proceeding started against the said vehicle so
learned trial court as well as revisional court did not
commit any mistake in rejecting applicant's prayer.
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the parties. Although it
appears from the record that Collector started
confiscation proceeding against the said vehicle but it
also appears that the order of confiscation has not yet
been passed by the district magistrate. A bare reading of
Section 11(5) of M.P. Govansh Vadh Pratishedh
Adhiniyam, 2004 along with Rules 5 and 6 of M.P.
Govansh Vadh Pratishedh Rules, 2012 makes it clear that
there is no restriction in releasing the seized vehicle on
supurdginama during the pendency of confiscation
proceedings. This Court in the case of Raees V/s. State
of M.P. reported in 2013 (5) M.P.H.T. 233, has observed
that,
"mere commencement of the
confiscation proceedings before the District
Magistrate under Rules 5 and 6 of the M.P.
Govansh Vadh Pratishedh Rules, 2012 do
not oust the jurisdiction of Judicial
Magistrate/trial Court to release the seized
vehicle."

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[6] Thus, in the light of the aforesaid decisions of
this Court, in my opinion, the Courts below have
committed illegality in dismissing the application of the
applicant under Section 451/457 of the Cr.P.C. for
releasing the offending vehicle on Supurdginama.
Consequently, this petition is allowed. Order dated
16.11.2016 passed by the Second Additional Sessions
Judge, Barwani in Criminal Revision No.89/2016 and
order dated 03.10.2016 passed by the Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Rajpur in Criminal Case No.135/2015 are
hereby set aside and it is directed that on furnishing the
Supurdginama by the petitioner to the sum of
Rs.5,00,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate concerned,
the seized vehicle bearing registration No.HR-38-P-9425
be released subject to complying following conditions :-
(i) That, applicant shall produce the same before
the Trial Court as and when directed to do so.
(ii) That, in the meantime, he shall not alienate the
vehicle or make use of vehicle for any unlawful purpose;
and
(iii) that they shall not carry out any change in the
colour and outward appearance of the vehicle.

C.J.M., Dewas applicant filed an application under
Section 311 read with Section 325(3) of Cr.P.C. for
recalling the prosecution witness R.S.Jhala (PW-13) for
further cross-examination which was rejected by the
C.J.M by order dated 06.04.2017 observing that applicant
had cross-examined R.S.Jhala (PW-13) one & half years
ago and filed this application only for hindering the trial.
Being aggrieved with the order applicant filed this
petition.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that earlier at the time of recording the statement of
R.S.Jhala (PW-13), his lawyer was not present. So
applicant wants to cross-examine R.S.Jhala (PW-13)
through his counsel, so applicant filed an application for
further cross-examination of R.S.Jhala. Learned trial
court without appreciating that fact rejected applicant's
application.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 106
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State
opposed the prayer.
[5] It appears from the record that applicant's
counsel was not present earlier when Judicial Magistrate
First Class recorded the statement of R.S.Jhala (PW-13).
Applicant himself cross-examined R.S.Jhala. In these
circumstances, it is appropriate that applicant Manoj be
given an opportunity to cross-examine R.S.Jhala (PW-13)
through his counsel.. Therefore, petition is allowed and
order of C.J.M. is set aside and he is directed to call
R.S.Jhala (PW-13) for further cross-examination by
applicant No.1.
[6] It is made clear that if applicant fails to cross-
examine R.S.Jhala, on the date fixed for the same by
him,without any sufficient cause, learned trial court is
free to pass an appropriate order in this regard.
C.c. as per rules.

Shri Manoj Manav, learned counsel for the

Shri Vinay Zelawat, learned Sr. Advocate with
Shri Pratyush Mishra, learned counsel for the non-

Shri Himanshu Joshi, learned Panel Lawyer
for the non applicant no.9/State.
This Civil Revision has been filed under
Section 115 of Code of Civil Procedure against the order
dated 17.09.2016 passed by the 3rd Civil Judge Class-II,
Dewas, in Civil Suit No.34-A/2013, whereby learned
Civil Judge rejected applicant's application filed under
Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant for
the disposal of this Civil Revision are that non-applicants
No.1 to 8/plaintiffs filed a Civil Suit No.34-A/2013
before the 3rd Civil Judge Class-II, Dewas for declaring
them owner of the suit land and restraining the applicants
from interfering in possession of suit land.
During trial of the suit applicants filed an
application under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC averring that
non-applicants filed a Civil Suit declaring them owner of
suit land on adverse possession, while declaring them
owner of suit land on the basis of adverse possession is
not maintainable. Non-applicants themselves averred in
their plaint that they took information regarding partition
of suit land in the year 2009 while non-applicants filed
this Civil Suit in the year 2013, so this Civil Suit is also
time barred. Non-applicants wanted permanent injunction
on the basis of oral partition while in the revenue record
suit land recorded in joint name of applicants and non-
applicants. So, this civil suit is not maintainable. Non-
applicants also not valued their suit properly. So also this
civil suit is not maintainable and pray for rejection.
Non-applicants in their reply opposed the
prayer.
Learned trial court rejected their application
by order dated 17.09.2016 observing that non-applicants
averred in their plaint that cause of action arises in the
year 2013, from that suit is under limitation. Suit land of
applicants' is an agriculture land and on the basis of
revenue record court fees of valued suit is Rs.1,000/- and
for permanent injunction Rs.100/- and paid proper court
fees whether applicant is the owner or not of suit land on
the basis of adverse possession it requires evidence to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 108
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
decide. Being aggrieved from that order applicant filed
this Civil Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicants submitted
that applicants and non-applicants are the member of a
joint family and enjoying the suit property which is
ancestral property. On 17.08.2009, present applicant filed
an application under Section 178 of M.P.L.R.C. Before
Tehsildar, Dewas seeking partition of the suit land and
the same got registered as 06/A-27/2009-10, while the
present suit was filed by the non-applicant on 23.02.2013,
so suit is clearly time barred and also plaintiffs claimed
adverse possession on the suit land. From bare averment
of the plaint appeared that non-applicants were in
knowledge of the applicants action from the year 2009
when an application for partition was brought by the
present applicants but the civil suit was filed in the year
2013 which is filed after four years from the date of
knowledge, so it is clearly time barred. The limitation
must be calculated from the date of knowledge of the act
of action on which the suit is relied likewise declaration
of ownership of land on the basis of adverse possession
cannot be sought. The applicant filed civil suit on oral
partition held way back between the ancestors of the
applicants and non-applicants to the present suit. Though
this aspect has not been considered by the court below
that no suit can be brought by any of the parties relying
on an oral partition until and unless such petition is
reduced into writing by the parties and must be registered.
The cause of action on which the suit is relied is clearly
barred by law of registration. So learned trial court
committed mistake in rejecting applicants' application.
[4] On the contrary, learned counsel for the non
applicants submitted that issue raised by the applicants is
required evidence to decide, so learned trial court did not
commit any mistake in rejecting applicants' application.
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the parties. The issue raised
by the applicants is required evidence to decide so at this
stage the issue cannot be decided. It is settled that at the
time of deciding the application filed under Order 7 Rule
11 of CPC only averment of the plaint to see and assum
correct. Non-applicant filed Civil Suit not only for
declaration but also for injunction on the basis of
possession and clearly averred in his plaint that cause of
action arose when applicants interfered in their possession
provisions on suit land. So for the injunction this suit is
clearly maintainable. Suit on the basis of oral partition is
also maintainable. Although learned counsel for the
applicants placed reliance on the Apex Court's judgment
passed in Khatri Hotels Private Limited and another
V/s. Union of India and another reported in 2011 (4)
SCC (Civil) 484, in which Hon'ble Apex Court held that,
"Limitation Act, 1963, Article 58 - If a suit is based
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 109
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
on multiple causes of action, the period of limitation will
begin to run from the date when the right to sue first
accrues - Successive violation of the right will not give
rise to fresh cause and the suit will be liable to be
dismissed if it is beyond the the period of limitation
counted from the day when the right to sue first accrued."
But the fact of the case does not match with
the present case. In that case suit was filed restraining the
defendant from interfering in the possession of plaintiff
and from demolishing or selling, any part of existing
structure of suit house and it was found that plaintiff was
in possession of suit land for 15 years. He also placed
reliance on Apex Court's judgment passed in Ram
Prakash Gupta V/s. Rajiv Kumar Gupta reported in 2007
(11) JT 472, in which Apex Court held that,
"Civil Procedure Code, Order 7, Rule 11(d) -
Rejection of plaint - Power of trial court to reject the
complaint - Court can exercise the power at any stage of
the suit before registering the plaint or after issuing
summons to the defendant at any time before the
conclusion of the trial."
He also placed reliance on the judgment
passed in Gurudwara Prabandak Committee................
C.c. as per rules.

marriage was solemnized on 10.03.2016 with the
applicant. According to Hindu custom after marriage she
went to matrimonial house and lived with applicants, but
applicants harassed her and subjected to cruelty in
demand of dowry. On 12.12.2016, applicants expelled her
from her matrimonial house. Since then she lived at
Indore with her brother, so action be taken against
applicant. On that report Crime No.0/2016 was registered
at P.S. Mahila Thana, Indore against applicants and case
was transferred to P.S. Neelganga, Distt. Ujjain where
Crime No.0706/2016 for the offence under Section 498,
323 read with Section 34 of IPC was registered. Being
aggrieved from that report applicants filed this petition.
Learned counsel for the applicants submitted
that there is no legal evidence to connect applicants with
the offence. Applicants have been falsely implicated in
this case by the non-applicants. Marriage of applicant
No.1 was solemnized with complainant/non-applicant on
10.03.2016, but after few days of her marriage applicant
No.1 took complainant to Chhindwara but in Chhindwara
non-applicant/complainant doubted that applicant is
having relations with his students and tortured applicant.
Applicant tried his best for changing mind of
complainant. He took complainant to various tourist
places but without any reason complainant created
dispute and on 19.05.2016 went to her parental house and
since then she lived with her parents at Indore voluntarily,
because of that applicant filed application under Section 9
of Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal right on
16.09.2016, because of that non-applicant No.2 lodged a
false complaint against the applicants in P.S. Mahila
Thana, Indore and also averred that applicant came Ujjain
on 12.06.2016 and beated complainant while applicant
No.1 who is working as Lecturer in P.G. College,
Chhindwara never came Ujjain on 12.06.2016, so FIR be
quashed.
On the contrary, learned counsel for the
respondent/State submitted that after investigation of FIR
Police found prima facie case against applicants for the
offence under Section 498-A, 323 r/w Section 34 of IPC.
On that Police filed charge-sheet against applicants for
the offence under Section 498 and 506 of IPC, so there is
no question of quashment of FIR of Crime No.0706/16.
Applicant No.1 never came Ujjain on 12.06.2016 is a
matter of evidence. The document filed by the applicant
along with his petition is not a part of charge-sheet so it
cannot be considered for quashing the FIR. It is the
defence of applicant which is to be proved by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 121
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
applicant in his evidence, so at this stage FIR cannot be
quashed.
This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the counsel for the parties.
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of
Haryana and others V/s. Bhajan Lal and others reported
in 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 held that :-
"The power of quashing a criminal
proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and
with circumspection and that too in the rarest of
rare cases. The extraordinary or inherent powers do
not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to
act according to its whim or caprice. The court will
not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to
the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the
allegations made in the FIR or the complaint.
The following categories of cases can be
stated by way of illustration wherein the
extraordinary power under Article 226 or the
inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC can be
exercised by the High Court either to prevent abuse
of the process of any court or otherwise to secure
the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to
lay down any precise, clearly defined and
sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or
rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of
myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should
be exercised :
(1) Where the allegations made in the
first information report or the complaint, even if
they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any
offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first
information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police
officers under Sections 156(1) of the Code except
under an order of a Magistrate within the purview
of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations
made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence
collected in support of the same do not disclose the
commission of any offence and make out a case
against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do
not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute
only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is
permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of
the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the
FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 122
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is
sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar
engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or
the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and
continuance of the proceedings and/or where there
is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned
Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance
of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is
manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the
accused and with a view to spite him due to private
and personal grudge."
It appears that the report lodged by the
complainant/non-applicant is read as thus,

From the FIR prima facie evidence under
Section 498-A, 323 & 34 of IPC are clearly made out.
From the FIR whether allegations made by the non-
applicant No.2 in the report are true or not? it cannot be
ascertained at this stage as it requires evidence, therefore,
FIR cannot be quashed, so the petition is dismissed.
Applicant is free to raise all objections before the trial
court at the appropriate stage.
Learned counsel for the applicants in this
regard also placed reliance on the Hon'ble Apex Court's
judgment passed in the case of Ram Saran Varshney
and others V/s. State of Uttar Pradesh and another
reported in 2016 Cri.L.J. 1251, in which Apex Court
held that,
"Section 498A - Cruelty and harassment by
in-laws - charge-sheet filed against sisters-in-law -
All sisters-in-law are married and living separately
at different places - No clear allegation leveled
against any of them - Visit of sisters-in-law on
occasions of 'grah pravesh' and 'naming ceremony
of daughter of respondent/wife - Cannot be treated
as occasions where they harassed respondent/wife
- Initiation of proceeding against them and
consequent filing of FIR - Liable to be quashed."
But facts of this case do not match with the
offence registered against applicant No.1, who is the
husband of non-applicant No.2 and applicant No.2 who is
the sister of non-applicant No.2 and lived at Ujjain and it
is clearly mentioned in the FIR that applicant No.2 beated
and mentally tortured her whether the allegation is true or
false it has to be decided after evidence.
Learned counsel for the applicants placed
reliance on the Hon'ble Apex Court's judgment passed in
the case of Bhaskar Lal Sharma and another V/s.
Monica reported in (2009) 10 SCC 604, but in this case
Apex Court after evaluating all evidence held that offence
under Section 498-A, 406 and 34 of IPC is not made out
against accused but in this case trial is not supported so
this case also does not help the applicants.
C.c. as per rules.

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C. against the order dated 05.11.2016 passed by the
Additional Sessions Judge, Ujjain in Cr.R.No.249/2016
whereby, learned ASJ affirmed the order dated 26.09.2016
passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ujjain in Criminal
Case No.7754/2015 whereby; learned Judicial Magistrate First
Class, Ujjain rejected the applicant's application filed under
section 45 of Evidence act for getting the writing of questioned
cheques (bearing Nos.000033, 000034, 000035, 000036, 000037
and 000039) examined by the Handwriting Expert.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to the
disposal of this petition are that applicant is facing trial for the
offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act
for dishonour of cheques in Criminal Case No.7754/2015
pending before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ujjain.
During trial of the case on the stage of defence evidence,
applicant filed an application under Section 45 of the Evidence
Act stating that writing on the said cheques is not of the applicant
therefore, he be permitted to get the writing of the said cheque
examined by the Handwriting Expert.
Non-applicant/complainant in his reply opposed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 146
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
the prayer.
Learned trial court by the order dated 29.06.2016
rejected applicant's application observing that earlier also
applicant filed application in this regard which was rejected by
this court by order dated 19.08.2016. Applicant again filed that
application for the same cause of action which was not
maintainable. Being aggrieved with the order dated 26.09.2016
applicant filed Cr.R.No.249/2016, which was disposed of by
A.S.J. Ujjain by order dated 05.11.2016 observing that
applicant has not challenged the signatures on cheques, so there
is no need to examine the writing on the aforesaid cheques and
rejected the applicant's prayer. Being aggrieved with that order
applicant filed this petition.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
applicant clearly took the defence that said cheques had not been
filled by the applicant therefore, the applicant wanted to get the
cheque examined by Handwriting Expert for verifying his writing,
which is necessary to find out the truth. The learned trial Court as
well as the appellate Court have committed mistake in rejecting
the application.
Learned counsel for the non-applicant opposed the
prayer and submitted that applicant did not take the defence that
signature and writing on the said cheque is not of applicant. So
Trial Court as well as Revisional Court did not commit any
mistake in rejecting the applicant's application.
[3] This Court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by the learned counsel for the applicant.
The only contention of the applicant is that the name and
amount written in the said cheques is not in his handwriting
.But applicant admitted that signatures on the aforesaid cheques
are of his, so there is no need to examine the writing on the said
cheques. In the considered opinion of this Court learned Trial
Court as well as Revisional Court did not commit any mistake
in rejecting the applicant's prayer. Hence, the petition has no
force and is hereby rejected.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 147
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Heard finally at the motion stage with the consent
of both the parties.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act against the order
dated 17.10.2016 passed by the First Additional Principal
Judge, Family Court, Indore in M.J.C.1069/2015, whereby
learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore allowed the
non-applicant's prayer and directed the applicant to pay
Rs.4,000/- per month as interim maintenance.
[2] Brief facts of this case which are relevant to the
disposal of this petition are that non-applicant filed an
application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. for getting
maintenance from the applicant before the First Additional
Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore averring that she is a
legally wedded wife of applicant. Her marriage was
solemnized with applicant on 30.06.2012. She is unable to
maintain herself, while applicant is able to maintain her but
not maintaining her without any sufficient reason. so
applicant be directed to pay Rs.30,000/- per month as
maintenance. She also filed an application for getting interim
maintenance during trial of the case.
Applicant in his reply opposed the prayer.
Learned First Additional Principal Judge, Family
Court, Indore by order dated 17.10.2016 allowed the
application and directed the applicant to pay Rs.4,000/- as
interim maintenance to the non-applicant during trial of the
case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 148
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
non-applicant was earlier employed with SKS Institute of
Technology and Science and Index Medical College and
presently also works as HR Administrator and is able to
maintain herself. So she is not entitled to get interim
maintenance. On the other hand, applicant is a Govt.
employee and getting salary only of Rs.23,663/- and his
mother, who is suffering from various diseases is also
dependent upon him and approximately Rs.20,000/- per
month are spent on the treatment of his mother and domestic
expenses. Learned trial court without appreciating that fact
wrongly directed the applicant to pay Rs.4,000/- per month as
interim maintenance to non-applicant. Non-applicant also
filed an application under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act
before the Family court, Rewa during trial of that case.
Learned Family Court, Rewa also directed the applicant to
pay Rs.3,000/- per month to non-applicant by order dated
28.09.2016 passed in H.M.A. Case No.02A/2016. So non
applicant is not entitled to get interim maintenance .
[4] On the other hand, learned counsel for the non-
applicant submitted that non-applicant is unable to maintain
herself. The applicant is in Govt. job and earning salary of
Rs.23,663/- and able to maintain non-applicant. So learned
trial court did not commit any mistake in directing the
applicant to pay Rs.4,000/- per month as interim maintenance
to the non-applicant. Although Principal Judge, Family court,
Rewa also directed applicant to pay Rs.3,000/- per month as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 149
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
interim maintenance to non-applicant in H.M.A. Case
No.02A/2016 but that case was filed by the applicant against
non-applicant under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act in
the Family Court, Rewa. Non-applicant resides at Indore so
for defending that case, and traveling from Indore to Rewa
money is also required while applicant gets salary of
Rs.23,663/- per month. So looking to the applicant's salary
and the inflation interim maintenance awarded by the First
Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore is not on
higher side and prays for rejection.
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by the learned counsel of both the parties.
Although applicant submitted that non-applicant presently
works as HR Administration but he has not filed any
document showing that non-applicant presently works in any
institution. On the contrary non-applicant clearly denied the
above fact. It is admitted that the non-applicant is a legally
wedded wife of applicant so it is the duty of the applicant to
maintain her. Applicant himself admitted that he is getting
Rs.23,663/- per month as salary. So looking to the salary of
applicant amount of interim maintenance awarded by the
First Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore does
not appear to be on higher side on any count .
Although Principal Judge, Family Court, Rewa
also in H.M.A. Case No.02A/2016 directed the applicant to
pay Rs.3,000/- per month during trial of that case, but that
case was filed by the applicant himself in Rewa knowingly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 150
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
that non-applicant lived in Indore, so non-applicant has to
spend money for defending the case and traveling from
Indore to Rewa. So, on the ground that Principal Judge,
Family Court, Rewa also directed the applicant to pay
Rs.3,000/- per month to the non-applicant in H.M.A. Case
No.02A/2016, the order passed by the First Additional
Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore in MJC No.1069/2015
whereby; he directed the applicant to pay Rs.4,000/- per
month as interim maintenance to the non-applicant cannot be
set aside.
So petition has no force and is hereby rejected.
C.c. as per rules.

M.Cr.C. No.4040/2010
06.04.2017
Shri V.A.Katkani learned counsel for the
applicant.
None for the respondent.
This M.Cr.C. has been filed under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C. against the order dated 05.02.2010 passed by the
Special Judge/Additional Sessions Judge, Ratlam in
Cr.R.No.13/2010 whereby, learned ASJ rejected the
applicant's Revision for enhancement of amount of interim
maintenance awarded by the Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Ratlam and sustained the order dated 04.11.2009 passed by
the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ratlam in MJC No.15/09
whereby learned JMFC allowed the applicant's application
and directed the non-applicant to pay Rs.1,200/- per month as
interim maintenance to the applicant.
[2] Brief facts of this case which are relevant to the
disposal of the petition are that applicant filed an application
under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Ratlam averting that she is a legally wedded wife
of the non-applicant and is unable to maintain herself, while
applicant is having agricultural land measuring 3.100 hectare
at Village Mundadi, Tehsil Ratlam And able to maintain her
but not maintaining her without any sufficient cause. So non-
applicant be directed to give Rs.5,000/- as maintenance and
applicant also filed an application for directing non-applicant
to pay Rs.5,000/- per month as interim maintenance during
trial of the case.
Non-applicant opposed the prayer and submitted
that applicant is voluntarily living separately and is not
entitled to get any maintenance. He took a loan on
agricultural land and burden of repayment of that loan is on
him, so he is unable to give maintenance to the applicant.
Learned trial court allowed the applicant's prayer
and directed the non-applicant to pay Rs.1,200/- per month as
interim maintenance to the applicant. Being aggrieved from
the amount awarded by the trial court applicant filed
Cr.R.No.13/2010 before the Additional Sessions Judge for
enhancement of that amount and non-applicant also filed
Cr.R.No.383/09 for setting aside that order. Learned Special
Judge/Additional Sessions Judge, Ratlam disposed both the
Criminal Revisions by a common order dated 05.02.2010 and
rejected both the revisions. Being aggrieved from that order
applicant filed this petition.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
applicant is a 60 years' old blind lady and not able to maintain
herself, while applicant is having 3.100 hectare agriculture
land at Village Mundadi, Tehsil Ratlam and earns Rs two
lakh from that land. Looking to the inflation, the amount that
will be given is very low. Learned trial court as well as
revisional court without giving attention to the fact and the
income of non-applicant wrongly awarded only Rs.1,200/- as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 162
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
interim maintenance, so the amount be enhanced.
[4] None appeared from the non applicant
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by the learned counsel for the applicant.
[6] Learned trial court as well as revisional court
found that non-applicant has 13-14 Bigha agriculture land yet
awarded only Rs.1,200/- as interim maintenance to the
applicant, who is blind which is clearly on lower side
Looking to the inflation, so it is appropriate that the amount
of interim maintenance be enhanced from Rs.1,200/- to
Rs.4,000/- per month. So revision is allowed and it is directed
that non applicant shall pay Rs.4,000/- per month as interim
maintenance to the applicant from the date of order of this
court during trial of the case. It also appeared that the
maintenance application of applicant, who is blind was
pending since 2009, so trial court is also directed to dispose
of the application within six months.

Criminal Revision No.792/2016
04.04.2017
Shri Rakesh Sharma, learned counsel for the
applicant Chandar Singh.
Shri Himanshu Joshi, learned Panel Lawyer
for the respondent/State.
Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against the
order dated 29.04.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Dhar in S.T.No.373/15 whereby; he framed charge
against applicant for the offences under Sections 115 and
120B of IPC.
[2] According to prosecution story, present
applicant (Chander Singh Dangi) contracted with Arjun
for killing complainant Hardev Singh Jaat. So on
24/08/2115 Mayank, Arjun, Amit, Mohit and Vinkesh
came on a motorcycle to Ghatabillod for murdering
complainant. At that time, co-accused Mohit had a
country made pistol and wanted to fire on complainant
but was unable to fire due to crowd. On 25.08.2015, in
the evening Mayank narrated the incident to complainant
Hardev Singh Jaat on which Hardev Singh Jaat lodged a
written report at Police Chowki Ghatabillod. On that
report Crime No.403/2015 was registered at Police
Station Pithampur for the offence under Section 115, 120-
B of IPC against applicants Chander Singh, and co
accused Mayank, Arjun, Amit, Mohit and Vikensh.
During investigation Police seized one country made
pistol from the possession of co-accused Mohit, mobile
from, co-accused Arjun, one mobile and a motorcycle
bearing registration No.MP09-QD-5100 from the
possession of co-accused Vinkesh @ Mama, one
motorcycle bearing registration No.MP09-NT-6754 and
mobile from the possession of Mayank and also one
mobile phone from the possession of Amit and after
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 172
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
completion of investigation chargesheet was filed against
the applicant and other co accused. On that charge sheet
ST No.373/2015 was registered. During trial of the case
by order dated 29.04.2016 learned A.S.J., Dhar framed
charges against the applicants for the offence under
Sections 115 and 120-B of IPC. Being aggrieved from
that order applicant filed this Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that there is no prima facie evidence against the applicant
that he had entered into conspiracy with other co-accused
persons. also there is no evidence against co-accused
Mayank, Arjun, Amit, Mohit and Vinkesh regarding an
attempt to cause any injury to complainant. It shows that
the Police has falsely implicated the present applicant in
the case. There is no evidence that applicant committed
any offence against the complainant Hardev Singh Jaat.
Learned Trial Court committed mistake in framing charge
against the applicant for the offence under Section 115
and 120-B of IPC.
[4] Learned counsel for the State opposes the
prayer and submitted that there is ample evidence on
record to frame charge against the applicant. So learned
trial court did not commit any mistake in framing charge
against the applicant for the offence under Section 115
and 120-B of the IPC.
[5] We have gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the parties.
[6] As regards scope of Sections 227 and 228 of
the Criminal Procedure Code, Apex court in his
judgement Sajjan Kumar vs C.B.I (2010) 9 SCC 368.
observed as thus:- On consideration of the authorities
about the scope of sections 227 and 228 of the Code, the
following principles emerge:-
(i) The Judge while considering the
question of framing the charges under
Section 227 of the Cr.P.C. has the undoubted
power to sift and weigh the evidence for the
limited purpose of finding out whether or not
a prima facie case against the accused has
been made out. The test to determine prima
facie case would depend upon the facts of
each case.
(ii) Where the materials placed before the
Court disclose grave suspicion against the
accused which has not been properly
explained, the Court will be fully justified in
framing a charge and proceeding with the
trial.
(iii) The Court cannot act merely as a Post
Office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution
but has to consider the broad probabilities of
the case, the total effect of the evidence and
the documents produced before the Court,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 173
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
any basic infirmities etc. However, at this
stage, there cannot be a roving enquiry into
the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the
evidence as if he was conducting a trial.
(iv) If on the basis of the material on
record, the Court could form an opinion that
the accused might have committed offence, it
can frame the charge, though for conviction
the conclusion is required to be proved
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has
committed the offence.
(v) At the time of framing of the charges,
the probative value of the material on record
cannot be gone into but before framing a
charge the Court must apply its judicial mind
on the material placed on record and must be
satisfied that the commission of offence by
the accused was possible.
(vi) At the stage of sections 227 and 228,
the Court is required to evaluate the material
and documents on record with a view to find
out if the facts emerging therefrom taken at
their face value discloses the existence of all
the ingredients constituting the alleged
offence. For this limited purpose, sift the
evidence as it cannot be expected even at that
initial stage to accept all that the prosecution
states as gospel truth even if it is opposed to
common sense or the broad probabilities of
the case.
(vii) If two views are possible and
one of them gives rise to suspicion only, as
distinguished from grave suspicion, the trial
Judge will be empowered to discharge the
accused and at this stage, he is not to see
whether the trial will end in conviction or
acquittal.
[7] If the the evidence collected by the
prosecution against applicant is analysed in the light of
above principles laid down by the Apex Court the only
allegation against the applicant is that he entered into a
conspiracy with other co-accused Mayank, Arjun,
Vinkesh @ Mama, Amit and Mohit for murdering Hardev
Singh Jaat and applicant instigated co-accused Mayank,
Arjun, Vinkesh @ Mama, Amit and Mohit For this and
also gave proposal of Rs.5,00,000/- for murdering Hardev
Singh Jaat but there is no substantive evidence on record
to frame charge against applicant in this regard.
[8] Although in the written report lodged by
Hardev Singh Jaat and the case diary statement of
complainant Hardev and Purshotam it is mentioned that
applicant instigated co-accused Mayank, Arjun, Vinkesh
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 174
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
@ Mama, Amit and Mohit for murdering Hardev Singh
Jaat and gave proposal of giving Rs.5,00,000/- for
murdering Hardev Singh Jaat, but report lodged by the
complainant Hardev and case diary statement given by
complainant Hardev and Purshtomon is based only on the
information given to them by co accused Mayank.
[9] While Mayank is not a prosecution witness in
the case. Police also did not make approver to Mayank.
Although police also recorded the statement of Other
witnesses Sumer Singh and Dhiraj Rathore who are the
witness of recovery of pistol from the possession of other
co-accused Mohit not against applicant. There is no other
witness of the alleged incident. Although Police also filed
list of mobile call details, regarding conversation between
co-accused on mobile phone at relevant time but the
mobile call details only shows that on the date of incident
co-accused talked with each other but only on the basis it
can not be inferred that applicant hatched conspiracy with
other co-accused for murdering Hardev Singh Jaat.
[10] So the only evidence, which was collected by
the police against the applicant, is the extra-judicial
confession alleged to have been made by co-accused
Mayank.
[11] It is trite law that a confession made by a co-
accused is not a substantive piece of evidence. There is a
marked difference between the probative value of the
confession of an accused vis-à-vis the confession of a co-
accused .The confession made by an accused, if found
voluntary and true, can be made basis for his own
conviction. The confession of a co-accused is no evidence
at all and it cannot be used as a foundation for conviction
of the accused, who is not maker thereof, though the same
can, indeed, be used as a supporting piece of evidence
against the accused, who is not the maker thereof.
[12] A reference, in this regard, may be made to
Kashmira Singh Vs The State of Madhya Pradesh
AIR 1952 SC 159, wherein the Supreme Court observed
as follows:
"The confession of an accused person is not
evidence in the ordinary sense of the term as
defined in Section 8. It cannot be made the
foundation of a conviction and can only be
used in support of other evidence. The
proper way is, first, to marshal the evidence
against the accused excluding the confession
altogether from consideration and see
whether, if it is believed a conviction could
safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief
independently of the confession, then, of
course it is not necessary to call the
confession in aid. But cases may arise, where
the Judge is not prepared to act on the other
evidence as it stands even though, if
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 175
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a
conviction. In such an event, the Judge may
call in aid the confession and use it to lend
assurance to the other evidence and, thus,
fortify himself in believing what without the
aid of the confession he would not be
prepared to accept."
[13] Apex Court in Hari Charan Kurmi and
Jogia Hajam V/s. State Of Bihar reported in 1964 AIR
1184 also held that,
"though a confession mentioned in Section
30 of the Indian Evidence Act is not
evidence as defined by Section 3 of the Act,
it is an element which may be taken into
consideration by the criminal courts and in
that sense, it may be described as evidence
in a non-technical way. But in dealing with
a case against an accused person, the court
cannot start with the confession of a co-
accused person, it must begin with other
evidence adduced by the prosecution and
after it has formed its opinion ,with regard
to the quality and effect of the said
evidence, then it is permissible to turn
to the confession in order to lend assurance
to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial
mind is about to reach on the said other
evidence."
[14] Which shows that the confession of the co-
accused can be used as a supporting piece of evidence for
lending assurance to the other evidence on record and it
can also be used in order to fortify the Court in believing
that the conclusion that it had reached on the basis of
other evidence that the accused is guilty is correct.
[15] While In the present case if the evidence of
the confession of the co-accused, namely, Mayank, is
kept excluded from the purview of this Court's
consideration, there is no other evidence, either direct or
circumstantial, showing, far less proving, applicant's
involvement in the said crime.
[16] So there is no substantial piece of evidence on
record to frame the charge against applicant. In absence
of other evidence only on the basis of extra judicial
confession of co accused Mayank which is only a
Corroborative piece of evidence against applicant and
alone can not be made basis of conviction, charge can not
be framed against applicant for the offence offences
under section 115 and 120-B of IPC. learned trial court
committed mistake in framing charge against accused for
the offences under section 115 and 120-B of IPC.
[17] Hence, the revision is allowed and applicant is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 176

discharged for the charges under section 115 and 120-B

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing Criminal Case
No.15718/12 pending before the Judicial Magistrate First
Class, Indore.
[2] Brief facts of the case relevant to disposal of this
petition are that non-applicant filed a private complaint
before the trial court averring that non-applicant sold soya oil
to applicant worth Rs.20,00,000/- on credit and thereafter an
agreement relating to assignment of debt was executed on
03.07.2008 between the applicant and non-applicant whereby
it was agreed that the debt due for Rs.9,10,930/- towards non-
applicant shall stand transferred to Jayanta Bhattacharya, who
was in debt towards applicant for amount of Rs.19,38,187.77
and Jayanta Bhattacharya shall be liable to pay the debt
directly to non-applicant and the 50% of excess amount of
outstanding dues i.e. Rs.9,10,930/- shall be repaid by non-
applilcant to the authorized representative of applicant.
Jayanta Bhattacharya was immediately informed on
03.07.2008 regarding execution such agreement and
compliance of the same by applicant as well as non-applicant.
In compliance of that agreement Jayanta Bhattacharya issued
cheque in favour of the non-applicant for the amount of
Rs.19,38,000/- bearing cheque No.937521 dated 16.07.2008,
however, the said cheque was dishonored and Jayanta
Bhattacharya have refused to give money to the non-applicant
on the ground that a money receipt dated 20.05.2009 was
given by the applicant to Jayanta Bhattacharya to the effect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 185
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
that the applicant has received amount of Rs.20,00,000/- from
Jayanta Bhattacharya and the same is transferred to J.K.
Chemicals, Indore on behalf of Chaitanya Agro Products with
full and final settlement and applicant committed cheating
with non-applicant so cognizance be taken against applicant
and Jayanta Bhattacharya. Learned trial court by order dated
09.07.2012 took cognizance only against applicant for the
offence under Section 420 of the IPC. Being aggrieved with
that order applicant filed this petition.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
the debt due on applicant to non-applicant was legally
transferred as per Section 130, 132 of Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 by execution of agreement/MOU in consonance,
concurrence and knowledge of the non-applicant and the said
document is completely valid as per law and even not
questioned by the non-applicant and, therefore, after
execution of such agreement and as per law applicant cannot
be held liable to pay such debt to the non-applicant and the
non-applicant has to avail all remedies under law only against
assignee of the debt and not against the applicant. Non-
applicant also filed complaint against Jayanta Bhattacharya
for dishonoring of the cheque. It is not the case of the
complainant that the representations made by applicant in the
agreement i.e. Jayanta Bhattacharya owes debt to applicant
worth Rs.19,38,187.77 is false and, therefore, the applicant
cannot be said to have committed the offence of cheating as
the agreement was good in law without any
misrepresentations. The non-applicant has not alleged in the
complaint that the applicant had the dishonest intention of
cheating right from inception whereas the basis of complaint
is the averment made in Para 9 of complaint which contains
the narration that Jayanta Bhattacharya has alleged that the
applicant has committed offence of cheating but this cannot
be made basis of implication of applicant without any actual
overt act. The applicant is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in the case. There is no legal evidence to connect
the applicant with the aforementioned crime. The trial court
without any application of mind rightly took cognizance
against the applicant.

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure for directing respondents No.1 to 3
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 205
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
for registering FIR against respondents No.4 & 5.
[2] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
applicant is a company and involved in production of Soybean
product like DOC etc. and also having solvent extraction plant at
Mahidpur Road, Village Champla Khedi, District Ratlam.
Applicant company and respondents No.4 and 5 took over Marvel
Agrex Limited Company as per memorandum of understanding
on 26.12.2006. The applicant company supplied Indian Solvent
Extracted Toasted Yellow Soyabean Meal to M/s. Bishan Saroop
Ramkrishna Agro Private Ltd. in lieu of payment of that goods M/
s. Bishan Saroop Ramkrishna Agro Private Ltd. gave three
Demand Draft worth Ro.90.00 Lacs each and One D.D worth of
Rs.30 Lacs. That draft was received by non applicant No.3 and 4
on behalf of applicant company. After receiving that Demand
Draft non applicant No.4 and 5 informed the applicant company
that they had deposited that Demand Draft in the account of
company and a copy of deposit receipt was also provided to
applicant by the non applicant No.4.
[3] After some time applicant came to know that non
applicant no. 4 and 5 opened an account in Bank of India and on
forged documents and illegally misappropriated Rs.3 Crores
belonging to petitioner company and committed offence under
section 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B of IPC. On that applicant
company lodged a report against respondents No.4 & 5 but Police
is not registering FIR against respondents No.4 and 5 and not
taking action against them with an ulterior and mala fide motive
while said offences are cognizable offence. So respondents No.1
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 206
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
to 3 be directed to register FIR against respondents No.4 and 5 on
applicant's complaint.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State opposed the
prayer and submitted that police had enquired the matter
regarding which a civil suit also pending in the Court of District
Judge Indore between both the parties. So, FIR was not registered.
If applicant is aggrieved, he is free to file private complaint before
the competent court and pray for rejection.
[5] This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the parties. Applicant filed this
petition for issuing direction to respondents No.1 to 3 for
registering FIR against respondents No.4 and 5 on the complaint
filed by the petitioner before the police.
[6] This Court had gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the parties, according to provisions of
section 154 to 156 Cr.P.C. where a person has approached the
Police Station under Section 154 of the Code, but the Police does
not register FIR as contemplated under law, he has a right to make
a complaint to the Superintendent of Police concerned in terms of
Section 154(3) of the Code and such Superintendent of Police
concerned exercising the powers of an officer in charge of a
police station would investigate the matter himself or direct the
investigation to be conducted by another police officer
subordinate to him. If there is inaction on the part of the Station
House Officer and the Superintendent of Police, the complainant
is at liberty to move the jurisdictional Magistrate under Section
156(3) Cr.P.C.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 207
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[7] While dealing with the exercise of power under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. by the Magistrate, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of Lalita Kumari V/s. State of U.P. & Others
reported in 2014(2) SCC 1, held that,
"The registration of First
Information Report is mandatory in
Cognizable offences and action will be
taken against the police officer for his
failure to register a First Information
Report on the complaint of a cognizable
offence.
If action is not taken by the
superior officer under Section 154 (3) of
the Code, then any person has a right to
invoke the power of the court under
Section 156(3) of the Code. The
Legislature provides a specific protection
in terms of Section 156(3) of the Code
and gives right to a person to approach
the court of competent jurisdiction for
issuance of direction to the police officer
to investigate the matter in accordance
with law."
[8] The Bombay High Court in the case of State of
Maharashtra V/s. Shashikant Shinde reported in 2013 All MR
(Cri) 3060, held that,
"when a petition or complaint is
presented before the Magistrate, in which
a request is made for taking action as
mentioned in Section 2(d) of the Code,
the Magistrate is expected to apply his
mind. The Magistrate has to ascertain as
to whether the contentions made in the
petition /complaint constitute any
offence. If they constitute some offence
then the Magistrate is expected to take
decision as to whether the matter needs
to be referred to police for investigation
as provided in section 156(3) of the Code
or he needs to proceed further as
provided in Section 200 and subsequent
Sections of Chapter XV of the Code.
There is a discretion with the Magistrate
in this regard. Though police officer is
duty bound to register case on receiving
information of cognizable offence, the
Magistrate is not bound to refer the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 208
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
matter to police under section 156(3) of
the Code."
And a Three-Judge Bench of Apex Court in
Ramdev Food Products(P) Ltd. V/s. State of Gujarat, (2015) 6
SCC 439 has held that,
"the direction under Section 156(3) is to
be issued, only after application of mind
by the Magistrate. When the Magistrate
does not take cognizance and does not
find it necessary to postpone instance of
process and finds a case made out to
proceed forthwith, direction under the
said provision is issued. In other words,
where on account of credibility of
information available, or weighing the
interest of justice it is considered
appropriate to straightaway direct
investigation, such a direction is issued.
Cases where Magistrate takes cognizance
and postpones issuance of process are
cases where the Magistrate has yet to
determine "existence of sufficient ground
to proceed".
[9] Apex court also in Priyanka Srivastava Vs State of
U.P. reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287, held as follows;
"In our considered opinion, a stage has
come in this country where Section
156(3) Cr.P.C. applications are to be
supported by an affidavit duly sworn by
the applicant who seeks the invocation of
the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That
apart, in an appropriate case, the learned
Magistrate would be well advised to
verify the truth and also can verify the
veracity of the allegations."
[10] Regarding maintainability of petition directly in the
High Court for registering the FIR Hon'ble Apex Court in his
judgment passed in Sakiri Vasu V/s. State of U.P. & others
reported in (2008) 2 SCC 409 clearly observed that :-
"If a person has a grievance that
his FIR has not been registered by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 209
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
police station his first remedy is to
approach the Superintendent of Police
under Section 154(3) Cr.P.C. or other
police officer referred to in Section 36
Cr.P.C. If despite approaching the
Superintendent of Police or the officer
referred to in Section 36 his grievance
still persists, then he can approach a
Magistrate under Section 156(3)
Cr.P.C. instead of rushing to the High
Court by way of a writ petition or a
petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
Moreover, he has a further remedy of
filing a criminal complaint under
Section 200 Cr.P.C. Why then should
writ petitions or Section 482 petitions be
entertained when there are so many
alternative remedies?
As we have already observed
above, the Magistrate has very wide
powers to direct registration of an FIR
and to ensure a proper investigation and
for this purpose he can monitor the
investigation to ensure that the
investigation is done properly (though he
cannot investigate himself). The High
Court should discourage the practice of
filing a writ petition or petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. simply because a
person has a grievance that his FIR has
not been registered by the police, or after
being registered, proper investigation has
not been done by the police. For this
grievance, the remedy lies under Sections
36 and 154 (3) before the police officers
concerned, and if that is of no avail,
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the
Magistrate or by filing a criminal
complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C. and
not by filing a writ petition or a petition
under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
It is true that alternative remedy is
not an absolute bar to a writ petition, but
it is equally well settled that if there is an
alternative remedy the High Court should
not ordinarily interfere."
[11] The same view has been reiterated by the apex court
in Sudhir Bhaskarrao Tambe V/s. Hemant Yashwant Dhage
and others (2016) 6 SCC 277 observing in paras 2 and 3, as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 210
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
follows:-
"This Court has held in Sakiri Vasu v.
State of UP (2008) 2 SCC 409 that if a
person has a grievance that his FIR has
not been registered by the police, or
having been registered, proper
investigation is not being done, then the
remedy of the aggrieved person is not to
go to the High Court under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India, but to approach
the Magistrate concerned under Section
156(3) CrPC. If such an application under
Section 156(3) CrPC is made and the
Magistrate is, prima facie, satisfied, he
can direct the FIR to be registered, or if it
has already been registered, he can direct
proper investigation to be done which
includes in his discretion, if he deems it
necessary, recommending change of the
investigating officer, so that a proper
investigation is done in the matter. We
have said this in Sakiri Vasu case because
what we have found in this country is that
the High Courts have been flooded with
writ petitions praying for registration of
the first information report or praying for
a proper investigation." "3. We are of the
opinion that if the High Courts entertain
such writ petitions, then they will be
flooded with such writ petitions and will
not be able to do any other work except
dealing with such writ petitions. Hence,
we have held that the complainant must
avail of his alternate remedy to approach
the Magistrate concerned under Section
156(3) CrPC and if he does so, the
Magistrate will ensure, if prima facie he
is satisfied, registration of the first
information report and also ensure a
proper investigation in the matter, and he
can also monitor the investigation."
[12] So in the light of above pronouncements it emerges
that if there is inaction on the part of the Station House Officer
and the Superintendent of Police, the complainant is at liberty to

Shri Vinay Sarraf, learned counsel for the
applicant.
Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Dy. Govt. Advocate
for the respondent/State.
Heard.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure for directing respondents
No.1 to 3 for registering FIR against respondents No.4 & 5.
[2] Brief facts of the case are that applicant lodged
report against respondents No.2 & 3 at P.S. Bhanwarkuwa,
Indore averring that applicant is a company and involved in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 215
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
production of Soyabean product like DOC etc. and also
having solvent extraction plant at Mahidpur Road, Village
Champla Khedi, District Ratlam. Applicant company and
respondents No.4 and 5 took over Marvel Agrex Limited
Company as per memorandum of understanding on
26.12.2006. Applicant company was having an account
bearing No.880720110000040 with Bank of India,
Sanyogitaganj Branch, Indore, which was closed vide letter
dated 20.11.2007. The applicant company obtained term loan
of Rupees Nine Crores and working capital of Rupees Ten
Crores from Punjab National Bank, Manorama Ganj Branch,
Indore.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
company lodged a report against respondents No.4 & 5 for
the offence under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B of
IPC regarding misappropriation of Rupees Three Crores by
forged documents and forged payslip but Police with an
ulterior and mala fide motive has not recorded FIR against
respondents No.4 and 5 and not taking action against them,
so respondents No.1 to 3 are directed to lodge FIR against
respondents No.4 and 5.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State opposed
the prayer and submitted that petition is not maintainable and
also submitted that respondents No.1 to 3 are not bound to
register FIR from the complaint of applicant. If applicant is
aggrieved, he is free to file private complaint before the
competent court and pray for rejection.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 216
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
04. According to provisions of section 154 to 156 Cr.P.C.
Where a person has approached the police station under
Section 154 of the Code, but the police does not register FIR
as contemplated under law, he has a right to make a
complaint to the higher authorities in terms of Section 154(3)
of the Code and such higher authority exercising the powers
of an officer in charge of a police station would investigate
the matter himself or direct the investigation to be conducted
by another police officer subordinate to him.
[5] Applicant filed this petition for issuing direction
to respondents No.1 to 3 for registering FIR against
respondents No.4 and 5 on the complaint filed by the
petitioner before the police.
[6] Hon'ble Apex Court in his judgment passed in
Sakiri Vasu V/s. State of U.P. & others reported in (2008) 2
SCC 409 clearly observed that :-
"If a person has a grievance that
his FIR has not been registered by the
police station his first remedy is to
approach the Superintendent of Police
under Section 154(3) Cr.P.C. or other
police officer referred to in Section 36
Cr.P.C. If despite approaching the
Superintendent of Police or the officer
referred to in Section 36 his grievance
still persists, then he can approach a
Magistrate under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.
instead of rushing to the High Court by
way of a writ petition or a petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. Moreover, he has a
further remedy of filing a criminal
complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C.
Why then should writ petitions or Section
482 petitions be entertained when there
are so many alternative remedies?
As we have already observed
above, the Magistrate has very wide
powers to direct registration of an FIR
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 217
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
and to ensure a proper investigation and
for this purpose he can monitor the
investigation to ensure that the
investigation is done properly (though he
cannot investigate himself). The High
Court should discourage the practice of
filing a writ petition or petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. simply because a
person has a grievance that his FIR has
not been registered by the police, or after
being registered, proper investigation has
not been done by the police. For this
grievance, the remedy lies under Sections
36 and 154 (3) before the police officers
concerned, and if that is of no avail,
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the
Magistrate or by filing a criminal
complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C. and
not by filing a writ petition or a petition
under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
It is true that alternative remedy is
not an absolute bar to a writ petition, but
it is equally well settled that if there is an
alternative remedy the High Court should
not ordinarily interfere."
[7] The Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the
case of State of Maharashtra V/s. Shashikant Shinde
reported in 2013 All MR (Cri) 3060, held that,
"when a petition or complaint is
presented before the Magistrate, in which a
request is made for taking action as
mentioned in Section 2(d) of the Code, the
Magistrate is expected to apply his mind.
The Magistrate has to ascertain as to whether
the contentions made in the petition
5/complaint constitute any offence. If they
constitute some offence then the Magistrate
is expected to take decision as to whether the
matter needs to be referred to police for
investigation as provided in section 156(3)
of the Code or he needs to proceed further as
provided in Section 200 and subsequent
Sections of Chapter XV of the Code. There
is a discretion with the Magistrate in this
regard. Though police officer is duty bound
to register case on receiving information of
cognizable offence, the Magistrate is not
bound to refer the matter to police under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 218
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
section 156(3) of the Code."
[8] Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Hemant Yashwant
Dhage V/s. State of Maharashtra and others reported in ..............
also held that,
"We are of the opinion that if the
High Courts entertain such writ petitions,
then they will be flooded with such writ
petitions and will not be able to do any other
work except dealing with such writ petitions,
then they will be flooded with such writ
petitions and will not be able to do any other
work except dealing with such writ petitions.
Hence, we have held that the complainant
must avail of his alternative remedy to
approach the concerned Magistrate under
Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C. and if he does so,
the Magistrate will ensure, if prima facie he
is satisfied, registration of the first
information report and also ensure a proper
investigation in the matter, and he can also
monitor the investigation."
[9] The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case of
Lalita Kumari V/s. State of U.P. & Others reported in
2014(2) SCC 1, held that,
"The registration of First Information
Report is mandatory in Cognizable offences
and action will be taken against the police
officer for his failure to register a First
Information Report on the complaint of a
cognizable offence.
If action is not taken by the superior
officer under Section 154 (3) of the Code,
then any person has a right to invoke the
power of the court under Section 156(3) of
the Code. The Legislature provides a
specific protection in terms of Section
156(3) of the Code and gives right to a
person to approach the court of competent
jurisdiction for issuance of direction to the
police officer to investigate the matter in
accordance with law."
[10] So petition is rejected with a directed that if
police not registered FIR on the complaint of petitioner, he
will be free to avail alternative remedy to approach the

Heard on IA No.1124/17, which is an application
filed under Order XXII Rule 3 of CPC for bringing LRs of
sole appellant Ambalal on record and IA No.1125/17,
which is an application under Order XXII Rule 9 of CPC
for setting aside the abatement of this appeal and IA
No.1126/17, which is an application filed under Section 5
of the Limitation Act for condoning delay in filing
application.
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that
appellants are the legal heir of appellant Ambalal, who died
on 30.07.2016. Because appellants did not know regarding
pendency of this Civil Suit, so they could not file
application for bringing them on record in time. Delay is
bona fide, so delay caused in filing application under Order
XXII Rule 3 of CPC be condoned and abatement be also
set aside and appellants be taken on record in place of
appellant Ambalal.
Learned counsel for the respondent opposed the
prayer and submitted that the cause shown by the
appellants for not filing application within time is not
correct, so application be rejected.
It is clearly mentioned that because they did not
know regarding pendency of this Civil Appeal, so they
could not file the application for bringing them on record in
time. Appellant Basantilal also filed an affidavit in support
of his application, wherein he had clearly mentioned that
on 13.01.2017 he came to know for the first time that
appeal is also pending in the High Court. Respondents did
not file any written affidavit. There is no reason to
disbelieve his statement. Looking to the reasons assigned
by the appellants in the applications, applications (IA
No.1124/2017, IA No.1125/2017 & IA No.1126/2017) are
allowed and the appellants are permitted to incorporate

Shri R.S.Parmar, learned Panel Lawyer for the
respondent/State.
Heard on I.A.No.2172/2017, which is an
application for temporary suspension of sentence for one
month filed by appellant No.2 Ravi S/o Nandlal Patidar and
grant of bail.
This appeal has been filed against the judgment
dated 08.02.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge,
Manasa, Distt. Neemuch in ST No.57/14 by which the
appellant No.2 Ravi was convicted under Sections 394 read
with Section 398 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 10 years
rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default of
payment of fine to undergo one year's rigorous imprisonment.
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that
appellant is a permanent resident of District Neemuch. There
is no apprehension of his running during the pendency of this
appeal. The Mundan Snaskar of appellant's son is on
16.04.2017 in which appellant's presence is necessary, so
appellant would be released on bail for a period of one
month.
Learned counsel for the respondent/State opposed
the prayer.
In the considered opinion of this court it is not
appropriate to give interim bail to the appellant for the
programme of Mundan Sanskar of his son, therefore, no case
for temporary suspension of sentence as prayed is made out.
Hence, application (IA No.2172/2017) stands rejected.
Let the matter be listed for final hearing in due
course.

Heard on objection put forth by the office
regarding maintainability of this appeal.
[2] This Criminal Appeal has been filed against the
order dated 11.11.2016 passed by the learned Special Judge,
SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Dhar, District Dhar in
Special Case No.121/2016; whereby he framed charges
against applicant for the offences under Section 294, 323/34
and 506B of the IPC and Section 3 (1-X) of Scheduled Caste
and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.
[3] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that
according to Section 14-A of the Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 237
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
appeal shall lie, from any judgment, sentence or order, not
being an interlocutory order, of a Special Court or an
Exclusive Special Court, to the High Court both on facts and
on law. The order against which he filed this appeal is not an
interlocutory order and is a final order so appeal shall lie
against the impugned order.
[4] On the other hand, learned counsel for the State
submitted that the order of framing charge is not a final order.
It is an interlocutory order so appeal shall not lies against that
order.
Section 14-A of the Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act reads as
thus :-
"14A. (1) Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973, an appeal shall lie, from any judgment,
sentence or order, not being an interlocutory
order, of a Special Court or an Exclusive
Special Court, to the High Court both on facts
and on law.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in
sub-section (3) of Section 378 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973, an appeal shall lie
to the High Court against an order of the
Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court
granting or refusing bail.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in
any other law for the time being in force,
every appeal under this section shall be
preferred within a period of ninety days from
the date of the judgment, sentence or order
appealed from :
Provided that the High Court may entertain
an appeal after the expiry of the said period of
ninety days if it is satisfied that the appellant
had sufficient cause for not preferring the
appeal within the period of ninety days:
Provided further that no appeal shall be
entertained after the expiry of the period of
one hundred and eighty days.
(4) Every appeal preferred under Sub-
Section (1) shall, as for as possible, be
disposed of within a period of three months
from the date of admission of the appeal."
Which shows that appeal shall lie only against the
judgment, sentence or order not being an interlocutory order
while order framing charge against the appellant filed this
appeal is an interlocutory order. Full Bench of Hon'ble Apex
Court in its judgment passed in V.C.Shukla V/s. State
through CBI reported in AIR 1980 Supreme Court 962
clearly held,
"The order of framing the charges is purely
an interlocutory order as it does not terminate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 238
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
the proceedings but the trial goes on until it
culminates in acquittal or conviction. It is true
that if the Special Court would have refused
to frame charges and discharged the accused,
the proceedings would have terminated but
that is only one side of the picture. The other
side of the picture is that if the Special Court
refused to discharge the accused and framed
charges against him, then the order would be
interlocutory because the trial would still be
alive."
[5] So it is clear from the above pronouncement that
order of framing charges is an interlocutory order. While
according to provisions of section 14-A of SC & ST
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act. an appeal shall lie, from any
judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order.
Hence, this Criminal Appeal filed by the appellant against the
order of framing charges against him by Special Judge SC/ST
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Dhar is not maintainable.
Hence, this Criminal Appeal is rejected without commenting
on merit with the liberty that appellant is free to challenged
the impugned order according to law.

Criminal Revision No.1401/2016
21.03.2017
Shri Umesh Mansore, learned counsel for the
applicant.
Shri S.K.Meena, learned counsel for the
respondent.
Heard finally at the motion stage with the consent
of both the parties.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 19 (4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 read with
Sections 397 of Cr.P.C. against the judgment dated
29.09.2016 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court,
Dhar in M.Cr.C. No.31/2015, whereby learned Judge rejected
the applicant's application filed under Section 125 of Cr.P.C.
for getting maintenance from the non-applicant.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that applicant filed an
application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. before the trial court
for getting maintenance from the non-applicant stating that
her marriage was solemnized with non-applicant on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 257
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
25.04.2013. After marriage she resided with non-applicant
but only after four months of her marriage non-applicant and
his mother Nirmala Bai started harassing her for dowry and
subjected her to cruelty and demanded Rs.200000/- Non-
applicant often beated her and confined her into a room not
giving food for 2-3 days. Non-applicant also bought one plot
on installment and pressurize applicant to ask her father to
deposit the installment of plot. On 30.01.2015, non-applicant
and his father, mother and sister told the applicant to call her
father and ask him for sending Rs.2,00,000/- otherwise they
would kill her. When applicant denied, they beated her. On
that applicant left non-applicants' house and lodged report
against them. Non Applicant works in a private company and
earns Rs.18,000/- per month and is able to maintain her but
refused to do so without any reason. So non-applicant be
directed to pay Rs.10,000/- per month as maintenance.
In his reply non-applicant opposed the prayer and
denied all the allegations and averred that he, his parents or
his sister never demanded dowry or never harassed or beated
the applicant. He also never demand money from applicant.
Behaviour of applicant herself is not good with the non-
applicant and his family members. Also she has filed false
report against the non-applicant and his family members.
Applicant works in parlour, teaches children and also does
sewing work and earns Rs.15,000/- per month and is able to
maintain herself, while non-applicant earns only Rs.4,000/-
per month and is unable to maintain the applicant. Applicant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 258
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
without any reason is living separately from the non applicant
and, therefore, he prays for rejection of her application .
[3] Learned trial court rejected the applicant's prayer
observing that applicant is living separately from the non-
applicant without any sufficient reason and is also able to
maintain herself. Being aggrieved with that order applicant
filed this Revision.
[4] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
from the evidence produced by the applicant it is clearly
proved that non-applicant and his family members demanded
dowry from the applicant and subjected her to cruelty. Non-
applicant used to beat her so she has sufficient reason to live
separately from the non-applicant and she is also unable to
maintain herself. While non-applicant is able to maintain her
but is not doing so without any sufficient reason. So applicant
is entitled to get maintenance from applicant. Learned trial
court committed mistake in rejecting applicant's prayer.
[5] On the other hand learned counsel for the non-
applicant submitted that learned Trial Court after evaluating
all the evidence rightly held that applicant is living separately
from the non-applicant without any sufficient reason and is
able to maintain herself. So she is not entitled get
maintenance from non applicant and prayed for rejection of
applicant's Revision.
[6] This court gone has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by both the parties.
[7] As regards the finding of trial court, that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 259
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
applicant is living separately from non-applicant without
sufficient reason, it disbelieved her statement in this regard
only on the ground that her statement did not match with her
pleadings and that statements of applicant and her witnesses
Bhagwan Goyal (PW-2) and Shardabai (PW-3) also do not
match with each other. But this finding of trial court does not
appear to be correct.
[8] Proceedings under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. are in
summary nature and the person seeking the remedy is
ordinarily a helpless person, the provision should be liberally
construed without injustice to the deserted wife and the
provisions regarding pleadings and proofs is not strictly
followed in the proceedings. In the maintenance proceeding
only on the basis of totality of evidence it would be seen that
whether applicant having sufficient reason to live separately
or not?
[9] Applicant Sangeetabai (PW-1) clearly stated in
her statement that her marriage was solemnized with non-
applicant on 25.04.2013 and after marriage she lived with
non-applicant but only after 15 days of marriage applicant
started harassing her and demanded money for plot, levelled
false allegations against her and also doubted her character
and her father-in-law demanded Rs.2,00,000/- as dowry.
Non-applicant used to beat her. Once when she fell ill, non-
applicant did not even take her to hospital. Then her parents
came to her matrimonial house and took her to hospital for
treatment. On 30.01.2015, her mother-in-law beated her by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 260
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
stick because she had not brought Rs.2,00,000/- from her
father. She sustained injury in her head and so she left her
matrimonial house and was forced to live with her parents.
Her statement is also corroborated by statement of other
witnesses Bhagwan Goyal (PW-2) and Shardabai (PW-3)
parents of the applicant, who also deposed that non-applicant
and her family members demanded dowry from the applicant
and used to harass her and subjected her to cruelty.
[10] Although non-applicant Pankaj denied from that
fact and deposed that he never demanded dowry and never
beated the applicant and on the contrary applicant's behaviour
was not good with him and his parents and wants to live
separately from his parents and always quarreled with him
and pressurized him to live separately from his parents, but
his statement does not appear to be trustworthy. Applicant
himself in his reply admitted that Police registered a crime
against him on applicant's report. If applicant and his
family's behaviour was good with applicant why she would
have left non-applicant's house and gave statement against
non-applicant about his bad behaviour.
[11] Although statement of applicant, her father
Bhagwan Goyal (PW-2) and mother Shardabai (PW-3)
regarding harassment do not match with each other regarding
the incident of harassment but in totality, from their
statements it is clear that non-applicant's behaviour was not
good with applicant which forced her to live separately from
the non-applicant.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 261
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[12] Applicant's mother Shardabai (PW-3) clearly
stated that they are willing to sent her daughter to her
matrimonial house but non-applicant is not ready to keep her
with him. Applicant's father Bhagwan Goyal (PW-2) also
deposed that her daughter wanted to go to her matrimonial
house but non-applicant did not depose in his statement that
he is willing to keep her with him. From his statement it does
not appear that he made any genuine effort to persuade
applicant to live with him. It also shows that non-applicant
himself is not willing to keep applicant with him.
[13] In these circumstances, it is clearly proved from
the evidence that applicant has sufficient reason to live
separately from non-applicant besides non-applicant himself
does not want to keep applicant with him. Learned trial court
committed mistake in holding that applicant failed to prove
that she did not have sufficient reason to live separately from
the non-applicant.
[14] Learned counsel for the non-applicant submitted
that applicant neither pleaded in her application nor deposed
in her examination-in-chief that she is unable to maintain
herself. On the contrary applicant in her cross-examination
clearly admitted that she teaches in a private school and earns
Rs.4,000/- to 5,000/- per month which shows that applicant is
able to maintain herself but this argument does not appear to
be correct.
[15] Although applicant neither in her application nor
in her examination-in-chief deposed that she was unable to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 262
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
maintain herself but in her application filed for getting
interim maintenance she clearly pleaded that she is
unemployed and unable to maintain herself. That application
is also a part of her main application . Moreover in her cross-
examination also she denied from the suggestion she is doing
job at Dhar presently, which shows that applicant is not able
to maintain herself.
[16] Although applicant deposed in her cross-
examination that earlier she did teaching job and earns
Rs.4,000/- to Rs.5,000/- but that job was done by the
applicant when she was living in her matrimonial house at
Indore not after filing of application. Only on the ground that
she is having capacity to earn does not mean that she is able
to maintain herself. The potential ability to earn will not be
considered. The 'able body' concept cannot be extended to
the case of wife for this will defeat the very object of the
legislation. The holding of an employment sometime back
does not mean she has the capacity and is able to maintain
herself
[17] Although non-applicant deposed in his statement
that applicant works as Teacher but did not file any
documentary evidence nor stated in his statement as in which
school did the applicant work. So non-applicant's statement
that applicant works as Teacher does not appear to be correct.
In these circumstances, it is also proved that applicant is not
able to maintain herself.
[18] Applicant stated that non-applicant works in
private company and earns Rs.18,000/- per month. Although
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 263
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
non-applicant in his statement denied the fact that he works in
a private company and deposed that at he is unemployed
presently and only did labour work and earns only Rs.3,000/-
per month. But here also his statement does not appear to be
correct because non-applicant himself in his reply of main
application stated that he is doing job and earns Rs.4,000/-
per month and in reply of interim maintenance application
stated that he is doing job and earns Rs.5,000/- per month
which shows that non-applicant gave false statement in his
court statement for hiding his income. These days daily
wages worker earns Rs.7,000/- to Rs.8,000/- per month. Non-
applicant also did not state that he is unable to work because
of any physical disability. So it can easily be assumed that his
income is minimum Rs.7,000/- to Rs.8,000/- per month.
[19] From the above discussion, it is clearly proved
that applicant has sufficient reason to live separately from the
non-applicant and is unable to maintain herself while
applicant, who is able to maintain her is not doing so without
sufficient reason. So Revision is allowed and judgment of the
Trial Court is set aside and non-applicant is directed to pay
Rs.3,000/- per month as maintenance to the applicant from
date of the order of trial court i.e. 29.09.2016.

Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Dy. Govt. Advocate for

Heard on IA No.3010/2014, which is an application
filed under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of CPC for restraining the
respondents No.1 to 3 from interfering in possession of the
appellant in suit land Survey No.639 area 1.275 hectare
situated at Village Morgaon, Tehsil Sardarpur, District Dhar
during pendency of appeal.
Appellant stated in his application (IA
No.3010/2014) that he is in possession of the suit land and
also wanted to transfer the suit land to others. So, respondents
No.1 to 3 be directed not to interfere in the possession of the
appellant on suit land and not to transfer it to another person
during pendency of appeal.
Respondents No.1 to 3 in their reply opposes the
prayer and submitted that they are in possession of the suit
land and not the appellant. Learned trial court after evaluating
all the evidence in his judgment clearly held that the suit land
is in possession of the respondent and not the appellant and
also restrained him from interfering in respondent's
possession of suit land. So there is no prima facie case in
favour of appellant for allowing his application and prayed
for rejection.
This court has gone through the record and
arguments put forth by the counsels for both the parties. It is
clear from the trial court's judgment that trial court after
evaluating all the evidence clearly held that appellant had
failed to prove that he was in possession of the suit land. On
the contrary it was proved that respondents No.1 to 3 are in
possession of suit land and trial court also decreed the
counter claim of respondents No.1 to 3 and restricted the
appellant from interfering in possession of respondents in the
suit land. In revenue papers Khasra (Ex.P/1) also it is
mentioned that suit land is in possession of the respondents.
So there is no prima facie case in favour of the appellant to
grant stay in his favour, hence IA No.3010/2014 has no merit
and is hereby rejected.
Appeal is already admitted, so list it for final hearing

This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against the
order dated 21.07.2016 passed by the Second Additional
Sessions Judge, Dhar, in Criminal Appeal No.341/2015;
whereby learned Judge has affirmed the judgment of
acquittal dated 28.07.2015 passed by the Judicial
Magistrate First Class, Dhar in Criminal Case
No.3178/2008; whereby learned Magistrate acquitted the
respondents from the charge for the offence under
Sections 294 (2 counts), 323 (3 counts), 323/149 (3
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 268

counts) and 506 Part-II (2 counts) and Sections 25(1-B)
(a) and 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms Act.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that on 25.09.2008
complainant Shakuntalabai lodged report against non-
applicants at P.S. AJK, Dhar mentioning that she with
other villagers of Golupura had gone to Morgaon for
cutting Soyabean crop. Balaram stoped them from doing
so and when they were about to return to their home, non-
applicants Narayan, Badri, Raghu and Suresh came there
and stopped them and non-applicant Badri fired with gun
and non-applicants beated complainant Shakuntalabai,
Rukminibai and Yashwant. Non-applicant Balaram
beated Yashwant by sword. Yashwant sustained injury in
his right palm. When Rukminibai tried to rescue
Yashwant, Balaram assaulted her by sword and
Rukminibai sustained injury in her left hand thumb. Non-
applicant Suresh also beated Yashwant by hand and fists
and Raghu also assaulted Yashwant by Dhariya and also
threatened to kill them. On that report police registered
Crime No.50/2008 for the offence under Sections 341,
291, 506, 324, 323, 352 and 427 of the IPC and
investigated the matter and after investigation filed
chargesheet against the non-applicants. Thereafter, on
that chargesheet Criminal Case No.3178/2008 was
registered against the non-applicants.
[3] Learned trial court framed the charges against
the non-applicants for the offence under Sections 341,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 269
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
291, 506, 324, 323, 352 and 427 of the IPC and tried the
case, however, after trial learned Judicial Magistrate First
Class acquitted the non-applicants from the aforesaid
charges, against which applicant filed Cr.A.No.341/2015
in the court of Second Additional Sessions Judge, Dhar,
who again rejected the appeal. Being aggrieved with the
judgment applicant filed this Criminal Revision.
[4] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that it is clearly proved from the statement of complainant
Shakuntalabai (PW-1) which is also corroborated by the
statement of Yashwant (PW-2). Rukminibai (PW-6),
Vinod (PW-8), Kamal (PW-9) and from the medical
reports of complainant Shakuntalabai and other injured
Rukminibai clearly proved that in the incident non-
applicants abused and beated Shakuntalabai, Rukminibai
and Yashwant and threatened to kill them. Learned Trial
Court as well as Appellate Court had committed mistake
in acquitting non-applicants from the aforesaid charge.
[5] Learned counsel for the respondents submitted
that there is no reliable evidence on record for convicting
the non-applicants No.1 to 5. The Trial Court as well as
Appellate Court has rightly acquitted the non-applicants
and prays for rejection.
[6] This Court has gone through the record and
the arguments put forth by learned counsels of both the
parties.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 270
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Andhra Pradesh and Another reported in AIR 1962
SC1788 a three-Judge Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court
while dealing with the power of the High Court for
directing retrial ruled as thus:
"It is true that it is open to a High Court
in revision to set aside an order of
acquittal even at the instance of private
parties, though the State may not have
thought fit to appeal; but this
jurisdiction should in our opinion be
exercised by the High Court only in
exceptional cases, when there is some
glaring defect in the procedure or there
is a manifest error on a point of law and
consequently there has been a flagrant
miscarriage of justice. Sub Section (4)
of Section 439 forbids a High Court
from converting a finding of acquittal
into one of conviction and that makes it
all the more incumbent on the High
Court to see that it does not convert the
finding of acquittal into one of
conviction by the indirect method of
ordering retrial, when it cannot itself
directly convert a finding of acquittal
into a finding of conviction. This places
limitations on the power of the High
Court to set aside a finding of acquittal
in revision and it is only in exceptional
cases that this power should be
exercised. "
But in the case in hand there is no exceptional
circumstance as such to intervene in the finding of
acquittal. Both the Courts trial Court as well appellate
Court after evaluating all the evidence produced by the
prosecution held that prosecution failed to prove his case
beyond reasonable doubt against respondents. So there is
no scope in the revision to appreciate the evidence of
prosecution for the purpose that another view on the basis
of the evidence brought on record is possible.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 271
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[8] Even otherwise, there are many contradictions
and omissions in the statements of complainant
Shakuntalabai and injured and other eye witnesses
regarding the incident. Their statements are also not
corroborated by medical evidence. According to
prosecution story, non-applicant had beated complainant
Shakuntalabai. But Shakuntalabai herself did not depose
in her statement that non-applicants beated her. Likewise
she deposed that non-applicants beated Rukminibai and
Yashwant by sword and dhariya, which are sharp cutting
weapons but that is also not corroborated by the medical
reports, so in the considered opinion of this court learned
trial court as well as appellate court have not committed
any mistake in acquitting the accused/non-applicants
No.1 to 5 from the aforesaid charges, hence, Revision has
no force. So, this Revision Petition is hereby dismissed.

Shri Z.A. Khan, learned senior counsel with Shri Ramesh
Gangare, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2.
Shri Himanshu Joshi, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent No.3/State.
This revision has been filed by the applicant under
Section 397 & 401 of Cr.P.C. against the judgment dated
29.07.2015 passed by II Additional Sessions Judge, Dewas in
criminal Appeal No.160/2014 whereby he has affirmed the
judgment of acquittal dated 10.07.2014 passed by Judicial
Magistrate First Class- Dewas in Criminal Case
No.2831/2009 whereby learned Magistrate has acquitted the
respondents from the charges under Sections 498-A, 323,
294, 506, 34 of IPC.
As per prosecution case, on 04.09.2009
complainant/applicant lodged the report against respondent
No.1 and 2 at Police Station Kotwali, Dewas averting that she
married with the respondent No.1 in the year 1999 and after
nine months of her marriage respondents No.1 & his brother
respondent No. 2 used to harass her physically and mentally
and when she wanted money for her survival they used to
beat her and did not give money for her survival. Whenever
she went out from the house they abused her at public places
and threatened to kill her if she filed any complaint against
them. On 04.09.2009 at 10:00 am, when she demanded
money from the respondents for her daily requirements, they
beat her and threatened to kill her. On that report, crime
No.831/2009 was registered at Police Station Kotwali Indore,
under Section 498-A, 323, 294, 506, 34 of IPC and after the
investigation charge-sheet was filed against respondents No.1
& 2. On that charge-sheet criminal case No.2831/2009 was
registered and learned JMFC tried them after framing charges
under Sections 498-A, 323/34, 294, 506 part II of IPC against
respondents . But after trial learned JMFC acquitted the
accused from the charges against which applicant filed the
criminal appeal No.160/2014 in the Court of II Additional
Sessions Judge, Dewas, who again rejected the appeal. Being
aggrieved this revision has been filed.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
it is clearly proved from the statement of the complainant
which is also corroborated by the medical report Ex.P/2
proved by Dr. Kailashlal Devda (PW.6) that respondents used
to harass the applicant and subjected her to cruelty.
Therefore, trial Court as well as Appellate Court had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 279
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
committed mistake in acquitting respondent No.1 & 2 from
the said charges.
Learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2
submitted that there is no evidence on record for convicting
the respondents. The trial Court as well as appellate Court
have rightly acquitted the respondents. He also placed
reliance on apex Court judgment passed in the case of
Bindeshwari Prasad Singh @ B.P. Singh vs. State of Bihar
reported in AIR 2002 SC 2907, and judgment passed by
Division Bench of this Court in the matter of Maya Bai and
another vs. Bhajan Lal and others [2005(2) MPLJ] page
37 and further submitted that judgment of acquittal cannot be
overturned in revision merely on the ground that another view
on the basis of the evidence brought on record is possible.
In K.Chinnaswamy Reddy v. State of Andhra
Pradesh and Anr AIR 1962 SC1788 a three-Judge Bench of
Hon'ble Apex Court while dealing with the power of the High
Court for directing retrial ruled as thus:
"It is true that it is open to a High
Court in revision to set aside an order
of acquittal even at the instance of
private parties, though the State may
not have thought fit to appeal; but this
jurisdiction should in our opinion be
exercised by the High Court only in
exceptional cases, when there is some
glaring defect in the procedure or there
is a manifest error on a point of law
and consequently there has been a
flagrant miscarriage of justice. Sub
Section (4) of Section 439 forbids a
High Court from converting a finding
of acquittal into one of conviction and
that makes it all the more incumbent
on the High Court to see that it does
not convert the finding of acquittal into
one of conviction by the indirect
method of ordering retrial, when it
cannot itself directly convert a finding
of acquittal into a finding of
conviction. This places limitations on
the power of the High Court to set
aside a finding of acquittal in revision
and it is only in exceptional cases that
this power should be exercised. "
But in the case in hand there is no exceptional circumstance
as such to intervene in the finding of acquittal. Both the
Courts trial Court as well appellate Court after evaluating all
the evidence produced by the prosecution held that
prosecution failed to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt
against respondents. So there is no scope in the revision to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 280
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
appreciate the evidence of prosecution for the purpose that
another view on the basis of the evidence brought on record is
possible. Even otherwise, it appears from the statement of
complainant that she had clearly admitted in her cross-
examination that respondents are not giving money for her
necessary expenses and when she demanded money they
quarreled with her due to which she lodged the report. Apart
from that there is no dispute between her and the respondents.
Looking to her cross examination, It is clear that allegations
leveled by her in the FIR against respondents are not correct.
Although Dr. Kaliash (PW.6), who examined the applicant
and prepared the medical report Ex.P/4 deposed that on
examination he found three bruises on her body. But He
clearly stated that he examined the applicant on 01.09.2009
and duration of injuries was within 24 hours while
complainant lodged the report on 04.09.2009 and it is not
mentioned in the report that respondent beat her on
01/09/2009. So in considered opinion of this Court the trial
Court as well as appellate Court have not committed any
mistake in acquitting the accused respondents No.1 & 2 from
the aforesaid charges, therefore, this revision stands
dismissed.

[1] As far as divorce is concerned applicant took a plea
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 289
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
that he got divorce from non-applicant by mutual divorce
deed (Ex.D/2), so he is not bound to pay maintenance to
non-applicant, so burden of proving that plea was on
applicant. Although applicant deposed that non-applicant is
having affair with another boy and she wanted to marry
with that boy and she disliked the applicant and was
pressurizing applicant for giving her divorce. So he
divorced the non-applicant in presence of her family
members. The divorce deed (Ex.D/2) was executed by him
and non-applicant both voluntarily in front of family
members of non-applicant but non-applicant clearly denied
that fact and deposed that applicant and his father came her
parental house and forcibly took her signatures on some
blank stamp papers. Applicant for proving Ex.D/2 not
produced any witness of that deed. Regarding that deed
statement of Sakina Khan (DW-2) mother of applicant and
Shakur Khan (DW-3) father of applicant and Vahid Khan
(DW-4) also contradictory. Applicant not stated in his
statement that from which place Ex.D/2 was executed.
Sakina Khan (DW-2) mother of applicant deposed in Para
5 of her cross-examination that non-applicant sent the
divorce deed through his brother to her. Shakur Khan
(DW-3) deposed that divorce deed executed on
Mandleshwar and that deed wrote by brother of non-
applicant. He was not present during that proceeding.
Vahid Khan (DW-4) deposed that at Mandleshwar Ex.D/2
was executed and that deed wrote by brother of non-
applicant. While it is not mentioned that on which place the
deed was executed, even in that deed where it is mention
that he gave divorce on ^^rqedks rykd nsrk gwa] rqedks
rykd nsrk gwa] rqedks rykd nsrk gwa**. There is no
signature of applicant. Even it is also mentioned that after
getting Mehar and dowry non-applicant signed the divorce
deed. Although applicant also filed Ex.D/3 receipt of
getting Mehar by non-applicant but on that deed executed
by Bilkis Bi, non-applicant so from Ex.D/2 it is not proved
that applicant got divorce from non-applicant with consent.
Learned trial court did not commit any mistake in holding
that applicant failed to prove that he got divorce from the
non-applicant.
[2] As far as non-applicant lived separately from the
applicant concerned, non-applicant clearly deposed in her
statement that behaviour of applicant and his family
members was not good with her. He used to demand dowry
and harass her and pressuring her for bring dowry of
Rs.1,00,000/- and a motorcycle. On 20.03.2014, applicant
beated her and sent her to her parental house. At that time
she lived for two months in her parental house. After that
applicant brought back her in her matrimonial house and
told that if she would fulfil the demand of dowry then she
will be allowed to live in her matrimonial house, so she
was forced to live with her parents. Although applicant
denied the fact and deposed that he never demanded dowry
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 290
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
and harass the non-applicant. The behaviour of non-
applicant herself was not good with him and she used to
quarrel with him and his family members and told that she
did not want to live with him and told that she wanted
divorce from him because she is having affair with another
boy and she left his house. He took her back after
compromise. At that time non-applicant admitted that in
future she will not quarrel with applicant but after that
again she used to quarrel with him and voluntarily left her
matrimonial house, but his statement is not appeared to be
correct because non-applicant did not want to live with
applicant and wanted to marry with another boy that's why
she would go in her matrimonial house after compromise.
[3] Although learned counsel for the applicant
submitted that it is clearly appeared from Ex.D/1
compromise deed, which is executed by non-applicant that
her behaviour with applicant was not good but applicant's
argument has no force. Although in Ex.D/1 it is mentioned
that non-applicant admitted that in future she will not
quarrel with applicant and obey her parents-in-law's order
but in that deed it is also mentioned that applicant admitted
that he will never raise hand on non-applicant which is
corroborated by the non-applicant's statement that applicant
used to beat her, so on Ex.D/1 it cannot be assumed that
behaviour of non-applicant is not good with applicant.
From Ex.D/2 it is clear that applicant did not want to keep
non-applicant with him, so learned trial court also not
committed mistake in holding that non-applicant having
sufficient reason to live separately from the applicant.

Shri Hemant Vaishnav, learned counsel for the
respondent.
Heard finally at the motion stage with the consent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 294
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
of both the parties.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under
Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 read with
Sections 397/401 of Cr.P.C. against the order dated
03.12.2015 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court,
West Nimar Mandleshwar in M.Cr.C.No.3/2015, whereby
learned Judge allowed the non-applicant's application filed
under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. and directed the applicant to
pay her Rs.5,000/- per month as maintenance.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that non-applicant filed
an application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. for getting
maintenance from the applicant before the Principal Judge,
Family Court, West Nimar Mandleshwar contending that she
is the legally wedded wife of applicant. Her marriage was
solemnized with applicant on 18.04.2012. At the time of
marriage applicant told her that he worked at Mumbai as
Manager in ICICI Bank and earned Rs.12,00,000/- per annum
also assured that within two or three months of marriage he
would take flat on rent in Mumbai and bring non-applicant to
Mumbai and that she had to live with his parents at Nagda
only for two to three months. After marriage she resided at
her matrimonial home at Nagda, with non-applicant only for
10 days and applicant went to Mumbai thereafter . Before
leaving for Mumbai he assured that in a 2 or 2-1/2 months he
would get a house on rent and would bring non applicant to
Mumbai but applicant did not bring her to Mumbai as
promised and talked rudely with non-applicant on phone so
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 295
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
she was forced to live with applicant's parents at Nagda. The
behaviour of applicant's parents sisters was also not good
with her. They used to harass her for dowry and subjected her
to cruelty. On the eve of Diwali applicant came to Nagda.
Then she again asked applicant to take her to Mumbai. At
that time, applicant told her that he did not have money to
take a house on rent at Mumbai, and would take her only if
she would get Rs.40,00,000/- from her parents for buying a
flat in Mumbai, otherwise she would have to live with his
parents at Nagda. In December, 2012 applicant again came to
Nagda from Mumbai and non-applicant again requested
applicant to take her to Bombay on which applicant beated
her and she left the matrimonial house and was forced to live
with his parents. She is unable to maintain herself, while
applicant is a Senior Manager in ICICI Bank and gets salary
of Rs.1,00,000/- per month and able to maintain her but
refused to do so without any sufficient reason, so applicant be
directed to give her Rs.13,000/- per month as maintenance.
Applicant in his reply denied the allegations
levelled by the non-applicant against him and averred that he
and his family members neither demanded dowry nor
misbehaved with her. He never gave false assurance to non-
applicant and since he was unable to keep non-applicant with
him at Mumbai, he left his job of Mumbai and is presently
unemployed. He wants to keep non-applicant with him so had
filed an application under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act
for Restitution of Conjugal Right. The non-applicant is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 296
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
without any sufficient reason voluntarily living with her
parents and runs a coaching class in Khargone and earns
Rs.5,000/- to Rs.6,000/- per month and is able to maintain
herself while applicant only earns Rs.3,50,000/- per annum.
Applicant is maintaining his old parents and unmarried sisters
also , so he is unable to give maintenance to the non-applicant
and prays for rejection.
Learned trial court after recording evidence
allowed the non-applicant's application and directed the
applicant to pay Rs.5,000/- per month as maintenance to the
non-applicant observing that non-applicant had sufficient
reason to live separately with applicant and is unable to
maintain herself, while the applicant is able to maintain her
but not doing so without any sufficient reason. Being
aggrieved with this order applicant filed this Criminal
Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
it is clear from the evidence that applicant without any
sufficient reason voluntarily lives separately from applicant
and is also able to maintain herself while applicant is
unemployed presently and unable to maintain the non-
applicant. The trial Court has committed mistake in directing
the applicant to pay Rs.5,000/- per month as maintenance.
[4] On the other hand, learned counsel for the non-
applicant submitted that it is clear from the evidence that
applicant works in ICICI Bank as Manager and earns
Rs.30,000/- per month. Learned counsel for the non-applicant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 297
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
also submitted that from the evidence it is clearly proved that
non-applicant is having sufficient reason to live separately
from applicant and is unable to maintain herself. So, learned
trial court did not commit any mistake in directing the
applicant to pay Rs.5,000/- per month as maintenance to non-
applicant. She also filed an application as cross objection to
enhance the maintenance amount.
[5] Regarding the trial court's finding that non-
applicant has sufficient reason to live separately from the
applicant, non-applicant in her statement clearly deposed that
her marriage was solemnized with applicant on 18.04.2012 at
Nagda. After marriage she lived with applicant at Nagda. At
the time of marriage applicant told her that he worked at
Mumbai as Manager in ICICI Bank and earned
Rs.12,00,000/- per annum also assured that within two or
three months of marriage he would take flat on rent in
Mumbai and bring non-applicant to Mumbai and that she had
to live with his parents at Nagda only for two to three months.
After marriage she resided at her matrimonial home at Nagda,
with non-applicant only for 10 days and applicant went to
Mumbai thereafter. Before leaving for Mumbai he assured
that in a 2 or 2-1/2 months he would get a house on rent and
would bring non applicant to Mumbai but applicant did not
bring her to Mumbai as promised and talked rudely with non-
applicant on phone so she was forced to live with applicant's
parents at Nagda. The behaviour of applicant's parents and
sisters was also not good with her. They used to harass her for
dowry and subjected her to cruelty. On the eve of Diwali
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 298
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
applicant came to Nagda. Then she again asked applicant to
take her to Mumbai. At that time, applicant told her that he
did not have money to take a house on rent at Mumbai, and
would take her only if she would get Rs.40,00,000/- from her
parents for buying a flat in Mumbai, otherwise she would
have to live with his parents at Nagda. In December, 2012
applicant again came to Nagda from Mumbai and non-
applicant again requested applicant to take her to Bombay on
which applicant beated her. Applicant used to tell her that he
only married her for serving his parents and so he would not
take her to Mumbai. On this she returned to her parental
house in February, 2014 and is living with her parents since
then. Applicant never came to take her back Non-applicant's
statement is also corroborated by the statement of Manish
Panwar (PW-2) and Dashrath Singh (PW-3).
Applicant also in his statement did not clearly
denied from the fact. Although he deposed that he could not
take non-applicant to Mumbai as he did not have a flat where
he could live with non-applicant but he used to come to
Nagda to meet non-applicant but non-applicant clearly denied
this fact that applicant came to Nagda every month. So there
is no reason to disbelieve her statement that applicant did not
keep her with him at Mumbai. After marriage from
18.04.2012 to January, 2014 she lived at Nagda with
applicant's parent and sisters. This behaviour of applicant
comes under purview of cruelty that he had left his wife alone
with his parents at Nagda and lived separately in Mumbai
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 299
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
against his promise.
[6] Learned counsel for the applicant also submitted
that applicant filed an application under Section 9 of Hindu
Marriage Act to keep non-applicant with him but non-
applicant was not keen to live with applicant and is living
voluntarily with her parents. But this argument also has no
force as from non-applicant's statement which is also
corroborated by applicant himself, it is clear that after
marriage i.e. from 18.04.2012 to January, 2014 non-applicant
lived with applicant's parents at Nagda and applicant never
tried to take her to Mumbai. Moreover in his statement
applicant did not state that he was ready to keep her in
Mumbai with him if she returned back. So learned trial court
did not commit any mistake in holding that non-applicant has
sufficient reason to live separately from applicant.
[7] Non-applicant in her statement clearly stated that
she is unable to maintain herself. Although applicant in his
statement deposed that non-applicant runs coaching classes
and also has a house in Choti Khargone which she has let on
rent and earned Rs.4,000/- to Rs.5,000/- per month from
rental and also earned Rs.4,000/- to Rs.5,000/- per month
from coaching but applicant did not produce any
documentary and other reliable evidence in this regard so
there is no reason to disbelieve non-applicant's statement that
she is not able to maintain herself.
[8] Although applicant in his statement stated that
earlier he worked in ICICI bank in Mumbai but is presently
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 300
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
unemployed but has not filed any documentary evidence
showing that he left this job. On the contrary applicant
himself filed his payslips Ex.D/2 to ExD/5 which shows that
applicant works in ICICI company at Mumbai. In Ex.D/3
payslip for the month of October, 2014 mentioning that
applicant gets Rs.30,831/- per month as salary.
[9] Although learned counsel for the applicant
submitted that burden of maintenance of parents and
unmarried sisters is also on him but he cannot deny paying
maintenance to his wife only on that ground because she is
also his responsibility. Learned trial court directed the
applicant to give only Rs.5,000/- per month as maintenance
which is only 1/6 of applicant's one month's pay, so it cannot
be said excess in any case .
It is clear from the aforesaid discussion that
learned trial court did not commit any mistake in awarding
Rs.5,000/- per month as maintenance to the non-applicant, so
revision has no force and deserves to be rejected. Hence, this
revision is hereby dismissed.
Although non-applicant also filed an application
under Order 41 Rule 22 of CPC as cross-objection, but in
Section 19 (4) of the Family Court Act and Sections 397 &
401 of Criminal Procedure Code under which applicant has
filed this criminal revision there is no provision regarding
filing of cross-objection, so it is not maintainable.
C.c. as per rules.

Heard on I.A.No.1628/2017, which is an application filed by appellant No.3 Ishak Kha S/o Rajjak
Kha for suspension of sentence awarded by the Additional Sessions Judge, Badnagar, Distt. Ujjain in
ST No.6/15 and grant of bail.
[2] Appellant No.3 Ishak Kha has been convicted under Sections 302/34 and 324/34 of IPC and
sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with fine of Rs.1,000/- and one year RI with fine of
Rs.500/- with default stipulation respectively.
[3] As per prosecution story, on 25.09.2014, complainant Bhadar Khan and his younger brother
Mubarik came to Bargundaseri Badnagar Cattle Haat for selling a cow. At 9.30 a.m., appelland
Ishak and other co-accused Javed, Azad and Zuber came there and abused Mubarik. Javed assaulted
Mubarik by knife on his throat. When Bhadar Kha tried to rescue him, Ishak and Zuber caught hold
Bhadar Kha and Azad inflicted knife blow on his left palm and Javed also beated him by stick. On

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
hearing the hue and cry Mehboob Kha, Mohd. Azhar, Irfan Kha came to rescue them, then accused
ran away. On the report of complainant Bhadar Kha, Crime No.403/14 was registered against the
applicant and other co-accused Javed, Azad and Zuber for the offence under Section 307, 294, 323
and 34 of IPC at P.S. Badnagar.
[4] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the statements of so called eye witnesses
Bhadar Kha (PW-1), Mohd. Azhar (PW-2), Mehboob (PW-3), Umar Farukh (PW-4) and Ditya @
Dattu (PW-5) are not reliable. There are many contradictions and omissions in their statements.
Learned Trial Court without appreciating their statements wrongly found the appellant Ishak guilty
for the offence under Sections 302/34 and 324/34 of IPC. Hearing of the appeal will take time, so
sentence awarded by the Trial Court be suspended and appellant Ishak be released on bail.
[5] On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/State opposed the prayer and submitted
that from the statement of prosecution witnesses it is clearly proved that at the time of incident
appellant Ishak was present at the spot and also took part in the incident. Learned Trial Court after
evaluating all the evidence rightly convicted applicant Ishak and prays for rejection.
[6] From the statements of eye witnesses Bhadar Kha (PW-1), Mohd. Azhar (PW-2), Mehboob
(PW-3), Umar Farukh (PW-4) and Ditya @ Dattu (PW-5) it is clear that appellant Ishak was also
present on the spot at the time of incident along with other co-accused and took active part in the
incident in which Mubarik was murdered and Bhadar Kha (PW-1) also sustained injuries. So we are
of the considered opinion that it is not a fit case for granting bail to appellant No.3 Ishak. Hence,
prayer for suspension of sentence is hereby rejected.
[7] The appeal is already admitted, therefore, let the appeal be listed for final hearing in due course.
C.c. as per rules.

This Civil Revision has been filed under Section 115 of CPC against the order dated 17.02.2017
passed by the 2nd Civil Judge Class-I, District Barwani in Civil Suit No.1400037/2016, whereby
learned judge rejected the applicant's application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 309
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant for the disposal of this Revision are that
respondent/plaintiff filed a Civil Suit No.1400037/2016 before the 2nd Civil Judge Class-I, District
Barwani seeking declaration and injunction with the averment that suit property was purchased by
him in the name of his sister late Sardar Bi D/o Dildar Khan on 04.02.1988 for a consideration of
Rs.12,000/-. on which he did some construction. Sardar Bi expired on 25.07.1994. In the year 2012
Khurshid Bi wrongly got her name recorded on the said plot in the Municipal Register and sold that
plot by registered sale deed dated 28.02.2012 to applicants No.1 & 2 without any legal right. So
plaintiff be declared owner of the suit plot and in alternate plaintiff also sought relief that if learned
court finds Sardar Bi owner of suit plot then it be declared that plaintiff is having half share in the
suit plot as heir of Sardar Bi and applicants No.1 & 2 also be directed to not to interfere in his
possession on suit plot.
[3] During trial of the suit applicants filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC before the
trial court contending that suit is not maintainable according to Section 4 of Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Act of 1988. Although plaintiff also sought other alternative relief, but which is
contradictory. So plaintiff is also not entitled for that alternative relief. Plaintiff also did not value
the suit property according to value of sale deed, challenged by the plaintiff' in the suit. So suit is
rejected.
[4] Plaintiff/respondent in his reply opposes the prayer.
[5] Learned trial court by order dated 17.02.2017 rejected the prayer observing that the objection
raised by the applicant cannot be decided without recording evidence. Plaintiff is not a party to that
sale deed against which plaintiff sought cancellation. So he is not bound to valued his suit according
to value of that sale deed. Being aggrieved from that order applicant filed this Revision.
[4] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that respondent clearly pleaded in his suit that the
suit property was purchased by him in the name of Late Sardar Bi. He never intended that Sardar Bi
was the owner of that plot and real owner of the suit plot is plaintiff/respondent. So looking to the
averment of plaint present suit is barred by the provisions of Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act
of 1988, although respondent/plaintiff also sought relief to declare him owner of half of the suit
property being a heir of Sardar Bi but that relief is contradictory to the main relief so plaint for that
relief is also not maintainable and Learned Trial Court committed mistake in rejecting applicant's
application. In this regard he also placed reliance on the Hon'ble Apex Court's judgment passed in
T.Arivandandam V/s. T.V.Satyapal and another reported in AIR 1977 Supreme Court 2421, But the
facts of this case do not match with the instant case. In that case court rejected the plaint on the
ground that plaint is meritless and vexatious. He also placed reliance on the Karnataka High Court's
judgment passed in Syed Mujibur Rahman V/s. Abdul Azeez reported in AIR 2001 Karnataka Page
104. But that judgment also does not help the applicant because in that case plaintiff did not pay
court fee on the relief which was added by him in the plaint by way of amendment.
[5] It is clear from the copy of the plaint that plaintiff also pleaded that he is in possession of suit
plot and sought relief of Injunction. But there cannot be a partial rejection of the plaint as held by
Apex court in D. Ramachandram V/s. R.V.Janakiraman and others reported in AIR 1999 SC 1128.

Hence, the Civil Revision is hereby dismissed.

Case diary along with the report of S.H.O.Manawar, District Dhar was received.
Heard.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order
dated 12.09.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Manawar, District Dhar passed in
Criminal Revision No.119/2016 whereby learned A.S.J., Manawar rejected the applicant's criminal
Revision and maintained the order dated 10.08.2016 passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Manawar wherein learned judge had rejected the applicant's application filed under Section 451/457
of Cr.P.C. for getting interim custody of Tractor bearing registration No.MP-11- AB-9674 and trolley
attached to it seized by the Police on 23.07.2016 in Crime No.462/16 registered at P.S. Manawar for
the offences under section 379 IPC and Section 53 of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, 1996( hereinafter
referred to as rules).
[2] Brief facts of the case relevant to disposal of this petition are that on 23.07.2016, at 1.30 p.m.,
when Parvez Constable No.256 of P.S. Manawar, was going to Ravi Garage, on the way, near Gulati
Road, he saw a tractor bearing registration No.MP-11-AB-9674 with trolley carrying illegal sand,
then he stopped the Tractor-trolly and brought them at P.S. Manawar, where Kishanchand, the then
Sub Inspector, P.S. Manawar seized the tractor-trolly and lodged FIR. On that FIR, Crime
No.462/2016 was registered for the offences under Section 379 of IPC and Rule 53 of M.P. Minor
Mineral Rules, 1996 against Ganpat S/o Bhimsingh Bhilala. Applicant filed an application under
Section 451/457 of Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Manawar to get said Tractor
No.MP-11-AB-9674 with trolley in his interim custody. Learned Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Manawar rejected that application by order dated 10.08.2016 observing that the said tractor-trolly
was involved in illegal carrying of sand, whereas National Green Tribunal had prohibited illegal
mining and carrying of sand in that area. Against this applicant filed Cr.R.No.119/2016. Learned
A.S.J., Manawar, Distt. Dhar also rejected that Criminal Revision observing that according to Rule
53 of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, 1996 intimation is necessary to invoke the power of Judicial
Magistrate First Class for granting vehicle into custody but no intimation was sent by the authority
under Rule 53 Sub Rule 3 of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules. So, learned Magistrate has not committed
any mistake in rejecting the applicant's application.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the provision of Rule 53 of M.P. Minor Mineral
Rules come into play when the vehicle is seized by the authority mentioned in Sub Rule 2 of Rule 53
of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, 1996 but said vehicle was seized by the police. Even otherwise, it is
clear from the record that police who seized the said vehicle also sent intimation regarding seizure of
that vehicle to the Magistrate. So learned Additional Sessions Judge committed mistake in rejecting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 311
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
the applicant's Revision only on the ground that no information was sent by the authority to the
concerned Magistrate.
[4] Likewise learned Judicial Magistrate First Class also committed mistake in rejecting the
application only on the ground that National Green Tribunal had imposed ban on mining activities
as National Green Tribunal imposed ban only on mining activities and not on transportation of
sand, therefore, transportation of sand does not come under ban imposed by the National Green
tribunal. Even otherwise whether said vehicle was carrying illegal sand or not is a matter of evidence
which cannot be ascertained without evidence at this stage and shall be decided by the court at the
time of judgment of the case. If vehicle is kept in idle condition in the Police Station for a long period
it would suffer loss. So learned Trial Court also committed mistake in not giving the vehicle in
applicant's interim custody.
[5] On the other hand, learned Panel Lawyer for the State submitted that the said vehicle was seized
on the basis of carrying illegal sand against the order of National Green Tribunal and applicant did
not file any document which shows that tractor was carrying sand on valid pass at the time of
incident. So learned trial court did not commit any mistake in rejecting the prayer.
[6] This court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the parties.
[7] It appears from the record that when learned Trial Court rejected the application of applicant
charge-sheet had not been filed, but now charge-sheet has been filed so petition is disposed of with
the direction that in the event of filing of fresh application by the applicant before the Trial Court
under Section 451 of Cr.P.C. for getting said vehicle in custody the Trial Court will decide that
application according to law without taking notice of his earlier order.
A copy of this order be sent to the concerning Trial Court for compliance.

19.02.2014 applicant's surety was given by Smt. Saroj Singh on her plot No.14/16, Mahakal Vanijya
Kendra, Ujjain Vikas Pradhikaran Ujjain. Now, Smt. Saroj wants loan on that property that's why
she may be permitted to give surety on commercial shop No.12/8, Jhawar Nagar, Ujjain in place of
plot No.14/16, Mahakal Vanijya Kendra, Ujjain Vikas Pradhikaran Ujjain.
After due consideration, prayer is allowed. She be permitted to give surety of appellant on shop
No.12/8, Jhawar Nagar, Ujjain instead of plot No.14/16, Mahakal Vanijya Kendra, Ujjain Vikas
Pradhikaran Ujjain and C.J.M., Ujjain is directed to permit the surety of appellant Smt. Saroj Singh
to replace the property on which she earlier given surety of appellant.

passed by the Vth Civil Judge Class-I, Ujjain in Civil Suit No.13-A/2015, whereby learned judge
rejected the applicant's application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case which are relevant for the disposal of this Revision are that respondent
filed a Civil Suit No.13-A/2015 before the Vth Civil Judge Class-I, Ujjain seeking declaration to get
invoice worth Rs.5,51,232/- prepared by the defendant null and void, averting that he purchased one
Maruti Car through invoice dated 08.01.2014 worth Rs.6,20,438/-. The applicant completed all the
formalities of registration and insurance of the vehicle and delivered the car to him.

Later on, it came to the notice of the respondent that the petitioner had prepared a new invoice
dated 08.01.2014 for RTO purpose wherein there was change of Rs.26,998/- from the original
invoice. That invoice was prepared for saving the tax and the petitioner had no right to prepare two
invoices for one vehicle. So invoice of Rs.5,51,232/- prepared by the defendant on 24.08.2015 be
declared null and void. The respondent valued his suit at Rs.5,51,232/- and paid a fixed court fees of
Rs.1,000/-.
[3] During trial of the suit Applicant/defendant filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC
before the trial court averting that applicant is bound to pay ad-
valorem court fees on the valuation of Rs.5,51,232/-.
[4] Respondent in his reply opposes the prayer.
[5] Learned trial court by order dated 31.08.2015 rejected the prayer observing that applicant filed
the suit only for seeking declaration, so the provisions of Article 17 of Schedule 2 of Court Fees Act
are attracted according to which respondent is only bound to pay fix court fees and rejected the
applicant's application. Being aggrieved with the order applicant filed this Civil Revision.
[4] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that respondent seeks a declaration to get invoice
worth Rs.5,51,232/- null and void which has money value, so he is bound to pay ad valorem court
fees on the valuation of suit. Learned Trial Court committed mistake in rejecting his application. In
this regard he also placed reliance on the judgment of Full Bench of this Court passed in Subhash
Chand Jain V/s. Chairman, M.P. Electricity Board and others reported in AIR 2001 Madhya Pradesh
88 but facts of that case are distinguishable from the instant case. In that case plaintiff had filed suit
for injunction for which provisions of section 7(iv) of Court Fees Act were applicable and plaintiff
sought relief to restrain the defendant from recovery of amount Rs.
2,14,747/-. While in this case respondent did not seek relief to restrain the defendant from recovery
of any amount but only for a declaration to get invoice prepared by the defendant worth
Rs.5,51,232/- null and void.
Respondent is not the party of that invoice, therefore, he is not bound pay ad valorem court fee on
the suit value.
[5] Full Bench of this High Court in the case of Sunil Radhelia and others V/s Awadh Narayan and
others reported in I.L.R. (2010) M.P., 2454 held that, Court Fees Act (7) of 1870, 7 (iv) C and Article
17 Schedule II -- If plaintiff makes an allegation that the instrument is void and hence not binding
upon him, then ad valorem court-fee is not payable and he can claim declaration simpliciter from
the court.
In the instant case also Plaintiff neither executed nor is a signatory to the invoice which he wants to
be declared null and void and claimed only the relief of declaration, So Plaintiff is not required to
pay ad-valorem court fee. Learned trial did not commit any mistake in rejecting the applicant's

prayer. So the revision has no force. Hence, the Revision is dismissed.
(Rajeev Kumar Dubey) Judge ns Criminal Revision No.158/2016 10.03.2017 Shri Nilesh Dave,
learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Chetan Jain, learned counsel for the respondent.
Heard finally at the motion stage with the consent of both the parties..
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 read with
Sections 397 & 401 of Cr.P.C. against the order dated 12.01.2016 passed by the Principal Judge,
Family Court, Indore in M.Cr.C.No.368/2014, whereby he rejected the applicant's application filed
under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. for getting maintenance from respondent.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that applicant filed an application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. before
the Family Court, Indore averting that applicant is a legally wedded wife of respondent. She married
with respondent on 03.04.2012 after which she lived with respondent, but behaviour of respondent
and his family members was not good with her.
They demanded Five Lakh rupees and one Maruti Car as dowry and used to harass her for that.
Respondent also used to drink and beated applicant and one year before filing of application
respondent had expelled the applicant from his house. Since then she has been living with her
parents and is not able to maintain herself, while respondent runs business of selling cloths and
earns Rs.30,000/- per month and able to maintain her but is not doing so without any sufficient
cause.
So, respondent be directed to pay Rs.15,000/- as maintenance to the applicant.
Respondent in his reply denied the all allegations and averted that he and his family members never
demanded any dowry from the applicant and respondent does not drink wine. Applicant herself
threatened respondent to implicate him in false case as she did not want to live in Biaora. so she
herself left respondent's house voluntarily without any sufficient cause and is living with her
parents. Respondent tried to take her back but she refused. Applicant does sewing work and is able
to maintain herself. On the other hand, respondent is an employee in a cloth shop and only earns
Rs.2,500/- per month and is unable to maintain the applicant and pray for rejection.
Learned trial court after recording the evidence of both the parties rejected the application
observing that since applicant has been living separately from the respondent without any sufficient
reason, so she is not entitled to get maintenance. Being aggrieved from that order applicant filed this
Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that from the evidence it is clearly proved that
respondent and his family members demanded dowry from the applicant and subjected her to
cruelty and owing to their ill-behaviour applicant was forced to live separately from the respondent.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Learned trial court without appreciating the evidence only on the basis of some minor
contradictions mistakenly disbelieving the statement of applicant and his Father Hari Om (PW-2)
and wrongly assuming that applicant voluntarily lived separately from respondent rejected
applicant's prayer.
He also placed reliance on Apex Court's judgement in Mannava Satyawati and others V/s. Mannava
Malleswara Rao and others reported in 1995 Supreme Court Cases (Cri.) 836 and this Court's
judgement Dali Bai V/s.
Rajendra Singh reported in M.P. Weekly Notes 2006 (II) Note 54.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that trial court after evaluating all the evidence
rightly held that applicant had been living separately from the respondent without any sufficient
reason so she is not entitled to get maintenance. He also placed reliance on Apex Court's judgement
passed in Deb Narayan Halder V/s. Smt. Anushree Halder reported in (2003) 11 Supreme Court
Cases 303.
[5] This Court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the parties. As far as trial
court's finding that the applicant has no sufficient reason to live separately from respondent is
concerned, although applicant had deposed that respondent's behaviour became bad with her after
one and half months of marriage and that he used to beat her for dowry besides her father Hari Om
(PW-2) also deposed that behaviour of respondent and his family members turned bad with
applicant after one year of marriage and they demanded dowry and used to beat her and tell her that
her father had not given them any cash at the time of marriage and demanded Rs. One Lakh Twenty
Five Thousand due to which he brought his daughter back from her matrimonial house and that she
has been living with him for the past two years during which respondent never came to take her
back. But Applicant averted in the plaint that her marriage was solemnized with respondent on
03.04.2012 and that he expelled her from his house one year back from the date of filing of
application i.e. 15.04.2014, which shows that applicant is living separately from 15.04.2013 meaning
thereby that applicant lived with respondent only from 03.04.2012 to 15.04.2013 i.e. 1 year 12 days,
while applicant herself averted in her application that behaviour of respondent and his family
members was good with her upto one year from her marriage. So the statements of applicant and
her father Hari Om regarding demand of dowry and ill-
behavior of respondent and his family members becomes doubtful. Even regarding harassment and
demand of dowry the statement of applicant and her father is contradictory.
Applicant stated that respondent and his family members started torturing her only after 1 or 2
months of her marriage, while applicant's father stated that respondent started torturing his
daughter after one year of marriage. Likewise Hari Om (PW-2) stated that respondent and his
family members demanded Rs.1,25,000/-, while in the application it is mentioned that respondent
and his family members demanded Rs.5,00,000/- and one Car. Applicant also stated that she does
not remember the year or month or day her husband beated her. She filled report against
respondent one year after returning from her parents' house. If respondent had demanded dowry
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 322
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
and used to beat her and expelled her from his house after beating then she would have lodged the
report of incident soon after the incident. So statements of applicant and her father Hari Om (PW2)
that respondent and his family members used to beat her and demanded dowry are do not appear to
be correct. Although the learned counsel for applicant placed reliance on the Apex Court's judgment
passed in Mannava Satyawati and others V/s. Mannava Malleswara Rao and others reported in 1995
Supreme Court Cases (Cri.) 836, in which Apex Court held that, "because the wife and children had
left the house on their own, held, is no ground to disentitle them to maintenance - In the facts and
circumstances of the case the respondent was found to maintain his wife and children."
But the facts of that case are distinguishable, as here Hon'ble Apex Court did not hold that even
when wife lived separately from her husband without any sufficient reason even then she is entitled
to get maintenance from her husband. He also placed reliance on Apex Court's judgement passed in
Dwarika Prasad Satpathy V/s. Bidyut Praya Dixit and another reported in 2000 Cr.L.R. (SC) 41,
wherein Apex Court held that, "Not to be invoked to examine whether procedure of marriage was
properly followed - Once the Magistrate is satisfied that marriage was performed - Maintenance can
be granted."
This judgement also does not help the applicant as it is not on the point that whether applicant is
entitled to get maintenance even after living separately from her husband without any sufficient
cause.
[6] Learned counsel for the applicant also placed reliance on this Court's judgment passed in Dali
Bai V/s.
Rajendra Singh reported in M.P. Weekly Notes 2006 (II) Note 54, in which this court held that,
"claim for maintenance by wife - wife deposing ill treatment on demand of dowry by husband -
cruelly be beating also stated - statement is reliable to prove sufficient cause for separate living."
But facts of this case do not match with the aforementioned case. In the instant case statement of
applicant regarding ill treatment and demand of dowry by husband do not appear to be correct.
[7] On the other hand counsel of the respondent placed reliance on Apex Court's judgment passed in
Deb Narayan Halder V/s. Smt. Anushree Halder reported in (2003) 11 Supreme Court Cases 303,
wherein Apex Court held that, "Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - Section 125 - Maintenance - Wife
having left her matrimonial home without any justifiable ground - Held, not entitled to the grant of
maintenance
- On facts, two reasons given by respondent wife for her ill-treatment by husband, namely, his greed
for dowry and that the respondent was not good- looking, held, were non-existent - Also, no other
reason for ill-treatment - Facts indicating that for several years after their marriage they enjoyed
normal marital relationship - Hence held, learned Magistrate rightly rejected wife's claim for
maintenance."

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[8] It also appeared from the statement of applicant that respondent had sent notice to her for
keeping her with him. Respondent also filed suit for restitution of conjugal rights which shows that
respondent is ready to keep her but she herself is not living with respondent without any sufficient
cause. So in the considered opinion of this court Learned trial court did not commit any mistake in
arriving at the conclusion that applicant is living separately from the respondent without any
sufficient reason and that she is not entitled to get maintenance from the applicant. Hence this
revision has no force and is hereby dismissed.

Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against the
order dated 05.08.2016 passed by the First Additional Sessions Judge, Shujalpur, District Shajapur
in S.T. No.344/2015, whereby learned A.S.J. framed charges against applicants under Sections 148
and 307/149 of IPC.
[2] Brief facts which are relevant to this petition are that on 26.06.2015, at 11.30 p.m., when
complainant Indersingh was satting on dice (chabutara) of Ram Mandir with his brother Liladhar
and niece Dhirajsingh at Village Jabiya Gharwas, Kalapipal, applicants came there armed with farsi,
lathi and rod and abused and beated Indersingh. Applicant Mansingh assaulted him by farsi on his
head with an intention to kill him while Mahendrasingh assaulted on his head by rod and Raghuveer
Singh, Pappu and Santosh also beated him by lathi. When complainant's brother Leeladhar came to
rescue him, Hindusingh also assaulted him by farsi on his head with an intention to kill him and
applicants Kapal Singh, Peer Singh and Raghuveer also beated him by lathi. Indersingh and
Leeladhar sustained injuries on head and other body parts. On hearing hue & cry Praveen, Narendra
Singh came there and tried to save them with the help of Dheerap Singh and admitted them in the
hospital. On that report of injured Indersingh Crime No.250/2015 was registered at P.S. Kalapipal,
District Shajapur under Section 307, 147, 148, 149 and 294 of IPC against the applicants and after
investigation police filed charge-sheet against the applicants. On that charge-
sheet ST No.344/2015 was registered and learned First Additional Sessions Judge, Shujalpur,
District Shajapur by order dated 05.08.2016 framed charges against applicants under 307/149 (in
two counts) and 148 of IPC.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Being aggrieved from that order applicants filed this Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicants submits that to frame charge under Section 307 of IPC it
should appear from the evidence that applicants inflicted injuries to the injured person with an
intention to cause death but according to MLC report injuries sustained by Indersingh and
Leeladhar are simple in nature and not dangerous to life. In the X-Ray report it is clearly mentioned
that they did not receive any bony injury, therefore, provision of Section 307 of IPC did not attract.
So learned trial court committed mistake in framing charge against applicants under Section 307/34
of IPC.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer and submitted that Indersingh and
Leeladhar received injuries by farsi on their head which is vital part of body. Therefore, learned trial
court rightly framed charge against the applicants and prays for rejection of Revision.
[5] Although according to MLC report and X-Ray report, injury sustained by Indersingh and
Leeladhar is not grievous or dangerous to life, but for framing of charge under Section 307 of IPC it
is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted.
[6] The Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment in the case of State of Maharashtra V/s. Balram Bama
Patil and others reported in 1983 Cri.L.J. 331 has held that, "to justify a conviction under Section
307 of IPC it is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted. It
is sufficient in law, if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof."
[7] The Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment in the matter of State of M.P. V/s. Kashiram, reported in
ILR (2009) MP 1552 (SC) also held that, "to justify conviction under Section 307 of IPC it is not
essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted. The section makes a
distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any. The Court has to see whether the act,
irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge. Whether there was intention to
kill or knowledge that death will be caused is a question of fact. The circumstances that the injury
inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of Section 307
IPC."
[8] It is clearly mentioned in the FIR that applicant Mansingh inflicted injury on Indersingh and
Leeladhar on their head with farsi (which is a vital part of the body) with an intention to kill them.
According to the MLC report, Indersingh sustained as many as 10 injuries out of which two injuries
are on his head and Leeladhar also sustained three injuries of which one is on his head.
So this version coupled with the injury is prima facie sufficient to frame charge against the
applicants/accused Santoshsingh, Mahendrasingh, Pirsingh, Krupalsingh Jaisingh @ Pappu,
Raghuvir Singh and Mansingh under Sections 307/149 (in two counts). Learned A.S.J., Shujalpur,
District Shajapur did not commit any mistake in framing charge against the applicants under
Sections 307/149 (in two counts).
So, this Revision Petition is hereby dismissed.

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order
dated 12.09.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Manawar, District Dhar passed in
Criminal Revision No.119/2016 whereby learned A.S.J., Manawar rejected the applicant's criminal
Revision and maintained the order dated 10.08.2016 passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Manawar where by learned judge rejected the applicant's application filed under Section 451/457 of
Cr.P.C. for getting vehicle Tractor bearing registration No.MP-11-AB-9674 and trolley attached with
in interim custody seized by the Police on 23.07.2016 in Crime No.462/16 registered at P.S.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[2] Brief facts of the case relevant to disposal of this petition are that on 23.07.2016, at 1.30 p.m.,
when Parvez Constable No.256 of P.S. Manawar, was going to Ravi Garrage, on the way near Gulati
Road, he saw a tractor bearing registration No.MP-11-AB-9674 with trolley carrying illegal sand,
then he stopped the Tractor-trolly and brought them at P.S. Manawar, where Kishanchand, the then
Sub Inspector, P.S. Manawar seized the tractor-trolly and lodged FIR. On that FIR Crime
No.462/2016 was registered for the offences under Section 379 of IPC and Section 53 of M.P. Minor
Mineral Rules, 1996 against Ganpat S/o Bhimsingh Bhilala. Applicant filed an application under
Section 451/457 of Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Manawar to get said Tractor
No.MP-11-AB-9674 with trolley in his interim custody. Learned Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Manawar rejected that application by order dated 10.08.2016 observing that the said tractor-trolly
was involving in illegal carrying of sand, whereas National Green Tribunal prohibited illegal mining
and carrying of sand in that area. Against which applicant filed Cr.R.No.119/2016.
Learned A.S.J., Manawar, Distt. Dhar also rejected that Criminal Revision by observing that
according to Section 53 of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, 1996 intimation is necessary to invoke the
power of Judicial Magistrate First Class for taking vehicle into custody but it appears from the
record that no intimation was sent by the applicant under Rule 53 Sub Rule 3 of M.P. Minor Mineral
Rules. So, learned Magistrate has not committed any mistake in rejecting the applicant's
application. Hence, petition is dismissed.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the provision of Section 53 of M.P. Minor
Mineral Rules apply place when the vehicle seized by the authority mentioned in Section 53 Sub
Rule 2 of Section 53 of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, 1996 while vehicle seized by the police. So the
provision of Section 53(3) of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules does not apply in the case. Learned
Additional Sessions Judge wrongly observing that because no information was sent by the authority
under Section 53 Sub Rule 2 of Section 53 of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, so (Rajeev Kumar Dubey)

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure regarding illegal
detention of applicant after undergoing the whole sentence awarded by the court in
S.T.No.27/2003.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to this petition are that Special Judge (NDPS Act),
Neemuch vide judgment dated 07.09.2007 passed in Special Sessions Case No.27/2003 convicted
the accused for offence under Section 8/29 of the NDPS Act and sentenced him to 10 years rigorous
imprisonment and fine of Rs.1,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine he was to undergo one
year's additional rigorous imprisonment. Against that judgment applicant filed Cr.A.No.1072/2007
before this Court, which was decided vide judgment dated 28.07.2015 and this Court partly allowed
the appeal and affirmed the sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.1,00,000/-
for the offence under Section 8/29 of the NDPS Act awarded by the Trial Court but reduced the
sentence from one year to six months awarded by the Trial Court in default of payment of fine.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that applicant has undergone whole sentence even
then jail authorities of District Jail, Neemuch have not released the applicant/accused. So, Jailor of

[4] Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that during trial applicant remained in detention
from 28.09.2005 to 05.03.2007 in other Sessions Case No.09/07 in Central Jail at Arthor Road Jail,
Chinchpokli, Mumbai (Maharashtra). No written information regarding that detention has been
received as yet from the said Jail. So applicant could not be released.
[5] On this, learned counsel for the applicant submitted that if that period is not considered in
detention period even then applicant has undergone whole sentence awarded by the court in Special
Sessions Case No.27/2003.
[6] Considering the aforesaid, the Jail Superintendent District Jail, Neemuch is directed that if the
applicant Mohammad Iqbal has undergone whole sentence awarded by the court in Special Sessions
Case No.27/2003, excluding the period for which he was detained in other Special Sessions Case
No.09/2007 then he be released, if not required in any other case.
Accordingly, the petition is disposed.
(Rajeev Kumar Dubey) Judge ns 07.03.2017 Shri Sunil Verma, learned Counsel for the applicants.
Shri Chetan Joshi, learned counsel for the non applicant.
Heard finally at motion stage. [1] This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. (in
brief "Code") against the order dated 16.09.2015 passed by the 16th Additional Sessions Judge,
Indore in Cr.R.No.564/15; whereby learned Judge allowed the revision and set aside the order dated
28.07.2015 passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore and directed him to take
cognizance against applicants for the offences under Sections 499, 500, 501 and 502 of the IPC .
[2] Brief facts of the case relevant for disposal of this petition are that non-applicant filed a private
complaint against the applicants under Sections 499, 500, 501 and 502 of the IPC alleging that the
applicants had published defamatory news against the non- applicant/complainant. Learned
Judicial Magistrate recorded statement of complainant and his witnesses under Section 200 and
202 of Cr.P.C. and after considering the evidence learned Judge observing that there was no
sufficient ground for proceeding against the applicant, dismissed the complaint. Against that order
non-applicant filed Criminal Revision No.564/2015 which was disposed of by the 16th Additional
Sessions Judge, Indore by order dated 16.09.2015 without giving notice to the applicant and by the
impugned order allowed the revision and set aside the Magistrate's order observing that prima facie
there was sufficient evidence in the complaint to take cognizance against the applicant under
Section 499, 500, 501, 502 and 503 of the IPC and directed the learned Magistrate to take
appropriate action against the applicant in this regard. Being aggrieved from that order applicants
have filed this petition.
[3] Learned Counsel for the applicants submits that by virtue of Section 401(2) of the Code the
Revisional Court should not pass any adverse order unless an opportunity of hearing is given to the
accused, but the impugned order has been passed without giving opportunity of hearing to the
applicants, therefore, the order is not sustainable in law. For this purpose placed reliance on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 339
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
judgment of Apex Court in the case of Manharibhai Muljibhai Kakadia and another V/s.
Shaileshbhai Mohanbhai Patel and others reported in 2013 Cri.L.J. 144. wherein apex court held as
under :-
"If the Magistrate finds that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding with the
complaint and dismisses the complaint under Section 203 of the Code, the question
is whether a person accused of crime in the complaint can claim right of hearing in a
revision application preferred by the complainant against the order of the dismissal
of the complaint. The Parliament being alive to the legal position that the
accused/suspects are not entitled to be heard at any stage of the proceedings until
issuance of process under Section 204, yet in Section 401(2) of the Code provided
that no order in exercise of the power of the revision shall be made by the Sessions
Judge or the High Court, as the case may be, to the prejudice of the accused or the
other person unless he had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by
pleader in his own defence."
[5] In the present case Revisional Court has passed the impugned order without giving an
opportunity of hearing to the applicants as provided under Section 401(2) of the Code. Thus, the
impugned order is not sustainable in law, therefore, the order is hereby set aside without
considering the merits and the matter is sent back to the Revisional Court with the direction to
decide the revision afresh after giving opportunity of hearing to the applicants.
[6] Both parties are directed to appear before the Revisional Court on 17.04.2017.
A copy of the order be sent to the Revisional Court as well as to the concerned Magistrate for
compliance.
Thus, the revision is allowed as indicated above.

learned counsel for the applicants.
Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Dy. Govt.
Advocate for the respondent/State.
Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. against the order dated
23.02.2016 passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Rajgarh (Biaora) in S.T. No.62/2016,
whereby Learned A.S.J. framed charges against applicant Ramprasad under Section 307 of IPC and
applicants Kanchanbai, Hokomsingh and Vishramsingh under Section 307/34 of IPC..
[2] As per prosecution story, on 19.11.2015, at 5.30 p.m., when complainant Omprakash and his
family members were working in the field situated at Rajgarh near National High Way 12, applicants
came there armed with lathi and farsi and applicant Ramprasad assaulted Omprakash on his head
by farsi with an intention to kill him while Hukum Singh assaulted on Omprakash's hand by lathi
and Kanchanbhai by stone. When complainant's son Jaiprakash came to rescue him Ramprasad
inflicted farsi blow on Jaiprakash's head and other applicants also beated them. On that report
Crime No.617/2015 in P.S. Kotwali, Rajgarh was registered under Section 307 and 323 read with
Section 34 of IPC. After investigation Police filed charge-sheet before the court and on the basis of
charge-sheet S.T.No.62/2016 was registered and then learned A.S.J. framed charges against the
applicant Ramprasad under Section 307 of IPC and against applicants No.2 Kanchanbhai No.3
Hukum Singh & Vishram Singh under Sections 307/34 and 323/34 of IPC.
Being aggrieved by the orders of framing charges under Sections 307, 307/34 IPC applicants have
filed this Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicants submits that to frame charge under Section 307 of IPC it
should appear from the evidence that applicants inflicted injuries to the injured person with an
intention to cause death but according to MLC report, injuries sustained by Omprakash and
Jaiprakash are simple in nature and not dangerous to life. In the X-Ray report it is clearly
mentioned that they have not received any bony injury, therefore, there is no evidence on record to
frame charge under Section 307 of IPC. Learned Trial Court committed mistake in framing charge
against applicant Ramprasad under Section 307 of IPC and against applicants Kanchanbai,
Hokomsingh and Vishramsingh under Section 307/34 of IPC.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer and submitted that Omprakash and
Jaiprakash received incised wounds by farsi on their head which is vital part of body. Therefore,
learned trial court rightly framed charge against the applicants and prays for rejection of Revision.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[5] For framing of charge strong suspicion about commission of offence and accused's involvement
of offence is sufficient. On merits, materials/documents filed by accused can not be considered.
Material produced by prosecution alone is to be considered. Roving inquiry and mini trial is not
permissible. Defence of accused is not relevant. Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgement passed in
Hemchand V/s. State of Jharkhand reported in (2008) 5 SCC 113 held that at the stage of framing of
charge, Court exercises a limited jurisdiction. It has to see whether prima facie case has been made
out or not?
Concern of the Court should be to see whether a case of probable conviction for commission of an
offence has been made out on the basis of the materials found during investigation. Although
according to MLC and X-Ray report, injury sustained by Omprakash and Jaiprakash is not grievous,
but for framing of charge under Section 307 of IPC it is not essential that bodily injury capable of
causing death should have been inflicted. The Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment in the case of
State of Maharashtra V/s. Balram Bama Patil and others reported in 1983 Cri.L.J. 331 has held that
to justify a conviction under Section 307 of IPC it is not essential that bodily injury capable of
causing death should have been inflicted. It is sufficient in law, if there is present an intent coupled
with some overt act in execution thereof.
The Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment in the matter of State of M.P. V/s. Kashiram, reported in
ILR (2009) MP 1552 (SC) also held that to justify conviction under Section 307 of IPC it is not
essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted. The section makes a
distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any. The Court has to see whether the act,
irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge. Whether there was intention to
kill or knowledge that death will be caused is a question of fact.
The circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule
out application of Section 307 IPC.
[5] It is clearly mentioned in the FIR that applicant Ramprasad inflicted injury on Omprakash and
Jayprakash with farsi on their head (which is a vital part of the body) with an intention to kill them.
So this version coupled with the injury is prima facie sufficient to frame charge against the
applicants/accused Ramprasad under Section 307 of IPC and other applicants under Section 307
read with 34 of IPC. Learned A.S.J., Rajgarh (Biaora) did not commit any mistake in framing charge
against the applicant Ramprasad under Section 307 of IPC and applicants Kanchanbai, Hokomsingh
and Vishramsingh under Section 307/34 of IPC.
So, this Revision Petition is hereby dismissed.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Heard finally at motion stage. This leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment dated
01.07.2016 passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Indore in Criminal Case
No.3517/2001, whereby he acquitted the respondent from the charge under Section 279, 337, 338
and 304(A) of the IPC.
[2] Learned counsel for the applicant/State submitted that from the statement of Hemsingh (PW-1)
it is clearly proved that at the time of accident respondent/accused rashly and negligently drove the
vehicle bearing registration No.MP09-K-7976 and dashed against Kinetic Moped, due to which two
girls sustained injuries and one of them died. From the statement of Tarachand (PW-2) it is also
proved that at the time of accident vehicle No.MP09-K-7976 was being driven by respondent
Mazhar. So, learned trial court committed mistake in acquitting the accused Mazhar from the
aforesaid charge.
[3] On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that from the statement of
Hemsingh (PW-1) it is not proved that driver of the vehicle No.MP09- K-7976 was driving said
vehicle rashly and negligently, at the time of incident. Also it is not proved that vehicle No.MP09-
K-7976 was being driven by the respondent at the time of accident. Although Tarachand (PW-2)
deposed that respondent Mazhar was the driver on said vehicle on the date of accident but he is not
an eye witness of the incident so only on the basis of his statement, it cannot be assumed that
vehicle No.MP09-K-7976 was being driven by the respondent Mazhar at the time of accident. So,
learned trial court after appreciating all the evidence rightly acquitted the accused and pray for
rejection.
[4] This court perused the record and considered arguments put forth by the parties. Hemsingh
(PW-1) only stated that at the time of accident driver of vehicle No.MP09- K-7976 was driving
vehicle at a high speed and dashed against the Kinetic Moped, due to which two girls sustained
injuries but he did not specifically deposed in his statement that as to at what speed the vehicle
No.MP09-K-7976 was being driven at the time of accident. So, only on the basis of statement of
Hemsingh (PW-1) that driver of vehicle No.MP09-K-7976 was driving vehicle at a high speed, it
cannot be assumed that the driver of the said vehicle drove the vehicle rashly and negligently at the
time of accident. Hemsingh (PW-1), who is an eye witness of the incident, did not even depose that
the said vehicle No.MP09-K-7976 was being driven by the respondent Mazhar at the time of
accident. So, from his statement it is also not proved that vehicle No.MP09-K-7976 was being driven
by the respondent Mazhar at the time of accident.
[5] Although Tarachand (PW-2) deposed that on the date of accident respondent Mazhar was the
driver on his vehicle No.MP09-K-7976 but he is not an eye witness, so without any other
corroborating evidence merely on the basis of his statement it cannot be assumed that the vehicle
No.MP09-K-7976 was being driven by respondent Mazhar at the time of accident. So in the
considered opinion of this court learned trial court did not commit any mistake in acquitting the
accused from the aforesaid charge. Hence, the petition is dismissed.
Record be sent back to the trial court along with the copy of this order. Accordingly, the M.Cr.C. is
disposed of.

filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.
[2] Brief facts of the case which are relevant to this petition are that, respondent/complainant filed a
private complaint before Judicial Magistrate First Class, Mandleshwar under Section 138 of
Negotiable Instruments Act against the applicant for dishonor of cheque averting that petitioner and
respondent were known to each other and out of that friendship when petitioner was in need of
money, respondent gave Rs.20,00,000/- to him. In order to discharge the said liability, a cheque
bearing No.185939 of Bank of India, Branch - Mandleshwar, was given by the petitioner to the
respondent. When the cheque given by the petitioner was presented by the respondent in his bank,
the same was returned by the petitioner's Bank due to insufficient funds. So action be taken against

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
applicant. On that complaint Learned Magistrate took cognizance against the applicant under
Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act and registered complaint as Criminal Case No.49/2016.
[3] During trial of the case applicant filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. averting that
though respondent had filed a criminal complaint against the applicant for dishonor of cheque
amounting to Rs.20,00,000/- but he did not file any documentary evidence regarding that amount
so respondent be directed to file all documents relating to his income, expenditure and income tax
return. In his reply respondent opposed the prayer. Learned Judicial Magistrate by order dated
23.09.2016 rejected that application observing that application filed by the applicant under Section
91 of Cr.P.C.was not maintainable at that stage against which applicant filed Cr.R.No.111/2016,
which was dismissed by order dated 15.02.2017 passed by the Additional Judge to the court of First
Additional Sessions Judge, West Nimar, Mandleshwar observing that the impugned order was an
interim order against which the Revision is not maintainable. Being aggrieved from that order
applicant has filed this petition.
[4] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that respondent/complainant filed a private
complaint against the petitioner averting that respondent gave Rs.20,00,000/- to the petitioner. In
order to discharge the said liability, a cheque bearing No.185939 of Bank of India, Branch -
Mandleshwar, was given by the petitioner to the respondent. When the said cheque was presented
by the respondent in his bank, the same was returned by the petitioner's Bank due to insufficient
funds. Applicant wants to cross-examine the respondent on the point that whether respondent
actually has the capacity to give Rs.20,00,000/- to the applicant for which documents regarding
income and expenditure and his income tax return are required. so they be called from the
applicant. Learned trial court committed mistake in rejecting his application.
[5] It appears from the record that respondent/complainant filed a private complaint against the
applicant averting that applicant took Rs.20,00,000/- from him and to discharge the said liability, a
cheque bearing No.185939 of Bank of India, Branch - Mandleshwar, was given by the petitioner to
the respondent. So prima facie burden for proving this fact lies on respondent and what documents
he wish to file to prove this fact depends upon his will. In his application applicant has not
mentioned the year/years for which he sought respondent's income tax return and regarding what
documents or for what period he wants income and expenditure details of respondent. His
application is vague, so learned trial court did not commit any mistake in rejecting the applicant's
application. Hence, petition is dismissed.

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order
dated 12.05.2015 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Mahidpur in Cr.R.No.298/2014,
whereby learned A.S.J. set aside the order dated 17.05.2014 passed by the Judicial Magistrate First
Class, Mahidpur, District Ujjain in Criminal Case No.694/2014 registered on a private complaint
filed by the applicant, whereby learned Magistrate took cognizance against the respondent and for
others for the offence under Section 6 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 368
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[2] Brief facts of this case which are relevant to this petition are that, applicant filed a private
complaint against the respondent before the J.M.F.C., Mahidpur, Ujjain averting that marriage of
his daughter Heena was solemnized with respondent Firoz on 09.02.2013 at Mahidpur. In the
marriage he gave jewellery, cloths, electric goods, almirah, fridge, T.V., washing machine, a cooler
and other home appliances worth Rs.3,50,000/- to his daughter. On 20.04.2013, respondent Firoz
gave divorce to his daughter Heena but he did not return the aforesaid house-hold goods, which he
gave to his daughter as dowry at the time of marriage. So cognizance be taken against the
respondent and six other persons under Section 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. On complaint
learned Judicial Magistrate First Class recorded statement of applicant and her witness Usman
Khan, Vaseem under Section 200 and 202 of Cr.P.C. and by order dated 17.05.2014 took cognizance
against respondent and four others under Section 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Being
aggrieved from that order respondent Firoz filed Cr.R.No.2098/14. That Revision was disposed of
by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Mahidpur by order dated 12.05.2015 wherein it set aside
the trial court's order observing that applicant's daughter Heena voluntarily left her matrimonial
house in the night of 19.03.2013 and she clearly admitted in a letter that she does not want to live
with respondent Firoz. She wanted to live with Nilesh Suryawanshi and also admitted that
respondent Firoz Khan had voluntarily given divorce to her and she had received all house-hold
goods which were given by her father as dowry. So offence under Section 6 of the Dowry Prohibition
Act is not made out against the respondent. Being aggrieved with that order applicant filed this
petition.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that at P.S. Jhalra Patan, District Jhalawad
respondent himself promised to return the house-hold goods which were given by the applicant as
dowry to his daughter at the time of her marriage but he did not do so. The affidavit filed by the
respondent before the Revisional Court alleging given by Heena is fake. Learned A.S.J. committed
mistake in rejecting the trial court's order by relying on that fake affidavit.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that according to Section 6 of the Dowry
Prohibition Act a list of articles which were given in dowry at the time of marriage should be made
but there is no such list. So it cannot be said that applicant gave aforesaid articles in dowry to her
daughter. On the contrary Heena at P.S. Jhalra Patan, District Jhalawad clearly admitted before the
Police Officers that she got all articles which were given to her at the time of her marriage. So no
question of returning the articles arises. Learned A.S.J. rightly rejected the applicant's prayer.
[5] First of all applicant himself averted in the application that he gave house-hold goods and other
articles to her daughter in her marriage. So those articles are the property of her daughter and not
the applicant. According to Section 6 of Dowry Prohibition Act, which reads as under :-
Section 6 in the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
6. Dowry to be for the benefit of the wife or her heirs.--
(1) Where any dowry is received by any person other than the woman in connection
with whose marriage it is given, that person shall transfer it to the woman-- --(1)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 369
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Where any dowry is received by any person other than the woman in connection with
whose marriage it is given, that person shall transfer it to the woman--"
(a) if the dowry was received before marriage, within 1[three months] after the date
of marriage; or
(b) if the dowry was received at the time of or after the marriage, within 1[three
months] after the date of its receipt; or
(c) if the dowry was received when the woman was a minor, within 1[three months]
after she has attained the age of eighteen years, and pending such transfer, shall hold
it in trust for the benefit of the woman. 2[(2) If any person fails to transfer any
property as required by sub-section (1) within the time limit specified therefor, 3[or
as required by sub-section (3),] he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term
which shall not be less than six months, but which may extend to two years or with
fine 4[which shall not be less than five thousand rupees, but which may extend to ten
thousand rupees] or with both.] 1[(2) If any person fails to transfer any property as
required by sub-
section (1) within the time limit specified therefor, 2[or as required by sub-section (3),] he shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months, but which may
extend to two years or with fine 3[which shall not be less than five thousand rupees, but which may
extend to ten thousand rupees] or with both.]"
(3) Where the woman entitled to any property under sub-section (1) dies before
receiving it, the heirs of the woman shall be entitled to claim it from the person
holding it for the time being:
3[Provided that where such woman dies within seven years of her marriage,
otherwise than due to natural causes, such property shall,-- 2[Provided that where
such woman dies within seven years of her marriage, otherwise than due to natural
causes, such property shall,--"
(a) if she has no children, be transferred to her parents; or
(b) if she has children, be transferred to such children and pending such transfer, be held in trust for
such children.] 5[(3A) Where a person convicted under sub-section (2) for failure to transfer any
property as required by sub-section (1) 3[or sub-section (3)] has not, before his conviction under
that sub-section, transferred such property to the woman entitled thereto or, as the case may be,
6[her heirs, parents or children] the Court shall, in addition to awarding punishment under that
sub- section, direct, by order in writing, that such person shall transfer the property to such woman
or, as the case may be, 6[her heirs, parents or children] within such period as may be specified in the
order, and if such person fails to comply with the direction within the period so specified, an amount
equal to the value of the property may be recovered from him as if it were a fine imposed by such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 370
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Court and paid to such woman or, as the case may be, 6[her heirs, parents or children]. 4[(3A)
Where a person convicted under sub-section (2) for failure to transfer any property as required by
sub-section (1) 2[or sub-section (3)] has not, before his conviction under that sub-section,
transferred such property to the woman entitled thereto or, as the case may be, 5[her heirs, parents
or children] the Court shall, in addition to awarding punishment under that sub-section, direct, by
order in writing, that such person shall transfer the property to such woman or, as the case may be,
5[her heirs, parents or children] within such period as may be specified in the order, and if such
person fails to comply with the direction within the period so specified, an amount equal to the value
of the property may be recovered from him as if it were a fine imposed by such Court and paid to
such woman or, as the case may be, 5[her heirs, parents or children]." (4) Nothing contained in this
section shall affect the provisions of section 3 or section 4.
This shows that where any dowry is received by any person other than the woman in connection
with whose marriage it is given, that person shall transfer it to that woman within three months.
[6] But the complaint has not been filed by Heena in whose marriage the aforesaid articles were
allegedly given. She also did not appear before the court to give her statement that respondent did
not return the articles back to her. Along with the complaint applicant also filed a copy of the notice
given by him to the respondent before filing of complaint wherein it is mentioned that a list of
articles given to the respondent at the time of marriage was prepared, but no such list was produced
by the applicant before the court. The complainant filed complaint against nine persons alleging that
all of them received the gifts given to Heena at the time of marriage. It is incredible that all the nine
persons together received the gift items while in the notice it is mentioned that all gifts were
received by respondent Firoz which is contradictory so in the opinion of this court learned
Additional Sessions Judge did not commit any mistake in rejecting the trial court's order. Hence,
petition is dismissed.

Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Dy. Govt. Advocate for the respondent/State.
Shri R.C.Verma, learned counsel for the complainant.
Case diary perused and arguments heard. This criminal appeal has been filed under Section 14-A of
SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the order dated 01.02.2017 passed by Special
Judge/Additional Sessions Judge, Jhabua, in Bail Application No.16/2017, whereby learned Judge
rejected the bail application filed by the appellant Mohammad Zeeshan S/o Mohammad Anees
under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. to get bail in Crime No.28/2017 registered at Police Station-A.J.K.,
Jhabua, District- Jhabua for the offence under Section 376 & 506 of IPC & Sections 3/4 of
Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act 2012 & Sections 3(2), 5(a) of SC/ST (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that prosecutrix lodged report on 24.01.2017 at Police Station
Meghnagar, District Jhabua averting that appellant sexually exploited her for two years in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 371
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
pretext of marriage. He also gifted her one mobile phone valued Rs.10,000/-. On 24.01.2017, at 1.00
p.m., at Meghnagar Bus Stand, when she asked appellant to marry her, he refused and abused her
and clearly stated that he can't marry her. When she told appellant that she will lodge a report, he
threatened to kill her. On that report, Crime No.28/17 was registered for the offence under Section
376 & 506 of IPC & Sections 3/4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act 2012 & Sections
3(2), 5(a) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. During investigation police arrested appellant on
25.01.2017. The appellant filed Bail Application No.16/2017 under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. for getting
bail. Learned Special Judge/Additional Sessions Judge, Jhabua rejected that application. Being
aggrieved appellant filed this Criminal Appeal.
[3] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that complainant is major and she is a consenting
party. She has wrongly lodged the report against the appellant. Appellant has falsely been implicated
in the crime. Charge-sheet has been filed. The appellant is in custody since 25.01.2017 and
conclusion of trial will take time, hence, counsel prayed for grant of bail.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State and complainant/prosecutrix opposed the prayer
made by the appellant and submitted that complainant was minor at the time of starting of the

This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 115 of CPC against the order dated 07.11.2016
passed by the XIIth Civil Judge Class-II, Indore in Civil Suit No.6-A/2015, whereby he rejected the
applicant's/defendent's application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case which are relevant for the disposal of this Revision are that
respondents/plaintiffs filed a Civil Suit No.6-A/2015 before the XIIth Civil Judge Class-II, Indore
for seeking arrears of rent and eviction of applicant from the part of suit house and in alternative for
seeking a declaration to declare them owner of that part of the suit house and also declaring that
part of the suit house in dangerous state and that it be demolished after eviction of applicant
averting that respondents are the owner of the suit house No.181 situated at Netaji Nagar, Indore. In
the back side of the suit house No.181 two rooms and kitchen were built in 14x20=280 sq.ft. Area,
which was given by the respondents on rent @ Rs.1,500/- per month to the applicant in the year
1993 by an oral agreement. The applicant had not paid rent since 21.05.2013. In the year 2010
Municipal Corporation also gave a notice to the respondents that the said construction is in
dangerous state and can't be used for human dwelling. That being so, applicant was directed to give
vacant possession of that part of suit house to respondents and pay arrears of rent.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 377
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[3] During trial of the suit applicant filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC averting that
the land of suit house was given to applicant's mother Munni Bai by the State Government on lease
so the provisions of M.P. Accommodation Control Act would not apply on the suit land.
Respondents also did not file any documentary evidence showing that the respondent is owner while
applicant is a tenant in his suit house, so respondents' suit is not maintainable. Even otherwise on
one hand respondents filed a suit averting that applicant is a tenant in the suit house and for his
eviction from the suit house and also for getting arrears of rent while on the other hand applicant
sought that he be declared owner of the suit house and it be declared in a dangerous stage and a
mandatory injunction be issued against the applicant to vacate the suit house which is contradictory
so suit is not maintainable.
[4] Learned Trial Court rejected the application observing that suit under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC
cannot be rejected merely on the ground that respondents sought contradictory relief. To decide
other objections it requires evidence which cannot be decided at this stage. Being aggrieved of that
order applicant filed this Revision.
[5] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that learned trial court has committed mistake in
rejecting the applicant's application without appreciating the fact that the respondents sought
contradictory relief in the suit and that without amending pleading of the suit, the same is not
maintainable.
[6] Respondents in their reply opposed the prayer.
[7] This court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the learned counsel for the
applicant. Although it appears from the averment of the plaint that respondents sought
contradictory relief in the suit but the suit cannot be rejected only on that ground that there is no
such provision under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC. Likewise the suit cannot be rejected only on the
ground that respondent has not filed any documentary evidence showing his ownership or
landlordship over suit property. It is a matter of evidence so learned trial court did not commit any
mistake in rejecting the application of applicant. Hence, the revision is dismissed.

Heard finally at the motion stage with the consent of both the parties..
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 read with
Sections 397/401 of Cr.P.C. against the order dated 01.12.2016 passed by the Principal Judge,
Family Court, Rajgarh in M.Cr.C.No.200/2015, whereby he allowed the application of respondents
filed under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. and directed the applicant to pay maintenance of Rs.5,000/- per
month to each of the respondent.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that respondents filled an application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C.
before the Family Court, Rajgarh for directing the applicant to pay maintenance averting that
respondent No.1 is legally wedded wife of applicant and respondents No.2 and 3 are his sons. Her
marriage was solemnized with the applicant on 13.02.2005 in Baran (Rajasthan) and after marriage
she resided with the applicant in his house at Kota (Rajasthan), but the behaviour of the applicant
and his family members was not good with her.
Applicant used to demand dowry and subjected her to cruelty, due to which respondent No.1 is
living with her parents along with her minor children i.e. respondents No.2 and 3.
Respondent No.1 has no means of earning and she is not able to maintain herself and her minor
sons. Applicant works in Tanishk Jewellers Showroom and earns Rs.40,000/- per month.
He also runs one talkies named Janta Cinema at Baran (Rajasthan) and earns Rs.30,000/- per
month. He is also having 10 shops at Kota and earning Rs.50,000/- per month as rent from those
shops and he is able to maintain his wife and children but has refused to do so without any sufficient
cause, so applicant be directed to pay maintenance to the respondents.
[3] Applicant in his reply opposed the prayer and denied the allegations levelled by the respondents
in his application and averted that he never demanded dowry from respondent No.1 and never
harassed her. Respondent No.1 herself is voluntarily living with her mother without any cause.
She is working as a Teacher in R.K.Academy, Biaora and earns Rs.10,000/- per month and is able to
maintain herself and her children, while applicant is a Store Manager in Tanishk Jewellers
Showroom and earns only Rs.17,685/- per month and his parents also depend on him. Therefore,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 386
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
prayed for rejection of application.
[4] Learned Trial Court after recording evidence of both the parties observed that respondent No.1 is
having sufficient reason to live separately from the applicant and is not able to maintain herself and
her children while applicant is able to maintain respondents but has refused to do so, therefore, he
directed the applicant to give Rs.5,000/- as maintenance to each respondent. Being aggrieved with
this order applicant filed this Criminal Revision.
[5] Only contention of the learned counsel for the applicant is that the amount of maintenance is on
higher side.
He submits that it is clearly established from the evidence produced by the applicant that applicant
earlier worked in Tanishk Jewellers Showroom but he left that job and presently has no means of
earning so he is not able to maintain respondents.
[6] On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submits that applicant himself in his
reply admitted that he works as Store Manager in Tanishk Jewellers Showroom, Kota and earns
Rs.17,685/- per month. The Certificate (Ex.D/1) filed by the applicant is not correct. It is clear from
the record that applicant is having many means of earning. He runs one talkies and also has many
shops in the market and earns much and is able to pay Rs.15,000/-
maintenance as awarded by the learned Trial Court.
[7] This Court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the parties. Learned trial
court itself in Para 22 of its judgment held that applicant earns Rs.17,685/-
per month as salary but it awarded Rs.15,000/- per month as maintenance, which is clearly on
higher side. Although respondent No.1 Dipika Chourasiya deposed that applicant runs one talkies
named Janta Cinema at Baran (Rajasthan). He is also having 25 to 30 shops at Baran (Rajasthan)
and also has one house at Kota (Rajasthan) with 10 shops at its ground floor, which earns him rent.
But applicant in his statement clearly denied the fact that he runs one talkies named Janta Cinema
at Baran (Rajasthan) and having 25 to 30 shops at Baran (Rajasthan) or has any house at Kota
(Rajasthan) with 10 shops at its ground floor which earns him rent.
[8] Respondents have not filed any document which shows that applicant possess the
aforementioned immovable property. So respondents' statement that applicant is having the
aforesaid immovable property and he is earning from that property does not appeared to be true.
Likewise although respondent No.1 stated that applicant works in Tanishk Jewellers Showroom,
Kota and earns Rs.40,000/- per month as salary and applicant also admitted in his reply that he
worked in Tanishk Jewellers Showroom but he got only Rs.17,685/- per month as salary from that
job. Respondents have not filed any documentary evidence which shows that applicant's salary is
Rs.40,000/- per month.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 387
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[9] Although applicant in his statement deposed that earlier he worked in Tanishk Jewellers
Showroom but form 15.11.2015 he has left his job and also filed Ex.D/1 resignation letter from that
job. But it is clear that respondents filed application for maintenance on 22.06.2015. Applicant filed
reply of respondents' application on 10.08.2015 in which he clearly admitted that he works at
Tanishk Jewellers Showroom, Kota and got a salary of Rs.17,685/-. Although on the stage of his
evidence on 18.11.2016 applicant filed Ex.D/1 showing that he resigned from the said service from
15.11.2015 but has not produced the person, who gave Certificate (Ex.D/1) in this regard, so this
Certificate is not believable. Even otherwise it appears strange that he left his job at the time of
evidence without any cause so it is incredible and does not appear to be correct.
[10] So from the evidence produced by the parties applicant's income appears only as Rs.17,685/-
per month. Learned trial court also in Para 22 of his judgment held that applicant's income is
Rs.17,685/- per month. In these circumstances, the amount of maintenance of Rs.15,000/- per
month is on higher side looking to the income of applicant. So it is appropriate to reduce the
maintenance amount.
[11] Hence, Revision is partly allowed and applicant is directed to pay a maintenance Rs.5,000/- per
month to respondent No.1 and Rs.2,500/- per month each to respondents No.2 and 3 instead of
Rs.5,000/- per month as directed by the trial court. Remaining conditions of the trial court's order
shall remain same. Accordingly, Revision stands disposed of.
C.c. as per rules.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
This criminal appeal has been filed under Section 14-A of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
against the order dated 16.01.2017 passed by Special Judge, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
District - Rajgarh, in Criminal Case No.13/2017, whereby learned Judge rejected the bail application
filed by the appellant Gopal S/o Shankarlal Jat under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. to get anticipatory bail
in Crime No.184/2016 registered at Police Station - Malawar, District - Rajagarh for the offence
under Section 376, 294 and 506 of IPC & Section 3(1)(B)(2), 3(2)(5) of SC/ST (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act (further refer as "Act").
[2] As per prosecution story, on 30.08.2016, prosecutrix lodged a written complaint at Police
Station A.J.K., Bhopal averting that appellant Gopal is threatening her since 1½ years and keeps
asking her to come to his field otherwise he would kill her husband. In the month of August, 2016
four days before Rakhi between 12.00 p.m. to 1.00 p.m., when she went in Gopal's field for taking
kanda (dung cake) Gopal caught her and raped her and threatened to kill her if she narrated the
incident to anybody. She narrated the incident to her husband, who asked Gopal as to why he raped
his wife, on which Gopal abused them and also tried to kill her husband. On this Police of P.S.
A.J.K., Bhopal sent report to P.S. Malawar, Distt Rajgarh, where Police registered Crime
No.184/2016 for the offence under Section 376, 294, 506 of IPC and Section 3(2)(5) & 3(1)(2) of
SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the appellant and investigated the matter. During
investigation it was found that prosecutrix lodged false report against the appellant Gopal. In these
circumstances, Police filed FR ([kkfjth fjiksVZ) in the court of Special Judge, Rajgarh. On that report
Special Judge Rajgarh took cognizance against the appellant and registered Special Case No.13/2017
and issued arrest warrant for securing the presence of appellant in the case. Learned Special Judge
also rejected the appellant's application filed under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. observing that from the
case diary it prima facie appeared that appellant committed rape with the prosecutrix and got FR
([kkfjth fjiksVZ) filed in this case using his influence. From the case diary, provisions of Section 18
of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act get attracted.
[3] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that prosecutrix lodged false report against the
appellant to harass him. During investigation, from the statement of prosecutrix herself it appeared
that prosecutrix filed false report against him, so police filed FR ([kkfjth fjiksVZ) in the crime.
Learned Trial Judge wrongly took cognizance against the appellant and issued warrant and that
provisions of Section 18 of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act are not attracted from the case diary
and prayed for anticipatory bail.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent/State opposes the prayer.
[5] Learned counsel of the prosecutrix submitted that he has no objection if the court allows the bail
of appellant.
[6] Although Crime No.184/2016 was also registered against the appellant for the offences under
Sections 3(1)(B) (2), 3(2)(5) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and according to Section 18 of
the Act provisions of Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not apply to the persons
committing an offence under the Act, but in Pankaj D. Suthar V/s. State Of Gujarat reported in
(1992) 1 GLR 405 while considering the scope of Section 18 of the Prevention of Atrocities Act, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 400
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Gujarat High Court observed :-
"Section 18 of the Atrocities Act gives a vision, direction and mandate to the Court as
to the cases where the anticipatory bail must be refused, but it does not and it
certainly cannot whisk away the right of any Court to have a prima facie judicial
scrutiny of the allegations made in the complaint. Nor can it under its hunch permit
provisions of law being abused to suit the mala fide motivated ends of some
unscrupulous complainant."
[7] Apex Court also in Vilas Pandurang and another V/s. State of Maharashtra and others reported
in (2012) 8 SCC 795 held that :-
"The scope of Section 18 of the SC/ ST Act read with Section 438 of the Code is such
that it creates a specific bar in the grant of anticipatory bail. When an offence is
registered against a person under the provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act, no Court shall entertain application for anticipatory bail, unless it
prima facie finds that such an offence is not made out. Moreover, while considering
the application for bail, scope for appreciation of evidence and other material on
record is limited. Court is not expected to indulge in critical analysis of the evidence
on record, which shows that in the crime registered for the offences under Atrocity
Act anticipatory bail can be granted when unless it prima facie finds that such an
offence is not made out."
[8] From Perusal of case diary and documents filed by the appellant it appears that prosecutrix
lodged the F.I.R. Fifteen days after the incident and during investigation complainant herself in her
statement said that appellant Gopal has not committed any act with her, even in her statement
before the Court recorded by the Judicial Magistrate First Class under Section 164 of Cr.P.C.
prosecutrix deposed that appellant had not committed rape with her. Besides that, before this Court
also, learned counsel of the prosecutrix expressed no objection on grant of bail to the appellant.
Even in the final report Police also mentioned that no case was made out against the appellant. in
these circumstance, from the case diary, prima facie no case is made out against the appellant.
[9] So appellant is entitled to get anticipatory bail, his appeal is allowed and it is directed that in the
event of his arrest in Crime No.184/2016 registered at Police Station Malawar, District Rajgarh, in
pursuance of the arrest warrant issued by the learned Special Judge Rajgarh or if he surrenders
before Special Judge Rajgarh in S.T. No.13/2017 the present appellant namely Gopal Jat S/o
Shankarlal Jat be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/-
(Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) with one solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the
Special Judge, Atrocity, Rajgarh. This order will remain operative subject to compliance of the
following conditions by the applicant :-
1. The appellant will comply with all the terms and conditions of the bond executed
by him;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 401
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
2. The appellant will co-operate in the investigation/trial, as the case may be;
3. The appellant will not indulge himself in extending inducement, threat or promise
to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him/her from
disclosing such facts to the Court or to the Police Officer, as the case may be;
4. The applicant shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order
dated 23.09.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Indore in Cr.R.No.619/2016, whereby he
affirmed the order dated 04.08.2016 passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore in Cr.
M.J.C. No.2/2006, whereby he rejected the applicant's prayer that since he has already undergone
whole sentence of imprisonment in default of payment of fine so recovery proceedings be not carried
out against the applicant.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that, respondent/complainant filed a private complaint against the
applicant under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for dishonor of cheque. On the
complaint Criminal Case No.1801/2001 was registered by Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore
and after trial Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore found applicant guilty for the offence under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and awarded three months' imprisonment and fine of
Rs.1,25,000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo one month's rigorous imprisonment,
against which applicant filed Cr.A.No.397/2004. That appeal was decided by the Additional
Sessions Judge, Indore by judgment dated 29.09.2004 and affirmed the order of Trial Judge,
against which applicant has also filed Cr.Rev. No.777/2004 in this court which was also rejected by
this court by order dated 24.08.2005 and the judgment of the Trial Judge became final. Applicant
has undergone the sentence awarded by the Trial Court.
[3] After that respondent filed Cr. M.J.C. No.2/2006 to procure the compensation amount from the
applicant. During prosecution of this case applicant filed an application under Section 300 of
Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore averting that because applicant has
undergone one month's RI in default of payment of fine so the recovery proceedings of
compensation amount cannot be carried out against the applicant.
[4] Learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore rejected the prayer observing that even after
undergoing the sentence in default of payment of compensation court issued recovery warrant
against the applicant for recovering of compensation amount, against which applicant filed Cr.R.
No.619/2016, which also was rejected by the Additional Sessions Judge, Indore. Being aggrieved
with this order applicant filed this petition.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 417
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[5] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that because applicant has already undergone
sentence awarded by the Trial Court in default of payment of compensation amount so the
compensation amount cannot be procured from the applicant.
[6] He placed reliance on the judgment of Rajasthan High Court passed in Ramnath V/s. Jagdish
Prasad Garg and another reported in 2000 Bank J. 29, in which court held that, "Petitioner having
already undergone the punishment awarded minus the fine; petition becomes infructuous as no
other mode of realisation of amount under criminal law is provided. Complainant may if he desires
file civil suit for recovery."
But in that case point whether the accused has already undergone the sentence of imprisonment in
default of payment of fine and so recovery proceeding be not carried out was not in issue that
Criminal Revision was filed by the accused against the judgment of conviction and sentence passed
by the appellate court against him.
Section 421 of Code of Criminal Procedure makes provision regarding this issue.
Section 421 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 reads as under :
421. Warrant for levy of fine.
(1) When an offender has been sentenced to pay a fine, the Court passing the
sentence may take action for the recovery of the fine in either or both of the following
ways, that is to say, it may-
(a) issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by attachment and sale of any movable
property belonging to the offender;
(b) issue a warrant to the Collector of the district, authorising him to realise the
amount as arrears of land revenue from the movable or immovable property, or both,
of the defaulter:
Provided that, if the sentence directs that in default of payment of the fine, the
offender shall be imprisoned, and if such offender has undergone the whole of such
imprisonment in default, no Court shall issue such warrant unless, for special reasons
to be recorded in writing, it considers it necessary so to do, or unless it has made an
order for the payment of expenses or compensation out of the fine under section 357.
(2) The State Government may make rules regulating the manner In which warrants
under clause (a) of sub- section (1) are to be executed, and for the summary
determination of any claims made by any person other than the offender in respect of
any property attached in execution of such warrant.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 418
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
(3) Where the Court issues a warrant to the Collector under clause (b) of sub- section
(1), the Collector shall realise the amount in accordance with the law relating to
recovery of arrears of land revenue, as if such warrant were a certificate issued under
such law: Provided that no such warrant shall be executed by the arrest or detention
in prison of the offender.
[7] Even in the judgment of Karnataka High Court passed in Y.Vishnu V/s. Venkatesh reported in
2007 (1) DCR 18, which is relied upon by the learned counsel for the applicant held as under :
"Section 421 of Cr.P.C. provides for recovery of fine by one of the two ways or by both
of them. One way of recovery is to issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by
attachment and sale of any movable property belonging to the offender. The second
mode of recovery is to issue a warrant to the Deputy Commissioner of the District,
authorising him to realise the amount as arrears of land revenue. Where the offender
undergoes the whole of the imprisonment in default of payment of fine, before
recovery or before issuance of warrant for recovery, no such warrant can be issued,
unless the Court assigns special reasons as to how despite the accused undergoing
default sentence, there is necessity of recovering fine. However, there is an exception
to this rule that is, if the recovery is for realising expenses of the complainant or the
compensation awarded under Section 357 of Cr.P.C., the power of the Court to issue
warrant for recovery of that amount, continues even after the accused undergoes the
default sentence in full."
[8] So, learned trial court did not commit any mistake in issuing recovery warrant to procure the
fine amount from applicant. Hence, petition is rejected.

Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Sections 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against
the order dated 18.03.2016 passed by the Second A.S.J., Jaora, Link Court, Alote in
S.T.No.119/2015, whereby he framed the charge against respondents under Section 306 of IPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that on 22.09.2014 deceased Firoz Khan committed suicide in his
house situated at Alote, District Ratlam. On the information Police registered merg No.31/14 under
Section 174 of Cr.P.C..
During investigation it was found that applicant no. 1 and 2, are the parents in law of deceased and
applicant no.3 is the wife of the deceased. The marriage of applicant no.3 was solemnized with
deceased on 22/05/2010. she is also having one daughter Roshni aged 3 years. Due to some dispute
between applicant no3 and deceased their matrimonial life got strained. So applicant no. 2 came to
deceased's house at Alot and took applicant No. 3 and her daughter Roshni with him. There he
threatened deceased's mother to lodge court case against deceased. Nine or Ten days later, on
21/05/2016 deceased Firoz telephoned her daughter Roshney and applicant No.3 but applicant No.
2 did not let deceased talk with his wife applicant No.3 and daughter Roshni, due to which deceased
Firoz committed suicide by consuming poison at his house in Alote. He also left a suicide note. On
that basis Police Alote registered Crime No.1403/2014 for the offence under Section 306/34 of IPC
against the applicant.
During investigation of crime Police recorded statement of family members of the deceased and
after investigation Police filed charge-sheet against the applicant for the offence under Section 306
of IPC. On that charge-sheet ST No.119/2015 was registered in the trial court and learned Second
A.S.J., Link Court, Alote, District Ratlam framed the charge against applicant under Section 306 of
IPC.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that it is clear from the evidence collected by the
Police against the applicant that deceased Firoz died due to consuming poison. From the statements
of witnesses produced by the Police along with charge-sheet, only allegation against the applicants
was that applicant No.3 wanted deceased to live with her parents at their house. Firoz committed
suicide because applicant No.2 took his wife applicant No.3 and daughter with him to their house
since deceased Firoz was unable to maintain his family. Applicant No.3 Roshan Bee is serving in
school, due to this reason applicants did not send their daughter with deceased. Apart from that
evidence there is no any other evidence against the applicants that they ill treated with the deceased.
Only on the ground that applicants did not send their daughter with deceased it cannot be said that
applicants abetted deceased Firoz for committing suicide.
He further submitted that deceased Firoz was Driver by profession and he was habitual of
consuming liquor and after consuming liquor he beated his wife, therefore, applicant No.2 took
applicant No.3 with him. But despite this learned trial court committed mistake in framing charge
under Section 306 of IPC against the applicants.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 425
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer and submitted that deceased Firoz in his
suicide note himself mentioned that he committed suicide because applicants did not send his wife
and daughter with him and that they are liable for his suicide. So, there is ample evidence to frame
charge against the applicants under Section 306 of IPC and prayed for rejection.
[5] This court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the parties. The suicide note
of deceased reads as thus:-

Husen, Zarina Khatun, Mohammad Rafiq, Gulam Husen, Chhoti Be @ Jubeda Bi,
Mohamad Shabbir and suicide note of deceased, it appears that only allegation
against the applicants, who are the wife's parents in law of the deceased are that their
was some dispute between applicant No.3 and her husband deceased Firoz, due to
which applicant No.2 took her daughter from the custody of deceased to his house at
Mandsaur and did not send her with the deceased and not let the deceased talk with
applicant No.3 and her daughter and wanted to marry applicant No.3 to another
person. On that count deceased Firoz committed suicide. Applicant No.2 took
applicant No.3 and her daughter Nine or Ten days before the incident.
[7] In the matter of Babbi @ Jitendra V/s. State of M.P. reported in 2008(2) MPHT
160 considering a case under Section 306 read with Section 107 of IPC, it has been
held as under by this Court :
"09. For making out an offence under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code, one
essential and requisite ingredient is 'abetment' by the accused to deceased to commit
suicide. Section 306 of Indian Penal Code reads as under :
306. Abetment of suicide - If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the
commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 426
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
10. As per definition given in Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code abetment is
constituted by :
(i) Instigating a person to commit an offence; or
(ii) Engaging in a conspiracy to commit it; or
(iii) Intentionally aiding a person to commit it.
1. A person is said to 'instigate' another to an act, when he actively suggests or stimulates him to the
act by means of language, direct or indirect, whether it takes the form of express solicitation, or of
hints, insinuation or encouragement. The word 'instigate' means to goad or urge forward or to
provoke, incite, urge or encourage to do an act."
Merely on the ground that deceased held the applicants liable for his suicide in his suicide note it
cannot be assumed that applicants abetted the deceased for committing suicide. For abetment to
commit suicide there should be evidence of any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence
on the part of the accused which lead or compelled the person to commit suicide.
[8] Merely because a relationship does not work out"
and one of the two people ends his or her life, the other person cannot be held guilty
of abetment. Besides, the accused must have possessed the knowledge or intention
that his acts would lead the person to commit suicide. Without knowledge or
intention, there can be no abetment. In this case the material on record may show a
cause for the husband to feel so depressed as to take such a decision, but how much
he was so depressed by the act of the applicants is different from person to person. It
is not a common feature that husbands are led to commit suicide. So it is not a
normal conduct.
[9] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Amalendu Pal @ Jhantu V/s. State of West
Bengal reported in 2010 AIR (SC) 512, after considering various earlier judgments in
para 15 observed that, "Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that before
holding an accused guilty of an offence under section 306 IPC, the Court must
scrupulously examine the facts and circumstances of the case and also assess the
evidence adduced before it in order to find out whether the cruelty and harassment
meted out to the victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to put an end
to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide
there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of
suicide. Merely on the allegation of harassment without their being any positive
action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or
compelled the person to commit suicide, conviction in terms of section 306 IPC is not
sustainable."

[10] So in the considered opinion of this court evidence collected against the applicants by the
prosecution are totally insufficient to infer that the applicants abetted for suicide, they may be cause
for the suicide but not the abetted. Resultant, the petition is hereby allowed. The impugned order
framing charge against the applicants for the offence under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code
deserves to be set aside. Accordingly the order framing charge under Section 306 of Indian Penal
Code is set aside. Accordingly, Revision is disposed of.
(Rajeev Kumar Dubey) Judge ns 13.02.2017 Shri Vikas Yadav, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Dy. Govt. Advocate for the respondent No.1/State.
Shri Akash Rathi, learned counsel for the respondent No.2.
Heard.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashment of
charge- sheet as well as proceedings of criminal case No.2130/2013 pending before the J.M.F.C.,
Indore for the offence under Section 498A, 294 and 506 of the IPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that, on 09.01.2013 respondent No.2 lodged a report at Police Station
Mahila Thana, Indore that she had known the applicant since 2009 both liked to each other so they
married on 04.07.2012 in Arya Samaj Mandir, Indore and started living together at Nehru Nagar,
Janta Quarter, Indore. The respondent No.2 was teacher at that time so she used to come to Satwas.
After marriage they lived happily for two months, but from 15.09.2012 her husband started beating
and abusing her and also demanded Rs.5,00,000/- (Rs. Five Lakhs) and on 07.10.2012 her husband
and his family members were going to engage her husband with Usha Rathore, then she informed
Usha Rathore that she is the wife of Mukesh and applicant and his family members are trying to get
her married to him by fraud. Thereafter Usha Rathore's family refused to do the engagement. On the
said refusal the applicant beat and threatened her. Then on 09.01.2013 she lodged the report at
Mahila Thana, Indore against the applicant. On that report Police Station Mahila Thana, Indore
registered Crime No.2/2013 for the offence under Section 498-A, 294 and 506 of IPC. After
investigation Police filed charge-sheet against the applicant. On that charge-sheet Criminal Case
No.2130/2013 was registered before the J.M.F.C., Indore and J.M.F.C., Indore framed charges
under Section 498A of the IPC against the applicant and tried the matter. The case is pending for
evidence before the trial court.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that there is no legal evidence to connect the
applicant with the offence. Looking to the FIR and charge-sheet no offence is made out against the
applicant. Respondent did love marriage with applicnt and after marriage she never resided with the
applicant. From the very same day she returned to Satwas. Before that report respondent also filed a
report in Police Station Mahila Thana, Indore averting that applicant solemnized temporary
marriage with her and soon after the marriage applicant left her. She had lived with applicant only
three hours after marriage then applicant left her. So there is no question of applicant's demanding
money or torturing the respondent. The FIR lodged by the respondent is false.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 428
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that from the FIR prima facie case under Section
498A of the IPC is made out. On the charge-sheet learned trial court prima facie found that offence
under Section 498A, 506 and 294 of IPC is made out and framed the charge against the applicant
for those offences. So there is no question of quashment of criminal case. The respondent filed
another application before the Mahila Thana averting that she only lived with the applicant for three
hours after marriage is not a part of charge-sheet under which circumstances, that application is
filed, is a matter of evidence. The application filed by the applicant along with petition is not a part
of charge-sheet. So, it can't be considered for quashing the Criminal Case that under what
circumstances did the respondent filed that application is a matter of evidence. So considering that
application, at this stage proceedings of Criminal Case No.2130/2013 cannot be quashed.
[5] This court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by both the counsels.
[6] Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Haryana and others V/s. Bhajan Lal and others
reported in 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 held that :-
"The power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and
with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases. The extraordinary or
inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according
to its whim or caprice. The court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry
as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or
the complaint.
The following categories of cases can be stated by way of illustration wherein the
extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482
CrPC can be exercised by the High Court either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised :
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Sections 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 429
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge."
[7] It appears from the record that after investigation of the report lodged by the respondent No.2,
police found prima facie case against the applicant and filed charge-sheet against the applicant so at
this stage only on the basis of document filed by the applicant along with this application it cannot
be assumed that respondent No.2 filed the report just to harass the applicant based on false
allegation.
[8] Prima facie offence under Section 498A, 294 and 506 are clearly made out from the FIR,
whether the allegation made by the respondent No.2 in the report is true or not? It cannot be
ascertained at this stage as it requires evidence, therefore, FIR cannot be quashed. So the petition is
dismissed. Applicant is free to raise all objections before the trial court at appropriate stage.

Shri Z.A.Khan, learned Senior Counsel with Shri S.Ansari, learned counsel for the respondents.
Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Sections 397(1) and 401 of Cr.P.C. against the order
dated 01.07.2015 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Indore in Criminal Complaint
No.26409/2015, whereby he took cognizance against the respondents under Section 294, 323 and
341 read with Section 34 of IPC but did not take cognizance under Sections 506 and 393 of IPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that applicant filed a criminal complaint against the respondents
averting that on 30.01.2015, at 2.45 p.m., applicant went to Life Insurance Corporation's Office,
Indore, where respondents Sunil Jhinjhore and Abdul Jalal Mulla abused and beated him and
another 25-30 persons confined the applicant and respondents Sunil Jhinjhore and Abdul Jalal
Mulla tried to loot money from applicant. On that applicant informed Aditya Garg on phone then he
came there. Respondents No.1 Sunil Jhinjhore, No.2 Abdul Jalal Mulla and No.3 Bhupendra
Rathore with the aid of other persons beated Aditya Garg also and tore his shirt. Applicant and
Jitendra lodged report about the incident at Police Station Tukoganj, Indore but Police did not lodge
the FIR. So cognizance under Section 294, 506, 323, 342 and 393 read with Section 34 of IPC be
taken against the respondents. Learned trial court recorded statements of applicant and Aditya Garg
under Section 200/202 of Cr.P.C., then by order dated 01.07.2015 on the complaint took cognizance
against the respondents under Section 294, 323 and 341 read with Section 34 of IPC but did not take
cognizance under Sections 342, 506 and 393 of IPC against them. Being aggrieved from that
applicant filed this Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that from the complaint and statements given by
the applicant and Aditya Garg (PW-2) offence under Section 393 and 506 of IPC is clearly made out.
Learned trial court committed mistake in not taking cognizance under Section 393 and 506 of IPC.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that there is no prima facie evidence on record to
take cognizance against the respondents under Section 393 and 506 of IPC, so learned trial court
has not committed any mistake in not taking cognizance against the respondents under Section 393
and 506 of IPC.
[5] This court perused the record and arguments put forth by both the parties.
[6] Applicant only deposed that at the time of incident respondent Sunil Jhinjhore, Abdul Jalal
Mulla and Dilip Jain tried to snatch money from him and respondents also threatened to break his
legs that if he lodged the report in Police, he would break legs and hand of him. But for attracting
offence under Section 506 of IPC the threat should be a real and not just a mere word. When the
person uttering it does exactly what he said and also when the person at whom threat is launched
feels actually threatened. Empty threats does not prima facie means that the case under section 506
I.P.C. is made out. If the threat is mere word there is no offence. Words used should indicate as to
what the accused was going to do and the complainant must feel as reasonable man that the accused
was going to convert his words into action, but it is does not appear from the statement of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 437
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
complainant that complainant felt, as reasonable man, that the accused was going to convert his
words in action, on the contrary complainant himself stated that after the threat of respondent to
break his hands and legs if he lodged the complaint, he went to Police Station Tukoganj, for lodging
the report which shows that respondent's threat caused no fear to complainant. So trial court did not
commit any mistake in not taking cognizance under Section 506 of IPC, likewise complainant
deposed that respondents tried to snatch money from him but it is not stated that from where
respondents tried to snatch money either from his pocket or from his hand.
Moreover he did not even disclose the amount he was carrying that respondents tried to snatch and
where he kept that money. So, learned trial court has also not committed any mistake in not
registering the case under Section 393 of IPC.
Hence, Revision has no force and is hereby dismissed.

learned Counsel for the applicants.
Shri Himanshu Joshi, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.
Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Sections 397 read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. against
the order dated 18.03.2016 passed by the Second A.S.J., Jaora, Link Court, Alote in
S.T.No.119/2015, whereby he framed the charge against respondents under Section 306 of IPC.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that on 22.09.2014 deceased Firoz Khan committed suicide in his
house situated at Alote, District Ratlam. On the information Police registered merg No.31/14 under
Section 174 of Cr.P.C. was registered. During investigation it was found that applicant ill treated
deceased Firoz. Due to this reason he committed suicide in his house. On that basis Police Alote
registered Crime No.1403/2014 for the offence under Section 306/34 of IPC against the applicant.
During investigation of crime Police recorded statement of family members of the deceased and
after investigation Police filed charge-sheet against the applicant for the offence under Section 306
of IPC. On that charge-sheet ST No.119/2015 was registered in the trial court and learned Second
A.S.J., Link Court, Alote, District Ratlam framed the charge against applicant under Section 306 of
IPC.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that it is clear from the evidence collected by the
Police against the applicant that deceased Firoz died due to consuming poison. The statements of
witnesses produced by the Police along with charge-sheet. Only allegation against the applicants was
that applicants want to deceased live with them at their house. Firoz committed suicide because
applicants took his wife and daughter with them in their house because deceased Firoz was unable
to maintain his family. Applicant No.3 Roshan Bee is serving in school, due to this reason applicants
not sent their daughter with deceased, apart from that evidence there is no any other evidence
against the applicants that they ill treated the deceased. Only on the ground that applicants not sent

their daughter with deceased it cannot be said that applicants abetted deceased Firoz for committing
suicide. He further submitted that as per prosecution case deceased Firoz was Driver by profession
and he was habitual for consuming liquor and after consuming liquor he beated his wife and
forcefully took with him. Applicant No.3 Roshan Bee stated to deceased that if he leaves liquor and
not ill treat her. Due to this reason Firoz has committed suicide, so as per whole charge-sheet there
is no whisper of evidence collected by the prosecution under Section 107 of IPC and there is no
evidence of any abetment or instigation for committing suicide found by prosecution. But despite
this learned trial court committed mistake in framing charge under Section 306 of IPC against the
applicants.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer and submitted that deceased Firoz
himself in his letter mentioned that he committed suicide because applicants not sent her wife and
daughter with him and applicants are liable for his suicide. So, there is ample evidence against the
applicants to frame charge against the applicants under Section 306 of IPC and reject their prayer.
[5] It appears from the record that only allegation against the applicants is that applicants who are
the father-in-
law and mother-in-law of the deceased took their daughter with them and not sent with deceased
Firoz on that count deceased Firoz committed suicide.
[6] Learned counsel for the applicant in this regard also placed reliance on the judgment of this
court passed in Hariom S/o Ramesh Kumar V/s. State of M.P. reported in 2007(1) M.P.L.J. Page 195
in which this court held that, "Abetment to commit suicide - Proof - The act of the accused must fall
in any of the three categories as enumerated under Section 107 of IPC. It is the duty of the
prosecution to establish that the accused has abetted the commission of suicide and for the purpose
of determining the act of accused it is necessary to see that his act must fall in any of the three
categories as enumerated under Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code. It is necessary to prove that
the said accused instigated the person to commit suicide or engaged himself with one or more other
persons in any conspiracy for seeing that the deceased commits suicide. In the present case there is
no direct or indirect connection between the act of applicant and the act of deceased of commission
of suicide. Applicant is said to have entered the house in the night, but the deceased hanged herself
in the morning at about 8.00 a.m. It appears that under great stress and depression and feeling
ashamed by the conduct of applicant, she committed suicide. Apparently, the charge under Section
306 of Indian Penal Code is not sustainable against applicant merely on the ground that deceased
felt ashamed by the said conduct of accused. However, there is material on record to indicate that
applicant had entered the house of complainant in the night. The act of entering the house in the
night, without permission and consent of the complainant amounts to an offence under Section 451
of Indian Penal Code. Therefore, the order framing charge under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code
is set aside. However, the trial court is directed to frame the charge under Section 451 of Indian
Penal Code and to proceed according to law."
and also placed reliance on the judgment of this court passed in Parmal Singh S/o Asharam Kateria
(Rajput) and others V/s. State of M.P. reported in 2011 (1) M.P.L.J. Page 340, whereby this court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 439
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
held that, "Charge framed against for abetment of suicideby wife - Revision - Deceased committed
suicide as she was dejected by allegation of her having illicit relations - Suicide committed by her
after more than 15 hrs. from the time of quarrel - Act of did not fall within the ambit and scope of
abetment as defined under Section 306 Penal Code - No prima facie case of framing of charge for
commission of offence punishable under Section 306 Penal Code is made out - Order of trial Court
directing framing of charge against set aside - Revision application allowed."

(Rajeev Kumar Dubey) Judge ns Criminal Revision No.1445/2015 08.02.2017 Shri M.A.Mansoori,
learned counsel for the applicant.
Heard.
This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 against the
order dated 31.07.2015 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Mandsaur in
M.Cr.C.No.432/2014, whereby he allowed the application of respondent's filed under Section 127 of
Cr.P.C. and enhanced the maintenance amount from Rs.2,000/- to Rs.3,000/-.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that respondents No.1 and 2 are minor children of the applicant.
Earlier they filled M.Cr.C.No.52/2007 under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. for getting maintenance from the
applicant, In that case trial court vide order dated 19.05.2010 directed the applicant to give
Rs.1,000/- per month as maintenance for each of the respondents. On 04.12.2013, respondents filed
an application under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. before the trial court for enhancement of
maintenance amount on the ground that the awarded amount is not sufficent for maintaining them,
so amount of maintenance be enhanced. Although applicant opposed the prayer but learned trial
court after recording the evidence of both the parties allowed the application and enhanced the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 445
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
amount from Rs.1,000/- to Rs.1,500/- for each of the respondent. Being aggrieved with the order
applicant has filed this Criminal Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that learned trial court without appreciating the fact
that applicant is not able to give enhanced amount because his income is on lower side, on the
contrary respondents are living with their mother and their mother running beauty parlor and earns
Rs.15,000/- to Rs.20,000/- per month and she is able to maintain the respondents wrongly
enhanced the amount of maintenance.
[4] It is appeared from the evidence on record that applicant himself admitted that between the year
2010 to 2015 went inflation has doubled and also admitted that the respondents are gradually
getting older so need of respondents are also growing. There is no reliable evidence on record which
shows that mother of respondents is running beauty parlor and earns Rs.15,000/- to Rs.20,000/-
per month.
Although applicant deposed that he is a laborer and only earns Rs.4,500/- per month. but he also
admitted that his mother having shop he works in the house of his mother. It is not believable that
applicant is working as labourer in the house of her mother, so it appears that applicant for hiding
his income wrongly deposed the facts. it is known fact that inflation is increasing and need of
respondent is also growing with her age. in these circumstances learned trial court has not
committed any mistake in enhancing the maintenance amount from Rs.2,000/- to Rs.3,000/-.
Hence, the Revision is dismissed.
(Rajeev Kumar Dubey) Judge ns 08.02.2017 Ms. Archna Maheshwari, learned counsel for the
applicant.
Heard.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for recalling the
order dated 14.12.2016 passed by this Court in Cr.R.No.1591/2015 by which this Court rejected
applicant's Revision and maintained the order dated 21.11.2015 passed by the Principal Judge,
Family Court, Neemuch, in Criminal MJC No.30/2014, whereby the learned Judge ordered the
applicant to pay arrears of maintenance amounting to Rs.14,300/- to respondent No.1 for the period
of 01.02.2012 to 31.12.2012 and amounting to Rs.1,36,000/- to respondent No.2 for the period of
10.09.1996 to 31.12.2012.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that, the respondents had filed an application for grant of maintenance
under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (henceforth the code) in Criminal MJC
No.21/1999 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Neemuch which was allowed and
Respondent No.1was granted Rs.1300/- per month from 10.9.1996 and respondent No.2 was
granted Rs.700/- per month from 10.9.1996 till attaining majority or till her marriage. Thereafter an
application was made by the respondents on 2/1/13 for recovery of the amount under Section 125
(3) read with Section 128 Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate First Class Neemuch, demanding
amount for Respondent No.1 from 1/1/12 to 31/12/12 and for Respondent No.2 from 10.9.1996 to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 446
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
31/12/12. This proceeding was transferred from the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class to
Principal Judge Family Court Neemuch.
[3] The applicant raised the objection that respondent No.2 has become major so she has no right to
get the maintenance. Even otherwise in view of section 125(3) of the code recovery of the amount
should be confined to one year prior to filing of the application. The rest of the amount stands time
barred in view of subsection (3) of section 125 of the code.
[4] The Principal Judge Family Court Neemuch, by order dated 21.11.2015 rejected the applicant's
objection by observing that respondent No.2 became major on 01.07.2012 and she filed the
application on 02.01.2013 within one year of attaining majority. So her application under Section
125 (3) Cr.P.C. is maintainable. The applicant is bound to pay maintenance to respondent No.2 from
10.09.1996 to till attaining the age of majority and of her marriage. Being aggrieved by the order, the
applicant filed Cr.R.No.1591/2015, which was decided by this court vide order dated 14.12.2016 and
maintained the order of the trial court observing that respondent No.2 became major on 01.07.2012
and respondent No.2 filed the said application on 02.01.2013 i.e. within one year of attaining
majority which is well within time.Being aggrieved from that order applicant filed this petition.
[5] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that applicant in the revision filed before this court
took an objection that respondent No.2 had become major before filing of execution but respondent
No.1 Rashida filed an execution on behalf of respondent No.2 as guardian hiding the fact that she is
a major. The minor could have filed an application within a year after attending majority and
claimed maintenance from 1999 but the application was filed by her mother which cannot be filed
after lapse of so many years. The application is time barred so impugned order may kindly be
recalled.
[6] It appears from the record that this court after evaluating all the facts clearly held that the time
given under first proviso to Section 125(3) of the Code for filing application for recovery of arrear of
maintenance would run from the date from which respondent No.2 became major i.e. 01.07.2012
and respondent No.2 filed the said application on 02.01.2013 i.e. within one year of attaining
majority which is well within time.
[7] There is no ambiguity in that order. The application for getting maintenance was filed by both
the respondents. So only on the ground that in the application it is mentioned that respondent No.2
is minor, it cannot be said that the application is not filed by the respondent no.2. Hence, this
petition has no force and is hereby dismissed.

This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 19(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 read with
Section 397 and 401 of Cr.P.C. against the order dated 13.10.2015 passed by the Second Additional
Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore in M.J.C.No.3881/2015, whereby applicant is directed to pay
Rs.3,000/- per month as interim maintenance to the respondent during trial of the case.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that respondent filed an application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C.
before the Second Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore for getting maintenance from the applicant
and also filed an application for getting interim maintenance during trial of the case.
Learned trial court observing that respondent is the legally wedded wife of applicant and presently
living separate from the applicant and it is the duty of the applicant to maintain her, directed the
applicant to pay Rs.3,000/- per month as interim maintenance to the respondent during trial of the
case.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that learned trial court without appreciating the fact
that respondent voluntarily without any cause is living separately from the applicant, so she is not
entitled for any maintenance.
Even otherwise respondent helps her parents in business and earns Rs.15,000/- to Rs.20,000/- and
she is able to maintain herself while applicant is unemployed and unable to give maintenance to the
respondent. Thus, learned trial court has wrongly ordered the applicant to pay Rs.3,000/- per
month as interim maintenance during trial of the case.
[4] Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that applicant without any cause refused to
maintain the respondent. So learned trial court has not committed any mistake in awarding
Rs.3,000/- per month as interim maintenance during trial of the case.
[5] This Court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the parties. It is admitted
that respondent is a legally wedded wife of the applicant and at present living with her parents. In
that circumstances, respondent is entitled to get maintenance from the applicant.
Whether respondent is voluntarily living separately from the applicant or she is able to maintain
herself is a matter of evidence. It cannot be decided at this stage without evidence.
Although applicant stated that he is unemployed presently and it is admitted that applicant is a
Software Engineer. It is not the case of the applicant that he is unable to do work because of any
inability. So under these circumstances, if learned trial court awarded Rs.3,000/- per month as
interim maintenance during trial of the case to the respondent, it cannot be said to be wrong. So,
Revision is dismissed.

Heard finally at motion stage. This Civil Revision has been filed under Section 115 of the Civil
Procedure Code against the order dated 29.03.2016 passed by the Second Civil Judge, Class-II,
Nagda in Civil MJC No.3/15; whereby he allowed the application filed under Order 9 Rule 13 of CPC
by the respondents/defendants before the court to set aside the ex parte judgment and decree
passed by the trial court in Civil Suit No.30-A/2014.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that applicant filed a Civil Suit No.30-A/2014 before the Second Civil
Judge, Class-II, Nagda against the respondents for declaring him owner of suit land and restraining
the respondent to interfere in his possession in the suit land. During trial of the suit, on 08.12.2014,
respondent and his counsel were absent, so trial court proceeded ex parte against the respondent
and passed the ex parte judgment in favour of the applicant on 23.06.2015. For setting aside that
judgment and decree respondents filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the CPC on
01.09.2015 before the trial court and also filed an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act
for condoning the delay in filing the application before the trial court. In reply applicant opposed the
prayer. But Learned trial court allowed the application observing that the disposal of case should be
on merits and not only on technical grounds. Being aggrieved by the impugned order applicant filed
this Civil Revision.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that learned trial court wrongly allowed the
application of respondents without giving an opportunity for producing evidence.
[4] It appears from the record that the applicant in his reply opposed the prayer of respondents. The
application filed by the respondents is also time barred and respondent also filed an application
under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to condone the delay in filing the application under Order 9
Rule 13 of the CPC. In that circumstances it is the duty of the court to give opportunity to the parties
to give evidence in support of their contentions. Learned trial court without giving proper
opportunities to both the parties to produce evidence in support of their contentions decided the
application, which cannot be said to be correct. This court in the case of Babulal Ramcharan and
others V/s. Chhotekhan Lal Khan reported in 1976 MPLJ Page 843 held that, "under Order 9 Rule
13 of the CPC the applicant must show that he was prevented by any "sufficient cause" from
appearing when the suit was called on for hearing. And, sufficient cause can be made out to the
satisfaction of the Court only on the basis of evidence. It cannot depend on any whim or fancy of the
presiding officer. It is the duty of the court to give each of the parties reasonable opportunity to
support or oppose the application."
But learned trial court without giving proper opportunity to the parties decided the application
which cannot be said to be corrected. Hence, revision is allowed and the impugned order passed by
the trial court is set aside without commenting on merits and the matter is remanded back to the
trial court with the direction that first trial court give an opportunity to respondents for producing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 456
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
the evidence in support of their application. Thereafter, give an opportunity to the applicant for
rebuttal and then again decide the application on merits.
[5] Applicant is directed to appear before the trial court on 22.03.2017. Record be sent back to the
trial court along with the copy of order before 22.03.2017. Accordingly, the Revision is disposed of.

Shri Sachin Bhatnagar, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Anand Soni, learned counsel for the respondent. Heard.
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the order
dated 22.09.2015 passed by the learned First A.S.J., Mandleshwar in Special Case No.18/2013,
whereby learned Judge rejected the application filed by the applicant under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. to
recall the complainant Nawal Singh for further cross-examination.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that applicant is facing trial for the offences under Sections 7, 13(1)(d)
read with Section 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act for taking bribe from complainant Naval
Singh for correcting entries of revenue record.
[3] During trial of the case on 22.09.2015 applicant filed an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C.
averting that according to the information received by the applicant from office of Tehsildar Tehsil
Bhagwanpura, District Khargone complainant did not file any application before the office of
Tehsildar Tehsil Bhagwanpura, District Khargone for correcting the revenue entries and procuring
new Bhoo Adhikar Pustika. So, he wants further cross-examination of complainant in this regard.
[4] Respondent in his reply opposed the prayer and averted that from the documents produced with
charge-sheet it is clear that the work of complainant was pending before the applicant at the time of
incident and pray for rejection.
[5] Learned trial court rejected his application observing that earlier also applicant had filed
application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. on 08.05.2015 which was rejected by this court. Applicant
again filed the application on the same ground. There is no need to recall the complainant for
re-examination and that applicant is free to file document in his defence. Being aggrieved from this
applicant has filed this petition.
[6] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that applicant is facing trial for allegedly
demanding and taking illegal gratification for correcting revenue entries of complainant's land and
issuing new Bhoo Adhikar Pustika while the information received from office of Tehsildar Tehsil
Bhagwanpura, District Khargone after completion of examination of complainants Naval Singh
(PW1) before trial court shows that no such work of complainant was pending before the revenue
authority at the time of incident. So it is essential to cross examine the complainant on the point on
the basis of information received. The trial court wrongly rejected his application for further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 457
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
cross-examination of complainant in this regard.
[7] Learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer and submitted that applicant had full
opportunity to cross-examine the complainant and he has filed this application only for delaying the
trial. Learned trial court has rightly rejected the prayer.
[8] It is clear from the record that the deposition of complainant before trial court completed on
19/08/14. At that time trial court gave full opportunity to the applicant to cross- examine the
complainant. Applicant himself averted in the petition that he received the information on 11/11/14
while applicant filed the application for further cross examine the complainant before trial court on
03/06/15, almost seven months after receiving the information. Applicant also had full opportunity
to file the said documents in his defence. So trial court did not commit any mistake in rejecting the
prayer. Hence, the petition is dismissed.

of Shri P.K.Gupta, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Sanjay Sharma, learned counsel for the respondent.
Heard finally at motion stage. This Criminal Revision has been filed under Section 19(4) of the
Family Courts Act, 1984 against the order dated 07.09.2015 passed by the First Additional Principal
Judge, Family Court, Indore in M.Cr.C.No.552/2013 whereby he allowed the application of
respondent filed under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. and directed the applicant to pay Rs.4,000/- per
month as maintenance to respondent.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that respondent filed an application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. for
getting maintenance from the applicant before the trial court averting that she is the legally wedded
wife of the applicant. Her marriage was solemnized with applicant on 09.03.2008. But, since
marriage the behaviour of applicant and his family members was not good with her. After marriage
she lived with her husband only for one & half year . Later applicant sent the respondent with her
brother to her maternal home and never recalled her from there. Applicant and his family members
asked for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- cash, a tractor and a car from the parents of respondent for
taking her back.
Aggrieved by such behaviour of the applicant and his family members respondent filed a petition
before the Family Court, Indore for restitution of conjugal rights. Learned Trial Court allowed the
applicant's petition. In compliance of that order applicant took the respondent along with him on
01.02.2013, but his behaviour with the respondent remained same but after sometime he left the
respondent at her parental house.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Then respondent lodged the report against the applicant in Police Station Malharganj. On the report
Crime No.251/2013 was registered, which is already pending against the applicant. Respondent is
handicapped and is not able to maintain herself. Applicant is having 13 Bigha agriculture land
situated at Village Utavad, Tehsil and District Dhar from which applicant earns Rs.2,50,000/- per
annum. Applicant is also having business of selling milk and earns Rs.10,000/- per month and is
able to maintain respondent, but has refused to maintain the respondent without any sufficient
cause. So, the applicant is directed to pay Rs.10,000/- per month as maintenance.
[3] Applicant in his reply opposed the prayer and denied the allegation levelled by the respondent
against him and averted that family members of the respondent solemnized the marriage of
respondent with applicant deceiving the fact that she is handicapped . Also, at the time of marriage
applicant was minor, so applicant's marriage with respondent is void. Applicant never demanded
any dowry and never harassed the respondent. Respondent made false allegation in this regard in
her application. Respondent works as Beautician and also works in a private company and earns
Rs.13,000/-per month and is able to maintain herself, while applicant earns only
Rs.30000-35,000/- per year and he is not able to maintain respondent and prays for rejection of
application.
[4] Learned Trial Court after recording evidence of both the parties allowed the application of
respondent and directed the applicant to pay Rs.4,000/- per month as maintenance to respondent
observing that respondent is a legally wedded wife of applicant and is not able to maintain herself
while applicant who is able to maintain her is not maintaining respondent without any sufficient
cause.
[5] Being aggrieved by the impugned order applicant filed this revision.
[6] Learned Counsel for the applicant submitted that Trial Court by the order dated 18.03.2015
wrongly closed the right of applicant to cross-examine the respondent due to which because
applicant was debarred from his right. It is also proved from the evidence that respondent was
minor at the time of marriage and the family members of the respondent solemnized marriage of
respondent with applicant deceiving the fact that respondent is handicapped. Since applicant was
minor at the time of marriage, so marriage of respondent with applicant is void. In these
circumstances respondent has no right to claim maintenance. Even otherwise it is clearly proved
from the evidence produced by the parties that respondent is able to maintain herself while
applicant is having only 1/6th share in 10 Bigha of his agriculture land and only earns
Rs.30000-35,000/- per annum. Trial Court without appreciating the fact wrongly awarded
Rs.4,000/- per month maintenance.
[7] Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that Trial Court after appreciating all the evidence
rightly awarded maintenance of Rs.4,000/-. There is no need for interference in that order and pray
for rejection of the petition.
[8] The court perused the record and arguments put forth by the parties. It appeared from the
record that learned Trial Court by order dated 18.03.2015 closed the right of applicant to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 459
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
cross-examine the respondent but at the same time it also appeared from the record that on
22.09.2014 respondent and her brother was present in the court for giving evidence but applicant
sought time to cross-examine. On that Trial Court fixed next date of evidence on 22.11.2014. On that
date again applicant sought time for evidence of respondent and her brother Pradeep, then learned
Trial Court fixed next date as 18.02.2015. On that date applicant yet again sought time to
cross-examine the respondent whereupon trial court gave one more opportunity by way of last
indulgence and case was fixed for 18.03.2015 but again on that date applicant sought time to
cross-examine the respondent. Then Trial Court closed the right of applicant to cross-examine the
respondent. Where, even after taking four opportunities the applicant did not cross-examine the
respondent, the trial court did not commit any error in closing the right of applicant to
cross-examine the respondent.
[9] Although applicant stated that parents of the respondent solemnized marriage of respondent
with him deceiving the fact that respondent is handicapped so marriage is void but it does not
appear to be correct. Because applicant himself admitted that after marriage respondent lived with
him for three years and if parents of respondent solemnized marriage of respondent with applicant
deceiving the fact that respondent is handicapped then applicant should have filed the suit for
declaring the marriage void on that ground then and there.
[10] Applicant also stated that at the time of marriage he was minor so his marriage with respondent
is void but as per hindu marriage Act the marriage of a minor is not void. It is not the case of
applicant that he after attaining the majority filed any suit for annulling the marriage on that
ground. So it is clearly proved that respondent is a legally wedded wife of applicant.
[11] Respondent clearly deposed that after marriage she lived with the applicant for three years but
after that applicant sent the respondent with her brother to her maternal home and never recalled
her back. Then she filed the petition before the Family Court. On the order of Family Court applicant
took her but after one & half year applicant again left her in her parental home. Since then
respondent is living with her father. The statement of respondent is corroborated by the statement
of Pradeep (PW-2). Respondent also deposed that applicant did natra with Pooja and at present
Pooja is living with the applicant as his wife. Applicant himself in his cross-examination clearly
admitted that he was not ready to keep respondent with him which shows that applicant himself not
willing to keep respondent with him.
[12] Respondent also deposed that she is handicapped and she has no earning. Although applicant
stated that respondent teaches children and also does sewing work and earns Rs.20000 to 22,000/-
per month but respondent clearly denied this fact. Applicant did not produce any cogent evidence
which proves that respondent teaches children and also does sewing work and earns Rs.20,000 to
22,000/- per month.
[13] So it is clearly proved that respondent is a legally wedded wife of applicant and is not able to
maintain herself while applicant is able to maintain respondent but has refused to maintain her
without any sufficient cause. In these circumstances respondent is entitled to get maintenance from
the applicant.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 460
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[14] As far as the amount of maintenance is concerned. It appears from the record that learned trial
court on the basis of Ex.P/4 and P/5 revenue papers of agricultural land of applicant assumed that
applicant is having sufficient income but it is clear from Ex.P/4 and P/5 that applicant has only
1/6th share in total 2.516 hectare land mentioned in Khasra and Khatoni. So the maintenance
awarded by the trial court to the applicant appears to be on the higher side. It is appropriate to
reduce the amount of maintenance from Rs.4,000/- to Rs.3,000/-. Accordingly, the Revision is
partly allowed and the maintenance amount awarded by the trial court to the applicant is reduced
from Rs.4,000/- to Rs.3,000/-
per month. Remaining conditions of the trial court order shall remain the same.
The revision is disposed of accordingly.

Heard.
This Civil Revision has been filed under Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code against the order
dated 05.12.2015 passed by the First A.M.A.C.T., Mandleshwar whereby he rejected applicant's
application to pay the amount of Rs.57,375/- in cash which was kept by the Tribunal in Fixed
Deposit in the name of the applicant in the Nationalized Bank.
[2] Brief facts of this case are that applicant and other person filed the Claim Case No.3/2012 before
the Trial Court in which the Trial Court awarded him Rs.4,25,000/-. The Trial Court deposited
Rs.4,25,000/- in the Fixed Deposit in the Nationalized Bank for five years.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that applicant's dwelling house has been damaged
because of heavy rains and she wants money to repair the same. Applicant is a labourer and she is
unable to bear the cost of repairing work from her income of labour work, so she wants
compensation of Rs.57,375/- which was kept by the Tribunal in the Fixed Deposit in applicant's
name.
[4] Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, learned Trial Court has wrongly rejected her
application. Hence, the Revision is allowed. Learned Tribunal is directed to pay an amount of
Rs.57,375/- which was being kept as Fixed Deposit in the name of applicant in a Nationalized Bank.
Applicant be permitted to withdraw the amount which was deposited by the Tribunal in a
Nationalized Bank as Fixed Deposit upto 11.04.2018.
Copy of the order be sent to the trial Court for compliance. Accordingly, the Revision is disposed of.

Shri Ajay Vyas, learned counsel for the appellant No.3 Abid.
Shri Himanshu Joshi, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.
Heard on I.A.No.714/2017, which is an application filed by appellant No.3 Abid S/o Abdul Patel for
suspension of sentence and grant of bail.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 472
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
Appellant Abid has been convicted under Sections 148, 326/149, 302/149 of IPC and sentenced to
undergo two years RI with fine of Rs.500/-, RI for seven years with fine of Rs.3,000/- and
imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.5,000/- respectively.
According to prosecution story, on 21.6.2016, at 5.30 p.m., in village Multanpura when injured Fajju
(PW-4) and deceased Afzal were putting sticks on bullock cart, accused Ishaq, Yusuf armed with
swords, Abid, Salim armed with guns, Shabbir armed with Axe, Ahmed armed with Dhariya, Akilabi,
Shamshadbi, Abdul Salam, Rafique armed with Lathis came there and beated Fajju and Afzal with
their weapons with an intention to kill them.
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that appellant has been falsely implicated. Since
co-accused Shamshad, Abdul Salam and Akila Bi were released on bail by this Court and appellant's
case is similar to their case, therefore, on the ground of parity appellant also deserves to get bail.
Hence application for suspension of sentence be allowed.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/State submits that injured Fajju (PW-4) and
other eye witnesses Ibrahim (PW-2), Farukh (PW-5), Farida (PW-6) have clearly stated that
appellant was also present on the spot armed with gun and he also beated Fajju along with other
co-accused and prayed for rejection.
This Court has carefully gone through the case and judgment delivered by the Court below and
arguments put forth by the learned counsel for the parties.
The case of the appellant Abid is not similar to other co-accused, who have been earlier granted bail
by this court. It is clearly mentioned in the FIR lodged by eye witness Ibrahim (PW-2) that Abid was
also present on the spot with gun and assaulted deceased Afzal by butt of gun in his legs. Injured
Fajju (PW-4) and other eye witnesses Ibrahim (PW-2), Farukh (PW-5) and Farida (PW-6) have
clearly stated that appellant was also present on the spot armed with gun. He also beated Fajju
(PW-4) along with other co-accused and injured Fajju (PW-4) also deposed that Abid break the leg
of deceased Afzal. According to the postmortem report, deceased Afzal sustained 13 injuries
including on legs, therefore, looking to the facts and circumstances of the case it is not appropriate
to release the appellant on bail, hence, the application is rejected.
The appeal is already admitted, therefore, let the appeal be listed for final hearing in due course.
C.c. as per rules.

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the
FIR of Crime No.69/2016 registered at Police Station Mahila Thana, Indore for the offence under
Sections 498A, 294 & 506 of IPC against the on the complaint of respondent No.2 Smt. Neha.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 480
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
[2] Brief facts of this case are that on 22.05.2016, respondent No.2 Smt. Neha lodged a report
against the applicant at Police Station Mahila Thana, Indore averting that she is a legally wedded
wife of the applicant. Her marriage was solemnized with applicant on 09.02.2010 at Sagar. But since
marriage behaviour of the applicant and his family members was not good with her. They demanded
dowry and for that subjected her to cruelty. Earlier also she had lodged report against the applicant
regarding demand of dowry but after some time in June, 2013 she compromised with the applicant
and started residing with him and she also got the case disposed of in compromise. But, applicant
again tortured her and demanded Rs.40,00,000/- as dowry and in the month of February,2016
applicant by force got divorce papers signed by her and expelled from house. Since then she has
been living with her parents at Indore. On 10.04.2016, applicant came to her parental house at 73,
Ashish Nagar, Kanadiya Road, Indore and abused her and demanded Rs.40,00,000/- and also
threatened to kill her. On that report at Police Station Mahila Thana, Indore Crime No.69/16 for the
offence under Sections 498A, 294 & 506 of IPC was registered against the applicant. After
investigation charge- sheet was filed. Being aggrieved with the FIR applicant has filed this
application.
[3] Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that earlier also respondent No.2 lodged a report
against the applicant for the offence under Section 498A of the IPC and after some time she
compromised with the applicant and again after some time to harass the applicant lodged a false
report against the applicant. Respondent No.2 Smt. Neha herself tortured the applicant by her act.
Earlier respondent No.2 and applicant had filed an application under Section 13- B of the Hindu
Marriage Act for taking divorce with consent. But after that respondent No.2 wrongly lodged the
FIR mentioning that applicant forcibly got the divorce papers signed from her. Applicant never
came to Indore for demanding money and never threatened respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 also
lodged a report averting that applicant came on 14.05.2016 in Indore at her parental house and
threatened her and demanded Rs.40,00,000/- but when respondent No.2 came to know that on
that date applicant was in Haidrabad (Telangana), she again filed a false complaint on 22.05.2016.
So, this report be quashed.
[4] Learned Counsel for the respondent No.2 submitted that on the report of respondent No.2 Police
Station Mahila Thana, Indore registered Crime No.69/16 for the offence under Section 498A, 294
and 506 of IPC against the applicant and after investigation of that crime charge-sheet has been
filed by the Police before the court. So, at this stage only on the averment of the applicant it cannot
be said that the report lodged by the respondent No.2 is false.
[5] This court gone through the record and arguments put forth by both the counsels.
[6] Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Haryana and others V/s. Bhajan Lal and others
reported in 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 held that :-
"The power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and
with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases. The extraordinary or
inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according
to its whim or caprice. The court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 481
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or
the complaint.
The following categories of cases can be stated by way of illustration wherein the
extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482
CrPC can be exercised by the High Court either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised :
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Sections 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge."

[7] It appears from the record that after investigation of the report lodged by the respondent No.2,
police found prima facie case against the applicant and filed charge-sheet against the applicant so at
this stage only on the basis of document filed by the applicant along with this application it cannot
be assumed that respondent No.2 filed the report just to harass the applicant based on false
allegation.
[8] Prima facie offence under Section 498A, 294 and 506 are clearly made out from the FIR,
whether the allegation made by the respondent No.2 in the report is true or not? It cannot be
ascertained at this stage as it requires evidence, therefore, FIR cannot be quashed. So the petition is
dismissed. Applicant is free to raise all objections before the trial court at appropriate stage.

Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the
FIR bearing Crime No.570/2016 registered at Police Station MIG Colony, Indore under Sections
420, 467, 468, 471 & 120-B/34 of IPC on the complaint of respondent No.2.
[2] It is appeared from the record that on 11.01.2017 this court has directed the Principal Registrar
to verify the factum of compromise and the Principal Registrar in its report dated 23.01.2017 has
stated that complainant/respondent and s No.1 to 3 admit that they amicably settled their dispute. It
appears from the record that it was a land dispute which was amicably settled between the parties.
[3] It is true that some of the sections involved in the case are non-compoundable offences, however,
the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh V/s. State of Punjab and another reported in (2012) 10 SCC
303, in which Apex Court held that, "The power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding
or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 Cr.P.C. Cases where
power to quash criminal proceedings may be exercised where the parties have settled their dispute,
held, depends on facts and circumstances of each case. Before exercise of inherent quashment power
under Section 482, High Court must have due regard to nature and gravity of the crime and its
societal impact. Offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or like
transactions or offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or family disputes where the
wrong is basically private or personal in nature and parties have resolved their entire dispute, High
Court may quash criminal proceedings."
[4] The aforesaid dictum stands reiterated by the Apex Court in a recent judgment in Narinder
Singh & others V/s. State of Punjab & others reported in (2014) 6 SCC 466, the pertinent
observations of the Apex Court in Narinder Singh (Supra) are as under:-
"In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay down the following principles
by which the High Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment to the
settlement between the parties and exercising its power under Section 482 of the
Code while accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to
accept the settlement with direction to continue with the criminal proceedings:
Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished from the power
which lies in the Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No
doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash
the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable, where the
parties have settled the matter between themselves. However, this power is to be
exercised sparingly and with caution.
When the parties have reached the settlement and on that basis petition for quashing
the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases would be to secure:
(i) ends of justice, or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 488
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.
While exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two
objectives.
Such a power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences
of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in
nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for the offences alleged to have been
committed under special statute like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by
public servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of
compromise between the victim and the offender.
On the other hand, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character,
particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship
or family disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among
themselves.
While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as to whether the possibility of conviction
is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal cases.
Offences under Section 307 IPC would fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and
therefore are to be generally treated as crime against the society and not against the individual
alone. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of
Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be open to the
High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or
the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to proving the charge
under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of
injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of
weapons used, etc. Medical report in respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the
guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether
there is a strong possibility of conviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the
former case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the criminal proceedings whereas in the
latter case it would be permissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding the offence
based on complete settlement between the parties. At this stage, the Court can also be swayed by the
fact that the settlement between the parties is going to result in harmony between them which may
improve their future relationship.
While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of
settlement play a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the
alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be
liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is because of
the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on and even the charge-sheet has not been filed.
Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26488089/ 489
Kapil vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 26 April, 2017
still at infancy stage, the High Court can show benevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but
after prima facie assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the other hand,
where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the evidence the matter
is at the stage of argument, normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its power under
Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court would be in a position to decide the case
finally on merits and to come to a conclusion as to whether the offence under Section 307 IPC is
committed or not. Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already recorded by the trial
court and the matter is at the appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromise between the
parties would not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the offender who has
already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is proved under Section 307 IPC and
conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of sparing a
convict found guilty of such a crime."
[5] In the light of the aforesaid compromise which is taken place between the parties, this Court is of
the considered opinion that no useful purpose is going to be served by keeping the matter pending
especially when the grievance of the complainant has been satisfied by the present applicant.
[6] Resultantly, the FIR at Crime No.570/2016 registered at Police Station MIG Colony, Indore
under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 & 120-B/34 of IPC is hereby quashed. Criminal proceedings also
stands quashed.
