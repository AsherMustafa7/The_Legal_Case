M.Jaishankar vs M/S.Sree Gokulam Chits And Finance on 4 December, 2020
ORDER
This criminal original petition has been filed seeking to call for the records in C.C.No.291 of 2013 on
the file of the Judicial Magistrate Court No.V, Salem and quash the same.
2. Sree Gokulam Chits and Finance Corporation Private Limited (for brevity “Gokulam”) has
initiated a prosecution in C.C.No.291 of 2013 in the Court of Judicial Magistrate No.V, Salem, for the
offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for brevity “the NI Act”), against
Jaishankar (A1) and Nagalakshmi (A2).
3. It is seen that the case was originally numbered as C.C.No.291 of 2013, when it was on the file of
the Judicial Magistrate Court No.V, Salem. Thereafter, it was transferred to the file of the Judicial
Magistrate Court No.II, Salem and re-numbered as S.T.C.No.442 of 2015. Subsequently, it was again
transferred to the file of the Judicial Magistrate Court No.V, Salem and has been re-numbered as
S.T.C.No.300 of 2016. http://www.judis.nic.in
4. It is the case of Gokulam that Jaishankar (A1) joined some chit groups floated by them and
became a subscriber; Jaishankar (A1) was given chit amounts, towards which, he issued some
cheques as security; while so, Jaishankar (A1) defaulted on the repayment of the chits; when
Jaishankar (A1) was informed that Gokulam will take legal action against him, he (A1) and his wife
Nagalakshmi (A2) came for settlement, pursuant to which, Nagalakshmi (A2) issued a cheque dated
19.07.2013 bearing No.385089 for a sum of Rs.44,19,100/- drawn on Axis bank, Salem, in favour of
Gokulam; when Gokulam presented the said cheque, it was returned unpaid with the endorsement
“payment stopped by the drawer” vide return memo dated 22.07.2013; Gokulam issued a statutory
demand notice dated 19.08.2013, for which, Jaishankar (A1) and Nagalakshmi (A2) issued a reply
notice dated 06.09.2013; since Jaishankar (A1) and Nagalakshmi (A2) did not comply with demand,
Gokulam initiated a prosecution under Section 138 of the NI Act against them as aforesaid.
5. Heard Mr.T.T.Ravichandran, learned counsel Jaishankar (A1) and Nagalakshmi (A2), petitioners
herein. Notice has been served on Gokulam, respondent herein and their name was printed in the
cause list. http://www.judis.nic.in
6. The learned counsel for the petitioners took this Court through the various transactions to show
that the impugned cheque was not given in the circumstances as alleged by Gokulam.
7. In the opinion of this Court, these are disputed questions of fact, which cannot be gone into in a
quash petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. However, it is seen that the impugned cheque in this case
has been issued by Nagalakshmi (A2) from her personal bank account in discharge of the debt of her
husband Jaishankar (A1). The impugned cheque has not been issued from the bank account of any
juristic entity for invoking vicarious liability provision viz., Section 141 of the NI Act.
8. It is trite that if a cheque is issued by a person in discharge of the liability of another person and if
the cheque is dishonoured, the person, who issued the cheque can be prosecuted under Section 138
of the NI Act. Just because Jaishankar (A1) was the beneficiary of the loan, he cannot be prosecuted
