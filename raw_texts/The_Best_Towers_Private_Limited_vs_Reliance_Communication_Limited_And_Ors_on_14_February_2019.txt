accordingly.
Re: L.P.A. No. 1035 of 2018 & 1036 of 2018.
These Intra Court Appeals have been filed assailing
the judgment of a learned Single Judge dated 19th June, 2018,
whereby an order passed by the Facilitation Council, Patna in
Reference Case No. 05/2015 and Reference Case No. 01/2016
dated 06.02.2018 has been quashed, as it has been held to be
without jurisdiction and non est in law. The matter has been
remitted back to the Facilitation Council, Patna to make an
appropriate reference in terms of Section 18 (3) of the Micro,
Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006
("MSMED Act, 2006" in short).
2. Learned counsel for the appellant at the outset has
urged that the writ petition was a clear dilatory tactics and
ought not to have been entertained by the learned Single Judge
inasmuch as the Facilitation Council was not lacking in any
inherent jurisdiction on the reasoning given by the learned
Single Judge.
3. The background in which the submissions have
been raised discloses that this is the second round of litigation
between the parties. The work for establishment of towers for
mobile services and providing ancillary works and material was
Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019
4/29
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 3
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
entrusted by the respondent petitioner to the appellant. The
services so engaged led to the dispute of certain payments
which according to the appellant was due on the respondent
petitioner. The Facilitation Council passed an order on 30 th of
June, 2016 on an application being moved in terms of the 2006
Act directing payments to be made to the appellant. The
respondent petitioner challenged the said order in C.W.J.C. No.
14884 of 2016 and 15044 of 2016 that were disposed of on 11 th
April, 2017 by a detailed judgment holding that the provisions
of Section 18 of the 2006 Act were not followed inasmuch as it
was the duty of the Facilitation Council to first attempt
conciliation and in the event of any failure, the arbitration stage
would arrive later on in terms of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as "1996 Act").
It was further opined in Paragraphs 74 and 75 as follows:-
"74. So from the above quotations and
discussions, it is apparently clear that either the
Facilitation Council will take the burden on its
shoulder for arbitration or it relegates the matter to
anybody. Either the Facilitation Council or anybody
while making arbitration will follow the certain
provision of Code of Civil Procedure as mention in
Section 19 of the Act for the arrival to a fair and
proper conclusion.
75. For the foregoing reasons, the impugned

order containing memo No. 3898 dated 27.10.2016

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 4
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
passed by the Facilitation Council are hereby quashed. But, it is not end of the matter, this Court
directs both the parties to appear before the Facilitation Council within 15 days from the date of
passing the order of this Court. They should present themselves, the Facilitation Council will make
effort to resolve the dispute, in future, either the Facilitation Council itself will take responsibility of
arbitrator or refer the matter to third party, according to the provisions of the Act, for arbitration."
4. It is thereafter, that conciliation proceedings were undertaken and from the records of the writ
petition we find that the appellant filed L.P.A. No. 827 of 2017 challenging the said judgment which
was dismissed on 17 th July, 2017 by the following judgment:
"Finding statutory violation of Section 18 of the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises Development Act, 2006, the learned Writ Court has interfered into the
matter. A detailed deliberation and consideration has been done by the learned Writ
Court to say that there is violation of the statutory requirement of Section 18 of the
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act which contemplates
reference by the Facilitation Council to the Arbitrator Patna High Court LPA No.1035
of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 and thereafter certain procedures to be followed. That being
so, we find no error in the order passed by the Writ Court.
It is a well settled principle that if a statutory provision is violated, the learned Writ
Court can exercise jurisdiction even under Article 226 of the Constitution when an
even if an alternative remedy is available, this principle squarely applies to the
present case. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed.
However, the Facilitation Council is directed to decide the issue within a period of 60
days from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order."
5. The judgment of the learned Single Judge was, therefore, affirmed in its entirety with a further
observation that Section 18 contemplates reference by the Facilitation Council to the Arbitrator and
since the principle of alternative remedy would not be a petition, the appeal was dismissed.
6. It is thereafter that the Facilitation Council took up the matter and on 13th September, 2017 a
notice was issued to the appellant as well as to the respondent petitioner informing them about the
proceedings undertaken before the Council. The said letter demonstrates the entire details of the
proceedings recording that conciliation efforts were attempted that failed on account of
non-cooperation of the respondent-petitioner and Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018
dt.14-02-2019 also observed that the tendency of the respondent Reliance Communication was to
delay the matter. The conciliation, therefore, terminated and was ultimately closed by the Council
on 18th October, 2017.
7. In the proceedings for arbitration undertaken by the Facilitation Council the
respondent-petitioner appeared through a representative who prayed for some more time and,
therefore, the matter was adjourned for 28th November, 2017. It was again adjourned and both the
references were taken up where the respondent-petitioner appeared but did not respond to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 5
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
directions of the Council, as a result whereof in terms of Section 25(b)(c) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Amendment Act, 2014 read with the provisions of Section 18 of the 2006 Act an Award
was made. It was also noted therein that the jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council to act as an
Arbitrator under Section 12 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 had been challenged which
was not tenable in view of Section 18(3) of the 2006 Act. This challenge was raised by an
application, copy whereof was filed on record.
8. An interesting turn takes thereafter on facts. The two writ petitions giving rise to the present
appeals being C.W.J.C. No. 8086 of 2018 and C.W.J.C. No. 8077 of 2018, Patna High Court LPA
No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 challenging the proceedings of arbitration before the Facilitation
Council and the Award dated 6.2.2018 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, were instituted on 25th
April, 2018. The learned Single Judge proceeded to hear both the writ petitions simultaneously. A
counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the appellant who was the Respondent No. 4 in the writ
petition enclosing therewith the entire proceedings relating to the failure of conciliation up to the
passing of the Award as referred to hereinabove. The judgment was reserved by the learned Single
Judge on 18th of May, 2018.
9. From the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant dated 4th of December, 2018,
we find that on 25th of May, 2018, i.e. after the judgment was reserved by the learned Single Judge
of this Court, a Miscellaneous Case under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
was instituted by the respondent petitioner before the learned District Judge at Patna that was
registered as Arbitration Case No. 81 of 2018 for setting aside the Award dated 06.02.2018. The
matter was taken up on 28th May, 2018 according to the order-sheet and the case was directed to
come up on 14th June, 2018 for hearing on admission. On 14 th June, 2018 even though appearance
had been put up on behalf of the respondent Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019
petitioner, no one appeared and the case was directed to come up on 5th of July, 2018. The said
application in the arbitration case has been filed along with the supplementary affidavit referred to
above and the grounds for challenging the Award specifically includes the inherent lack of
jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council to proceed for arbitration in the matter with a specific plea
that in view of the provisions of Section 80 of the Arbitration Act, the Facilitation Council is
prohibited to Act as an Arbitrator inasmuch as it had already acted as a Conciliator. The position
was further sought to be challenged by making the following averments in Ground No. 8:
"8. Because the Facilitation Council has incorrectly held that the Objector has
challenged the jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council. The Objector has challenged
the independent status of the Facilitation Council validly and on justifiable grounds.
The objection raised by the Objector is because of the actions of the Facilitation
Council which is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality and justice. The
action of the Facilitation Council itself indicates the non-independent status of the
Facilitation Council."
10. It was also alleged therein that the Facilitation Council was required to conduct conciliation
proceedings but it Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 has wrongly assumed the
role of Arbitrator. In Ground No. 14 it has been specifically alleged that once the conciliation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 6
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
proceedings had failed, the Facilitation Council was bound to appoint an independent Arbitrator
inasmuch as there was no privity of contract between the parties to allow the Facilitation Council to
act as Arbitrator. It was further pointed out in the said application that under Section 12 of the Act
an application had been moved questioning the status of the Facilitation Council, which was
ignored. It was also stated that the dispute was only with regard to one work order and, therefore,
the Council has wrongly entertained other claims. The challenge to the Award on other grounds of
Section 34 have also been raised. The said application had been filed within time and the notices
had been issued, as is evident from the facts contained in the order-sheet noted above.
11. What is to be minutely noticed is that once the judgment was reserved by the learned Single
Judge on 18 th May, 2018, then if an application under Section 34 had been filed before the learned
District Judge thereafter, on 25th of May, 2018 the same ought to have been brought to the notice of
the learned Single Judge who had not yet delivered the judgment. On the other hand, the
application moved under Section 34 by the Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019
respondent petitioner before the learned District Judge on 25 th May, 2018 did not contain a single
averment that challenging the jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council in rendering the Award, the
respondent petitioner had already filed two writ petitions wherein judgment had been reserved.
Thus, neither the learned Single Judge was informed about the institution of the proceedings under
Section 34 by the respondent petitioner before the judgment was delivered nor did the application
under Section 34 contain any averment about the filing of the two writ petitions before this Court.
12. The aforesaid facts have to be noted in order to understand the conduct of the respondent
petitioner in approaching this Court, moreso, in view of the observations of the learned Single Judge
made in the earlier round of litigation and its affirmance in the Letters Patent Appeal that have been
extracted hereinabove.
13. Learned counsel for the appellant has invited the attention of the Court to Section 18(3) of the
2006 Act in particular to urge that the said provision is clear, that if the conciliation effort fails and
stands terminated without any settlement between the parties, the Council has the option to either
itself take up the dispute for arbitration or refer it to any Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018
dt.14-02-2019 institution as stated therein, and on such institution of proceedings the provisions of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall then apply to the dispute as if the arbitration was in
pursuance of an arbitration agreement referred to in sub- section (1) of Section 7 of that Act.
Learned counsel contends that there is no ambiguity in the said provision which is extracted
hereinunder:-
"18(3) Where the conciliation initiated under sub-section (2) is not successful and
stands terminated without any settlement between the parties, the Council shall
either itself take up the dispute for arbitration or refer it to any institution or centre
providing alternative dispute resolution services for such arbitration and the
provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall then apply
to the disputes as if the arbitration was in pursuance of an arbitration agreement
referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 7 of that Act."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 7
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
14. It is, therefore, submitted that the learned Single Judge has fallen in error in not construing the
aforesaid Section appropriately inasmuch as the provisions of Sections 15 to 23 of the 2006 Act have
an overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for
the time being in force. Section 24 is extracted hereinunder:-
Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 "24. Overriding effect.- The
provisions of sections
15 to 23 shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other
law for the time being in force."
15. It is urged that the provisions of Section 18(3) of the 2006 Act have an overriding effect and,
therefore, there is a statutory requirement and obligation on the part of the Facilitation Council to
enter upon arbitration as if the said proceedings are in pursuance of an agreement referred to under
Section 7 of the 1996 Act. It is submitted that in view of this express arrangement under the 2006
Act, which is a special Act, the Facilitation Council was well within its authority to enter upon
arbitration and deliver an Award. The same, therefore, could have been appropriately challenged
through proceedings under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, that was actually done by the respondent
petitioner, and the writ petition ought not to have been entertained as there was no lack of
jurisdiction on the part of the Facilitation Council. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied on
the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in the case of GE T&D India
Limited. Vs. Reliable Engineering Projects and Marketing [O.M.P. (COMM) 76/2016], decided on
15th February, 2017 to contend Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 that the 2006
Act is a special Act and has invited the attention of the Court to Paragraphs 38 and 39 of the said
judgment which is extracted hereinunder:-
"38. In the present case, therefore, the Court is satisfied that the MSMED Act to the
extent it provides for a special forum for adjudication of the disputes involving a
'supplier' registered thereunder, overrides the Act i.e., the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996. The following observations in Snehadeep Structures Pvt. Ltd.
V Maharashtra Small Scale Industries Development Corporation Ltd. (supra) which
deal with the statute of 1993 proceeding the MSMED Act equally applies to the
MSMED Act:
"47. The requirement of pre-deposit of interest is introduced as a disincentive to
prevent dilatory tactics employed by the buyers against whom the small-scale
industry might have procured in award, just as in cases of a decree or order.
Presumably, the legislative intent behind Section 7 was to target buyers, who only
with the end of pushing off the ultimate event of payment to the small-scale industry
undertaking, institute challenges against the award/decree/order passed against
them. Such buyers cannot be allowed to challenge arbitral awards indiscriminately,
especially when the section requires predeposit of 75% interest even when appeal is
preferred against an award, as distinguished from an order or decree."

The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019
39. Likewise, in Edukanti Kistamma (Dead) through LRs. v. S. Venkatareddy (dead) through LRs.
(supra), the Supreme Court explained that a special statute would be preferred over a general one
where it is beneficial. It was explained that the purport and object of the Act must be given its full
effect by applying the principles of "purposive construction." The question whether the dispute
resolution mechanism under Section 18 of the MSMED Act overrides the arbitration clause under
the contract has to be answered in the affirmative. As was explained in Waman Shriniwas Kini v.
Ratilal Bhagwandas & Co. (supra) an agreement contrary to a statutory provision that prohibits it
would be unenforceable. "
16. Learned counsel has also relied on another judgment in the case of Snehadeep
Structures Private Limited Vs. Maharashtra Small-Scale Industries Development
Corporation Limited, reported in (2010) 3 SCC 34 to substantiate the same. It is,
therefore, submitted that the learned Single Judge has erroneously assumed that a
Conciliator is prohibited from acting as an Arbitrator unless otherwise agreed by the
parties. It is further submitted that Section 80 of the Arbitration Act is no
impediment in the passage of the Facilitation Council to proceed for arbitration.
Assailing the findings recorded in Paragraph 19 of the Patna High Court LPA No.1035
of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 impugned judgment, the learned counsel submits that the
learned Single Judge has erroneously assumed the absence of inconsistency between
Section 18 of the 2006 Act and Section 80 of the 1996 Act inasmuch as Section 24 of
the 2006 Act not only overrides in respect of inconsistencies but otherwise also
begins with a non obstante clause giving an overriding effect of Section 18 as against
the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996. He, therefore, submits that the distinction
and the disagreement expressed by the learned Single Judge in respect of the
judgments of the Madras High Court are not well founded. It is urged that the
conclusion of the learned Single Judge that the Facilitation Council is prohibited
from acting in a dual capacity is incorrect and to that effect the conclusion drawn is
erroneous. The inference that the provisions of Section 80 recognizes the need to
disassociate a decision making body from the approving body is an assumption on
the basis of a judgment of the Supreme Court which does not apply on the
controversy raised herein keeping in view the specific provisions of Section 18 read
with Section 24 of the 2006 Act.
It is, therefore, urged that the impugned judgment being erroneous for all the reasons
aforesaid deserves to be set aside.
17. Responding to the aforesaid submissions, learned Patna High Court LPA No.1035
of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 counsel for the respondent petitioner has commenced his
arguments by contending that a comparative study of the 2006 Act with the
provisions of the 1996 Act would reveal that the provisions of Section 18(2) and the
reference to the provisions of Sections 65 to 81 of the 1996 Act contained in Part-III
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 9
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
thereof have been made applicable and, therefore, a purposive meaning has to be
attached to the said provision that has been rightly construed by the learned Single
Judge. It is urged that the same read with Section 80 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act would leave no room for doubt that the bar clearly comes to the aid
of the respondent petitioner which has been rightly construed and interpreted by the
learned Single Judge. It is submitted that even though the 2006 Act is a special Act,
yet it does not exclude the applicability of the provisions of the 1996 Act and the
overriding effect of Section 24 of the 2006 Act is nowhere attracted inasmuch as
there is no inconsistency. The provisions of Section 18(2) of the 2006 Act and Section
80 of the 1996 Act are extracted hereinunder:-
"18(2) On receipt of a reference under sub-section (1), the Council shall either itself
conduct conciliation in the matter or seek the assistance of any institution or centre
providing alternate dispute resolution services by making a reference to such an
institution or centre, for conducting conciliation and the provisions of Patna High
Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 sections 65 to 81 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall apply to such a dispute as if the conciliation
was initiated under Part III of that Act."
"80. Role of conciliator in other proceedings.- Unless otherwise agreed by the
parties,-
(a) The conciliator shall not act as an arbitrator or as a representative or counsel of a
party in any arbitral or judicial proceeding in respect of a dispute that is the subject of
the conciliation proceedings;
(b) the conciliator shall not be presented by the parties as a witness in any arbitral or
judicial proceedings."
18. On the strength of the aforesaid provisions and with the aid of the judgment in the case of
Harshad Chiman Lal Modi Vs. DLF Universal Ltd. And another, reported in (2005) 7 SCC 791, it is
urged that since the question of jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter, and the Facilitation
Council inherently lacked jurisdiction, the writ petition was very much entertainable and, therefore,
the argument raised on behalf of the appellant about the availability of the statutory remedy under
Section 34 of the 1996 Act is no bar for the entertaining of a writ petition. It is further submitted that
there was no intention to suppress any fact either before the learned Single Judge or before the
learned District Judge about the Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 pendency of
the respective proceedings and in such circumstances the writ petition was rightly entertained and
allowed. It is also submitted that since the writ petition was allowed, the respondent writ petitioner
has withdrawn the proceedings under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, as such the Facilitation Council
will have to proceed in accordance with the directions of the High Court. It is further submitted that
no dilatory tactics had been adopted by the respondent petitioner inasmuch as the issue of
jurisdiction being essential and core to the dispute, the same was rightly raised and, therefore, there
is no error in the impugned judgment. It is further submitted that the allegations of concealment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 10
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
made in the reply to the counter affidavit dated 06.02.2019 is absolutely incorrect as explained
above. Learned counsel has extensively taken the Court through the provisions of the 2006 Act as
well as the 1996 Act to contend that the Facilitation Council could not have acted as an Arbitrator
and a Conciliator in the fashion in which the entire proceedings have been conducted and, therefore,
the learned Single Judge has rightly observed that the Facilitation Council has acted without
jurisdiction.
19. We have considered the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the parties and have
examined the records Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 as also the provisions
referred to hereinabove.
20. We may at the outset undertake a comparative study of the provisions of the MSMED Act, 2006
and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. To begin with the object and reasons for enacting the
2006 Act was to clearly protect the development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and to
extend support to them to enable them to grow and adopt higher levels and higher productivity to
remain competitive in a fast globalization era. It is for this reason, a single legal framework was
required to facilitate the promotion and development of such industries. The statement of objects
and reasons in Clause 2(d)(h) clearly recites that the procedure also envisages to make further
improvements in respect of delayed payments. In this background, the appellant before us is a
supplier within the meaning of Section 2(n) of the 2006 Act and the respondent- petitioner is a
buyer within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Act. To facilitate the resolution of disputes relating
to delayed payments, Chapter-5 was incorporated in the Act fixing a statutory liability on the buyer
to make payments within a specified time. Section 16 fixes the liability of payment of interest and
Section 17 empowers the supplier to receive payments with interest thereon. On a dispute being
raised with Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 regard to delay in payments or
any amount due, a forum named as a Facilitation Council is created under Section 18 of the Act
where any party to a dispute may make a reference to the Facilitation Council. Sub-section (2) of
Section 18 enjoins upon the Council to either itself conduct a conciliation or seek the assistance of
any Institution or Centre providing alternate dispute resolution services by making a reference to it.
The provisions of Section 65 to Section 81 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are to apply
to such a dispute as if the conciliation was under Part-III of the 1996 Act. Thus, the first step on the
reference of a dispute is to undertaking a conciliation effort by the Council or reference of such
conciliation to any Institution or Centre as provided therein. The words "shall apply" in respect of
Section 65 to Section 81 of the 1996 Act, therefore, clearly stipulates that in an effort of conciliation
the same process will be adopted in respect of conciliation proceedings with a specific bar in Section
80 that the Conciliator shall not act as an Arbitrator or as a representative or Counsel of a party in
"any arbitral or judicial proceedings in respect of a dispute that is the subject of conciliation
proceedings". Thus, according to Section 80 the Conciliator cannot act as an Arbitrator. The
question raised before us by the Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 learned
counsel for the respondent petitioner is that if the Facilitation Council acts as a Conciliator then the
Council cannot act as an Arbitrator as in the present case when after having attempted conciliation
proceedings and its termination in failure, the Council itself has proceeded to arbitrate which it
could not have done in terms of Section 80 of the 1996 Act read with Section 18(2) of the 2006 Act.
This argument on behalf of the respondent petitioner has been accepted by the learned Single Judge

The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
that has been questioned by the appellant contending that Section 24 of the 2006 Act clearly
provides that Sections 15 to 23 thereof shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent
therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. What we find is that sub-section (2)
of Section 18 only refers to conciliation and the procedure to be followed in terms of Part-III of the
1996 Act to the extent of Section 65 to Section 81 thereof. Immediately thereafter, sub- section (3) of
Section 18 introduces an absolutely novel procedure allowing the commencement of arbitration
proceedings with a mandate on the Council that in the event conciliation ends in failure, the Council
shall "either itself" take up the dispute for arbitration or refer it to any Institution or Centre
providing alternate dispute resolution services for such Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018
dt.14-02-2019 arbitration and the provisions of the 1996 Act "shall then" apply to the disputes as if
the arbitration was in pursuance of an agreement. The overriding effect given to this provision in
terms of Section 24 of the 2006 Act, in our opinion, clearly overrides any bar as suggested by the
learned counsel for the respondent petitioner under Section 80 of the 1996 Act. It is trite law that
the meanings assigned and the purpose for which an enactment has been made should be construed
to give full effect to the legislative intent and we have no doubt in our mind that the provisions of
Section 18(3) mandates the institution of arbitration proceedings under the 2006 Act itself and it is
"then" that the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall apply. The institution
of arbitration proceedings would be governed by sub-section (3) of Section 18 of the 2006 Act which
having an overriding effect cannot debar the Facilitation Council from acting as an Arbitrator after
the conciliation efforts have failed under sub-section (2) of Section 18 of the Act. A combined
reading of sub-section (2) and sub-section (3) of Section 18 of the 2006 Act read with the overriding
effect under Section 24 thereof leaves no room for doubt that any inconsistency that can possibly be
read keeping in view Section 80 of the 1996 Act stands overridden and the Facilitation Patna High
Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 Council can act as an Arbitrator by virtue of the force of
the overriding strength of sub-section (3) of Section 18 of the 2006 Act over Section 80 of the 1996
Act. The conclusion of the learned Single Judge that there is a prohibition on the Council to act in a
dual capacity is, therefore, contrary to the clear intention of the legislature and, therefore, the
verdict that the Facilitation Council lacked inherent jurisdiction does not appear to be a correct
inference. Thus, on a comparative study of the provisions referred to hereinabove, there is no scope
for any doubt with regard to the overriding effect of the provisions of the 2006 Act that empowers
the Facilitation Council to act as an Arbitrator upon the failure of conciliation proceedings. The
cloud of suspicion and doubt about the role of the Facilitation Council, therefore, stands clarified on
the basis of the analysis made by us hereinabove.
21. The second reason why we differ from the view of the learned Single Judge is that the 2006 Act
was enacted as a complete code in itself and it is for this reason that the authority to conciliate and
arbitrate were enacted and provided for in a different form for the promotion, development and
facilitation of delayed payments arising out of disputes of small industries under the 2006 Act. The
platform for resolution of disputes was, Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019
therefore, created under Section 18 of the 2006 Act in order to avoid the rigors and settlement of
disputes at a pre-arbitration stage itself.
22. The status of the 2006 Act conferring the jurisdiction on the Facilitation Council to resolve
disputes is further fortified by a bare perusal of sub-section (4) of Section 18 to either act as a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145185456/ 12
The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
Conciliator or Arbitrator in respect of a dispute anywhere in India. The aforesaid provision,
therefore, also clearly rules out the possibility of reading a bar on the role of the Facilitation Council
to act as an Arbitrator if it has performed the role of Conciliator. The argument of the learned
counsel for the respondent petitioner, as accepted by the learned Single Judge, therefore, overlooks
the aforesaid intention that can be easily gathered from a reading of the entire provisions of the
2006 Act, particularly the provisions of Section 18 and Section 24 thereof.
23. The learned Single Judge has also held that the direction given by the learned Single Judge in
the earlier round of litigation on 11th April, 2017 and the dismissal of the Letters Patent Appeal on
17th July, 2017 will not amount to a direction conferring jurisdiction of arbitration on the
Facilitation Council. We are unable to agree with the said view as the learned Single Patna High
Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 Judge had categorically indicated that either the
Facilitation Council will itself take the responsibility of acting as an Arbitrator or refer the matter as
provided under the Act. The Division Bench in appeal held that since the procedure for conciliation
had not been followed, therefore, the petition could be entertained under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, but the Division Bench nowhere contradicted the observations made by the
learned Single Judge. It is, thus, clear that the said observations were clearly binding and could not
have been annulled, moreso, keeping in view the law as analyzed by us hereinabove. The judgment
dated 11th April, 2017 to that extent rightly observed that the Facilitation Council will have to take
responsibility of discharging its duty as an Arbitrator or to refer the matter under the provisions of
sub-section (3) of Section 18 of the 2006 Act. The same was binding on the respondent petitioner as
well as on the appellant as it was in consonance with the provisions of the 2006 Act.
24. The learned Single Judge has dealt with the issue of jurisdiction and it appears that had the fact
of the filing of an application by the respondent petitioner under Section 34 of the 1996 Act be
brought to his notice, the learned Single Judge would have also looked into the grounds raised in the
said Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 application. We are mentioning this
inasmuch ground No. 8 taken in the application filed by the respondent petitioner under Section 34
is as follows:-
"Because the Facilitation Council has incorrectly held that the Objector has
challenged the jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council. The Objector has challenged
the independent status of the Facilitation Council validly and on justifiable grounds.
The objection raised by the Objector is because of the actions of the Facilitation
Council which is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality and justice. The
actions of the Facilitation Council itself indicates the non-independent status of the
Facilitation Council."
25. The aforesaid stand taken by the respondent petitioner is clearly in teeth of the provisions of the
2006 Act as discussed hereinabove but the Award given by the Facilitation Council was amenable to
the proceedings under Section 34 of the 1996 Act inasmuch as Section 18(3) of the 2006 Act itself
recites that upon an arbitration having been instituted, the provisions of the 1996 Act "shall then"
apply. This clear remedy being available to question an Award is open to challenge on the grounds
referred to in Section 12 and the other related Patna High Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019

The Best Towers Private Limited vs Reliance Communication Limited And Ors on 14 February, 2019
provisions of the 1996 Act. The learned Single Judge, if informed about the institution of the
proceedings under Section 34 of the 1996 Act by the respondent petitioner, might have taken a
different view but in our clear opinion the respondent petitioner was playing ducks and drakes and
he has virtually gambled with law that clearly appears to be intended to delay the proceedings. As
noticed by us hereinabove, the application under Section 34 of the 1996 Act was moved by the
respondent- petitioner against the Award of the Facilitation Council on 25th of May, 2018 after the
judgment had been reserved by the learned Single Judge on 18th May, 2018. It was, therefore, the
duty of the respondent petitioner to have informed the learned Single Judge who had not yet
delivered the judgment about such process having been adopted. On the other hand, the respondent
petitioner was under a bounden duty to disclose the institution of the two writ petitions giving rise
to these appeals in the application moved before the Arbitrator. Neither of these informations were
tendered to the learned Single Judge or to the learned District Judge before whom the application
had been moved under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. The said application was quietly withdrawn after
the impugned judgment was delivered. This conduct of the respondent petitioner clearly Patna High
Court LPA No.1035 of 2018 dt.14-02-2019 disentitled him for any discretionary relief under Article
226 of the Constitution of India.
26. For all the reasons given hereinabove, we find that the judgment of the learned Single Judge
cannot be sustained and costs deserve to be imposed on the respondent petitioner for having
attempted to delay the proceedings as observed hereinabove.
27. The appeals are accordingly allowed and the impugned judgment dated 19th June, 2018 is set
aside with cost of Rs. 50,000/- (fifty thousand) on the respondent No. 1 petitioner payable and to be
deposited with the Patna High Court Legal Services Committee within one month from today.
