ORDER
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed, invoking Section 482 Cr.P.C., seeking orders to call
for the records relating to the FIR in Crime No.1540 of 2019 pending on the file of the first
respondent and quash the same so far as the petitioners are concerned.
2.The petitioners are the accused Nos.2 and 3 in Crime No.1540 of 2019 on the file of the
Thallakulam Police Station, Madurai City.
3.On the basis of the complaint lodged by the second respondent, FIR came to be registered in
Crime No.1540 of 2019 against three persons including the petitioners herein for the alleged
offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC.
4.According to the petitioners, they are the Trustee and Managing Trustee of Tamizhavel Thiru
P.T.Rajan Commemoration Trust which is a charitable trust involved in Public Welfare Activities
and the Trust is running a PTR marriage hall.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019
5.The case of the prosecution is that the second respondent approached the first accused on
22.07.2019 for booking the PTR marriage hall for his marriage scheduled to take place on
08.09.2019, that the first accused has received a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- in cash towards the rent for
the marriage hall and gave a hand written receipt, that subsequently, the second accused has
contacted the second respondent over phone and informed that the first accused had collected rent
from several persons on the guise of booking marriage hall and misappropriated the same and
further informed him to remit the rent amount to the Trust or otherwise he will not be allowed to
use the marriage hall, that the second respondent with no other option has paid the rent amount
vide cheque and thereafter, he has paid a sum of Rs.1,18,000/- for using other facilities, that though
the accused Nos.2 and 3 have admitted the misappropriation of the rents by their manager, they
have again collected the rent from the second respondent and that therefore, he was constrained to
lodge the above complaint.
6.The main contention of the petitioners is that the second respondent has not paid the rent to the
first accused in the Trust office and admittedly, he had handed over the cash of Rs.2,50,000/- to the
first accused near Periyar bus stand, that the hand written receipt allegedly
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019 given by the first accused does not
disclose any details regarding the payment of money, date, time and other particulars, that the
petitioners, being the office bearers of the Trust, came to know that the first accused had cheated
few persons by misusing the Trust name, that the first petitioner had already lodged a complaint

M.Thirumurthy vs The State Represented By on 6 December, 2021
before the first respondent police and on that basis, case in Crime No.1194 of 2019 was registered
against the first accused and the same is pending for investigation, that there is no question of any
misappropriation of funds given to the petitioners, when the cheque was presented in the Trust
account and that the second respondent at the instance of the first accused has lodged the above
false complaint with an intention to extract money from the petitioners.
7.The learned Senior counsel for the petitioners would submit that the FIR does not disclose any
offence for the alleged offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC, that the petitioners, neither made
any false representation pursuant to entrusted with any property by the defacto complainant and on
receipt of the property, have converted into their property, that the petitioners neither made any
dishonest or fraudulent representation to the defacto complainant nor they had acted on the
strength of the same, that the petitioners are not parties to the alleged
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019 hand written receipt issued to the
defacto complainant and that the complainant in order to wreak vengeance has given this false and
vexatious complaint by giving criminal color to the business transaction.
8.It is not in dispute that similar to the present FIR, one another person by name Gurusamy has also
lodged a similar complaint against the first petitioner and the also said Ramanathan and as per the
direction of the learned Judicial Magistrate under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., FIR came to be registered
in Crime No.2107 of 2019 on the file of the first respondent for the alleged offences under Sections
406, 420, 465 and 506(1) IPC and that the first respondent, after completing the investigation, has
filed a final report against all the three persons by including the second petitioner herein and the
case was taken on file in C.C.No.667 of 2021 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.II,
Madurai.
9.The learned Senior counsel for the petitioners would submit that the petitioners herein have filed
petitions in Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.16278 & 16281 of 2021 under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to call for the entire
records pertaining to the charge sheet filed in C.C.No.667 of 2021 on the file of the learned Judicial
Magistrate No.II, Madurai and quash the same and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019 that this Court, vide order dated 06.12.2021, has allowed the
criminal original petitions and thereby, quashed the impugned proceedings as far as the petitioners
are concerned.
10.In the common order, passed in Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.16278 & 16281 of 2021, my esteemed brother
Hon'ble Justice G.R.Swaminathan has discussed the ingredients of the offence elaborately and came
to the decision that the offences under Sections 406, 420, 465 and 506(1) IPC are not made out and
that a simple case of breach of contract has been given a criminal color.
“8.I carefully considered the rival contentions and went through the materials on record. The
undisputed fact is that Gurusamy, the father of the bridegroom, made payment directly to the hall
manager (A2 Ramanathan). It is obvious that A2 had pocketed the said amount and issued a fake
receipt. Booking was done on 02.06.2019. A2 had played a similar mischief in the cases of quite a
few other persons. When this came to light, A1 Thirumurthy gave a complaint against Ramanathan
and the same was also registered as Crime No.1194 of 2019 on 03.08.2019. When Gurusamy met
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131092265/ 3
M.Thirumurthy vs The State Represented By on 6 December, 2021
Thirumurthy on 29.08.2019, in all fairness, Thirumurthy should have owned up the responsibility.
Instead, Thirumurthy had taken the stand that unless Gurusamy made a fresh
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019 payment, the hall will not be
allotted to him on the scheduled date. It was this stand of Thirumurthy that led to registration of the
impugned Crime No.2107 of 2019.
9.When Thirumurthy moved this Court seeking anticipatory bail, while granting relief, I had
stipulated that Thirumurthy must make good the loss. I thought that the performance of marriage
had only been postponed so that the hall could be engaged on another date without making fresh
payment. Unfortunately, the marriage itself got cancelled and Thirumurthy could not atone for the
misdeed of A2 Ramanathan.
10.Now the question that arises for consideration is whether the first respondent is justified in filing
final report not only against Ramanathan but also against Shri.Thirumurthy and Shri.Ramesh
Rajan. Gurusamy never had any grouse against Shri.Ramesh Rajan. Be that as it may, final report
came to be filed against the petitioners herein and cognizance of the offences has also been taken.
11.In my view, Gurusamy could have filed a case against the hall management for deficiency of
service before the Consumer Forum. He could have also filed a civil suit for damages. I fail to
understand as to how a criminal case would lie against the trustees. More so, the case of the trustees
is that the hall manager had https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019
committed criminal breach of trust and acts of forgery by issuing bogus receipts.
12.The ingredients of the offence of cheating are totally absent. The petitioners did not deceive
Gurusamy. They did not fraudulently or dishonestly induce him to pay Rs.2,95,000/-. Gurusamy
had come to the office of the marriage hall and paid the said amount to A2 Ramanathan in cash. The
petitioners herein were nowhere in the scene. Even Gurusamy never alleged that the petitioners
herein induced him to do anything. Hence, the offence under Section 418 of IPC will not lie.
13.The bogus receipt was issued by A2 Ramanathan directly to Gurusamy. When the hall
management became aware of the criminal activities of A2 Ramanathan, they gave a complaint
against him leading to Registration of Crime No.1194 of 2019. That clearly shows the bona fides on
the part of the petitioners herein. It is earlier in point of time also. While Crime No.1194 of 2019 was
registered on 03.08.2019, Gurusamy's complaint was registered only on 27.11.2019. Of course, he
had made the complaint on 27.08.2019. The fact remains that Gurusamy's complaint is subsequent
in point of time. Hence, the offences set out in Section 468 and 469 of IPC are also not made out.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019
14.Invocation of Section 383 IPC is absurd. Section 383 IPC can be invoked only if the accused puts
the victim in fear of any injury either to himself or any other and thereby dishonestly induce the
victim to deliver any property or valuable security. In this case, the first accused no doubt made an
unfair demand on Gurusamy that he should make a fresh payment. This will by no stretch of
imagination constitute the offence of extortion.

M.Thirumurthy vs The State Represented By on 6 December, 2021
15.The offence of criminal intimidation will be made out only if the accused threatens the victim
with any injury to his person, reputation or property. In this case, there is no such allegation. Merely
because the first accused refused to consider the defacto complainant's request for refund, that
would not convert the transaction to one of criminal intimidation. Courts have held that for the
offence to be made out, a real threat should have been held out. The victim should have felt a sense
of alarm [(1988) L.W. (Crl.) 178 (Noble Mohandass V. State)]. Nothing of the sort happened in this
case. The elementary ingredients of the offence under Section 506(i) of IPC are absent.
16.A simple case of breach of contract has been given a criminal colour. Even in tort, the erring party
can be fastened with liability only for proximate consequences and not the remote ones. Likewise,
the petitioner-trustees cannot take the blame for the far- reaching matrimonial consequences that
befell the bridegroom.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16843 of 2019
11.The learned Senior counsel for the petitioners, on instructions, would further submit that the
petitioners would deposit a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs and Fifty Thousand only) to
the credit of Crime No.1540 of 2019 on the file of the Court of the Judicial Magistrate No.II,
Madurai within one week from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and on such deposit, the
learned Magistrate is directed to issue notice to the defacto complainant and permit him to
withdraw the said amount without prejudice to his claim for higher compensation or damages
before the appropriate Forum.
12.Recording the above, this criminal original petition is allowed and the FIR in Crime No.1540 of
2019 on the file of the first respondent stands quashed so far as the petitioners/accused Nos.2 and 3
are concerned. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
