9. Vide order dated 12.12.2019 the writ court passed an interim order staying counting and
declaration of result. The relevant paragraph-6 of the aforesaid interim order is quoted
hereinbelow:-
" In the meantime, though election may proceed tomorrow, but no further process,
including counting and declaration of result shall take place and the ballet shall be
kept under sealed cover until further orders of the Court."
10. Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that finally the matter was heard by a Division
Bench of this Court and was finally disposed of vide order dated 09.01.2023. The relevant paragraph
8 to 11 of the aforesaid order is quoted hereinbelow:-
"8. Having given our anxious thoughts, the Court would like to indicate, what is going
through its mind. On the one hand. elections have been held minus the 392 persons
who had applied well before the preparation of the voter list. On the other hand, the
body which was competent to Patna High Court L.P.A No.763 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025
consider, i.e., the Managing Committee itself in the resolution bought on record has
accepted the application of some of the persons and rejected some, which clearly
means that out of 392 persons at least some were allowed Once they were allowed,
they had to be made members and their names ought to have figured in the voting list
and they had a right to take part in the election. Admittedly, all 392 persons have
been left out. This 392 figure compared to 1116, which is the numbers of persons
included in the voter list, is a large number to be ignored without the due process of
law which clearly, at the cost of repetition, the Court has held has not been done
9. Accordingly, taking an overall view in the matter, the Court holds that the election
cannot be sustained and the exercise has to be redone right from the inception i.e.,
preparation of the voter list itself However, the said exercise will be limited to the
1116 members already there in the voter list and the 392 fresh applicants.
10. The State Election Authority is directed to issue fresh programme starting from
the stage of preparation of voter list. The Court would indicate that the consideration
would not extend beyond the 1116 persons already being on the voter list and the
concerned 392 applicants and the exercise shall be taken to its logical conclusion,
strictly in accordance with law including the statutory aspect of the Act and the Rules
as also the bye-laws of the PACS. The same be initiated within four weeks from today
Further, any objections which may Patna High Court L.P.A No.763 of 2025
dt.09-10-2025 be filed shall be dealt with and disposed of in time strictly in
accordance with law after proper consideration of both the factual and legal
aspects.11 Coming to the issue of there being grave irregularity committed by the
officers of the Co-operative Department especially at the district level, the Court was
of the opinion that the enquiry be entrusted to the Vigilance Department for which
Mr. Alok Raj, the Director General, Vigilance is present in the Court However, in view
of the request made by the Secretary Department of Co- operation, Government of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109525509/ 4
Umesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
Bihar that she may be entrusted with holding an in house enquiry and also to lay
down strict guidelines with regard to how the officers of the Department are to act in
cases related to the constitution of Managing Committees/ Governing Bodies of
Co-operative Societies at all levels, the Court acceding to such request refrains from
directing for any vigilance enquiry, for the present. However, the Court has been
assured that such exercise would be completed within two months and also strict and
specific guidelines would be issued The Court would only add that the departmental
officers should also be communicated that any violation and failure to strictly adhere
to those guidelines shall be treated as misconduct and shall lead to penal
consequences. The Court expects that based upon the enquiry with regard to the
conduct of the then officers in the present case, responsibility shall be fixed and
action Patna High Court L.P.A No.763 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 shall be taken."
11. Respondent No.14 has challenged the order dated 09.01.2023 passed in CWJC No. 24786 of
2019 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil appeal No. 5312 of 2024 and the same was dispose
of on 22.04.2024. The relevant portion of the aforesaid order is quoted hereinbelow:-
"4. We have heard learned senior counsel for the appellant as well as learned State
counsel. The first respondent, who was the writ petitioner before the High Court, has
not come forward.
5. In our considered opinion, the issues relating to establishment, management and
affairs of the Society can be effectively determined by the Statutory Authority,
namely, the Registrar, Cooperative Society, who can, if need be, hold a Fact-Finding
Enquiry and/or summon the original records to determine whether the 392
applicants had applied for membership or not and if so, whether they were eligible to
be included in the voter list. Without undertaking such an exercise, it will be difficult
to hold that the election of Managing Committee of the Society held by excluding
those voters, is vitiated in law. Consequently, we do not deem it necessary to delve
into the merits of the case and rather remit the same to the Registrar, Cooperative
Society, Bihar, who may in his discretion decide the entire controversy himself or
refer it to an Patna High Court L.P.A No.763 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 Officer, not
below the rank of Deputy Registrar, to hold a Fact-Finding Enquiry; determine the
claim, if any, of 392 applicants and consequently further adjudicate the legality of the
elections of the Managing Committee already held. It goes without saying that if the
Competent Authority comes to the conclusion that the 392 applicants never applied
for membership and/or were ineligible to be included in the voter list, the elections
already held would warrant no interference. However, if such applicants have been
deprived of their right to vote in the elections of the Managing Committee, necessary
consequences must follow."
12. Learned counsel for the Respondent No.14 submits that he had taken preliminary objection with
regard to maintainability of the aforesaid writ petition on the ground that as per the Article 329 (b)
and Article 243-ZG of the Constitution of India, election process at intermediate stage is not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109525509/ 5
Umesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of Constitution of India, except by way of election
petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any
law.
13. Learned counsel for the respondent no.14 further submits that as per Section 21 (x) of the Bihar
Cooperative Society Rules 1959- Patna High Court L.P.A No.763 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 " Any
dispute relating to election of a Cooperative Society may be raised within (90 days) from date of
declaration of result and such dispute shall be decided under Section 48 of Bihar Cooperative
Societies Act, 1935."
14. Learned counsel for the Respondent no.14 further submits that Hon'ble Apex Court has been
pleased to dispose of Civil Appeal No. 5312 of 2024 and the matter was remitted back to the
Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Bihar Patna for deciding the entire controversy himself or refer it
to an official not below the rank of the Deputy Registrar to hold a fact finding inquiry to determine
the claim of any of 392 applicant and consequently further adjudicate the eligibility of the election of
the managing committee already held. In Compliance of order of the Hon'ble Apex Court,
respondent no.2 has issued notice to all concerned and they were directed to file their written notes
of arguments. As per direction of Respondent no.2, Respondent no.5 has proceeded with fact
finding inquiry and summon the appellant and respondent no.14 in the office of the District
Cooperative Officer on 24.07.2024 and after inquiry, Respondent no.5 submitted his report to
Respondent no.2 vide his letter no. 1695 dated 17.08.2024.
15. Learned counsel for the Respondent no.14 submits that copy of the fact finding report dated
17.08.2024 has Patna High Court L.P.A No.763 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 not been given to the
appellant/writ petitioner (as claimed by the appellant/writ petitioner) but from bare perusal of the
aforesaid report dated 17.08.2024, it suggest that appellant/writ petitioner has received a copy of
the aforesaid fact finding report on 10.09.2024.
16. Learned counsel for Respondent no.14 further submits that the appellant/writ petitioner was not
before the Hon'ble Apex Court in Civil Appeal No. 5312 of 2024 and as per Section 48 of the Bihar
Cooperative Societies Act, 1935 read with Rule 21(x) of the Bihar Cooperative Societies Rule, 1959,
the election petition is the only remedy and apart from aforesaid that after the order of the
competent authority which was passed in compliance of the order dated 22.04.2024 passed in Civil
Appeal No.5312 of 2024 the result was published and Respondent no.14 has been declared
successful and he has already taken oath.
17. Learned counsel for the State Election Authority submits that appellant has not come with clean
hand rather he has made false statement before the writ court. He further referred to the paragraph
1 & 2 of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Dalip Singh vs State of U.P. & Ors reported in (2010)
2 SCC 114 which is quoted hereinbelow:-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.763 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 "For many centuries, Indian
society cherished two basic values of life i.e., `Satya' (truth) and `Ahimsa' (non-
violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109525509/ 6
Umesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of justice
delivery system which was in vogue in pre-independence era and the people used to
feel proud to tell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences. However, post-
independence period has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism
has over-shadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so
intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood,
misrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court proceedings.
2. In last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this
creed do not have any respect for truth.
They shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet
the challenge posed by this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new
rules and it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or
who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or
final."
18. We have heard the counsel for the parties and perused the records as well as order/orders as
mentioned aforesaid which transpired that the petitioner/appellant has not Patna High Court L.P.A
No.763 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 come before this Court with clean hand and he has suppressed the
material fact that he has not received copy of the report dated 17.08.2024. Infact he has received the
aforesaid report on 10.09.2024 itself and apart from the aforesaid as per Section 48 of the Bihar
Cooperative Societies Act, 1935 read with Rule 21(x) of the Bihar Cooperative Societies Rule, 1959,
the election petition is the only remedy. In compliance of the order of the Hon'ble Apex Court
passed in Civil appeal No. 5312 of 2024, the competent authority has published the result of the
election in question and Respondent no.14 has been declared successful and he has already taken
oath.
19. In view of the aforesaid, there is no merit in the present appeal and same stands dismissed.
20. Interlocutory Application(s) if any shall stand disposed of.
