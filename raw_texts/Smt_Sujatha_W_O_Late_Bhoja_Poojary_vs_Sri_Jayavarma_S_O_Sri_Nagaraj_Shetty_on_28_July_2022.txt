Smt Sujatha W/O Late Bhoja Poojary vs Sri Jayavarma S/O Sri Nagaraj Shetty on 28 July, 2022
MFA No. 10160 of 2010
C/W MFA No. 10744 of 2010
RS.3,80,500/- WITH INTEREST @ 6% P.A. FROM THE DATE OF
PETITION TILL REALIZATION.
THESE MFAs COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING THIS
DAY THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
MFA No.10744/2010 is filed by the KSRTC challenging the liability fastened on it.
2. It is not in dispute that in MFA No.181/2011 which was in respect of the same accident, this Court
has already held that the KSRTC was not liable for the compensation and absolved it of all liability
and it is also held that the insurer is liable.
3. In view of this undisputed position, the appeal filed by the KSRTC would have to be allowed and it
is accordingly allowed. The liability fastened on the KSRTC is set aside. The amount deposited by
the KSRTC shall be refunded to the KSRTC.
4. MFA No.10160/2010 is filed by the claimants seeking for enhancement in respect of an accident
which occurred on 23.08.2005, and in which Bhoja Poojary, (husband of the first claimant and
father of claimant Nos.2 and 3) suffered grievous injuries and ultimately succumbed to the said
injuries. The claimants therefore sought for compensation as against the owner of the bus, the
insurer of the bus and also against KSRTC.
5. The Tribunal by the impugned award has come to the conclusion that the claimants are entitled to
the following sums:
"1. Loss of dependency.. Rs. 3,12,000-00
2. Medical charges.. Rs. 23,500-00
3. Love and affection.. Rs. 25,000-00
4. Funeral & Obsequies. Rs. 10,000-00
5. Loss of Consortium.. Rs. 10,000-00

Rs. 3,80,500-00
--------------"
6. The Tribunal has fastened the liability on KSRTC. However, in MFA 181/2011 which arose out of
the same accident, this Court has already taken the view that KSRTC would not be liable for the
accident.
7. This court also held that it is open for the insurer and the owner to argue in this appeal as to who
would be liable to pay the compensation. In fact, the appeal filed by KSRTC has been allowed by a
separate order today.
8. It is not in dispute that the driver of the bus did not possess a valid and effective driving licence,
inasmuch as the licence that he possessed was valid only till 17.02.2004, whereas, the accident
occurred on 23.08.2005. In other words, the argument of the insurer is basically that there has been
a breach of the policy conditions and therefore, it would not be liable.
9. However, having regard to the decision of the Full Bench in New India Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs.
Yallavva W/o Yamanappa's case, in cases where violation of policy conditions are alleged, the only
remedy for insurer is to pay the compensation and thereafter proceed to recover the same from the
owner of the offending vehicle.
10. In that view of the above, it is hereby held that the insurer would be liable to pay the
compensation that is to be awarded first and thereafter proceed to recover the same from
Jayavarma, respondent No.1 herein.
11. So far as enhancement of compensation is concerned, it is not in dispute that deceased was aged
45 years and the accident occurred in 2005. The Tribunal has taken the notional income of the
deceased as Rs.3,000/- p.m. since the evidence produced regarding his monthly salary was not
credible. The Tribunal has however applied the multiplier of 13 which could be incorrect. In the light
of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court Sarla Verma (Smt) and Others Vs. Delhi Transport
Corporation and Another reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121, the multiplier applicable would be 14, since
deceased was aged 45 years.
12. The notional income determined by the Tribunal cannot be found fault with since even according
to chart prepared by KSLSA, the monthly income for accidents of the year 2007 was Rs.3,000/-.
Thus the finding regarding monthly income as assessed by the Tribunal is maintained. To this
monthly income of Rs.3,000/-, 25% would be added as future prospects and this would result in the
monthly income to a sum of Rs.3,750/-.
13. Out of the said sum, 1/3rd would have to be deducted towards personal expenditure of the
deceased and this would result in the income of Rs.2,500/-. After applying the multiplier of 14, the
claimants would be entitled to a sum of Rs.2,500 X 12 X 14 = Rs.4,20,000/-.

14. The Tribunal has noticed that the claimants had spent a sum of Rs.23,232/- towards medical
expenses and it is accordingly awarded a sum of Rs.23,500/-. The said award being based on
documentary evidence is maintained.
15. In addition to the above, the claimants being wife and children each would be entitled to a sum
of Rs.44,000/- towards loss of consortium and Rs.33,000/- under the conventional heads.
16. Thus in all the claimants would entitled to the following sums:
1 Towards Loss of dependency : Rs. 4,20,000/- ( Rs.2500 x 12 x 14) 2 Towards of
conventional heads : Rs. 33,000/-
3 Towards Consortium : Rs. 1,32,000/- (Rs.44,000 x3= 1,32,000/-) 4 Towards
Medical Expenses : Rs. 23,500/-
TOTAL : Rs. 6,08,500/-
17. The claimants are entitled to enhanced
compensation of Rs.6,08,500/- along with interest at 6% p.a. from the date of
petition till the date of realization.
The insurer is directed to deposit the above sum within a
- 10 -
period of eight weeks and thereafter would be at liberty to recover the same from the owner of the
offending vehicle.
On such deposit being made, the first claimant would be entitled to 50% of the compensation and
claimant Nos.2 and 3 would be entitled to remaining 50%. Out of the money payable to the first
claimant, 25% of the compensation amount shall be invested in Fixed Deposit for a period of five
years in any nationalized bank.
