157/2022/EZ which has stayed all construction activities over the land in question ex parte.
5. The Opp. Party No. 11 to 15 herein, were the applicants before the National Green Tribunal,
Eastern Zone Bench, Kolkata, who filed an application bearing No. 157/2022 U/s. 18(1) read with
Section 14(1) & 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 inter alia alleging therein that -
(a) Pending grant of Environmental Clearance the petitioner has commenced
construction over the land in question (b) the State Environment Impact Assessment
Authority, (SEIAA), Odisha vide its letter dated 23.11.2022 has communicated that
the application for grant of Environmental Clearance is still under process (c) The
Petitioner has already commenced construction of IMS & SUM Hospital (Campus-II)
over the land in question (d) The Kisam of the land in question is "Nayanjori"
through which storm water is discharged, which could not have been allotted by the
General Administration Department, Government of Odisha. (e) It is also submitted
that the land which is a water body // 3 // must be preserved as a water body and
cannot be converted for any use other than water body in view of the judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Hinch Lal Tiwari Vs. Kamala Devi
&Ors reported in (2001) 6 SCC 496.
6. Heard learned Counsel for the parties. It is ex facie clear that the major lis in question pertains to
(a) the nature i.e. the Kisam of the land in question and (b) construction without a subsisting
Environmental Clearance (EC). Admittedly, in the present case the land has been allotted by the
State itself by the General Administration Department. Without delving into the specifics, the Kisam
of "Nayanjori" merely means a water drainage roadside land or plot of land which can be used as a
passage to approach the main road running on a canal embankment. Therefore, as a corollary
whenever a road is constructed lands abutting both sides automatically become "Nayanjori" in
nature. The same bears no adverse environmental significance but the said land does help in
recharging the ground aquifers. Further in light of the above discussion, the allegation that the
Nayanjori originally was called Prachi River in the Sabik Record and this river extended over 78 kilo
meters with a catchment area of 600 square kilo meters as part of the Mahanadi // 4 // River Delta
seems grossly misconceived without any evidence on record.
7. During the course of the hearing on 12.01.2023 a question was put to the learned Senior Counsel
Shri Ashok Mohanty appearing for the Petitioner with regard to the maintainability aspect of the
instant petition. To that end, reliance was rightly placed by him on the decision of the Supreme
Court of India in the case of M.P. High Court Advocates Bar Assn. v. Union of India and Anr1
wherein, it has been held that the power to exercise of judicial review by the High Courts under
Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India qua the NGT cannot be curtailed by following the
diktat of L Chandra Kumar v. Union of India2 which observed as follows:
"22. It is also noteworthy that nothing contained in the NGT Act either impliedly or
explicitly, ousts the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 and 227 and the
power of judicial review remains intact and unaffected by the NGT Act. The
prerogative of writ jurisdiction of High Courts is neither taken away nor it can be

ousted, as without any doubt, it is definitely a part of the basic structure of the
Constitution. The High Court's exercise their discretion in tandem with the law
depending on the facts of each particular case. Since the High Court's 2022 SCC
OnLine SC 639 (1997) 3 SCC 261 // 5 // jurisdiction remain unaffected, the first
question is answered in the negative, against the petitioners."
Thus, he pointed out that the High court is well within its jurisdiction to entertain this petition.
8. There is no squabble that the GA Department is custodian of the land in question and must
comply with all legal formalities while allotting lands. The principal concern that this Court had on
the earlier date of hearing was that pending the grant of Environmental Clearance, the party in
question had commenced construction work. However, such a position now stands changed with the
grant of the Environmental Clearance by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change,
Government of India, New Delhi for the project in question after the requisite legal due diligence. It
has been brought to the attention of this Court that the Government of India has granted
Environmental Clearance during the pendency of the present Writ Petition on 3.01.2023 vide EC
Identification No. EC23B038OR195241.
9. That being the case, the allegations with regard to the Kisam i.e nature of land being ex facie
flimsy in nature; coupled with the fact that the Environmental Clearance has now been granted by
the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, the primary issue raised in // 6 //
the Original Application before the learned NGT seems to have attained a quietus. Be that as it may,
the same needs some further consideration to mould the appropriate relief.
10. It is borne out from the records of the case that an ex parte impugned order dated 12.12.2022
has been passed by learned NGT staying the construction activity over the land in question. The said
order was passed exparte without giving an opportunity of hearing to the present petitioner. Even
the clarification related to the issue of "fencing does not construe to be construction activities"
was not shown to the learned Tribunal by the Applicants.
11. In view of the above, issue notice to the opposite parties.
12. Five spare copies of the writ petition be served on the learned counsel for the opposite party Nos.
1, 2, 5, 9 and
10. Since a copy of the petition is stated to have been served on opposite party No.8, it need not be
served again on him.
13. Issue notice to the opposite party Nos. 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 to 16 through Regd. Post with A.D..
Requisites be filed within three working days.
14. List this matter on 16th of February, 2023.
