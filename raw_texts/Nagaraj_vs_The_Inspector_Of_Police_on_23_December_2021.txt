COMMON ORDER
These two Revision Cases in Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 arise out of the common judgment
and therefore, are taken up and disposed of together.
2. The petitioner in Crl.R.C.No.832 of 2014 namely Nagaraj was accused No.1 and the petitioners in
Crl.R.C.No.833 of 2014 are accused Nos.3 and 4 in the case. These three petitioners along with one
Nagappa, the second accused in the case faced the charges under Section 392 read with 397 of I.P.C.
The Trial Court, namely the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Hosur, by a judgment, dated
27.03.2008 in S.C.No.17 of 2007, convicted all the four accused for the offence under Section 392 of
Indian Penal Code and imposed a sentence of forty months Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a
fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default, to undergo three months Rigorous Imprisonment and for the offence
under Section 392 read with 397 of I.P.C, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and
833 of 2014 forty months Rigorous Imprisonment. The second accused in the case, namely
Nagappa, did not file any appeal and he has served out the sentence. The first accused, namely,
Nagaraj filed Crl.A.No.30 of 2008. The accused No. 3 and 4, namely, Nagarathinaiah @ Abbaiah
and Sowdappa @ Sowdareddy filed Crl.A. No. 17 of 2007 and both the appeals were taken up
together and by a judgment, dated 22.03.2015, the learned Sessions Judge, Krishnagiri, confirmed
the conviction and sentence of the Trial Court, aggrieved by which, the present revisions are laid
before this Court.
3. The case of the prosecution is that P.W.1, namely Shanmugam, came to Shoolagiri Police Station
on 14.04.2006 and lodged a complaint stating that he was acquianted with the first accused for
about a period of one year. A week before, on Saturday, the first accused came to his house and
handed him over two silver coins and represented to him that he has come into the possession of
treasure of thirty such coins and canvassed him to buy the same. When he represented that he had
no money, he stated that the opportunity will not come again and pressurised PW-1 to buy the same.
When he presented the coins to the Gold Smith, he tested that the silver is of good quality. On
13.04.2006, he went with Rs.1,00,000/- in cash in bag and met the first accused in a place called
Jujuvadi. The second accused was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of
2014 also with him at that time. Immediately, thereafter, the first accused, after checking that P.W.1
came with the money, represented to P.W.1 that the silver coins are with two other persons near a
place called Kaamanthotti Perumal Kovil and therefore, upon his direction, P.W.1 also proceeded
along with him to the said place. At about 6.00 P.M, two more persons were there in the said place
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184973825/ 2
Nagaraj vs The Inspector Of Police on 23 December, 2021
and all the four persons rounded him off and threatened him on knife point and robbed the cash and
ran away from the place. After searching for the first accused along with his uncle, he gave the
complaint.
4. Upon receipt of the complaint, P.W.7 registered a case in Crime No.129/6 and thereafter, P.W.8,
the Inspector of Police took up and completed the investigation and filed a final report, proposing
the four accused guilty of the offences under Sections 392 and 392 read with 397 of Indian Penal
Code.
5. Upon being committed by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Hosur, the case was taken on file
as S.C.No.17 of 2016 and the Trial Court framed the charges under Sections 392 and 392 read with
397 of I.P.C. The accused denied the charges and stood trial.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014
6. The first informant, Shanmugam, was examined as P.W.1; one Veerappan, friend of P.W.1, from
whom P.W.1 is said to have borrowed the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was examined as P.W.2; one
Muniraj, witness in the observation mahazar was examined as P.W.3; one Kumar, witness to the
confession from the first accused, was examined as P.W.4; one Pandurangan, to whom the accused
had lent a sum of Rs.5,000/- and from whom, the said sum of Rs.5,000/- was recovered, was
examined as P.W.5; one Raman, who was also witness to the confession and recovery, was examined
as P.W.6; one K.Brinda, the Sub-Inspector of Police, who registered the F.I.R, was examined as
P.W.7; the investigating officer, namely Sugumar, the Inspector of Police, was examined as P.W.8.
7. The prosecution marked the complaint lodged by PW-1 as Ex.P1; observation mahazar as Ex.P2;
the admissible portion of the confession of A2 as Ex.P3; the admissible portion of the confession of
A3 as Ex.P4; the admissible portion of the confession statement of the A4 as Ex.P5; the seizure
mahazars as Exs.P7 and P8; the admissible portion of the confession statement given by A1 as
Ex.P9; the said seizure mahazar as Ex.P10; the First Information Report as Ex.P11; Form No.95 as
Ex.P12; the rough https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 sketch as
Ex.P13; seizure mahazars Exs.P14 and P15; Form No.95 as Exs.P16 and P17. The cash recovered in
the denomination of 500 rupee notes were marked as M.O.1; the knife used by the accused to
threaten the complainant was marked as M.O.2; two silver coins handed over by the P.W.1 were
marked as M.O.3 and one gold Thali chain and one gold bangle recovered from the accused are
marked as M.Os.4 and 5.
8. Upon being questioned about the incriminating evidence under section 313 of Cr.P.C., the
accused denied the same as false. There was no evidence let in on behalf of the defence. Under these
circumstances, the Trial Court proceeded to hear the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor and the
learned Counsel for the accused. By a judgment, dated 27.03.2008 found that the evidence of P.W.1
trustworthy and that there is no motive whatsoever for him to lodge a false complaint. The
independent witnesses, who witnessed the confession statement, have spoken about the same and
the recovery of the gold jewels, purchased out of the cash, was also proved. The knife used for
commission of the offence was also recovered. There is no any flaw in the registration of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184973825/ 3
Nagaraj vs The Inspector Of Police on 23 December, 2021
complaint by P.W.8 and the investigation by P.W.9. Therefore, on the basis of the available evidence
on record and the documents produced by the prosecution, the Trial Court
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 found that the prosecution has
proved the charges beyond any doubt and convicted the accused and sentenced them as aforesaid.
9. As mentioned supra, aggrieved by the said judgment, A1, A3 and A4 preferred two separate
appeals. The said appeals were taken up together and by a judgment, dated 22.03.2015 that the
ground raised by the accused that there is a delay in lodging the complaint as without any merits on
the ground that PW-1 had explained the delay that he has informed his uncle and thereafter, they
have gone to the house of Nagaraj and after searching for him and thereafter only lodged the
complaint. P.W.2, Veerappan, has also corroborated the evidence of P.W.1 There is no flaw in the
registration of the case and thereafter, in the investigation of P.W.8, who had taken up the
investigation and apprehended the accused and recorded their confession statements and recovered
the money as well as the gold purchased out the crime. The witnesses to the admissible portion of
the confession and the observation mahazar, have spoken about the same. The Trial Court had
rightly directed the returning of the gold jewels to P.W.1. P.W.1 has categorically identified the
accused and therefore, upon appreciation of evidence, it is clear that in this case that the accused
had lured the complainant and thereafter, robbed him of the cash. The other
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 defence that there was motive
for P.W.1 to lodge a false complaint because the accused had complained about P.W.1 that he is
bogus medical practitioner, is without any merit because the accused had not produced any such
complaint given by them so as to impute motive on P.W.1. Therefore, considering all the evidences,
the Trial Court came to the conclusion that it is very clear that after luring P.W.1 to scene of
occurrence, on the knife point, P.W.1 was robed of his cash of Rs.1,00,000/- and therefore,
confirmed the conviction and sentenced imposed on the accused.
10. Heard Mr.C.S.Malarvannan, learned Counsel for the petitioners and Mr.L.Baskaran, learned
Government Advocate (Criminal Side) on behalf of the prosecution.
11. The learned Counsel for the petitioners contended that there is material contradiction in P.W.1's
statement and therefore, his statement should not be believed. He submitted that the recovery is not
at all proved in the manner known to law. He further submitted that the evidence of the friend from
Banglore, namely Muniraj is not at all clear. He did not depose that he gave Rs.1,00,000/-. Two
other persons, from whom recovery was made, were not examined. The recovery was shown only as
Rs. 500/- notes https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 while the PW-1
also gave Rs. 100/- notes. No test identification parade was conducted to identify the accused Nos.3
and 4. Even on the available material, the second charge under Section 392 r/w 397 was not proved
and under these circumstances, the Courts below erred in returning the finding of guilt and
imposing sentence on the petitioners.
12. In support of his contentions, the learned Counsel for the petitioners relied upon the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hari Om Vs. State of U.P1, by placing reliance on paragraph No.35 of
the said judgment, it is submitted that in the absence of the test identification parade, it is not safe
to convict the accused Nos.3 and 4. The learned Counsel also relied upon the judgment in Dana
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184973825/ 4
Nagaraj vs The Inspector Of Police on 23 December, 2021
Yadav and Ors. Vs. State of Bihar 2, for the same proposition that the test identification parade was
essential in this case, since the accused Nos.3 and 4 were not known persons to P.W.1 and therefore,
in the absence of the same, it cannot be said that the investigation is proceeded on the right lines.
13. Opposing the said submissions, Mr.L.Baskaran, learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side)
appearing on behalf of the 1 MANU/SC/0003/2021 2 MANU/SC/0763/2002
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 prosecution would submit that
in this case, the prosecution has mustered all the relevant evidences that it can. The evidence of
P.W.1 coupled with the recoveries made including silver coins, the knife, gold jewel bought out of
the proceeds of the crime, would establish the guilt of the accused conclusively. He would submit
that when P.W.1 had identified A3 and A4 in the Court, the absence of test identification parade will
not alter situation. Therefore, he would submit that the revision is without any merits and prayed
for dismissal of the same.
14. I have considered the rival submissions made on behalf of either side and the material evidence
on record and the findings of the Trial Court and that of the first Appellate Court. From the evidence
of P.W.1, it is clear that he was having one bundle of 500 rupee notes totally amounting Rs.50,000/-
and five bundles of 100 rupee notes for another Rs.50,000/-. However, all the recovery made were
only 500 rupee notes and therefore, the learned counsel would contend that the recovery is not
believable. The said submission of the learned Counsel can be countenanced if the recovery of 500
rupee notes had exceeded a sum of Rs.50,000/- which is not the case. Therefore, so long as the
recovered sum is less than Rs.50,000/-, the said argument is rejected. Further more, the Trial Court
as well as the lower https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 Appellate
Court considered the statements of the witnesses, who witnessed the accused making confession
statement and leading the investigating officer to recover M.Os. The statements of the said witnesses
and that of the investigating officer categorically prove the recovery and therefore, the submissions
to the contrary is without any merits.
15. The evidence of P.W.2 proceeds that he is residing in Banglore and that one year before when he
was in his house, P.W.1 asked for money. Thereafter, P.W.1 told him what happened and that he
narrated to him that the money of Rs.1,00,000/- was snatched away from him and that he
accompanied him to the Police Station. Therefore, mere absence of an express statement that he had
actually given the money of Rs.1,00,000/- will not make any difference.
16. As regards non-conduct of test identification parade, even as per the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India, relied upon by the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, as in paragraph No.37(e) of the judgment in Dana Yadav and Ors. Vs. State of
Bihar3, held as follows:-
3 Refer foot https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis note No.2 Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of
2014 “37 (e). Failure to hold test identification parade does not make the evidence of
identification in court inadmissible rather the same is very much admissible in law,
but ordinarily identification of an accused by a witness for the first time in court
should not form basis of conviction, the same being from its very nature inherently of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184973825/ 5
Nagaraj vs The Inspector Of Police on 23 December, 2021
a weak character unless it is corroborated by his previous identification in the test
identification parade or any other evidence. The previous identification in the test
identification parade is a check valve to the evidence of identification in court of an
accused by a witness and the same is a rule of prudence and not law.“ Therefore, it is
clear that it is a rule of prudence that when test identification parade is not
conducted, the conviction cannot be solely based on the identification of the accused
in Court. But, in this case, the corroboratory evidence i.e., Exs.P4 and P5, namely the
admissible portion of the confession statements of A3 and A4, is leading to recovery;
as far as the A3 is concerned, a recovery of Rs.10,000/- from himself; another sum of
Rs.5,000/- from P.W.5, Pandurangan, to whom he has given Rs.5,000/-;
Similarly, the sum of Rs.10,000/- was also recovered from A4; another sum of Rs.5,000/-, which he
had given to one Chinnappa is recovered. Therefore, the recoveries made clinchingly prove the
involvement of A3 and A4 and therefore, the probative value of the identification of the accused by
P.W.1 before the Court can be taken into account along with the other evidence on record to convict
the accused and therefore, I reject the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of
2014 submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners that the findings of the Trial Court and
the first Appellate Court are perverse for want of test identification parade. I therefore, see no merits
in the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the petitioners and I confirm the conviction of
the petitioners for the offense punishable under Section 392 of Indian Penal Code.
17. However, the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioners regarding the second charge
of punishable under Section 397 merits acceptance. It may be seen that the alleged knife which was
not properly identified by PW-1 and he has stated that it resembles the one shown to him and
accordingly marked with objection. Therefore, the use of the deadly weapon is doubtful. There was
no evidence that there was any grievious hurt was caused or attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.
Therefore, as rightly contended by the Learned Counsel for the petitioners, the Trial Court and the
Lower Appellate court did not consider this aspect of the matter and as such, I find that the second
charge, namely, 392 read with 397 IPC as not proved beyond doubt.
18. Finally the learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that each
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014 of them had undergone
imprisonment, pending trial and after the dismissal of their appeal. It is submitted that on a deeper
appreciation of fact, it can be seen that instant case was an attempt to cheat the accused, by coning
P.W.1 of treasure. He would submit that P.W.1 had gone ahead with the money, with an illegal
motive of appropriating treasure to himself in violation of the Treasure Trove Act, 1954 and the
offence is predominantly of luring and cheating money, even though the prosecution had alleged the
use of force by knife point. He would further submit that there are no other bad antecedents for the
accused. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) also confirmed that there is no other case
against the accused persons.
19. Considering the nature of the offence, efflux of the time and the socio-economic conditions of the
petitioners, I am inclined to reduce the sentence of punishment imposed by the Trial Court for the
offences under Sections 392 of Indian Penal Code from Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of forty

Nagaraj vs The Inspector Of Police on 23 December, 2021
months to that of Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of one year.
20. These Criminal Revision cases are partly allowed on the following terms :
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.Nos.832 and 833 of 2014
(i) The conviction of the petitoners for the offense under Section 392 is confirmed;
(ii) The sentence of imprisonment imposed by the trial court and the appellate Court
is reduced from the period of 40 months to a period of one year;
(iii) The accused shall be entitled to set off the period already there were in custody in
this case;
(iv) The fine amount remains the same;
(v) The petitoners are acquitted of the second charge of the offense under Section 392
r/w 397 of Indian Penal Code.
