HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
M.Cr.C. No.12399/2019
(Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another)
Gwalior, dated : 03.04.2019
Per Justice Vivek Agarwal
Shri K. Sultan Singh, learned senior counsel with Shri
Rajiv Sharma, counsel for the petitioner.
Shri Vivek Khedkar, learned Assistant Solicitor General,
for the respondent No.2/Union of India.
This Miscellaneous Criminal Case has been filed on behalf of the petitioner Dr. Sakti Pratap Singh
Kirar under the provisions of Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against the order dated 15.02.2019 passed by
the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gwalior, in Case No.16995/14, 728/14 ST (CBI Vs.
Dr. Vishal and Others) whereby learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate has issued
non-bailable warrant against the petitioner in relation to Crime No.285/14 registered at Police
Station Jhansi Road, District Gwalior and RC No.217 2015 S 0006 registered by CBI on dated
22.07.2015 for the offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 420, 467, 468, 471, 477-A of IPC and
Section 3(d) (1)(2)/4 of Examination Act (Vyapam). (2) Learned senior advocate appearing for the
petitioner submits that though the petitioner had an intimation about HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH (Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another) filing of charge-sheet
before the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate on 15.02.2019, but as petitioner had filed an
application for anticipatory bail under the provisions of Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure
before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Gwalior, registered as M.Cr.C.6278/19 on 6th
February, 2019 and that matter was though listed on 12.02.2019 but was adjourned for a period of
four weeks, therefore, in anticipation of getting anticipatory bail from the High Court, applicant did
not appear before the Court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate. (3) It is submitted that
on 12.02.2019 since lawyers were abstaining from work, therefore, petitioner's younger brother had
appeared and sought time. On his request, case was not fixed for 13th February, 2019, as sought by
younger brother of the petitioner and, therefore, in anticipation of getting early hearing, petitioner
did not appear before the trial Court. (4) It is an admitted position that on 12.03.2019 when said
M.Cr.C. came up for hearing, then learned counsel for the petitioner, who is today assisting learned
senior advocate appearing for the petitioner, had sought withdrawal of the HIGH COURT OF
MADHYA PRADESH (Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another) M.Cr.C. on

Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
account of filing of the charge-sheet, as a result of which, application for anticipatory bail was
dismissed as rendered infructuous, with liberty to challenge the non-bailable warrant issued to seek
arrest of the petitioner. (5) A perusal of order dated 12.03.2019 passed in M.Cr.C. No.6278/19 will
reveal that this Court had categorically expressed its lack of inclination to grant any liberty, when
learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that an order may be passed of withdrawal. Taking into
consideration the totality of the facts and circumstances that charge-sheet was filed, this Court had
permitted withdrawal of the petition and dismissed the petition as withdrawn.
(6) Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner was a candidate to the pre-Post
Graduate, 2011 Entrance Examination and the allegation of the prosecution is that he had secured
selection to Post Graduate degree course by way of manipulation in the mark-sheet with the help of
middle man Gaurav Bhadoira and Rahul Jain who had further introduced another middle man in
the chain of actors and benefactor namely Atul Sharma/Amit Sharma, who had in turn introduced
HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and
another) Brijmohan Sakhwar, which was seized by SIT/MP Police. (7) It is submitted that all other
co-accused are on bail and petitioner has been deprived of such liberty merely on account of his one
non-appearance before the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate.
(8) It is also submitted that his fundamental rights are being taken away with issuance of
non-bailable warrants which is violative of the provisions contained in Article 21 of the Constitution.
(9) It is also submitted that in its compliance report Central Bureau of Investigation, has clearly
mentioned that investigation is complete and there is no need of custodial or other interrogation of
the accused. Attention is drawn towards paragraph 15 of the compliance report:
"15. Whether custodial interrogation no of the applicant would be necessary in future
Investigation or not?"
(10) Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the judgment of Inder Mohan
Goswami and another Vs. State of Uttaranchal and Others as reported in 2008 (1) SCC (Cri) 259
wherein, in paragraph 53, guidelines have been HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dr. Shakti
Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another) laid down as to when non-bailable warrants
should be issued. Paragraph 53 reads as under:
"53. Non-bailable warrant should be issued to bring a person to court when summons
or bailable warrants would be unlikely to have the desired result. This could be when:
"* it is reasonable to believe that the person will not voluntarily appear in court; or *
the police authorities are unable to find the person to serve him with a summon: or *
it is considered that the person could harm someone if not placed into custody
immediately."
(11) Similarly, in paragraph 57, it has been held that the Court should try to maintain proper balance
between individual liberty and the interest of the public and the State while issuing non-bailable

warrant. Placing reliance on such judgment of the Supreme Court, it is pointed out that India being
a civilized country has to recognize that liberty is the most precious of all the human rights and
Article 21 of our Constitution proclaims that no one shall be deprived of his personal liberty except
in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
(12) Before adverting to merits of submissions put forth by the learned senior advocate, brief facts of
the present case are HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs.
State of M.P. and another) that in the impugned order itself it is mentioned as under:-

copy of the Miscellaneous Criminal Case enclosed by the petitioner which was
registered as M.Cr.C.6258/19, it is apparent that this was second bail application
under Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In the column of details of
earlier bail application, it is mentioned that earlier M.Cr.C.No.6237/15 was dismissed
vide order dated 07.07.2015. Earlier bail application was dismissed through a
reasoned and speaking order noting a fact that petitioner had secured admission in
the Post Graduate course by paying illegal gratification and such illegal act was
committed by the applicant with the assistance of his father Dr. Gulab Singh Kirar,
through racketeers and the middlemen, and HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
(Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another) therefore, the
contention of the applicant that he be extended benefit of anticipatory bail on the
ground that physical condition of his infant son was rejected looking to the
seriousness of the offences noting that such relief could not be extended merely on
such emotional and sentimental grounds, taking note of the orders of the Supreme
Court in the matter of Amit Yadav Vs. State of M.P. decided in Special Leave to
Appeal (Cri.) No.3835/2015 vide dated 12.05.2015 and in the matter of Dr. Kalyan
Singh Vs. State of M.P., decided in Special Leave to Appeal (Cri.) No.4796/15 vide
order dated 08.06.2015, whereby said Special Leave Petitions have been dismissed
which were preferred by the concerning accused against the order of dismissal of
their respective anticipatory bail applications by this Court. Thereafter, second bail
application under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. has been dismissed as withdrawn on
12.03.2019.
(14) Learned senior advocate appearing for the petitioner tried to implicate this Court for being
non-functional on 12 th February, 2019, on account of call of absenteeism given by the Bar, when it
was politely clarified that it is not the Court which HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dr.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143550188/ 3
Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another) abstained from work, but it is in fact
parties or their legal representatives who abstained from work. Order-sheet dated 12.02.2019 in
M.Cr.C.6278/19 reads as under:
"None for the parties.
Advocates are not appearing at the call of Bar Council of India.
By way of indulgence, one opportunity is granted. List after four weeks."
In this backdrop, the excuse, which has been given by the learned senior advocate for
non-appearance of the petitioner before the trial Court on 15.02.2019, is not made out. As has been
mentioned above, learned trial Court has already recorded a finding that despite intimation in
regard to filing of the charge-sheet, petitioner did not appear before the said trial Court on
15.02.2019, even it has considered an application for recall of non-bailable warrant before
dismissing it. (15) It is true that universal declaration on human rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, speak with one voice - liberty is the natural and
inalienable right of every human being. Similarly, Article 21 of our Constitution proclaims that no
one shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by HIGH
COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another) law.
(16) Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Indar Mohan Goswami (supra) in paragraph 53 has laid
down three criteria when non-bailable warrants should be issued and in our opinion, in the present
case, one appears to be available namely person will not voluntarily appear in Court. The reason
which has been assigned by learned counsel for the petitioner that he was waiting for the outcome of
his anticipatory bail application is not just and correct. Nothing prevented the petitioner from
appearing before the Court on 12.02.2019 seeking anticipatory bail. Even otherwise, such calls given
by Bar Association for abstaining from work have been declared to be illegal by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. For reference, see the authority of Ex.Capt. Harish Uppal Vs. Union of India and an
other as reported in 2003 (2) SCC
45. (17) As has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Indar Mohan Goswami (supra) that Court
has to balance between individual liberty and the interest of the public and the State, this Court is of
the opinion that learned Court below has been HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dr. Shakti
Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and another) able to strike a very fine balance between
individual liberty and the interest of the public and the State inasmuch as when petitioner did not
appear before the trial Court despite having knowledge of filing of charge-sheet by Central Bureau of
Investigation as has been noted by the trial Court, instead his advocate appeared (Refer to
paragraph 6 of the petition), then he himself chose to deprive himself of his liberty by not following
the procedure prescribed by law.
(18) A bare perusal of Section 204(1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure reveals that in a warrant
case, a magistrate, if he thinks fit can issue a warrant. For authority, please refer to Vidavaluru
Balaramaiah and others Vs. State of A.P. and another as reported in 2003 Cri.L.J. 3192 and Sukh

Deo Vs. State of UP 2006 as reported in Cri.L.J. (NOC) 577.
(19) Even otherwise, case of Indar Mohan Goswami (supra) is originating from commission of
breach of contractual obligation which is totally different from the one where a candidate allegedly
secures admission in a prestigious Post Graduate course of medical education using illegal and
HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Dr. Shakti Pratap Singh Kirar Vs. State of M.P. and
another) corrupt means and, therefore, the nature of two offences being distinguishable, the ratio of
law is also to be understood and appreciated in that context, inasmuch as the facts of the case in
Indar Mohan Goswami (supra) relates to a case in personam, whereas the present case is one in
rem. (20) Thus, finding no illegality in the impugned order, we are not inclined to show any
indulgence, as no grounds are available to maintain such a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
Consequently, the petition is dismissed.
