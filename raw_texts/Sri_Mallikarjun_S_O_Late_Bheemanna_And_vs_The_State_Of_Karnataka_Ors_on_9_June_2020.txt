Sri. Mallikarjun S/O Late Bheemanna And ... vs The State Of Karnataka & Ors on 9 June, 2020
Bidar, belonging to appellants are acquired for expansion of existing Defence
Air-force Station, at Bidar under 4 (1) notification dated 01.10.1985 issued by the
Land Acquisition Officer under Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The Land Acquisition
Officer passed the order on 26.07.1989 determining the market value of the said
lands at Rs.9,600/- per acre. The appellants- claimants being dissatisfied with the
quantum of the market value have filed reference petition before the Reference Court
in LAC.No.303/1991. The reference Court determined the market value of the
acquired lands at the rate of Rs.43,000/- per acre vide its judgment and award dated
27.11.1995.
04. Aggrieved by the same, the Union of India -
Respondent No.2 in the present appeal and others have filed an appeal before this Court in
MFA.No.1420/1999. The appeal was allowed on 01.03.2000 and the impugned judgment therein
was set aside and the matter was remitted back to the Reference Court for fresh disposal. The
appellant No.1 in this case again got examined and got marked additional documents Exs.P.15 to 23.
The Reference Court on the basis of the evidence and other materials, determined the market value
of the acquired lands at the rate of Rs.44,220/- per acre with other statutory benefits vide its
judgment and award dated 22.11.2012.
05. Aggrieved by the same the present appellants filed this appeal on the ground that the Reference
Court has erred in not determining the market value keeping in view the admitted facts and not
assessed the evidence keeping in view the potentiality of acquired lands for development. The lands
adjoining to it are already developed. The acquired lands are close to Bidar City and located in the
developed extension area of Bidar City. A plot of the size of 40' x 60' in the vicinity of the acquired
lands was being sold at Rs.12,000/- to Rs.15,000/- per plot at the time of issuance of 4 (1)
notification. The appellants made it clear in the plan that in one acre of land 12 plots of 60' x 40'
size, could be formed; excluding the area for parks, civic amenities and the road. The reference
Court having held that 12 plots of the size 40' x 60' could be formed in one acre of land; is not
justified in deducting 1/3rd of the value assessed. The approach of the Reference Court in deducting
further 1/3rd of the value is not correct. The lands, of which the Reference Court has observed as
similar to the acquired lands of the appellants, are of a different village and far from the acquired
lands. This approach of the Reference Court has resulted in determining the market value on lower
side and therefore the same requires reconsideration of this Court. The appellants pray to enhance
the compensation from Rs.44,220/- per acre to Rs.52,220/- per acre.
06. The learned counsel for the respondents relied on the judgment of Coordinate Bench of this
Court in MFA.No.1443/2008 (LAC) dated 08.06.2015, wherein the appeal preferred by the
respondents herein who are appellants in that MFA, in respect of lands acquired for the same
purpose under same preliminary notification dated 26.09.1985 and situated in the same village, the
market value at Rs.43,000/- per acre awarded by the Reference Court in LAC.No.312/1991 is
challenged. The said appeal came to be dismissed confirming the market value of the land awarded
by the Reference Court. In the said judgment at paragraphs Nos.8, 9 and 10 it is observed as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27163219/ 3
Sri. Mallikarjun S/O Late Bheemanna And ... vs The State Of Karnataka & Ors on 9 June, 2020
"Para No.8. The learned counsel for the appellants contended that in
MFA.No.31954/2009 this Court has awarded compensation at the rate of
Rs.42,000/- per acre with statutory benefits and therefore, the impugned judgment
and award needs to be modified. Para No.9. As against this, the learned submitted
that the reference Court relying upon the judgment in LAC.No.146/1988 which has
been confirmed by this Court in MFA.No.2366/1994 has awarded compensation at
the rate of Rs.43,000/-
per acre with statutory benefits and therefore, the impugned judgment and award
does not call for interference."
Para No.10. We find considerable force in the submission of the learned counsel for the claimants.
The reference Court relying upon the judgment in LAC.No.146/1988 which has been confirmed by
this Court in MFA.No.2366/1994 has awarded compensation at the rate of Rs.43,000/- per acre
with all statutory benefits. In the decision relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants the
compensation is awarded at the rate of Rs.42,000/- per acre with statutory benefits. There is no
substantial difference between the two. Therefore, we do not find any valid reason to interfere with
the impugned judgment and award.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed."
07. Further, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has also relied upon the judgment of the Single
Judge of this Court passed in MFA.No.31954/2009 (LAC), wherein the land loosers have filed
appeal against the respondents herein who are also the respondents therein, challenging the
quantum of compensation awarded by the Reference Court for the acquisition of land under same 4
(1) notification dated 26.09.1985 for the same purpose situated in the same village. After taking into
consideration the material on record, the learned Single Judge has allowed the appeal in part
pertaining to LAC.No.326/1991 by enhancing the compensation at the rate of Rs.42,000/- per acre.
08. That the judgment pertaining to LAC.No.326/1991 and present appeal is against the common
order passed in LAC.Nos.325/1991, 307/1991 and LAC.No.303/1991 by the Reference Court. In fact
the Reference Court has made reference to the other cases in determination of the market value. It is
evident that now in all these cases Rs.43,000/- per acre is accepted as per order passed, in both
MFA that is appeal preferred by the respondents in this case and appeal preferred by claimants in
LAC.No.326/1991 whose lands are acquired under same notification for same purpose situated in
the same village.
09. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that, this matter was remand by this Court for
fresh consideration. It is pertinent to note that this matter is remanded as appeal is filed by the
respondents herein challenging the enhancement of compensation, but appellants herein who were
respondents in that case have not preferred any appeal or cross-objection. It appears that they were
satisfied with the said award. Only, now in the year 2012 when the Reference Court affirmed the
compensation awarded, in the other LAC matters and awarded compensation at the rate of
Rs.44,220/- by enhancing it, this appeal is preferred by the appellants and tried to contend that now
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27163219/ 4
Sri. Mallikarjun S/O Late Bheemanna And ... vs The State Of Karnataka & Ors on 9 June, 2020
they were not satisfied with enhancement.
10. We have given our anxious consideration to the contentions advanced by the learned counsel for
the parties. In a matter like this, it has to be kept in mind that land belonging to a farmer is acquired
for public purpose taking recourse to provisions providing for compulsory acquisition under the
Land Acquisition Act. It is well established that persons whose lands are acquired under the same
notification for the same project are entitled to receive similar compensation on the principle of
parity in the matter of payment of compensation. It is also well established that judgments rendered
by the court of competent jurisdiction determining market value of similar lands can be relevant
piece of evidence and can be relied upon for fixing the market value of comparable lands acquired
for the same purpose.
11. In the instant case, only ground urged in the appeal is that the Reference Court has not
considered the evidence adduced by the claimants and not considered the potentiality of the
acquired lands for development. The lands adjoining to it are already developed as contemplated
under Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act. But such contentions cannot be accepted at this stage.
Similar lands having same potentiality and market value are acquired under 4 (1) notification on
26.09.1985, the reference Court awards are challenged both by land loosers and the beneficiaries
have been considered and it has reached finality by the judgments of this Court. It is pertinent to
note that under 4 (1) notification not only the lands of these appellants are acquired, but also the
lands of several persons were acquired i.e., more than 100 persons lands in the villages of Chidri,
Naubad, Bakchoudi and Nijampur of Bidar Taluka, totally measuring 495 acres 08 guntas extent of
lands are acquired. The award is passed by SLAO on 26.07.1989. The appeal filed by the
beneficiaries and land loosers under same notification are dismissed. Now,
respondents-beneficiaries and land loosers in other cases have accepted the market value of the
acquired lands at Rs.43,000/- per acre.
12. We are of the considered view that when the compensation in respect of large extent lands
acquired for the same purpose under same notification situated in the same village have attained
finality by judicial pronouncements of this Court, at this stage appellants prayer for fresh exercise of
re-determining the compensation will open up the Pandora's box. Again all land loosers will have
grievance and approach before the concerned forum seeking the additional compensation thereby
unsettling the settled position in this regard.
13. We find no valid grounds or material after lapse of nearly three decades to modify the order or
disturb the value of the acquired lands. Therefore, order of Reference Court awarding Rs.44,220/-
per acre does not call for any interference. The appeal being devoid of merits, is liable to be
dismissed.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
