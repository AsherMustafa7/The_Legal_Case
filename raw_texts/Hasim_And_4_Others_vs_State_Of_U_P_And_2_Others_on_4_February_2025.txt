petitioners in pursuance of the impugned F.I.R.
3. The Division Bench vide order dated 15.01.2025 has proceeded to pass the following order:
"1. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned A.G.A. appearing for the
State respondents. None appears for the informant.
2. This writ petition has been filed praying to quash the Case Crime No.325 of 2024
under Sections 75, 64, 89, 115 (2), 352, 351 (2), 351 (3) BNS and 3/4 Muslim Women
Protection Act, P.S. Simbhawali, Distt. Hapur.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned FIR has been
lodged totally on false allegations just to harass the petitioners. However, he submits
that the parties have already settled the matter out of court and as such, the
impugned first information report is liable to be quashed. The joint compromise deed
dated 07.01.2025 is also appended along with the supplementary affidavit filed today.
The said supplementary affidavit is taken on record. In support of his submission, he
has placed reliance on the judgements of Hon'ble Apex Court in B.S. Joshi Vs. State
of Haryana reported in 2003(4) SCC 675, Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of
investigation and another J.T. 2008(9) SC 192, Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2012)
10 SCC 303, Yogendra Yadav and others Vs. State of Jharkhand (2014) 9 SCC 653
and also in Narendra Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466.
4. It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that all the disputes and
differences have been settled between the parties. At this stage, it is pressed that
continuation of the proceedings of the aforesaid case will be an abuse of process of
law. He submits that the impugned FIR is liable to be quashed in view of the law laid
down by the Apex Court in Gian Singh (supra), B.S. Joshi (supra) and Madan Mohan
Abbot vs. State of Punjab, (2008) 4 SCC 582.
5. We have considered the rival submissions and gone through the entire record.
6. In all the aforesaid cases, the Apex Court has laid down the law that criminal
proceedings may be quashed even in non-compoundable cases by the High Court in
exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction to restore peace between the parties and in
case the justice so demands. According to Hon'ble Supreme Court, if the offence
involves private dispute between the parties of commercial nature or matrimonial
dispute and it is not related to heinous offence, the proceedings may be quashed.
7. Since the dispute between the parties has been amicably and mutually settled, no
fruitful purpose would be served by permitting to continue the criminal proceeding
and it would simply be a waste of time, if the aforesaid case is permitted to continue
till its logical conclusion.

8. As it is informed that till date the police report under Section 173 (2) of Cr.P.C. has
not been submitted in the aforesaid Case Crime, we direct that the parties may
appear before the Investigating Officer for verification of the joint compromise deed
dated 07.01.2025 within ten days from today. Thereafter, the investigating officer will
produce the parties to the concerned jurisdictional Magistrate for verification of the
said claim. It is also directed that the Magistrate concerned will record the statement
of the parties concerned as to whether the terms and conditions if set out in the
settlement/compromise had been fulfilled or not and submit a report before this
Court through Registrar (Compliance) by the next date.
9. Put up this matter as fresh on 04.02.2025.
10. Till the next date of listing, no coercive action shall be taken against the
petitioners pursuant to impugned FIR, provided they cooperate with the
investigation in question."
4. In response to the order dated 15.01.2025, the Additional Civil Judge (JD)/ Judicial Magistrate,
Garhmukteshwar, District Hapur has submitted a report dated 28.01.2025, which has also been
placed on record. Learned counsel for the petitioners in this backdrop states that since the parties
have already settled the matter in light of the settlement agreement entered into on 07.01.2025
before the concerned Magistrate, the instant First Information Report is liable to be quashed.
5. Learned counsel for the informant - respondent No.3 states informant has no objection in case
the impugned first information report is quashed.
6. As it is jointly submitted that as the dispute has come to be amicably resolved therefore, pending
proceedings would serve no purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in the light of the
judgements of the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana and others,
2003(4) SCC 675 and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab, 2012(10) SCC 303. Reliance has also been
placed on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court dated 16.9.2022 in Criminal Misc. Writ
Petition No.8510 of 2022 (Anuj Pandey v. State of U.P. & Ors.) wherein it is observed that the High
Court has ample power under its inherent jurisdiction to quash the first information report in which
the parties have settled their disputes which are of private in nature and have no any grave impact
on the society. The time of courts as well as investigating agencies are very precious which should
not be wasted in any futile proceedings where the chance of conviction is bleak.
6. Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra) has held in para-61 that;
"the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences Under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases

Hasim And 4 Others vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 4 February, 2025
power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or
victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not
private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like
Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while
working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
and pre-dominatingly civil favour stand on different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary
to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."
7. Since the dispute between the parties have already been settled amicably, pending proceedings
would serve no purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in the light of the aforesaid
judgments.
8. The writ petition is allowed and the proceedings of First Information Report dated 04.12.2024
registered as Case Crime No.325 of 2024 under Sections 75, 64, 89, 115(2), 352, 351(2), 351(3)
B.N.S. and 3/4 Muslim Women (Protection on Marriage) Act, 2019, at Police Station Simbhawali,
District Hapur are hereby quashed.
