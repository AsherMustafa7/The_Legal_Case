3.The case of the petitioner in W.P.No.15762 of 2021 is that during the previous year 2010-11, the
petitioner had received advance from some of its customers which was not offered to income. The
assessment was completed and an assessment order dated 31.03.2016 was passed for the

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021
4.The petitioner preferred an appeal before the CIT (Appeals) against the Assessment Order dated
31.03.2016 for the Assessment Year 2011- 2012. The petitioner's appeal was allowed by CIT
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147292242/ 3
M/S.Ganam Homes And Estates Private ... vs The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 29 November, 2021
(Appeals), vide order dated 23.02.2018. Further appeal before the Tribunal by the Department was
also dismissed, vide order dated 03.12.2018. In these circumstances, the Department preferred
appeal before this Court in TCA.No.505 of 2019.
5.It is the case of the petitioner that pending the above Department's appeal in TCA.No.505 of 2019,
the petitioner offered to settle the dispute by filling appropriate declarations under the provisions of
the Direct Taxes Vivad se Vishwas Scheme for the Assessment Year 2011-12. The petitioner's case for
settling the dispute was also accepted by the designated authority by issuance of Form-3 on
20.01.2021. The petitioner also remitted a sum of Rs.1,02,89,121/- on 05.03.2021.
6.The case of the petitioner in W.P.No.15763 of 2021 is identical. Here also, the petitioner was held
liable to advance received by it during Assessment Year 2011-12 by Assessment Order dated
31.03.2016. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 petitioner had
successfully appealed before the CIT (Appeals) who by order dated 23.02.2018 allowed the appeal of
the petitioner. The further appeal before the ITAT by the department was also dismissed on
03.12.2018. Aggrieved by the same, the Department had filed T.C.A.No.503 of 2019.
7.Under these circumstances, the petitioner sent a representation dated 30.11.2020 and 05.03.2021
to rectify the protective demand made for the Assessment Year 2014-15 and to refund a sum of
Rs.79,62,787/- + interest of Rs.15,57,673/- under Section 244A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
8.Meanwhile, for the Assessment Year 2014-15 [previous year 2013- 14], same income was also
offered to tax by the petitioner and a protective assessment was made by the respondent under
Section 143-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Since the petitioner's case was settled on the aforesaid
provisions of the Direct Taxes Vivad se Vishwas scheme, the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax
viz., for the Assessment Year 2011-2012, the first respondent passed an order under Section 154 of
the Income Tax Act for the assessment year 2014-15 on 08.03.2021 by concluding that the petitioner
was indeed entitled for refund of a sum of Rs.95,20,460/- i.e., a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 sum of Rs.79,62,787/- paid as proportionate tax paid on the
advance which was offered as tax by the petitioner on the aforesaid amount of Rs.3,21,90,000/- and
further interest under Section 244A of the Income Tax Act amounting to Rs.15,57,673/-.
9.During the pendency of the appeal, the petitioner opted for Vivad Se Vishwas Act Scheme and filed
Form No.1 and Form No.2 under the scheme for the assessment year 2011-12 on 02.12.202. As per
Circular No.7 of 2020 dated 04.03.2020 issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes, on settlement of
dispute related to substantive addition under Vivad Se Vishwas, the Assessing Officer shall pass
rectification order deleting the protective addition relating to the same issue in the case of the
assessee.
10.Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, Ms.Pushya Sitaraman, learned Senior Counsel would
submit that the respondents are bound to repay the amount which has been confirmed by the first
respondent while passing the order under Section 154 of the Income Tax Act on 08.03.2021. The
learned Senior Counsel has also drawn the attention to Circular No.7/2020, dated 04.03.2020
bearing reference F.No.IT(A)/1/2020-TPL, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147292242/ 4
M/S.Ganam Homes And Estates Private ... vs The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 29 November, 2021
15763 of 2021 Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Central Board of
Direct Taxes. In particular, reference was made to the Answer given to Question No.35, wherein the
CMBT has answered as follows:
Question No.35 : If there is substantive addition as well as protective addition in the
case of same assessee for different assessment year, how will that be covered?
Similarly if there is substantive addition in case of one assessee and protective
addition on same issue in the case of another assessee, how will that be covered
under Vivad se Vishwas?
Answer : If the substantive addition is eligible to be covered under Vivad se Vishwas,
then on settlement of dispute related to substantive addition AO shall pass
rectification order deleting the protective addition relating to the same issue in the
case of the assessee or in the case of another assessee.”
11.The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submits that despite the order passed under
Section 154 of Income Tax Act, 1961 for the assessment year 2014-15, the respondents are refusing
to refund the amount of Rs.95,20,460/- and therefore, submits that the writ petition deserves to be
allowed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021
12.The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has also drawn the attention to Circular No.71
dated 20.12.1971 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under Section 119(2)(b) of the Income
Tax Act, 1961. The learned Senior Counsel would further submit that the hardship faced by the
assessees on the ground of split implementation of the provisions of Income Tax was considered and
it was clarified as under:
“In our opinion, no question of law, much less a substantial question of law, arises in
these appeals. It is a settled principle that one particular income cannot be taxed in
the hands of different assessees. In the instant case, as the income has been
substantively assessed in the hands of the main trust, the same income cannot be
again assessed in the hands of the beneficiary trusts. For the sake of abundant
caution, it has been directed by the Tribunal that the revenue should look into the
facts and see whether the income which has been assessed on protective basis in the
hands of the respondent trusts was, in fact, assessed in the hands of the main trust.”
13.The learned Senior Counsel also submits that under somewhat similar circumstances as in the
present case where the dispute was settled under 'Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998' [KVSS], a
batch of appeals https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 numbering 284
was considered by the Special Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Ahmedabad in
Punitaben Karsanbhai Patel Oral v. Income Tax Officer reported in 2007 (288) ITR 169 Ahd and
allowed.

M/S.Ganam Homes And Estates Private ... vs The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 29 November, 2021
14.The learned Senior Counsel further submits that the views taken by the Special Bench was also
affirmed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Commissioner of
Income Tax v. Hirenbhai K.Patel reported in 2014 SCC OnLine Guj 15765. The learned Senior
Counsel submits that in the above case, the case that fell for consideration before the Special Bench
of the Income Tax was pertaining to the assessee which was a beneficiary Trust of the main Trust
called S.K.Patel Family Trust having share of income from Main Trust and also interest income from
the Main Trust along with their independent incomes. The Assessee had taken stand that the income
attributable to the beneficiary Trusts are to be assessed in the individual hand of the beneficiary
Trusts whereas the Income Tax department took a view that the income of the Main Trust should be
assessed in its own hand. There the dispute regarding the taxability of income in the hands of main
Trust reached upto the jurisdictional High Court on reference application and while the reference
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 was pending before the Hon'ble
High Court of Gujarat, the Government announced KVSS scheme under which the main Trust
settled the dispute regarding taxability of income in its hand by paying appropriate tax and securing
the relevant certificate of compliance from the concerned CIR/designated authority. It is submitted
that as the income had been taxed in the hands of the Main Trust, the beneficiary Trust were held
eligible for refund in the light of the above clarification of Board.
15.The learned Senior Counsel further submits that an identical submission of the respondents in
the present case was taken which was turned down by the Special Bench of the Tribunal which
decision has been now affirmed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of Gujarat High Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax v. Hirenbhai K.Patel reported in 2014 SCC OnLine Guj 15765 referred
supra.
16.Supporting the impugned order and opposing these Writ Petitions, the learned Senior Standing
Counsel for the respondents submits that the first respondent was incompetent to revise the
assessment made on 31.03.2016 under Section 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. It is submitted
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 further that the said exercise
carried out by the respondent was contrary to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court made in
the case of Goetze (India) Ltd., vs. Commissioner of Income Tax reported in (2006) 204 CTR SC
182.
17.The learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondents further submits that the Department is
also in the process of passing appropriate orders under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act against
the order passed by the first respondent under Section 154 of the Income Tax Act and therefore,
submits that the relief sought for by the petitioner cannot be entertained.
18.The learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondents further submits that though the
petitioner had settled the dispute under the Vivad se Vishwas scheme for the assessment year
2011-12, the petitioner had admitted to the tax liability during the assessment year 2014-15 by filing
the returns under Section 139 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Therefore, the question of refund of the
aforesaid amount paid during the assessment year 2014-15 cannot be straightaway allowed. It is
submitted that the order passed by the respondent under Section 154 of the Act was without
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 authority of law and there is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147292242/ 6
M/S.Ganam Homes And Estates Private ... vs The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 29 November, 2021
proposal to go for revision under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
19.It is submitted that in any event, the petitioner has an alternate remedy by way of an appeal
before the Appellate Commissioner and therefore, the petitioner should be directed to approach the
Appellate Commissioner as that would be the correct method of resolving the dispute.
20.By way of rejoinder, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above case cannot apply as the said case was rendered in the context
of peculiar facts of the aforesaid case. It is submitted that the return was filed on 30.11.1995 by the
appellant/assessee therein and on 12.01.1998, the assessee wanted to claim deduction by way of a
letter before the Assessing Officer which was disallowed by the Assessing Officer on the ground that
there was no provision for amending the return.
21.The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that in the said case the appeal filed by the
assessee was allowed and on further appeal made by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 the department, the department appeal was allowed. It is further
submitted that the decision was rendered in the context of Section 254 of the Income Tax Act and
that the said decision does not in anyway relate to the power of the Assessing Officer to entertain the
claim for revision, otherwise than by filing revised return. Therefore, the said decision is also of no
consequence.
22.The learned Senior Counsel also referred to the admission of the respondents in Paragraph 8 of
the counter wherein the respondents had categorically admitted that for the assessment year
2011-12, appropriate tax has been paid by the petitioner and therefore, there is no justification in not
refunding the amount.
23.Heard the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner and the learned Senior Standing
Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents. Perused the orders passed under Section 154 of the
Income Tax Act on 08.03.2021 for the assessment year 2014-15 and the settlement of case under the
Vivad se Vishwas scheme under VSV Act, 2020 for the Assessment Year 2011-12.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021
24.There is no dispute that the petitioner has paid the tax for the relevant assessment year viz.,
2011-12 and therefore, the protective assessment for the year 2014-15 results in excess payment of
tax. The petitioner cannot be taxed twice on the same income. Ultimately, the purpose of exercising
power under the Act is only intended to collect correct and just tax under the provisions of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 from an assessee. The Act is not intended either to collect or retain any
amount which is not due from an assessee.
25.In this connection, a reference may be made to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Unichem Laboratories Ltd vs. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay reported in (2002) 7 SCC 145
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is no part of duty of the department to levy and
collect tax which is not due to the department. Relevant passage from the said decision reads as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147292242/ 7
M/S.Ganam Homes And Estates Private ... vs The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 29 November, 2021
follows:
“12. For the aforementioned reasons, we are of the view that denial of benefit of the
notification to the appellant was unfair. There can be no doubt that the authorities
functioning under the Act must, as are in duty bound, protect the interest of the
Revenue by levying and collecting the duty in accordance
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 with law-no less
and also no more. It is no part of their duty to deprive an assessee of the benefit
available to him in law with a view to augment the quantum of duty for the benefit of
the Revenue. They must act reasonably and fairly.”
26.The above passage squarely applies to the facts of the present case as the department has also not
disputed the fact that the petitioner has settled the dispute under the Vivad se Vishwas scheme for
the assessment year 2011-12 as a consequence of which the tax offered and paid by the petitioner
during the assessment year 2014-15 had become excess.
27.That apart, under Section 237 under Chapter XIX of the Income Tax Act, there is no limitation
prescribed for granting refund of the amount paid in excess as tax. Therefore, I do not find any
merits in the submissions made by the learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondents. Therefore, these Writ Petitions deserves to be allowed.
28.These Writ Petitions are thus allowed. No costs. The respondents are directed to ascertain the
correct amount and refund the amount paid in excess for the Assessment Year 2014-15 by the
respective petitioner https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.15762 & 15763 of 2021 together
with interest preferably within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
