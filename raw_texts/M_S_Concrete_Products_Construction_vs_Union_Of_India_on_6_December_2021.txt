M/S.Concrete Products & Construction ... vs Union Of India on 6 December, 2021
PRAYER : This Petition has been filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act 1996 praying to set aside the Arbitration Award dated
03.03.2014 passed by the second Respondent in the dispute between the
Petitioner and the first Respondent.
For Petitioner : Mr.Abishek Jenasenan
for Mr.A.Jenasenan
For Respondents : Mr.C.V.Ramachandramurthy
ORDER
The claimant before the Arbitral Tribunal is the Petitioner herein. An Arbitral Award dated
03.03.2014 (the Award) is assailed.
2. An agreement was entered into between the Respondents and the Petitioner for supply of
2,94,400 numbers of pre-stressed mono block concrete sleepers (PSC Sleepers) at a price of
Rs.1194/- per unit exclusive of taxes and with price variation. The original delivery period was two
years and 37 days, i.e. from 19.11.2009 to 25.12.2011 with a permissible variation of + or – six
months as regards time and + or – 30% as regards quantity. According to the Petitioner, as regards
the Ambattur Concrete Sleepers Plant (the ABU Plant), the original monthly target was fixed at
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 10,000 numbers. Such monthly target was
reduced from time to time. For instance, the Petitioner asserts that the monthly target was reduced
to 3000 numbers by communication dated 26.07.2011 from the Respondents and to nil by
communication dated 10.11.2011. Consequently, it is contended that it was not possible to meet the
over all delivery schedule. In such circumstances, a request was made to the Respondents to consent
to the assignment of the contract to a sister concern of the Petitioner. Such request was declined.
The Respondents, however, by communication of 03.02.2012, agreed to reduce the total quantity by
30%. Eventually, by communication dated 02.11.2012, the Respondents terminated the contract
with effect from 20.10.2012 and proceeded to initiate action for the forfeiture of the security deposit
and for the imposition of liquidated damages at 5% on the value of unsupplied and undelivered
sleepers. The Petitioner herein initiated arbitral proceedings in the above facts and circumstances.
3. The Petitioner claimed a sum of Rs.4,49,90,340/- along with interest thereon amounting to
Rs.55,61,514/- up to 31.01.2013 by relying upon Sections 15 to 17 of the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Development Act, 2006(the
MSMED Act). In addition, the following relief was prayed for: a declaration that the termination of
the contract is void; for refund of the security deposit of Rs.20,00,000/- with interest thereon at
18% per annum; a perpetual injunction restraining the Respondents from recovering liquidated
damages of Rs.71,42,445/- ; and refund of a sum of Rs.16,84,809/- towards excess land licence fee
collected by the Respondents from the Petitioner.

4. The Respondents herein filed a counter along with a counter claim. By way of such counter claim,
forfeiture of the security deposit of Rs.20,00,000/-; recovery of liquidated damages of
Rs.68,16,977/-; and arbitration costs were prayed for. By the Award, the Arbitral Tribunal directed
the Respondents to make the payment of Rs.4,49,90,340/- within a period of 30 days. In the event
of default, simple interest at 7% per annum was directed to be paid. As regards termination, the
Arbitral Tribunal concluded that termination may be done only for the unsupplied quantity. The
forfeiture of the security deposit was upheld. As regards the claim for liquidated damages, the
Arbitral Tribunal concluded that liquidated damages could be levied for delayed supply of supplied
quantities, but not for unsupplied quantities.
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
5. The Petitioner assails the Award only insofar as it pertains to the refusal to award interest as per
the MSMED Act, the award of liquidated damages as regards delayed supply of supplied quantities
and the forfeiture of the security deposit.
6. The refusal to grant interest at the rates specified in the MSMED Act is assailed on the ground
that the MSMED Act confers rights on any enterprise which is registered under the said enactment
to claim interest at the rates specified therein if payments are not made within 45 days as specified
therein. By drawing reference to Section 16 of the MSMED Act, the Petitioner contends that the said
provision opens with a non-obstante clause and overrides contractual stipulations to the contrary.
By adverting to internal pages 10 and 11 of the Award, the Petitioner contends that the sole reason
assigned by the Arbitral Tribunal for rejecting the claim for interest is that the relevant contract does
not draw reference to Sections 15 to 17 of the MSMED Act. According to the Petitioner, the said
conclusion is patently illegal. In addition, the Petitioner contends that such conclusion is contrary to
public policy inasmuch as the MSMED Act was enacted to confer special benefits on MSMEs.
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7. As regards the award of liquidated damages, the Petitioner contends that the counter claim of the
Respondents was for recovery of liquidated damages at 5% of the unsupplied quantity. Such claim
was made for a sum of Rs.68,16,977/-. The Arbitral Tribunal, at internal page 87, rejected the claim
for liquidated damages with regard to unsupplied quantities by concluding that it would amount to a
double penalty in view of the termination of the contract. However, the Petitioner contends that the
Arbitral Tribunal committed a grave error in awarding liquidated damages for the alleged belated
supply of 25,945 numbers of PSC Sleepers. With regard to the forfeiture of the security deposit, the
Petitioner reiterates that the Respondents did not plead or establish loss. The Petitioner also
contends that the principles pertaining to liquidated damages would apply equally to the forfeiture
of the security deposit. Therefore, the Petitioner contends that the Award as regards forfeiture of
security deposit is unsustainable.
8. On this issue, the Petitioner relies upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kailash
Nath Associates v. DDA (2015) 4 SCC 136 (Kailash Nath) to the effect that even with regard to a
claim for _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis liquidated damages, it is necessary to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84579421/ 3
M/S.Concrete Products & Construction ... vs Union Of India on 6 December, 2021
establish the factum of loss and prove loss unless such loss is established to be impossible or difficult
to prove. In the case at hand, the Petitioner contends that the Respondents did not plead that the
loss was impossible or even difficult to prove. Indeed, it is submitted that even the factum of loss
was not pleaded by the Respondents.
9. These contentions are refuted by the Respondents. By referring to the written submissions, the
Respondents contend that the bills raised by the Petitioner could not be processed and paid on
account of the non-execution of a rider agreement to extend the terms of the agreement. The next
contention of the Respondents is that payment of interest is not permissible in terms of IRS
condition 2401. By relying upon IRS condition 2401, it is contended that the Respondents are
entitled to and exercised a lien over such amounts on account of the breach of contract by the
Petitioner and the amounts payable on such account to the Respondents.
10. With regard to the reliance on the MSMED Act, the Respondents referred to earlier orders of this
Court. By relying upon the order in Union of India v. M/s.Nellai Concrete Products, O.P.No.1022 of
2017, it is contended that the MSMED Act and the provisions relating to _____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis interest as specified therein would apply only to a reference made
before the Facilitation Council constituted under the said Act. In addition, the order of a learned
Judge in O.P.Nos.143 and 525 of 2016, which was affirmed in appeal by the Division Bench, is also
relied upon.
11. By way of a short rejoinder, the Petitioner contends that the delay in supply is irrelevant at this
juncture. As regards the non-execution of a rider agreement, the Petitioner points out that the
Arbitral Tribunal considered the said contention and rejected the same on the ground that payment
cannot be denied for non-execution of a rider agreement. As regards the judgments cited by the
Respondents, the Petitioner contends that the judgment in O.P.Nos.143 and 525 of 2016 pertained
to a security deposit and to the 75% pre-deposit requirement under the MSMED Act. Therefore, the
said judgment has no bearing on the question of payment of interest for supply of goods or services.
12. In view of the Petitioner confining the challenge to three aspects of the Award, only the said
aspects need to be discussed herein. With regard to the payment of interest on unpaid invoices, the
factual position, as on date, is that the Respondents have paid the Petitioner a sum
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of Rs.4,10,01,358/- on 31.07.2014 and a
further sum of Rs.13,64,979/- on 04.08.2014. While making such payments, the Respondents levied
and recovered a sum of Rs.24,03,208/- towards liquidated damages in terms of the Award. Thus,
any interest claim would be from the date the relevant invoices became due until the above dates of
payment thereof. This issue should be examined by bearing in mind the above factual context. The
Arbitral Tribunal considered the question of payment of interest and rejected the claim on two
grounds. First, at internal page 10 of the Award, the Arbitral Tribunal extracted IRS 2401. IRS 2401
is as under:
''IRS 2401 states that ''Whenever any claim or claims for payment of a sum of money
arises out of or under the contract against the Contractor, the purchaser shall be
entitled to withhold and also have a lien to retain such sum or sums in whole or in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84579421/ 4
M/S.Concrete Products & Construction ... vs Union Of India on 6 December, 2021
part from the security, if any, deposited by the Contractor and for the purpose
aforesaid, the purchaser shall be entitled to withhold the said cash security deposit or
the security, if any, furnished as the case may be and also have a lien over the same
pending finalisation or adjudication of any such claim. In the event of the security
being insufficient to cover the claimed amount or amounts or _____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis if no security has been taken from the Contractor,
the purchaser shall be entitled to withhold and have lien to retain to the extent of the
such claimed amount or amounts referred to supra, from any sum of sums found
payable or which at any time thereafter may become payable to the Contractor under
the same contract or any other contract with the Purchaser or the Government
pending finalisation or adjudication of any such claim.
It is an agreed term of the contract that the sum of money or moneys so withheld or
retained under the lien referred to above, by the Purchaser will be kept withheld or
retained as such by the Purchaser till the claim arising out of or under the contract is
determined by the Arbitrator(if the contract is governed by the arbitration clause) or
by the competent court as prescribed under clause 2703 hereinafter provided, as the
case may be, and that contractor will have no claim for interest or damages
whatsoever on any account in respect of such withholding or retention under the lien
referred to supra and duly notified as such to the Contractor.'' (emphasis added).
13. On perusal of IRS 2401, it is evident that a lien may be exercised provided the
exercise of lien is duly notified to the contractor.
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis From the documentary evidence placed before
the Arbitral Tribunal, it appears that no such notification was made by the Respondents to the
Petitioner. This aspect was not discussed by the Arbitral Tribunal. Secondly, the Arbitral Tribunal
noticed that the relevant contract does not refer to the MSMED Act, and, on such basis, a conclusion
was drawn that the MSMED Act is not applicable to the contract. Given the fact that the MSMED
Act is a statute, it is not necessary for such statute to be incorporated by reference into the contract
between the parties. While there could be other reasons for not applying the MSMED Act to the
present dispute, the Arbitral Award does not discuss anything other than the non-citing of the
provisions of the MSMED Act in the relevant contract. Therefore, the conclusion on this aspect is
not sustainable and is liable to be interfered with. A claim for interest is grounded in facts inasmuch
as the said claim would run from the date the relevant amount became payable and extend up to the
date when payment was made. Therefore, if a claim for interest is to be made by the Petitioner
herein, such claim would have to be made in de novo proceedings for such purpose.
_____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
14. Turning to the question of the grant of liquidated damages, a claim for damages involves four
elements: a breach of contract; the occurrence of loss; the causal link between the breach and such
loss; and proof of the quantum of loss. In the context of liquidated damages, a minor qualification is
made with regard to proof of quantum of loss. Starting with the judgment in Maula Bux v. Union of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84579421/ 5
M/S.Concrete Products & Construction ... vs Union Of India on 6 December, 2021
India, (1969) 2 SCC 554 and, thereafter, in the more recent judgment in Kailash Nath, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court concluded that the person claiming liquidated damages should discharge the burden
of either proving actual loss or establishing that such loss is impossible or difficult to prove given the
nature of the contract. After considering the line of judgments on this issue, in 3i Infotech Limited v.
Tamil Nadu e-Government Agency and another 2020 (4) CTC 673, I had formulated the applicable
principles in this regard in paragraph 23, which reads as under:
'' 23.The following principles emerge upon consideration of the judgments on
liquidated damages and penalty and from the foregoing analysis:
(i) Section 74 of the Contract Act provides for two categories of stipulated payments
for breach: (a) a sum named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of
breach, which _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis could be called
stipulated compensation; and (b) stipulations by way of penalty.
(ii) The principal difference between English law and Indian law, in this regard, is
that a stipulation by way of penalty is unenforceable under English law whereas it is
enforceable under Indian law.
(iii) In both categories of stipulated payments under section 74, the sum stipulated
operates as the maximum amount or ceiling. In this respect also, the two categories
are similar.
(iv) The term or label used, namely, liquidated damages, penalty or even price
reduction, in the relevant clause, is not conclusive or determinative. However, it
cannot be disregarded and the person contending that the label or term used is not
the correct term would be required to discharge the burden of establishing the said
assertion.
(v) The primary test for identifying and distinguishing between liquidated damages
and penalty clauses is whether, when tested as of contract formation, the stipulated
sum bears a reasonable correlation to anticipated loss; if so, it would be construed as
a liquidated damages clause and, if not, as a penalty clause. A stipulated sum that
bears such reasonable correlation to anticipated loss is considered as a genuine pre-
estimate of loss.
(vi) As regards enforcement, the two categories are treated differently. In case the
court concludes that the stipulated payment is a genuine pre-estimate of anticipated
loss in case of breach, the sum stipulated would be ordered to be paid if the court also
concludes that it is difficult or impossible to prove loss in the facts and
circumstances. Such pre-estimate is to be made at _____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the time of contract formation although evidence
thereof may be adduced when there is a dispute.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84579421/ 6
M/S.Concrete Products & Construction ... vs Union Of India on 6 December, 2021
(vii) Even if the court concludes that the stipulated compensation is a genuine
pre-estimate of loss, the party claiming such compensation is required to prove that
loss was incurred as a consequence of breach and what is dispensed with is the
obligation to prove the loss accurately by also proving quantum of loss as per the
claim. To put it differently, even in such a situation, a claim cannot be sustained in an
injuria sine damnum scenario.
(viii) If it is not difficult or impossible to prove loss, the person claiming liquidated
damages is required to prove loss, including the quantum of loss, even if the sum
stipulated is a genuine pre-estimate and, therefore, qualifies as a claim for liquidated
damages. In contrast with the contract formation stage evidence with regard to
genuine pre-estimate, needless to say, actual loss would be required to be proved
with reference to the breach and the direct consequences flowing therefrom.
(ix) Given the fact that a party claiming liquidated damages cannot claim more than
the stipulated sum, once such party establishes that the stipulated compensation is a
genuine pre-estimate, a high standard of proof would not be insisted upon to prove
difficulty or impossibility of proving loss. In other words, the court would bear in
mind that parties negotiated and concluded the contract on the basis of risk
allocation, whereby the party claiming liquidated damages forecloses the possibility
of claiming an amount higher than the sum stipulated, by way of proving higher
actual loss, so as to enjoy the benefit of the relative ease and certainty of establishing
a claim for liquidated _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis damages
as opposed to a claim for unliquidated damages.
(x) On the contrary, if it is concluded that the stipulation is by way of penalty, the
person claiming such penalty would be required to prove loss accurately, including
the quantum of loss, and claim reasonable compensation on that basis.''
15. The Respondents herein did not plead that they suffered loss in their counter statement cum
counter claim before the Arbitral Tribunal, and no evidence of loss was adduced. Needless to say,
the Respondents did not plead that the loss was impossible or difficult to prove in light of the nature
of the contract.
16. The conclusions of the Arbitral Tribunal should be examined in the above factual context. At
internal page 12 of the Award, the Arbitral Tribunal recorded its conclusion that liquidated damages
are leviable for 25,945 numbers of PSC Sleepers, which were supplied belatedly. Before arriving at
such conclusion, in a table at paragraph 3 of the Award, the Arbitral Tribunal set out the dates of
supply of specific quantities and held that liquidated damages are applicable for the quantity
supplied belatedly. There is no consideration of the question whether the Respondents suffered loss
as a result of belated supply and, most certainly, no discussion or _____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis conclusion with regard to the quantum of loss and the proof
thereof in the Award. Thus, the award of liquidated damages is completely unsustainable in light of
the law laid down in such regard. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held in Fateh Chand v. Balkishan Das,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84579421/ 7
M/S.Concrete Products & Construction ... vs Union Of India on 6 December, 2021
AIR 1963 SC 1405, that forfeiture of any amount deposited under the contract should satisfy the
requirements of Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Except for recording that the supply
was belated and drawing reference to paragraph 0504 of IRS condition and Clause 8.4 of the
contract, the Award contains no discussion on loss in the context of forfeiture of security deposit
too. These conclusions qualify as being patently illegal. Consequently, the Award merits interference
under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
17. The settled legal position is that an Arbitral Award can be severed and upheld in part while being
set aside in part. However, such Award cannot be modified under Section 34.
18. For reasons set out above, O.P.No.185 of 2021 is allowed by setting aside the Award as regards
the refusal to grant interest as per the _____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis MSMED
Act and as regards the grant of liquidated damages and forfeiture of security deposit. However, it is
made clear that nothing in this order should be construed as a finding that the Petitioner is entitled
to interest as per the MSMED Act. As a corollary, it is open to the Petitioner to institute de novo
arbitral proceedings in such regard in accordance with the relevant contract. If such proceedings are
instituted, the Petitioner shall be entitled to the benefit of Section 43(4) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996. Consequently, connected applications are closed.
