JUDGMENT
Per Oswal-J
1. There are mainly two groups of petitioners before this Court. One group comprises the petitioners
in WP(C) 905/2021& WP(C) 1973/2021,who are the appointees of the year 1992, though they
entered the feeding services of the Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Service(JKAS) through
Combined Competitive Examination held between 1980-1982. The other group comprises the
petitioners in WP(C) No. 865/2021, WP(C) No. 941/2023, WP(C) No. 784/2021, WP(C) No.
2720/2022, WP(C) No. 942/2023, WP(C) No. 962/2023, WP(C) No. 1073/2021 and WP(C) No.
961/2023, who are the appointees of the feeding services of JKAS of the year 1999. The learned
Central Administrative Tribunal has decided all the application/petitions filed by the appointees of
the years 1992 & 1999 a/w connected matters by a common judgment dated 30.02.2021 even
though the appointees of the year 1992 had raised additional grounds other than the ones urged by
the appointees of the year 1999 that were not considered by the learned Tribunal.
2. WP(C) No.1973/2021 has been filed by the petitioner, who was inducted in JKAS by selection
from officers of Technical Services in the year 2012. Though the subject matter of this writ petition
is the order dated 15.04.2021 but the order dated 30.03.2021 has formed the basis for passing of
order dated 15.04.2021.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 2
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
3. In all these petitions, the petitioners are aggrieved of the order dated 30.03.2021 passed by the
learned Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) Jammu Bench, whereby the applications/petitions
filed by the petitioners challenging the Final Seniority list dated 24.06.2011, were dismissed and
Rule 15(4) of the Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Service Rules (for short the 'Rules of 2008')
and Clause(i) of Proviso thereto, were held to be illegal and contrary to law.
4. In the writ petitions bearing Nos. WP(C) No. 2774/2023, WP(C) No. 895/2023 and WP(C) No.
1182/2023, impugned is the order dated 25.01.2023 passed by the learned Tribunal, whereby the
application filed by the private respondents was allowed and seniority list dated 07.04.2021 issued
by the official respondents was quashed and the seniority of the private respondents as fixed in the
seniority list dated 24.06.2011 was restored.
a/w connected matters
5. We propose to dispose of all these connected petitions by a common judgment though we will be
dealing with the additional grounds urged by the petitioners who are the appointees of the year 1992
separately. Factual matrix:
6. The petitioners have sought quashing of order dated 30.03.2021 and also quashing of the
subsequent orders issued by the official respondents from time to time including SO No. 133 dated
15.04.2021 by virtue of which Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 has been omitted. A further relief has
also been sought by the petitioners to direct the official respondents to maintain the seniority of all
the officers strictly in accordance with the tentative seniority list of 2010 issued vide order dated
485-GAD of 2010 dated 21.04.2010. The petitioners have also sought a direction upon the official
respondents to review the omission of Rule 15(4) of the Rule of 2008 and further that the official
respondents be directed to enforce the said rule.
7. The grievance projected by the petitioners in these petitions is that vacancies to the Time Scale
posts of JKAS from the year 2004 to 2007 were available but were filled up only in the year 2008
through the medium of various orders. After those orders were issued, the Government issued SRO
386 of GAD dated 01.12.2008 nomenclated as the Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Service
Rules, 2008, thereby repealing the Rules of 1979. After the New Rules came into force, the
respondent Nos. 1 and 2 vide Government order No.485-GAD of 2010 dated 21.04.2010 issued the
tentative seniority a/w connected matters list of Time Scale Officers of JKAS appointed to the
services against the vacancies, which were available with effect from 01.04.2004 till 31.12.2008. The
said tentative seniority list was objected to by some of the members of the Time Scale of JKAS and
the Government vide order No. 1076-GAD of 2010 constituted a committee of three officers to
examine the issue and consider the representations. The said Committee submitted its report on
15.02.2011 and on 24.06.2011 the Government issued the final seniority list vide order No. 743-GAD
of 2011 dated 24.06.2011. Some of the members including the petitioners herein assailed the
seniority list issued vide order No. 743- GAD of 2011 dated 24.06.2011 through the medium of
various writ petitions which were transferred to the learned Central Administrative Tribunal. When
SRO 386 of 2008 was issued by the Government, some members of the service also assailed the said
SRO through the medium of other writ petitions. Ultimately, all the writ petitions were transferred
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 3
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
to the Tribunal and the learned Tribunal vide its judgment dated 30.03.2021 disposed of all the
petitions in the manner as mentioned above.
8. Precisely, the contentions of the petitioners are that the Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 was
provided to undo the injustice meted out to them by not filling the vacancies, which arose in the year
2004-2008 and further that they are entitled to be inducted into Time Scale of JKAS from the date,
the vacancies were available, meaning thereby a/w connected matters that they are entitled to
retrospective promotion from the date, vacancies arose for their services.
9. The petitioners/appointees of 1992 Batch, besides raising the grounds as narrated above, have
also submitted that in terms of Rules of 1979, the petitioners had completed their five years' service
in the relevant pay scale and had thus acquired eligibility for induction into the Time Scale of JKAS
between the years 1997 to 2008. Induction from the Revenue Service (one of the feeding services)
into JKAS took place in the year 1997 and thereafter in the year, 2008. No officer from the Revenue
Gazetted Service, though eligible under Rules, was inducted into Administrative Service after 1997
and before 2008. During that period, the Selection Committee constituted under Rule 6 of the Rules
of 1979 met during the years, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 but it did not consider
any of the members of the Revenue Gazetted Service for appointment to the JKAS. In the year,
2004, many officers of the other feeding services came to be inducted in the Time Scale of JKAS vide
Government order dated 24.01.2004 but the petitioners were not considered for induction into
Administrative Service though all the petitioners were eligible, and slots were also available in the
Administrative Service. It is also stated that in the year 2002, the counsel for the Government on
30.06.2002 had submitted before the Division Bench of this Court in LPA No. 412/2001 that 120
vacancies were available in the Administrative Service out of which 18 posts fell to the share of
Revenue Gazetted Service and the a/w connected matters Division Bench after taking note of the
submissions made by the Government counsel, permitted the official respondents to go ahead with
the induction into JKAS and to consider the appellants therein irrespective of their seniority but on
their own merit and it was also directed that the consideration of the Revenue Gazetted Service be
kept in a sealed cover till further orders. The official respondents did not bother to comply the order
of the Court and as such, no consideration was accorded to the members of Revenue Gazetted
Service. The petitioners were ultimately considered and appointed in the Time Scale of JKAS vide
Government order dated 22.07.2008. It is also urged by the petitioners that they were sanctioned to
hold the charge of Assistant Commissioners, SDMs and Collectors etc. which posts fall in the cadre
of JKAS and they were holding the charge of these posts from 2004/2005 and as such, in any case,
they are entitled to claim their seniority from the date they were holding the charge of cadre posts.
10. The official respondents have filed the response stating therein that the validity of the seniority
list issued by the official respondents has rightly been determined by the Central Administrative
Tribunal and the same has been implemented by the Government in letter and spirit, as such, the
present petitions are not maintainable. It is stated that the petitioners were appointed in terms of
Rules of 1979. The Government initiated the process of induction of eligible officers of 15 services to
the JKAS in respect of the appointees of 1999 Batch as per a/w connected matters availability of
slots earmarked for each feeding service and as per their eligibility. Rules 5(3) and 6 of the 1979
Rules provide for selection committee to prepare a select list for appointment to the Time Scale on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 4
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
the basis of merit and suitability as provided under Rule 8 of the Rules of 1979. During the years
2005, 2006 and 2007, the induction of officers of the various departmental feedings services of the
year 1999 against the slots which became available from 2004 onwards could not be considered on
account of various reasons mostly procedural in nature and during that period, neither the officers
of the 1999 Batch nor the officers from subsequent Batch of 2001, though they had acquired
eligibility in the year 2006, were inducted in to Time Scale of JKAS. The Government after following
due procedure and recommendations of the Selection Committee appointed the officers of 1999
Batch to the Time Scale of JKAS in terms of 1979 Rules, however, the Government issued orders
with regard to the promotion of some of the officers of the 1999 Batch, even though enough
vacancies/slots were not available at the relevant point of time. This was done to protect the
interests of those officers, who would have otherwise become junior to the officers of the subsequent
batches of the feeding services and the Government decided to utilise the leave/reserve
vacancies/slots and some anticipated slots, which would have accrued in the year 2008 i.e. till
01.01.2009. The decision was taken to avoid "lag behind class of officers of 1999 Batch", otherwise
juniors would have taken march over the senior officers being eligible a/w connected matters
against the vacancies. A tentative seniority list of 239 officers appointed to the Time Scale of the
JKAS between 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2008 was notified vide Government order dated 21.04.2010. 110
representations were received against the said tentative seniority list wherein substantial issues
were raised. The Government appointed three members committee headed by Sh. Samuel Varghese
IAS vide Government order dated 24.09.2010. The said Committee submitted its report alongwith
recommendations to the Government on 15.02.2011. While the issue of finalising the seniority list
was under
active consideration with the General Administrative Department, some officers
approached this Court through SWP No. 1215/2011, wherein an interim order was
passed, and the respondents therein were directed to consider the case of the
petitioners therein for fixation of their seniority in terms of Rule 15(4) of the Rules of
2008. In compliance to the aforesaid directions of this Court, it was decided that the
petitioners, who were appointed to the Time Scale of JKAS under the Rules of 1979
and not under the Rules of 2008, would be entitled to seniority in terms of Rules of
1979 and not in terms of Rules of 2008. Thereafter, a final seniority list of officers
was issued vide Government order No. 743-GAD of 2011 dated 24.06.2011, which was
issued without prejudice to the cases of the officer/officers pending in any court of
law.
11. The official respondents have given the details of litigations which may not be
relevant for the purpose of consideration of the present a/w connected matters
controversy. It is also the stand of the official respondents that it is not mandatory for
the Government to set up a selection committee for each calendar year for preparing
a select list for promotion to the Time Scale level post. As per Rule 6 of the Rules of
1979, it is for the Government to constitute a selection committee on every
occasion/every time whenever it deems fit. The discretion is always with the
Government to constitute a selection committee whenever an occasion arises, but
whenever the selection committee is constituted and meets, it will prepare a select list
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 5
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
of all vacancies available on the day of its meeting. Occasion arose in the year, 2008
when the selection committee met. The selected candidate cannot have any plea of
retrospective promotion from the date on which the slots/vacancies were available
for their feeding cadre in the earlier /preceding calendar years and it is the discretion
of the Government to fill up the vacancies occurred in any preceding or earlier
calendar year. The promoted member shall have the claim for the post on the date
when he joins the said post and not from the date on which the said vacancy arose for
their feeding service.
12. The official respondents have objected the claim of the petitioners, who are
appointees of 1992, on the ground that the petitioners were appointed in the year
1992 after the judgment was passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court and thereafter the
appointees of 1992 including the petitioners initiated the second round of litigation
for fixation of their seniority retrospectively i.e. the date from which the candidates
who qualified the a/w connected matters Combined Competitive Examination 1981
were appointed to service.
The Division Bench of this Court on 02.06.1999 decided the aforesaid controversy by a common
judgment and the petitioners were held entitled to claim notional seniority with effect from the date
the other direct recruits came to be appointed i.e. 24.09.1984. The aforesaid judgment of the
Division Bench was assailed before Hon'ble the Apex Court and Hon'ble the Apex Court vide its
judgment dated 26.02.2003 upheld the judgment of the Division Bench and in compliance to the
same, the seniority of the petitioners was fixed with effect from 24.09.1984. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in its judgment dated 26.02.2003 had also ordered that no such seniority shall disturb the
promotions effected in the service with effect from 14.09.1984 till the issuance of the order including
the promotions made to JKAS. Thereafter, a third round of litigation was initiated by the direct
recruits of the Revenue Gazetted Service challenging the grant of notional seniority with effect from
24.09.1984 to the petitioners and all the petitions and appeals related to the matter were clubbed by
the Division Bench of this Court and finally disposed of on 21.09.2006, whereby various directions
were issued thereby upholding the claim of the direct recruits to the substantive seniority with all
consequential benefits with effect from 24.09.1984. The said judgment was assailed by the
Government before the Hon'ble Apex Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court set aside the directions
issued by the Division Bench and observed that though the dispute of seniority was confined mainly
to J&K a/w connected matters Revenue (Gazetted) Service but directions of the High Court would
unsettle the long settled positions and cause dislocation across the board in all services, even when
there was no controversy earlier and the Hon'ble Apex Court upheld the decision of the Government
qua the seniority of the direct recruits and promotees as settled in terms of order dated 04.09.2003.
The seniority of the direct recruits including the petitioners in the J&K Revenue (Gazetted) Service
was under
adjudication, as such, they could not be considered for induction into the Time Scale
of JKAS but was lastly settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is stand of the official
respondents that once the issue of seniority at the level of J&K Revenue Gazetted
Service stands settled by the Supreme Court, the reference to any claim on that aspect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 6
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
is thus misconceived. The official respondents have stated that as required in terms
of Rule 7 of JKAS Rules of 1979, the proposal of the eligible member of the service for
appointment by promotion to Time Scale of the JKAS was not received from the
Revenue Department considering the seniority dispute between the members of the
service, however, in the year, 2008, a proposal on the basis of the seniority issued in
year 2007 vide Government order dated 18.04.2007 was received and accordingly,
the members of the service were included in the select list by the selection committee.
It is also stated that pending disposal of the writ petitions filed by the two groups of
the petitioners, High Court on 30.09.2000 passed an interim direction allowing the
Government to make appointments/promotions on officiating basis in order to run
the a/w connected matters administration and Government offices. All the writ
petitions were disposed of by the learned Single Judge on 08.11.2013 and liberty was
granted to the petitioners claiming induction against the slots of years 2004, 2005,
2006 and 2007 to seek review of their appointments by filing formal review petitions
before the concerned authorities in terms of proviso (i) of sub-rule (4) of Rule 15 of
the Rules of 2008 with a direction to the Government to consider their review
petitions and dispose of the same in light of the observations made by the learned
Single Judge in its judgment. The Government filed Letters Patent Appeal bearing
No. 20/2014 against the judgment, as did the 49 persons inducted against
leave/training reserve, who were also aggrieved of the judgment and appeals were
finally decided by the Division Bench vide judgment dated 18.04.2016 whereby the
judgment of the Single Judge was set aside, and the matter was remanded back for
fresh adjudication. When the matter was pending consideration before the Court, the
Government constituted a committee vide Government order No. 203-GAD of 2017
dated 20.02.2017 for suggesting a road map for resolving the seniority issue of the
members of JKAS. The Committee submitted a report on 31.03.2017 which was
found to be inconclusive and accordingly, a new Committee was constituted vide
Government order dated 01.04.2020 to examine the seniority issue of the members
of the JKAS appointed to the Time Scale of the service between 01.01.2004 to
01.12.2008. The Committee submitted it report on 16.05.2020 which was accepted
by the competent authority. The final seniority list was placed before the
Establishment-
a/w connected matters cum-Selection Committee in its meeting on 22.06.2020 for consideration
and for making recommendations in the matter. Establishment-cum- Selection Committee
accordingly considered and recommended the redrawn seniority of the members of JKAS appointed
between 01.01.2004 to 01.12.2008. The recommendations of the Establishment- cum-Selection
Committee were approved by the competent authority for notification of draft/redrawn seniority list
of the members of the JKAS appointed to the service between 01.04.2004 to 01.12.2008. Various
objections were received against the draft of redrawn seniority and while the process of examining
the representation was under consideration, the aforesaid seniority list was also challenged before
the learned Tribunal in OA 94/2020 and OA No. 95/2020 and in TA No. 3481/2020, wherein the
validity of Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 was also challenged. It is stand of the officials
respondents that the seniority list of 2011 issued vide Government order No. 743-GAD of 2011 dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 7
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
24.06.2011 is in accordance with the rules as well as general principles of reckoning of the seniority,
except to the extent of modifying the seniority for placing the appointees/promotes against leave
and training vacancies/anticipated vacancies etc. below those who were promoted/appointed
against regular vacancies.
13. The petitioners who are the appointees of year 1992 batch have filed the rejoinder stating therein
that the petitioners for the first time were placed in the Time Scale of JKAS under Rules of 1979 in
the year, 2008 and thereafter placed in the Selection Scale in the year, 2011 and 2013. The a/w
connected matters petitioners have mentioned the pensionary benefits being received by them and
have stated that the candidates who were offered employment in the year 1984 are receiving
pensionary benefits either in Super Time Scale of JKAS or as IAS retirees and their pensionary
benefits are much higher than what is being paid to the petitioners. It is further stated that in order
to do justice, supernumerary posts will have to be created in various scales in recognition of the
rights of the petitioners and the placement of the petitioners be accordingly made so that no benefit
legally available to the petitioners and enforceable in law is denied there to.
ARGUMENTS:
14. Mr. Z. A. Shah, learned Senior Counsel appearing for petitioners, who are the appointees of
1992, has argued that the Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 was meant to do justice with the
petitioners as despite eligibility and availability of vacancies/slots for their respective feeding
departmental services, they were not inducted to the Time Scale of JKAS with effect from the years
2004-2007. He has further argued that the official respondents did not comply with the directions
issued by the Division Bench in the year, 2002 for keeping the seniority in a sealed cover and further
that the petitioners of 1992 Batch had been working against the posts meant for the JKAS from the
years 2004-2005 and even if the Rule 15 (4) of the Rules of 2008 is ignored, still the petitioners can
be granted the benefit of seniority from the date they were working on cadre posts, though on
incharge a/w connected matters basis. Mr. Shah has also placed much reliance upon the judgments
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in cases of State of J&K v. Javed Iqbal Balwan1, and Suraj
Prakash Gupta and others v State of J&K and others2.
15. Mr. R. A. Jan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for some of the petitioners, who are the
appointees of 1992, has argued that the fault, if any, was of the official respondents that they did not
make any induction into the Time Scale of JKAS and the petitioners, who are similarly situated to
their counterparts of other feeding services to the JKAS and were selected pursuant to the same
selection process, have been discriminated and the discrimination is writ large in the pensionary
benefits being received by them. He has placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in P.N. Premachandran v. State of Kerala3.
16. Mr. M. Y. Bhat learned Senior Counsel appearing for some of the petitioners, besides reiterating
the submissions made by Mr. Shah, learned Senior Counsel, has drawn the attention of this Court
towards the minutes of the meetings of the various meetings to demonstrate that the vacancies were
available for the petitioners right from the years 2004-2007 and the petitioners were eligible for
induction to the Time Scale of JKAS from the date of acquiring of their eligibility but the official
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 8
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
respondents did not make any induction for the years 2004 (2009) 4 SCC 529 (2000) 7 SCC561
(2004) 1 SCC 245 a/w connected matters to 2007, as a result of which, the petitioners have been
deprived of their valuable right to a higher post when they were possessing the requisite eligibility
and the slots for their respective feeder services were also available. Mr. Bhat has relied upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case 'Vijay Singh Charak v. Union of India' 4 to
substantiate that the official respondents could not have clubbed the vacancies for the various years
for the purpose of issuance of common seniority list and the seniority of the petitioners is to be
reckoned from the date when the vacancy had arisen subject to the fulfilment of other eligibility
conditions. Mr. Bhat has further argued that the private respondents, namely, Dr. Ghulam Nabi and
Mr. Tarik Ahmed Ganie have no locus to question the entitlement of the seniority of the petitioners,
namely, Mukhtar Ahmed and Rajesh Kumar Shawan with effect from the year 2006 and 2007
respectively as both the private respondents had not acquired the eligibility for induction into the
Time Scale of JKAS in the year 2006 and 2007. He has further argued that Mohd. Issac Shah and
Pankaj Mangotra also have no locus standi to question the validity of Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008
as their quota in the Time Scale of JKAS stood already exhausted.
17. Mr. Sunil Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for some of the petitioners and other counsels have also
argued on similar lines. (2007) 9 SCC 743 a/w connected matters
18. Per contra, Mr. Amit Gupta, learned AAG appearing for the official respondents has argued that
the benefit of seniority cannot be granted to the petitioners retrospectively in absence of any such
Rule in the Rules of 1979 and so far as Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 is concerned, it stands
omitted vide SO. No.13 dated 15.04.2021.He has further argued that the Government has accepted
the judgment of the learned CAT. He has placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in State of Uttranchal and another v Dinesh Kumar Sharma5.
19. Mr. Ravinder Gupta, learned AAG has argued that in case of the petitioners, who are the
appointees of 1992 batch, the controversy stands already settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India and now, the petitioners cannot raise the issue of discrimination vis-a-vis their counterparts
from other feeding services.
20. Mr. Jahangir Iqbal Ganie, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the private respondents has
argued that the Rules of 2008 were put into operation with effect from 01.12.2008 and the
petitioners as well as private respondents were inducted into Time Scale of JKAS prior to
01.12.2008 and by operation of the Rules of 2008, the rights which had vested with private
respondents were taken away by Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 and proviso (i) to the said Rule,
which vested the power with the Government to grant the benefit of seniority to the eligible
members of the service from the date of availability of the (2007) 1SCC 683 a/w connected matters
vacancies. He has placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in

22. The Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Service Rules of 1979 (for short 'the Rules of 1979')
provide that Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Service (for short 'the JKAS') shall comprise of
following scales of pay:
(i) Super time Scale
(ii) Special Scale
(iii) Selection Grade
(iv) Time Scale
(v) Junior Scale
23. In terms of Rule 5(3) of the Rules of 1979, out of total vacancies to Time Scale posts occurring in
a calendar year, 65% of the vacancies are required to be filled by promotion from departmental
feeding services, 10% of the vacancies are to be filled up by a selection from amongst the persons of
outstanding ability and merit serving in connection with the affairs of the State, in
departments/services but not from amongst the members of the feeding services and remaining
25% of the vacancies are required to be filled up by promotion of the Junior Scale JKAS officers,
subject to their eligibility after completion of 4 years of service.
2017 AIR SC 5101 a/w connected matters
24. The petitioners before this Court are the members of the feeding services, who were promoted to
the Time Scale of JKAS on various dates. The petitioner in WP(C) No.1973/2021 has been selected
from the service other than the feeding services in terms of 10% vacancies as mentioned above. A
member of Junior Scale of JKAS is to be appointed by the direct recruitment. In terms of Rule 3(4)
of the Rules of 1979, a member of the junior scale of JKAS and a member from feeding services can
be promoted to the Time Scale of the JKAS, subject to the various conditions including the one that
the post in the Time Scale of the JKAS for the relevant service is available. There are 16 feeding
services, the members of which are eligible to be promoted to the Time Scale in terms of Rule 3 (4)
of the Rules of the 1979.
25. The main common grievance projected by the petitioners in the present petitions is that after
rendering the requisite period of service in the feeding services to the Time Scale of JKAS, the
petitioners became eligible for promotion to the Time Scale of JKAS and despite the availability of
the slots for their respective services in the Time Scale of JKAS, the petitioners were not promoted
and to undo the injustice meted out to the petitioners, the Government came up with the Rules of
2008 more particularly the Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 and Clause-(i) of proviso thereof.
26. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the learned Tribunal had framed the following
issues for its adjudication:
a/w connected matters
(i) Whether the final seniority list dated 24.06.2011, suffers from any legal or factual
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 10
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
infirmity;
(ii) Whether the KAS 2008 Rules, would cover the State of affairs that existed before
they came into force;
(iii) Whether Rule 15(4) and clause(i) of the proviso thereof are legally valid; or
whether they are liable to be set aside;
(iv) Whether the exercise undertaken by the Government in constituting a committee
and publishing a further separate seniority list in 2020 is valid and legal; or
(v) Whether leave vacancies can be treated as Part of cadre.
27. The learned Tribunal while upholding the validity of final seniority list of 2011 held that the
Rules of 2008 will apply only to the inductions made into the JKAS after 01.12.2008 and declared
Rule 15(4) of Rules of 2008 and Clause-(i) of the proviso thereof as illegal and contrary to law. So far
as issue No. (v) is concerned, the learned Tribunal observed that Rules of 1979 did not provide for
inclusion of any leave or training vacancy for the purpose of promotion, but the
promotions/appointments so made cannot be treated as invalid and as such, appointees/promotees
cannot be placed above those who were appointed/promoted against regular vacancies. Common
issues for adjudication:
28. First, we propose to deal with the common issues involved in these petitions filed by the
petitioners who are appointees of the year 1999 and 1992.
Issue No. 1:
Whether rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 and Clause-(i) of the proviso thereof is illegal
as it snatches away the vested right in favour of some a/w connected matters
members of the service vis-a -vis other members who were inducted into JKAS
against the vacancies of the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007?
Issue No. 2:
If the answer to issue No. 1 is not in affirmative, whether the petitioners can be
granted the benefit of promotion from the date when the vacancy had arisen for their
respective departmental feeding services in the Time Scale of JKAS?
29. Whether rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 and Clause-(i) of the proviso thereof is illegal as it
snatches away the vested right in favour of some members of the service vis-a-vis other members
who were inducted into JKAS against the vacancies of the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007?
It would be proper to extract the Rule 15(4) and Clause (i) of proviso of Rules of 2008, which are as
under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 11
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
"15(4) Where select list cannot be prepared for the members of any departmental
feeding service in any particular calendar year despite availability of vacancies owing
to the procedural delay, such members, when finally included in the select list at any
later date, shall be appointed to the service from the date on which the vacancy was
allocated to such feeding service. Provided that
(i) cases of persons appointed against the vacancies of 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007
shall be reviewed in terms of sub-rule (4) above if their appointment has taken place
at a subsequent date."
30. This is an admitted fact that the petitioners as well as the private respondents were inducted
into the Time Scale of JKAS prior to 01.12.2008, when the Rules of 2008 were put into operation
thereby repealing the Rules of 1979, meaning thereby that the petitioners were a/w connected
matters inducted into Time Scale of JKAS under the Rules of 1979. It is the case of the petitioners
that they were eligible for induction to the Time Scale of JKAS for the vacancies in the year 2004 to
2007 as per the slots available for their services but the petitioners were not inducted into the Time
Scale of JKAS and were inducted into the Time Scale of JKAS only in the year 2008. So far as Rules
of 1979 are concerned, there is absolutely no provision prescribing the reckoning of date of
induction/promotion to the Time Scale of JKAS from the date of availability of vacancy in the Time
Scale of JKAS for the relevant feeding departmental services, when the candidate is promoted in any
year subsequent to the availability of vacancy where select list in any calendar year could not be
prepared due to procedural delay. Clause
(i) of proviso to Rule 15(4) of Rules of 2008 provided that the cases of persons appointed against the
vacancies of the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 shall be reviewed in terms of sub-rule (4) if their
appointments have taken place at a subsequent date. In fact, this provision vests the power with the
Government to review the appointment of the petitioners in the Time Scale of JKAS, if they are
inducted in the Time Scale of JKAS against the vacancies for the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007
but from a date subsequent to the availability of vacancies for their respective feeding services in the
Time Scale of JKAS. The practical effect of this sub-rule and proviso thereof is that some appointees
of 1999 Batch inducted/promoted against the vacancies/slots of the year-2004, 2005, 2006 and a/w
connected matters 2007 would figure higher in the seniority list of Time Scale posts of JKAS than
the others, who were inducted against the vacancies of the year-2008, though all of them got
inducted in to Time Scale of JKAS in same calendar year. But for this sub-rule and proviso thereof,
some members of time scale of JKAS, who though are inducted against the vacancies of 2004, 2005,
2006 and 2007 may figure below the other members appointed against the vacancies of 2008. The
operation of Rules of 2008 provides the benefit of appointment to the members of the Time Scale of
JKAS, who were inducted into the JKAS for the vacancies of the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007
vis-a-vis the members of Time Scale of JKAS appointed against the vacancies of 2008, from the date
of availability of vacancies and not from the date of order of appointment. In absence of this
sub-rule and proviso thereof, they would not get any benefit, and they may figure lower in the
seniority list against the other members of the service inducted into JKAS even against the vacancies
for the year, 2008. All the orders of the promotions of the petitioners into Time Scale of JKAS were
issued in the year, 2008 but prior to 01.12.2008. In this view of the matter, Rule 15(4) of the Rules
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 12
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
of 2008 and Clause (i) of the proviso to the above Rule would snatch away the vested right in favour
of the private respondents. This Court is of the considered view that as the petitioners were
appointed/inducted in to Time Scale posts of JKAS under the Rules of 1979, so they were required to
be governed by the Rules of 1979 only. Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008 a/w connected matters and
Clause (i) of the proviso, in fact had the effect of taking away the vested right of some of the
members of the service and as such, the same is illegal.
31. In the above context, it would be beneficial to take note of the observations of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in 'V. Vincent Velankanni v. Union of India'7, which are as under:
"43. If a Government Order is treated to be in the nature of a clarification of an
earlier Government Order, it may be made applicable retrospectively. Conversely, if a
subsequent Government Order is held to be a modification/amendment of the earlier
Government Order, its application would be prospective as retrospective application
thereof would result in withdrawal of vested rights which is impermissible in law and
the same may also entail recoveries to be made. The principles in this regard were
culled out by this Court in a recent judgment of Sree Sankaracharya University of
Sanskrit v. Dr. Manu, in the following terms:--
"52. From the aforesaid authorities, the following principles could be culled out:
i) If a statute is curative or merely clarificatory of the previous law, retrospective
operation thereof may be permitted.
ii) In order for a subsequent order/provision/amendment to be considered as
clarificatory of the previous law, the pre-
amended law ought to have been vague or ambiguous. It is only when it would be impossible to
reasonably interpret a provision unless an amendment is read into it, that the amendment is
considered to be a clarification or a declaration of the previous law and therefore applied
retrospectively.
iii) An explanation/clarification may not expand or alter the scope of the original provision.
iv)Merely because a provision is described as a clarification/explanation, the Court is not bound by
the said statement in the statute itself, but must proceed to analyse the nature of the amendment
and then conclude whether it is in reality a clarificatory or declaratory provision or whether it is a
substantive amendment which is intended to change the law and which would apply prospectively."
(emphasis added) In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the learned Tribunal is right in
striking down Rule 15(4) of the Rules of 2008. As a matter of 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2642 a/w
connected matters fact, the Government too realised its folly and vide S.O. No.133 dated 15.04.2021
notified the deletion of Rule 15 (4) of the Rules of 2008. The issue is answered accordingly.

Issue No. 2:
32 If the answer to issue No. 1 is not in affirmative, whether the petitioners can be
granted the benefit of promotion from the date when the vacancy had arisen for their
respective departmental feeding services in the Time Scale of JKAS?
The petitioners were inducted into Time Scale of JKAS in the year- 2008 only and there is no
provision in the Rules of 1979 which provides for grant of benefit of appointment/seniority to a
member of a JKAS service anterior to the date of his induction into Time Scale of JKAS. It was
contended by Mr. M.Y Bhat, learned Senior Counsel appearing for some of the petitioners that it is
obligatory for the selection committee to make selections/inductions for the calendar year and as
such seniority of inducted officers is to be determined on the basis of year of vacancy as shown in the
select list of that year in terms of Rule 16(4) of the Rules of 1979. A perusal of Rule 16 (4) of the
Rules of 1979 would reveal that the inter se seniority of the direct recruits on their promotion to the
Time Scale, vis-a-vis those appointed by promotion/selection shall be determined in the manner in
which the senior scale posts have to be allocated for promotion/selection/direct recruitment as
prescribed in the rules. For this purpose, a calendar year shall be taken as a unit for determination
a/w connected matters of the seniority. In case appointment of any group does not take place in a
particular calendar year, such a group shall have no claim for relating its seniority with those
appointed to the Time Scale in the previous year/years. This rule determines the inter se seniority of
the direct recruits vis-à-vis those appointed on promotion/selection. Rather the Rule 16(1) of the
Rules of 1979 would reveal that inter se seniority of the persons appointed to the service is to be
determined on the basis of order in which names are arranged in the select list prepared under Rule
8 of these Rules. Rule 8 of the Rules of 1979 provides that the selection committee shall classify
officers as 'outstanding', 'very good' and 'good' or 'unfit', on overall relative assessment of their
service records and those classified as 'outstanding', 'very good' and 'good' shall be included in the
select list in the same order, meaning thereby that those classified as 'outstanding' will appear first
and the remaining thereafter according to respective classification. It needs to be noted that Rule 6
of the Rules of 1979 provides that the Government shall on every occasion on which selection has to
be made for appointment to the services set up a selection committee for making selections and Rule
7 provides that Secretary of the Administrative Department concerned shall submit a list of all
eligible officers for selection against the vacancies in the time scale of the service, of course,
proportionate to their share in the Time Scale Posts. It is only when the select list is prepared that
the Government has to appoint the selected candidates to the service a/w connected matters in the
order in which their names appear in the select list. There is no rule that provides for the mandatory
appointment/selection of the candidates to the Time Scale posts for every calendar year. Only
mandate is that 65% of the Time Scale posts occurring in a calendar year are to be filled up by
promotion from the departmental feeding services. In this context, it would be appropriate to take
note of the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Deepak Agarwal v. State of U.P8, which are as
under:
"18. The short question that arises for consideration is as to whether the appellants
were entitled to be considered for promotion on the post of Deputy Excise
Commissioner under the 1983 Rules, on the vacancies, which occurred prior to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 14
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
amendment in the 1983 Rules on 17-5-1999.
19. Under the un-amended 1983 Rules, the petitioners would be eligible to be
considered for promotion by virtue of Rule 5(2). By virtue of the Note to Rule 8, a
combined eligibility list has to be prepared by arranging the names of Assistant
Excise Commissioners and Technical Officers in order of seniority as determined by
the date of their substantive appointment. The appellants were, therefore, clearly in
the feeder cadre of the post for promotion to the post of Deputy Excise
Commissioner. Rule 7 provides that the appointing authority shall determine the
vacancies to be filled during the course of the year and the number of vacancies.
There is no statutory duty cast upon the State to complete the selection process
within a prescribed period. Nor is there a mandate to fill up the posts within a
particular time. Rather the proviso to Rule 2 [sic Rule 4(2)] enables the State to leave
a particular post unfilled.
(emphasis added)
33. In State of Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma 9 , the Hon'ble Apex Court has
observed as under:
34. Another issue that deserves consideration is whether the year in which the
vacancy accrues can have any relevance for the purpose of determining the seniority
irrespective of the fact when the persons are recruited. Here the respondent's
contention is that since the vacancy arose in 1995-96 he should be given promotion
and seniority from that year and not from 1999, when his actual appointment (2011)
6 SCC 725 (2007) 1 SCC 683 a/w connected matters letter was issued by the
appellant. This cannot be allowed as no retrospective effect can be given to the order
of appointment order under the Rules nor is such contention reasonable to normal
parlance. This was the view taken by this Court in Jagdish Ch. Patnaik v. State of
Orissa.
34. The Hon'ble Apex Court, after taking note of its various earlier pronouncements, in Pawan
Pratap Singh v. Reevan Singh 10 , has held as under:
" From the above, the legal position with regard to determination of seniority in
service can be summarised as follows:
(i) The effective date of selection has to be understood in the context of the service
rules under which the appointment is made. It may mean the date on which the
process of selection starts with the issuance of advertisement or the factum of
preparation of the select list, as the case may be.
(ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be determined as per the service
rules. The date of entry in a particular service or the date of substantive appointment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 15
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
is the safest criterion for fixing seniority inter se between one officer or the other or
between one group of officers and the other recruited from different sources. Any
departure therefrom in the statutory rules, executive instructions or otherwise must
be consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
(iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from the backdate and if it is
done, it must be based on objective considerations and on a valid classification and
must be traceable to the statutory rules.
(iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of occurrence of the vacancy and
cannot be given retrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by the relevant
service rules. It is so because seniority cannot be given on retrospective basis when an
employee has not even been borne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely
affect the employees who have been appointed validly in the meantime."
(emphasis added) 35 In Ganga Vishan Gujrati v. State of Rajasthan 11 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court
of India has held that a consistent line of precedent of this Court follows the principle that
retrospective seniority cannot be (2011) 3 SCC 267 (2019) 16 SCC 28 a/w connected matters granted
to an employee from a date when the employee was not borne on a cadre. Seniority amongst
members of the same grade has to be counted from the date of initial entry into the grade.
36. From the above judicial pronouncements, it becomes crystal clear that in absence of any rule
providing for the benefit of promotion/seniority from the date anterior to substantive appointment
by promotion, the benefit of retrospective seniority/promotion cannot be granted. As such, this
Court is of the considered view that the petitioners cannot be granted the benefit of
induction/promotion to the post of Time Scale of JKAS for the vacancies of the years-2004, 2005,
2006 and 2007, from the date anterior to their promotion/induction. The issue No.2 is answered
accordingly.
37. It is also contended by Mr. M.Y Bhat, learned senior counsel for the petitioners that the official
respondents have clubbed the vacancies for the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, which is not
permissible. In support of his submissions, he has placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in 'Vijay Singh Charak v. Union of India (supra). In this case, the vacancies
for the years 1991- 1995 were clubbed resulting into the situation that the candidates, who were not
even eligible in the year 1991, were selected in the select list of 1995, ousting the appellant therein,
who claimed himself to be eligible for induction in the IFS in the year 1991. So far as the present case
is concerned, all the candidates except those 49 candidates, who were inducted against
leave/training vacancies, were inducted into a/w connected matters Time Scale of JKAS in
accordance with the year wise vacancies. This is not a case where private respondents have been
promoted against the vacancies belonging to the feeding services of the petitioners. It is worthwhile
to mention here that even in Vijay Singh Charak's case, the Hon'ble Apex Court made the following
observations:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 16
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
"We have carefully considered the aforesaid decisions and we are of the opinion that
the decisions in H. R. Kasturi Rangan12 and Nepal Singh Tanwar13 only lay down
that it is not an absolutely mandatory requirement of the regulation that a select list
must be prepared every year. Normally that should be done, but if for some good
reasons such a select list was not prepared every year, that by itself would not
invalidate the select list for that year".
38 In view of the above, there is no force in the aforesaid submission made by the learned Senior
Counsel and as such, the same is rejected. Additional grounds raised by the petitioners, who are the
appointees of the year 1992:
39. These additional grounds, being considered by this court, were in fact urged by the petitioners in
their petitions/applications but have not been taken note of by the learned Tribunal. In fact, Mr. Z.A
Shah, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has submitted that instead of remanding the matter
back to learned Tribunal for adjudication, these issues be decided by this Court.
40 The petitioners, who are the appointees of the year 1992 Batch have submitted that they had held
cadre posts of Administrative Services from the years 2004 to 2005 and as such, the petitioners
were entitled to claim seniority at least from the date they were holding the charge [(1998) 1 Scale
(SP) 11] [(1998) 1 Scale (SP) 7] a/w connected matters of cadre post in accordance with Rule 23 of
the J&K Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956. The petitioners have placed
reliance upon the order dated 26.10.2005 to demonstrate that they were posted as In-charge
Assistant Commissioners /SDMs /Collectors, the posts which they held till they were inducted in
Time Scale of JKAS in the year 2008. All these posts were JKAS cadre posts. They have further
submitted that from the years 2002 to 2007 many officers of other feeding services junior to them
came to be inducted in JKAS but the petitioners were not considered in the years 2003, 2004, 2005,
2006 and 2007 for induction into the JKAS for none of their fault and the act of the Government in
not according any consideration to the members of the Revenue Gazetted Service is nothing but
discriminatory, despite the fact that the Division Bench of this Court had directed the Government
to accord consideration to the eligible members of the Revenue Gazetted Service irrespective of their
seniority in the feeding service and to follow sealed cover procedure but the Government did not
bother to comply with the said direction. Their counterparts in other feeding services retired from
the posts at higher scale and some of them retired as IAS officers but they were discriminated as
they were not considered for induction from the date, they were entitled to and because of that they
are getting very meagre pension as compared to their counterparts, as such, the directions are
required to be issued to the respondents for creation of supernumerary posts, so that the injustice
meted out to the petitioners is undone and a/w connected matters they get the pensionary benefits,
they were entitled to, had they been considered in time for induction in to JKAS.
41 In Sunaina Sharma (supra), it has been held that the promotees can be granted the benefit of
seniority with retrospective effect, provided they have been working on temporary/officiating/ad
hoc or any other basis to work against the post for which he has been promoted. In Suraj Prakash
Gupta (supra) it has been held that once a promotee/recruitee by transfer is appointed on
probation, it is permissible to appoint him under Rule 23 of the J&K Civil Services (Classification,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 17
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956 as a member of the service from an anterior date when a
substantive vacancy existed in his quota. It was further held that the stop gap/ad hoc/temporary
service of a person appointed by transfer as an Assistant Engineer or by promotion as an Assistant
Executive Engineer can be regularized through PSC/DPC from an anterior date in a clear vacancy in
his quota, if he is eligible and found suitable for such transfer or promotion, as the case may be and
his seniority will count from that date.
42. Now, it is to be seen whether the petitioners can be granted benefit of seniority with effect from
the date they had been working as Assistant Commissioners/Collectors/SDMs or not, in terms of
Rule 23 of the J&K Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956.
43. In order to adjudicate the above-mentioned contention of the petitioners, first of all it is to be
determined as to whether Rule 23 of a/w connected matters J&K Civil Services (Classification,
Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956 is applicable in the case of the petitioners or not. So far as Sunaina
Sharma's case(supra) is concerned, there was Rule No. 13 of the Excise Rules, which provided that
seniority of the members of the service shall be regulated under the Civil Services Rules and likewise
in Suraj Prakash's case (supra), Rule 11 of the Jammu and Kashmir Engineer (Gazetted) Service
Recruitment Rules 1978, provided that the seniority of the members of the service shall be regulated
under the provisions of J&K Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956. The
Rule 23 of the J&K Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956 provides for
granting the benefit of seniority retrospectively from the date when the promotee or transferee has
been working on adhoc/officiating/temporary basis on the post in respect of which he has been
promoted. So far as Rules of 1979 are concerned, Rule Nos. 9, 10 and 16 of the Rules of 1979 are
relevant and the same are extracted as under:
"9. Appointment to the service (1) The Government shall on the occurrence of
vacancies appoint the selected candidates to the service in the order in which their
names appear in the Select List.
(2) the Government may make appointments in temporary or officiating vacancies
from among persons included in the Select List referred to in [(sub-rule (4)] of rule 8
of these rules and shall not appoint an officer not included in the said list.
10. Period of probation (1) All officers appointed to the service under rule 9 of these
rules shall be placed on probation or trial for a period of two years.
(2) if it appears at any time during or at the end of the period of probation or trial, as
the case may be, that an officer has not made sufficient use of his opportunities or if
he has failed to a/w connected matters give satisfaction, he may be reverted to the
post/service from which he was appointed to the service.
(3) The Government may in the case of any person extend the period of probation or
trial up to a maximum of four years.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126463374/ 18
Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
Explanation- Appointments on probation will be made against substantive vacancies only. All other
appointments will be on trial; provided that any period of officiating appointment shall be reckoned
as period spent on probation when a person appointed on trial is given regular appointment to the
service. (4) A probationer will be confirmed in the service at the end of his probation if he has
completed his period of probation to the satisfaction of Government; provided that a substantive
vacancy is available for the purpose.
16. Seniority (1) The relative seniority inter se of persons appointed to the service shall be
determined on the basis of the order in which names are arranged in the select list prepared under
rule 8 of these rules.
(2) The inter se seniority of those belonging to one and the same feeding service and who have been
classified under rule 8 in the same category shall be determined by reference to their seniority in the
feeding service.
(3) The inter se seniority of those who belong to different service but have been grouped in one class
by the selection committee under rule 8 shall be determined by reference to the service rendered at
the time scale level of the feeding service. Wherever, the dates of appointment to the Time Scale are
the same, the persons higher in age would be given seniority over the younger persons.
(4) The inter se seniority of the direct recruits on their promotion to the Time Scale, vis a vis those
appointed by promotion/selection shall be determined in the manner in which the senior scale posts
have to be allocated for promotion/selection/direct recruitment as prescribed in the rules. For this
purpose a calendar year shall be taken as a unit for determination of the seniority. In case
appointment of any group does not take place in a particular calendar year, such a group shall have
no claim for relating its seniority with those appointed to the Time Scale in the previous year/years.
(5) Seniority of the members of the service appointed to at its junior scale through competitive
examination shall be regulated under the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Service (Classification, Control
and Appeal) Rules 1956."
44. Rule 9 of Rules of 1979 vests the power with the Government to appoint the selected candidates
to the service in the order in which their names appear in the select list. It also empowers the
Government to make appointments on temporary or officiating basis from amongst the persons
included in the select list referred in sub-rule (4) of Rule 8 a/w connected matters of the Rules of
1979 and no officer can be appointed whose name does not appear in the select list. Explanation in
Rule 10 of the Rules of 1979 provides that any period of officiating appointment shall be reckoned as
a period spent on probation when a person appointed on trial is given regular appointment to the
service. Thus, only in a case where the appointment is made on trial from the persons whose names
appear in the select list, period spent on officiating appointment can be considered as period spent
on probation, when the said person is given regular appointment to the service. This is admitted fact
that when the petitioners, who are the appointees of 1992 batch, were tasked to work as In-charge
Assistant Commissioners/Collectors/SDMs, no select list in terms of in sub-rule (4) of Rule 8 of the
Rules of 1979 was prepared. Rule 16 of the Rules of 1979 deals with the seniority of the persons
appointed to the service. In terms of sub-rule 5 of Rule 16 of the Rules of 1979, seniority of the

member of the service appointed at its junior scale through competitive examination is regulated
under the J&K Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956 and J&K Civil Services
(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956 have not been made applicable for the purpose of
determining seniority in the present case, unlike in Suraj Parkash and Sunaina Sharma cases
(supra). Rule 18 of the Rules of 1979 provides that the matters not specifically covered by the Rules
of 1979 shall be governed by rules, regulations and orders applicable to State Civil Services in
general. Residuary power can be exercised only when a/w connected matters there is no provision in
the general rules. Also Rule 18 dealing with residuary matters cannot be pressed into service, as
Rule 16 of the Rules of 1979 deals with the seniority and Select List in terms of Rules of 1979 was
never prepared, which is sine qua non even for making appointments in temporary or officiating
vacancies in terms of Rule 9(2) of Rules 1979. In P.N. Premachandran (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme
Court upheld the decision of the Government in granting benefit of retrospective promotion as the
said power was traceable in the Rules, which is not so in the case of petitioners.
45. In view of the rule position as mentioned above, the contention of the appointees of 1992 batch
for grant of seniority with effect from the date they had been working as In-charge Assistant
Commissioners/ SDMs/Collectors from the year, 2004/2005 cannot be accepted.
46. In order to buttress their submissions that the petitioners of 1992 batch have been discriminated
qua their counterparts, who were selected in the same competitive examination Mr. Shah and Mr
Jan, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners have laid much stress on the interim order passed on
13.06.2002 in case titled as 'Javed Iqbal Balwan and others vs State of J&K and others' bearing LPA
No. 412/200, whereby the Government was directed to go ahead with the induction into the KAS
and during that process, the Government was directed to consider the appellant therein i.e.
petitioners herein irrespective of their seniority but on their own merit. The respondent therein was
directed to keep the said consideration of Revenue Gazetted in sealed a/w connected matters cover
till further orders, but the official respondent did not comply the said directions.
47. The above-mentioned LPA titled 'State of J&K vs. Javed Iqbal Balwan14' came to be decided by
the Division Bench vide judgment dated 21.09.2006,' wherein following directions were issued:
"I. The official respondents shall undertake a fresh exercise to fix the seniority of the
promotees and the direct recruits. While doing so due regard shall be given to the
judgments of the Court which have attained finality, by means of which seniority has
been fixed/confirmed by the Court in individual cases.
II. Out of the total posts available/falling vacant 50% posts shall go to the direct
recruits and 50% posts to the promotees;
III. Stop gap/adhoc promotion accorded to the promotees cannot be treated as
non-est merely because they were promoted directly as Tehsildars from the post of
Nai Tehsildars without first being posted as Additional Tehsildars or without
clearance by the Public Service Commission.

IV. Services of the promotees, which have duly been regularized as indicated above,
shall be counted with retrospective effect from the date a clear vacancy occurred in
the promotional quota.
V. Temporary, Adhoc and stop gap appointments of other promotees may be
regularized in accordance with the rules and the law laid down as has been cited
above;
VI. On such regularization the promotees shall be deemed to have been regularly
adjusted against the posts falling within their quota only;
VII. Where in a particular year appointment of both the direct recruits and
promotees has taken place, their placement in the seniority list shall be made in
accordance with their quota but where appointment is only from one category, the
candidates will occupy the posts of their quota only.
VIII. In case there is any excess appointment from a particular category, such
appointments shall be valid only till candidates from the other source became
available. The period spent against the other category post shall not count for
seniority;
IX. Once the persons from other source became available, the persons holding the
excess posts shall stand pushed down. They shall be adjusted against the available
vacancies within their quota in the subsequent years;
2006(3) JKJ 533[HC], a/w connected matters X. As far as practicable the persons
appointed/promoted shall not be ousted and shall be assigned to and adjusted
against the posts falling within their quota in the subsequent years;
XI. Direct recruits (Petitioners (DR)) shall be placed in the seniority list immediately
after the last direct recruit appointed in the year 1984 namely Mohd Ismail Baji, as
per the availability of posts within their quota. This shall be notwithstanding the
promotions granted to the promotees during the period.
XII. Those of the petitioners (DR) who have not so far passed the departmental
Tehsildars examination shall do so without further delay. Such petitioners shall be
entitled to further promotions only after qualifying such examination unless
exempted by the Government if permissible under the rules.
XIII. Those petitioners who have qualified such examination and possess the
requisite qualification, eligibility and other requirements of the rules shall be, subject
to availability of the posts be considered for promotion and also for induction into the
KAS in accordance with the rules from the date their immediate junior, got such
promotion/induction.

XIV. While according consideration and granting such promotion or induction into
the KAS, as far as, possible, grant of grade and promotion to the promotes or their
induction into the KAS, shall not be disturbed. In case posts are not available for the
qualified petitioners (DR), the Government may consider sanctioning of
supernumerary posts for them till the posts become available.
XV. Direct recruits who are promoted or inducted into the KAS as a result of this
exercise shall be given the same seniority position vis-a vis the promotees as they are
entitled to as a result of their notional seniority w.e.f. 24.9.1984."
48. A perusal of the direction Nos. XIII and XIV would reveal that the Government was directed to
consider the petitioners therein for induction into JKAS in accordance with the rules from the date
their immediate juniors got such promotion/induction and while according consideration and
granting such promotion or induction into KAS, as far as possible, grant of grade and promotion to
the promotees or their induction into JKAS was not to be disturbed and in case of non-
a/w connected matters availability of the posts for qualified petitioners, the Government was to
consider sanctioning of supernumerary posts for them till the posts become available. The
Government assailed the judgment before Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court
vide its judgment in case titled 'State of J&K v. Javed Iqbal Balwan (supra) set aside the directions
Nos. XIII and XIV, meaning thereby that the relief granted to the petitioners for
promotion/induction into KAS in accordance with the rules from the date their immediate juniors
got such promotion/induction and for creation of supernumerary posts for them in the event of
non-availability of posts, was denied.
49. There is no force in the submissions made by the learned Senior Counsels that the official
respondents did not comply with the order dated 13.06.2002, as the said order had merged in the
final order dated 21.09.2006.Though the Division Bench directed the official respondents to
consider the case of the petitioners for their induction into KAS in accordance with rules from the
date their immediate junior got such promotion/induction and if necessary to create supernumerary
posts but both these directions were set aside by the Hon'ble the Supreme Court. It appears that
after having failed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in getting the benefit of induction into JKAS
w.e.f. the date their counterparts were indicted into JKAS, the petitioners intend to reopen the
controversy which stands already settled by the Supreme Court of India. Therefore, there is no merit
in this contention raised by the petitioners, as such the same is rejected.

1182/2023, the petitioners are aggrieved of the order dated 25.01.2023 passed by the learned
Tribunal, whereby the seniority of the private respondents was restored in terms of seniority list
dated 24.06.2011.

Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
51. As a matter of fact, after the order dated 30.03.2021 was passed by the Jammu Bench of Central
Administrative Tribunal, the official respondents issued a seniority list, whereby the private
respondents Dr. Ghulam Nabi Itoo and Tariq Hussain Ganai were placed at Serial No. 200 & 202,
respectively. Both the private respondents challenged the seniority list dated 07.04.2021 on the
grounds that only option open before the official respondents was either to file a writ petition
against order dated 30.03.2021 passed by the learned Tribunal or to file a review application before
the learned Tribunal and once the seniority list was upheld by the Tribunal, the issuing Authority
had become functus officio. It was also contended that fixation of cut off had nothing to do with the
existence of vacancy and otherwise also, fixing of 01.01.2008 for considering vacancy position is
contrary to Rules of 1979. It was also contended that Rules of 1979 do not provide for year wise
preparation of select list.
52. The petitioners objected to the writ petition by stating that the private respondents were
appointed against the leave vacancies as there were a/w connected matters no clear vacancies
available on 01.01.2008, as such, seniority position was changed subsequently. It was also
contended that the Rules of 1979 provide for preparation of year wise select list for the vacancies
which occurred in a calendar year.
53. The learned Tribunal vide order dated 25.01.2023 upheld the contentions of the private
respondents and quashed the seniority list dated 07.04.2021. The order dated 25.01.2023 has been
impugned on the ground that private respondents were inducted to time scale of JKAS against
anticipated vacancies of the year 2008 and they were required to be considered only in the year
2009, as vacancies till 01.01.2008 only were to be filled.
54. Rule 6 of Rules of 1979 envisages that the Government on every occasion on which selection has
to be made for appointment to the service, shall set up a Selection Committee for making selection
under Rules and further Rule 5 (3) (a) of Rules 1979 provides filling up vacancies of time scale posts,
occurring in calendar year. The learned Tribunal has come to conclusion that the vacancies for the
private respondents were available in the year 2008 as is evident from the minutes of meetings of
Establishment Committee dated 29.05.2008 and further that the Rules of 1979 do not provide that
Selection Committee will meet on a particular date(s), month(s) or year.
55. Mr. Abhinav Sharma, learned Senior Counsel for some of the petitioners also contended that
once the private respondents have accepted order dated 13.08.2021, whereby the selection grade
was a/w connected matters released in favour of contesting parties and have not challenged the
same, the private respondents cannot assail the seniority list dated 07.04.2021. It needs to be noted
that the grievance of the private respondents was only to the extent that they were placed lower in
the seniority list dated 07.04.2021 as against their placement in the seniority list dated 26.04.2011,
which was upheld by the learned Tribunal vide its judgment dated 30.03.2021. If the seniority list
dated 07.04.2021 is quashed to the extent of private respondents, then as a natural consequence, the
seniority list dated 26.04.2011 except to the extent of placing 49 members, adjusted against training
and leave vacancies, at the bottom, would govern the seniority. Therefore, this contention of the
petitioners is not sustainable in the eyes of law.

Union Territory Of J&K And Anr vs Ghulam Nabi Itoo And Others on 3 April, 2025
56. The petitioners have not been able to demonstrate that the private respondents were empanelled
for the anticipated vacancies. In fact, the minutes of the meeting dated 29.05.2008 clearly establish
that the private respondents were considered against the vacancies of the year 2008. Apart from
this, it was not open to the Government to alter the seniority list to the detriment of the afore-named
respondents, without hearing them and once the Government accepted the judgment of the
Tribunal, whereby order dated 24.06.2011 was upheld, it could not have altered the seniority list
without challenging the judgment by way of appropriate proceedings.

57. In view of the above, we do not find any legal infirmity in the impugned order passed by the
Tribunal, so as to warrant any interference at the end of this Court.
CONCLUSION:
58 For all what has been said and discussed above, there is no merit in these writ petitions, as such,
the same are dismissed, however, no order as to costs.
59. Record of the Tribunal be sent back forthwith.
