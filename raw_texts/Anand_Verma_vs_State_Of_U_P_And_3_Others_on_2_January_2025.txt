Officer in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. in Case Crime No. 242 of 2023 under Section 376D I.P.C.
and Sections 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station-Tarkulwa, District-Deoria, Cognizance Taking
Order/Summoning Order dated 28.03.2024 passed by Additional District and Sessions
Judge/Special Judge, POCSO Act, Court No. 01, Deoria in consequential Sessions Case No. 666 of
2023 (State Vs. Ram Brijmohan Maddheshiya) under Section 376D I.P.C. and Sections 3/4 POCSO
Act, Police Station-Tarkulwa, District-Deoria as well as the entire proceedings of aforementioned
sessions case, now pending in the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge/Special Judge,
POCSO Act, Court No. 01, Deoria.
5. Present application came up for admission on 28.11.2024 and this Court passed the following
order:-
"1. Heard learned counsel for applicant, learned Additional Government Advocate
appearing for opposite party no.1-State and Mr. Akhilesh K. Dwivedi, learned counsel
for opposite party no.2.
2. Issue notice to opposite parties no.3 & 4, returnable at an early date.
3. Application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed challenging charge-sheet
dated 06.02.2024, cognizance/summoning order dated 28.03.2024 as well as
proceedings of Sessions Case No.666 of 2023 (State versus Ram Brijmohan
Maddheshiya) arising out of Case Crime No.242 of 2023, under Section 376D IPC
and Section 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station Tarkulwa District Deoria.
4. Learned counsel for applicant submits that a perusal of the first information report
as well as statement of victim recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. clearly indicate that
allegation of rape has been alleged against one Brijmohan Maddheshiya without any
allegation being levelled against the applicant and it is only in the subsequent
statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. that the name of applicant has been
introduced. Learned counsel has submitted that there is serious contradiction not
only in the version indicated in the FIR but also in statements recorded under
Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. The date and time of the incident is also differently
recorded in the FIR, under section 164 Cr.P.C. and in the medical examination report
which also indicates that the alleged victim has refused internal medical examination.
5. It is therefore submitted that there was no occasion for trial court to have taken
cognizance against the applicant since even prima facie case is not made out against
the applicant.
6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party no.2 on the basis of
instructions submits that during the course of investigation, victim as well as her
mother gave affidavits to the effect that the name of applicant was wrongly
introduced in the sequence of events at the instance of other persons.

7. Prima facie submissions advanced by learned counsel for applicant have force and
require consideration for which time is granted to opposite parties no.1, 3 and 4 to
file their counter affidavits with counter of opposite party no.2 already on record.
8. List this case on 16.12.2024, as fresh along with service report.
9. Until further order of this Court, proceedings in Sessions Case No.666 of 2023
(State versus Ram Brijmohan Maddheshiya) arising out of Case Crime No.242 of
2023, under Section 376D IPC and Section 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station Tarkulwa
District Deoria shall remain stayed so far as it relates to the applicant.
Order Date :- 28.11.2024"
6. On the matter being taken up, the learned counsel for applicant has reiterated the same
submissions as were urged by him before this Court on 28.11.2024. On the basis of above, it is
contended by the learned counsel for applicant that present application is liable to be allowed.
7. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1 has vehemently opposed this application.
Learned A.G.A. submits that applicant has also been implicated in the crime in question in the
statement of the prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. Applicant alongwith other
co-accused has been implicated under Section 376D I.PC. As such, prima-facie the presence of
applicant at the time and place of occurrence cannot be doubted. It is then contended that the
prosecutrix in her statementS under Section 161 as well as 164 Cr.P.C. has fully supported the F.I.R.
Upto this stage, no such material has emerged on record, on the basis of which, the veracity of F.I.R.
itself could be doubted. On the above premise, the learned A.G.A. submits that remedy lies to the
applicant to appear before court below and take all possible defence in support of his innocence. As
such, present application is liable to be dismissed.
8. When confronted with above, the learned counsel for applicant could not overcome the same.
9. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, upon perusal of
record and coupled with the fact that objections raised by the learned A.G.A. in opposition to this
application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. could not be dislodged by the learned counsel for applicant,
therefore, irrespective of the varied submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicant, this
court does not find any good or sufficient ground to entertain this application.
10. As a result, this application fails and is therefore liable to be dismissed.
11. It is accordingly dismissed.
