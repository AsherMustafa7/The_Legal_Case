THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE B. P. ROUTRAY
THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE CHITTARANJAN DASH
Date of Judgment: 02.04.2025
Chittaranjan Dash, J.:
1. By means of this appeal, the Appellant has challenged the judgment dated 12.12.2023 passed by
the Learned Judge, Family Court, Bhubaneswar, in C.P. No. 576/2017, declaring the Respondent as
the legally wedded wife of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty and his legal heir, thereby entitling her to
inherit his ancestral and self-acquired property.
2. The background facts of the case are that the Respondent, Anusaya Mohanty, initiated C.P. No.
576 of 2017 before the Family Court, Bhubaneswar, seeking a declaration that she is the legally
wedded wife of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty and his rightful legal heir. The Respondent claimed
that their marriage took place on 05.06.1966 as per Hindu rites and customs, and they lived
together, raising two sons. She further alleged that the Appellant, Sandhya Rani Sahoo @ Mohanty,
was merely a nurse who worked with the deceased and had no legitimate marital relationship with
him. The Family Court decreed the suit on 29.10.2021, declaring the Respondent as the legally
wedded wife and legal heir of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty, entitling her to inherit his ancestral
and self-acquired property. Aggrieved by the judgment, the Appellant filed MATA No. 96 of 2021

Smt. Sandhya Rani Sahoo vs Smt. Anusaya Mohanty .... Opposite ... on 2 April, 2025
before this Court, challenging the decision on the grounds that she was not given a fair opportunity
to present her case. The Appellant contended that her lawyer had passed away during the
proceedings, and due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, she was unaware of the
developments, leading to the case being decided in her absence. This Court, in its order dated
13.07.2023, observed that there was reasonable cause for the Appellant's non-appearance and held
that the Family Court's judgment was passed without affording the Appellant proper opportunity to
contest the matter.
Consequently, this Court set aside the judgment dated 29.10.2021 and remitted the matter back to
the Family Court, Bhubaneswar, for fresh adjudication. Additionally, this Court issued an interim
arrangement concerning the disputed property. Considering the advanced age of both parties with
the Respondent approaching 80 years and the Appellant around 70 years, this Court directed that,
until the final outcome of the case, the usufructs arising from the property would be shared in a
60:40 ratio, with 60% in favour of the Respondent, Anusaya Mohanty, and 40% in favour of the
Appellant, Sandhya Rani Sahoo @ Mohanty. Following the remission, the Family Court reheard the
matter and passed a fresh judgment on 12.12.2023, once again declaring the Respondent as the
legally wedded wife of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty and his legal heir, thereby reaffirming her
right to inherit his ancestral and self-acquired property. As a result of the Family Court's decision,
the Appellant has preferred the present Matrimonial Appeal, challenging the judgment dated
12.12.2023.
3. Mr. B. Baug, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, contends that the
Family Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit, arguing that the Respondent's prayer for a
declaration of marital status should have been brought before the Civil Court under Section 34 of the
Specific Relief Act, rather than under Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1984. He further asserts
that the suit is barred by limitation, as it was filed more than three years after the death of Late
Kailash Chandra Mohanty, making it time-barred under Article 58 of the Limitation Act, 1963.
Additionally, Mr. Baug challenges the Family Court's finding that the Respondent is the sole legal
heir of the deceased, contending that the children born from the Appellant's relationship with Late
Kailash Chandra Mohanty are legitimate under Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and are
entitled to inherit their father's self-acquired property as Class-I heirs under the Hindu Succession
Act, 1956. Mr. Baug asserts that the Family Court erred by failing to explicitly recognize this right in
its final order. Consequently, he prays for the setting aside of the impugned judgment and proper
consideration of her claims and those of her children as legal heirs of Late Kailash Chandra
Mohanty. Mr. Baug has placed his reliance on the following decisions - Samar Kumar Roy vs. Jharna
Bera reported in (2008) 1 SCC 1; Harmohan Senapati vs. Smt. Kamala Kumari Senapati and Anr.
Reported in AIR 1979 ORISSA 51; Renubala Moharana and anr vs. Mina Mohanty and ors reported

4. Mr. S. S. Bhuyan, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent, contends that the
Family Court rightly exercised its jurisdiction under Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act, 1984,
as the suit sought a declaration of her marital status, which falls squarely within the Family Court's
purview. He further argues that the suit is not barred by limitation, as the period spent pursuing the
matter before the Civil Court, which returned the plaint for lack of jurisdiction, should be excluded
under Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963. Additionally, Mr. Bhuyan asserts that the Family
Court correctly declared the Respondent as the legally wedded wife and legal heir of Late Kailash
Chandra Mohanty, based on ample oral and documentary evidence. While acknowledging that the
Appellant's children are legitimate under Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, Mr. Bhuyan argues
that this does not affect the Respondent's status as the lawful wife or her right to inherit the
ancestral property. He prays for the dismissal of the present appeal, asserting that the Family
Court's findings are just and proper. Mr. Bhuyan has placed his reliance on the following decisions -
Balram Yadav vs. Fulmaniya Yadav reported in AIR 2016 SC 2161; Hasina Bano vs. Mohd. Ehsan
reported in 2024 SCC OnLine AI 5194; Jitendra Kumar Choudhary vs. Banku Sahoo reported in
FAO No. 27 of 2013.
5. The Family Court, in its findings, held that the Respondent is the legally wedded wife of Late
Kailash Chandra Mohanty and his rightful legal heir. The Court found that the Respondent
established her marriage with the deceased through credible oral and documentary evidence,
including voter identity cards, service records, and letters exchanged between them. It ruled that the
suit was not barred by limitation, applying Section 14 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963, to exclude
the time spent pursuing the matter in the wrong forum. On the issue of jurisdiction, the Court
concluded that the matter fell within the purview of Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act, 1984,
as it concerned the declaration of marital status. Furthermore, the Court determined that the
Appellant's alleged marriage to the deceased was invalid under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
(hereinafter referred to as "HMA") as the Respondent's marriage was still subsisting at the time.
However, it acknowledged that the Appellant's children would be considered legitimate and would
have inheritance rights. Consequently, the Court declared the Respondent as the legally wedded wife
and lawful heir, entitled to inherit both the ancestral and self-acquired properties of Late Kailash
Chandra Mohanty.
6. In course of final hearing, this Court, as per the order dated 17.03.2025, found it appropriate to
outline the Appeal in the following three issues: -
(i) Whether the Respondent's prayer for declaration of her marital status is
maintainable before the learned Judge, Family Court under Section 7 of the Family
Courts Act, or whether she was required to approach the Civil Court under Section 34
of the Specific Relief Act?
(ii) Whether the suit filed by the Respondent before the learned Judge, Family Court
is barred by limitation, having been filed more than three years after the death of
Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69098143/ 3
Smt. Sandhya Rani Sahoo vs Smt. Anusaya Mohanty .... Opposite ... on 2 April, 2025
(iii) Whether the direction of the learned Judge, Family Court, depriving the issues
born from the Appellant (Second Wife) from the properties of Late Kailash Chandra
Mohanty, is violative of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act?
Both the parties have submitted their replies addressing these issues in the meantime, and it is now
incumbent upon this Court to scrutinise the matter independently and render its findings
accordingly.
Issue (i) - Whether the Respondent's prayer for declaration of her marital status is maintainable
before the learned Judge, Family Court under Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, or whether she
was required to approach the Civil Court under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act?
7. The Appellant contends that the relief sought by the Respondent, a declaration of her status as the
legally wedded wife of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty does not fall within the jurisdiction of the
Family Court. According to the Appellant, the proper recourse for such a declaration lies under
Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, which governs suits for declaratory relief. The Appellant
argues that the Family Court, being a creature of statute, derives its jurisdiction strictly from the
Family Courts Act, 1984, and any matter outside its express mandate must be brought before a Civil
Court of competent jurisdiction. The Appellant relies on the principle that jurisdiction cannot be
inferred but must be expressly conferred, and since the Respondent's suit primarily seeks a
declaration of marital status, it should have been adjudicated by a Civil Court.
Conversely, the Respondent asserts that the Family Court had the necessary jurisdiction under
Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act, 1984. Section 7(1)(b) empowers Family Courts to decide
suits or proceedings for "a declaration as to the validity of a marriage or as to the matrimonial status
of any person." The Respondent contends that her prayer to be declared the legally wedded wife of
Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty squarely falls within this provision. Moreover, the Respondent
points out that the Appellant never raised the issue of jurisdiction in the initial stages before the
Family Court or even during the earlier MATA No. 96 of 2021, and is therefore estopped from
raising it at this stage. The Respondent further submits that the matter was initially filed before the
Civil Court but was returned under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC for want of jurisdiction, reinforcing
the argument that the Family Court is the appropriate forum.
8. This Court, after carefully considering the rival submissions and examining the statutory
provisions, finds that Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, is broad enough to encompass
the relief sought by the Respondent. The provisions reads as follows:
"7. Jurisdiction.--(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a Family Court shall--
(a) have and exercise all the jurisdiction exercisable by any district Court or any
subordinate civil Court under any law for the time being in force in respect of suits
and proceedings of the nature referred to in the Explanation; and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69098143/ 4
Smt. Sandhya Rani Sahoo vs Smt. Anusaya Mohanty .... Opposite ... on 2 April, 2025
(b) be deemed, for the purposes of exercising such jurisdiction under such law, to be
a district Court or, as the case may be, such subordinate civil Court for the area to
which the jurisdiction of the Family Court extends.
Explanation.-- The suits and proceedings referred to in this sub-section are suits and proceedings of
the following nature, namely:--
(a) a suit or proceeding between the parties to a marriage for a decree of nullity of
marriage (declaring the marriage to be null and void or, as the case may be, annulling
the marriage) or restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation or dissolution of
marriage;
(b) a suit or proceeding for a declaration as to the validity of a marriage or as to the
matrimonial status of any person;
Additionally, Section 8 of the Family Courts Act reinforces the exclusivity of the Family Court's
jurisdiction by expressly barring the jurisdiction of Civil Courts in matters covered under Section 7.
The provision reads as:
8. Exclusion of jurisdiction and pending proceedings.--Where a Family Court has
been established for any area,--
(a) no district Court or any subordinate civil Court referred to in sub-section (1) of
section 7 shall, in relation to such area, have or exercise any jurisdiction in respect of
any suit or proceeding of the nature referred to in the Explanation to that
sub-section;
(b) no magistrate shall, in relation to such area, have or exercise any jurisdiction or
powers under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974);
(c) every suit or proceeding of the nature referred to in the Explanation to sub-section
(1) of section 7 and every proceeding under Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),--
(i) which is pending immediately before the establishment of such Family Court
before any district Court or subordinate Court referred to in that sub-
section or, as the case may be, before any magistrate under the said Code; and
(ii) which would have been required to be instituted or taken before such Family Court if, before the
date on which such suit or proceeding was instituted or taken, this Act had come into force and such
Family Court had been established, shall stand transferred to such Family Court on the date on
which it is established.

Finally, Section 20 of the Family Courts Act provides that the Act has an overriding effect over any
other law that may be inconsistent with it:
20. Act to have overriding effect.--The provisions of this Act shall have effect
notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the
time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than
this Act.
9. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Balram Yadav vs. Fulmaniya Yadav reported in AIR 2016 SC 2161,
has categorically held the following -
"Under Section 7(1) Explanation (b), a Suit or a proceeding for a declaration as to the
validity of both marriage and matrimonial status of a person is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Family Court, since under Section 8, all those jurisdictions covered
under Section 7 are excluded from the purview of the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts.
In case, there is a dispute on the matrimonial status of any person, a declaration in
that regard has to be sought only before the Family Court. It makes no difference as
to whether it is an affirmative relief or a negative relief. What is important is the
declaration regarding the matrimonial status.
Section 20 also endorses the view which we have taken, since the Family Courts Act,
1984, has an overriding effect on other laws."
10. The language of the above-mentioned provisions leaves no room for ambiguity. A suit seeking a
declaration of marital status whether it affirms or denies the existence of a valid marriage squarely
falls within the ambit of the Family Court's jurisdiction. Once the Family Court jurisdiction is
established over a matter, any attempt to bypass it would undermine the very purpose of
establishing Family Courts, which is to provide a specialised forum for resolving family disputes
efficiently. In the present case, the core of the matter is a declaration of marital status, which aligns
squarely with Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act. The Family Court had the proper jurisdiction
under Section 7(1)(b) of the Act to entertain the Respondent's prayer for a declaration of her marital
status. The provision clearly vests the Family Court with the authority to decide matters relating to
the validity of a marriage and the matrimonial status of any person.
11. The Appellant's argument that the Respondent ought to have approached the Civil Court under
Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act is misplaced, as the Family Courts Act is a special law enacted to
deal with disputes of a matrimonial nature, including the determination of marital status. The
principle of lex specialis derogat legi generali i.e. meaning special law prevails over general law
applies in this context, giving precedence to the Family Courts Act over the general provisions of the
Specific Relief Act. Furthermore, the Family Court's jurisdiction is not merely concurrent but
exclusive for matters enumerated under Section 7, thereby precluding the jurisdiction of Civil Courts
in such cases.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69098143/ 6
Smt. Sandhya Rani Sahoo vs Smt. Anusaya Mohanty .... Opposite ... on 2 April, 2025
Moreover, the fact that the Respondent initially approached the Civil Court and the plaint was
returned under Order VII Rule 10 CPC further reinforces the conclusion that the Family Court was
the correct forum. The Appellant's failure to challenge the jurisdiction in the earlier proceedings
further weakens her case, as jurisdictional objections must be raised at the earliest stage of
litigation.
12. Therefore, this Court finds no merit in the Appellant's contention regarding lack of jurisdiction.
The Family Court validly exercised its jurisdiction under Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act,
and the Appellant's objection regarding maintainability is, accordingly, untenable and stands
rejected.
Issue (ii) - Whether the suit filed by the Respondent before the learned Judge, Family Court is
barred by limitation, having been filed more than three years after the death of Late Kailash
Chandra Mohanty?
13. The Appellant contends that the Respondent's suit is barred under the Limitation Act, 1963.
According to the Appellant, Article 58 of the Limitation Act prescribes a three-year limitation period
for suits seeking a declaration, starting from the date when the right to sue first accrues. The
Appellant argues that the cause of action arose on 12.07.2012, the date of Late Kailash Chandra
Mohanty's death. Therefore, the Respondent's suit, filed on 24.07.2017, is time-barred, as it was
filed more than five years after the cause of action arose. The Appellant further submits that the
Respondent failed to seek condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act and did not
provide any explanation for the delay, making the suit liable for dismissal on this ground alone.
Conversely, the Respondent asserts that the suit is not barred by limitation, relying on the principle
that time spent prosecuting a case in the wrong forum should be excluded from the calculation of
the limitation period. The Respondent initially filed C.S. No. 1998 of 2013 before the Civil Judge
(Senior Division), Bhubaneswar, seeking a declaration of her marital status and legal heirship.
However, the Civil Court returned the plaint on 13.01.2016, citing lack of jurisdiction. The
Respondent subsequently challenged this order by filing CMP No. 278 of 2016, which was dismissed
on 10.05.2017. Thereafter, the Respondent filed the present suit before the Family Court on
24.07.2017. The Respondent contends that the period from the institution of C.S. No. 1998 of 2013
until the dismissal of CMP No. 278 of 2016 should be excluded under Section 14(2) of the Limitation
Act, which allows for the exclusion of time spent in bona fide pursuit of a claim before a Court that
lacked jurisdiction. The Respondent further submits that, as per settled law, there is no prescribed
period of limitation for seeking a declaration of marital status before the Family Court.
14. Upon careful consideration of the rival submissions, it is imperative to analyse the interplay
between the Limitation Act, 1963, and the Family Courts Act, 1984, in the context of suits seeking a
declaration of marital status.
Article 58 of the Limitation Act prescribes a three-year limitation period for suits seeking a
declaration, starting from the date when the right to sue first accrues. In the present case, the
Appellant asserts that the cause of action arose on 12.07.2012, the date of Late Kailash Chandra
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69098143/ 7
Smt. Sandhya Rani Sahoo vs Smt. Anusaya Mohanty .... Opposite ... on 2 April, 2025
Mohanty's death, and therefore, the suit filed on 24.07.2017 is barred by time. However, this Court
finds that such a rigid application of Article 58 overlooks certain critical legal principles.
15. Firstly, Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act provides relief in cases where a party has pursued a
matter in good faith before a Court that ultimately lacked jurisdiction. It reads as:
"In computing the period of limitation for any suit, the time during which the
plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in
a Court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the defendant, shall be
excluded where the proceeding is founded upon the same cause of action and is
prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause
of a like nature, is unable to entertain it."
In the present case, the Respondent initially filed C.S. No. 1998 of 2013 before the Civil Judge
(Senior Division), Bhubaneswar, seeking a declaration of her marital status and legal heirship.
However, the Civil Court returned the plaint on 13.01.2016, holding that it lacked jurisdiction to
entertain the matter. The Respondent subsequently filed CMP No. 278 of 2016, challenging the
order of the Civil Court, which was dismissed on 10.05.2017. Only thereafter did the Respondent file
the present suit before the Family Court on 24.07.2017. Therefore, the period spent in prosecuting
the earlier suit and the subsequent challenge before the Civil Court ought to be excluded under
Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act. This principle has been consistently upheld by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, which recognises that parties should not be penalised for diligently pursuing their
claims before a forum that ultimately lacks jurisdiction.
Secondly, a conjoint reading of Section 7 of the Family Courts Act and Section 29(3) of the
Limitation Act lends support to the view that proceedings before the Family Court are not subject to
a strict limitation period. Section 7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act expressly empowers the Family
Court to decide suits or proceedings for "a declaration as to the validity of a marriage or as to the
matrimonial status of any person." Importantly, the Family Courts Act does not prescribe any
limitation period for such proceedings. Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act clarifies that where a
special law provides for a different limitation period or excludes the application of the Limitation
Act, the special law will prevail. In the absence of a specific limitation period under the Family
Courts Act, the general principles of delay and laches apply, rather than the rigid timelines under
the Limitation Act.
16. A party seeking to establish or refute marital status cannot be barred from seeking such a
declaration merely because a certain period has elapsed, particularly when the dispute has
long-standing consequences for inheritance, legitimacy, and personal law rights. The concept of
"continuing cause of action" applies in cases involving marital status. The Respondent's right to
assert her status as the legally wedded wife of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty is not a right that
extinguishes over time, as it forms the foundation of her claims over his property and other legal
entitlements. As long as the Respondent's status remained contested by the Appellant, the cause of
action continued. Therefore, even assuming that no statutory exclusion under Section 14(2) applies,
the continuing nature of the dispute sustains the Respondent's right to seek a declaration.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69098143/ 8
Smt. Sandhya Rani Sahoo vs Smt. Anusaya Mohanty .... Opposite ... on 2 April, 2025
17. In light of these considerations, this Court finds that the Respondent's suit before the Family
Court is not barred by limitation. The time spent in prosecuting the matter before the Civil Court
and the subsequent challenge before the High Court must be excluded under Section 14(2) of the
Limitation Act. Moreover, given the absence of any specific limitation period under the Family
Courts Act and the continuing nature of the dispute, the Respondent's claim remains legally tenable.
Accordingly, the Appellant's objection regarding limitation lacks merit and stands rejected.
Issue (iii) - Whether the direction of the learned Judge, Family Court, depriving the issues born
from the Appellant (the Second Wife) from the properties of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty, is
violative of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955?
18. In view of this issue, the Appellant's concern is that in the final order section of the Family
Court's judgment, it is only declared that the Respondent is the legal heir of late Kailash Chandra
Mohanty and entitled to inherit his ancestral and self- acquired property. However, despite
discussion in the judgment, the Family Court has not clarified in the final order that the children
born from the Appellant have a right over both ancestral and self- acquired property of the
deceased.
19. In this regard, it is pertinent to examine the right of inheritance of such children under the
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as "HSA").
Section 16 of the HMA confers legitimacy on children born from void and voidable marriages,
ensuring that they are entitled to inherit their parents' property. Under the HSA, legitimate children
including those legitimised under Section 16 of the HMA, fall under the category of Class-I heirs,
giving them an undisputed right to inherit the self-acquired property of their parents.
20. To better understand, we may refer to the case in the matter of Revanasiddappa & Anr. versus
Mallikarjun & Ors., reported in 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 737, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
dealt with the issue as to whether the children born from void or voidable marriages, though
conferred legitimacy under Section 16(1) and (2) of the HMA, could claim rights in ancestral
property or as coparceners under the HSA. Held as under: -
"54. We now formulate our conclusions in the following terms:
(i) In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 16, a child of a marriage which is null and
void under Section 11 is statutorily conferred with legitimacy irrespective of whether
(i) such a child is born before or after the commencement of Amending Act 1976; (ii)
a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under the Act and the
marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under the enactment;
(ii) In terms of sub-section (2) of Section 16 where a voidable marriage has been
annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12, a child 'begotten or conceived' before
the decree has been made, is deemed to be their legitimate child notwithstanding the
decree, if the child would have been legitimate to the parties to the marriage if a
decree of dissolution had been passed instead of a decree of nullity;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69098143/ 9
Smt. Sandhya Rani Sahoo vs Smt. Anusaya Mohanty .... Opposite ... on 2 April, 2025
(iii) While conferring legitimacy in terms of sub-
section (1) on a child born from a void marriage and under sub-section (2) to a child born from a
voidable marriage which has been annulled, the legislature has stipulated in subsection (3) of
Section 16 that such a child will have rights to or in the property of the parents and not in the
property of any other person;
(iv) While construing the provisions of Section 3(1)(j) of the HSA 1956 including the proviso, the
legitimacy which is conferred by Section 16 of the HMA 1955 on a child born from a void or, as the
case may be, voidable marriage has to be read into the provisions of the HSA 1956. In other words, a
child who is legitimate under sub-section (1) or subsection (2) of Section 16 of the HMA would, for
the purposes of Section 3(1)(j) of the HSA 1956, fall within the ambit of the explanation 'related by
legitimate kinship' and cannot be regarded as an 'illegitimate child' for the purposes of the proviso;
(v) Section 6 of the HSA 1956 continues to recognize the institution of a joint Hindu family governed
by the Mitakshara law and the concepts of a coparcener, the acquisition of an interest as a
coparcener by birth and rights in coparcenary property. By the substitution of Section 6, equal rights
have been granted to daughters, in the same manner as sons as indicated by sub-section (1) of
Section 6;
(vi) Section 6 of the HSA 1956 provides for the devolution of interest in coparcenary property. Prior
to the substitution of Section 6 with effect from 9 September 2005 by the Amending Act of 2005,
Section 6 stipulated the devolution of interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property of a male Hindu
by survivorship on the surviving members of the coparcenary. The exception to devolution by
survivorship was where the deceased had left surviving a female relative specified in Class I of the
Schedule or a male relative in Class I claiming through a female relative, in which event the interest
of the deceased in a Mitakshara coparcenary property would devolve by testamentary or intestate
succession and not by survivorship. In terms of sub- section (3) of Section 6 as amended, on a Hindu
dying after the commencement of the Amending Act of 2005 his interest in the property of a Joint
Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law will devolve by testamentary or intestate succession,
as the case may be, under the enactment and not by survivorship. As a consequence of the
substitution of Section 6, the rule of devolution by testamentary or intestate succession of the
interest of a deceased Hindu in the property of a Joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshara law
has been made the norm;
(vii) Section 8 of the HSA 1956 provides general rules of succession for the devolution of the
property of a male Hindu dying intestate. Section 10 provides for the distribution of the property
among heirs of Class I of the Schedule. Section 15 stipulates the general rules of succession in the
case of female Hindus dying intestate. Section 16 provides for the order of succession and the
distribution among heirs of a female Hindu;
(viii) While providing for the devolution of the interest of a Hindu in the property of a Joint Hindu
family governed by Mitakshara law, dying after the commencement of the Amending Act of 2005 by
testamentary or intestate succession, Section 6 (3) lays down a legal fiction namely that 'the

coparcenary property shall be deemed to have been divided as if a partition had taken place'.
According to the Explanation, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener is deemed to be the
share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property has taken
place immediately before his death irrespective of whether or not he is entitled to claim partition;
(ix) For the purpose of ascertaining the interest of a deceased Hindu Mitakshara coparcener, the law
mandates the assumption of a state of affairs immediately prior to the death of the coparcener
namely, a partition of the coparcenary property between the deceased and other members of the
coparcenary. Once the share of the deceased in property that would have been allotted to him if a
partition had taken place immediately before his death is ascertained, his heirs including the
children who have been conferred with legitimacy under Section 16 of the HMA 1955, will be
entitled to their share in the property which would have been allotted to the deceased upon the
notional partition, if it had taken place; and
(x) The provisions of the HSA 1956 have to be harmonized with the mandate in Section 16(3) of the
HMA 1955 which indicates that a child who is conferred with legitimacy under sub-sections (1) and
(2) will not be entitled to rights in or to the property of any person other than the parents. The
property of the parent, where the parent had an interest in the property of a Joint Hindu family
governed under the Mitakshara law has to be ascertained in terms of the Explanation to sub-section
(3), as interpreted above."
21. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Section 16(3) of the HMA restricts the property rights of
such children to only the property that comes in the share of the parents out of the joint family
property besides self-acquired property. To be more specific, the judgment further clarifies that
where the parent was a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener, the explanation to Section 6(3) of the HSA
comes into play, that reads as -
6. Devolution of interest in coparcenary property. (3) Where a Hindu dies after the commencement
of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 (39 of 2005), his interest in the property of a Joint
Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession,
as the case may be, under this Act and not by survivorship, and the coparcenary property shall be
deemed to have been divided as if a partition had taken place and,
(a) the daughter is allotted the same share as is allotted to a son;
(b) the share of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as they would have got had they
been alive at the time of partition, shall be allotted to the surviving child of such pre-deceased son or
of such pre-deceased daughter; and
(c) the share of the pre-deceased child of a pre- deceased son or of a pre-deceased daughter, as such
child would have got had he or she been alive at the time of the partition, shall be allotted to the
child of such pre-deceased child of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as the case may
be.

Explanation.--For the purposes of this sub-section, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener
shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of
the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled
to claim partition or not.
This means that before the devolution of the parent's property, a notional partition must be
presumed to have occurred immediately before the parent's death, thereby determining the parent's
share in the coparcenary property. Once the share of the deceased parent is ascertained through this
notional partition, the legal heirs including children born from void or voidable marriages are
entitled to their rightful share in such property.
22. Accordingly, we find merit in the Appellant's concern and deem it necessary to modify the
Family Court's order by incorporating a specific clarification. This Court holds that the children
born from the Appellant and Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty are obviously entitled to inherit his
self-acquired property. Additionally, where the deceased parent was a Mitakshara coparcener, such
children shall also inherit their share in the ancestral property, limited to the portion that would
have been allotted to their parent upon a notional partition before their death. The Family Court's
order shall be modified to reflect this clarification.
23. In view of the above discussions, this Court finds no merit in the Appellant's other contentions.
As a necessary corollary, the jurisdiction exercised by the learned Judge, Family Court under Section
7(1)(b) of the Family Courts Act, is just and proper. Further, in view of our discussion as above, on
the issue of limitation, the suit is also not barred by limitation. Furthermore, the Family Court has
correctly declared the Respondent as the legally wedded wife of Late Kailash Chandra Mohanty and
his legal heir, entitled to inherit his ancestral and self-acquired property. As already discussed, the
judgment dated 12.12.2023 by the Judge, Family Court, Bhubaneswar, is modified to the extent that
the Appellant's children have the right to inherit the self-acquired property of Late Kailash Chandra
Mohanty, as well as their rightful share in his ancestral property, subject to the portion that would
have been allotted to him upon a notional partition before his death, as per section 6(3) of the HSA.
24. Accordingly, the Appeal is dismissed on merit, and the impugned judgment is upheld with the
aforementioned modification.
