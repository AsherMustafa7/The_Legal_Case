B E F O R E HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A. GUNESHWAR SHARMA For the petitioner :: Mr. HS.
Paonam, Sr. Adv. assisted by Mr. NG. Jotindra Luwang, Adv.
For the respondents :: Mr. M. Rarry, Special State Counsel; Mr. M. Hemchandra, Sr. Adv. assisted
by Mr. L. Sevananda, Adv. for R-5 Date of hearing :: 12,13,14,15,18,19&20 of September, 2023 Date
of Judgment and Order :: 15.12.2023 JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV) [1] The present writ petitions
have been filed by the petitioner under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for quashing the
impugned orders dated 28.09.2023 [WP(C) No. 613 of 2023] and 29.08.2023 [WP(C) No. 634 of
2023] issued by the Deputy Secretary (DP), Government of Manipur as arbitrary, malafide and
unconstitutional. The second impugned order dated 29.08.2023 is allegedly issued in supersession
of the first impugned order dated 28.08.2023, whereby the respondent No. 5 is allowed to look after
the charge of Director (Envt. & CC), Manipur as an interim measure till the appointment of a regular
Director. The petitioner has challenged both these orders on the ground of violation of the
guidelines issued by the Department of Personnel & Administrative Reform (Personnel Division),
Government of Manipur in Office Memorandum dated Page 2 03.10.2020 with respect to in-charge
appointment of seniormost in the cadre, where no eligible person as per the relevant Recruitment
Rules is available. Since the writ petitions involve the question of interpretation and applicability of
the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 based on the same factual matrix, these are heard
together and being disposed of by this common judgment.
[2] Another writ petition being WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 filed by the respondent No.5 herein
challenging the final seniority list in the cadre of Deputy Directors, Department of Environment and
Climate Change, Govt. of Manipur is also pending. Vide order dated 15.09.2023 in WP(C) No. 634 of
2023, this Court recorded that as the short question involved in the petition with respect to OM
dated 03.10.2020 and the matter having been heard extensively, these writ petitions [ WP(C) No.
613 of 2023 and WP(C) No. 634 of 2023] would be disposed of without filing of counter and
rejoinder affidavit at motion stage and all the parties agreed to this. Relevant part of order dated
15.09.2023 in WP(C) No. 634 of 2023 is reproduced below:
"Present Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Ng. Jotindra,
learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special counsel for the
State, assisted by Ms. T. Keishing, learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1,2,3 and 4
and Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Sevananda Sharma,
learned counsel for respondent No.5.
Due to paucity of time, this matter cannot be taken up today. List on 18.09.2023
along with connected matters, ie, WP(C) No. 613 of 2023 and WP(C) No. 289 of 2023
as part heard motion, first item.
It is made clear that WP(C) No. 613 of 2023 and WP(C) No. 634 of 2023 involve short
question as to whether the impugned orders dated Page 3 28.08.2023 and
29.08.2023 were issued in violation of the OM dated 03.10.2023.

Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
Since this matter has been heard extensively for three consecutive days, this Court is
inclined to dispose WP(C) No. 613 of 2023 and WP(C) No. 634 of 2023 at motion
stage without filing of counter and rejoinder affidavit.
With regard to WP(C) No.289 of 2023, parties are permitted to exchange their
pleadings."
In the circumstances, the matters are heard on merit on the basis of available materials, as pure
question of law of the applicability of OM dated 03.10.2023 is involved and there is no much
variance in the factual aspect.
[3] The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner was initially appointed as Data Analyst in the
Directorate of Environment & Climate Change, Manipur (erstwhile known as Environment and
Ecological Wing) on ad-hoc basis for a period of 3 (three) years vide the order dated 23.06.1999
issued by the Under Secretary (Forests and Environment), Government of Manipur and his service
was extended from time to time till the regularization of his service without any break. Vide order
dated 02.03.2007 issued by the Addl. Chief Secretary (Forests & Environment), Government of
Manipur, the petitioner's service was regularized. [4] The Principal Secretary (F & E), Government
of Manipur issued an order dated 24.12.2011 for strengthening and upgradation of the then existed
Environment and Ecology Wing of the Forest and Environment Department, Manipur into a
full-fledged Directorate of Environment, Manipur by redesignating the existing one post of Senior
Scientific Officer, Page 4 two posts of Scientific Officer as Director and Joint Directors respectively.
In continuation of the order dated 24.12.2011, another order dated 24.12.2011 was also issued by the
Principal Secretary (F & E), Government of Manipur for redesignating Dr. M. Homeshwar Singh
(Senior Scientific Officer, Environment and Ecology Wing and Dr. Y. Nabachandra Singh (Scientific
Officer as Director of Environment and Joint Director of Environment) respectively to the newly
created full fledged Directorate of Environment, Manipur.
[5] Vide order dated 09.03.2016 issued by the Joint Secretary (For. & Envt.), Government of
Manipur for re-designation with upgradation the post of Data Analyst (post held by the present
petitioner), Junior Scientific Officer and Research Officer (post held by respondent No. 5 namely
Mr. Tourangbam Brajakumar Singh) to the post of Deputy Director and there are 4 (four) posts of
Deputy Director in the Department without any specific classification. As the post of Data Analyst
was re-designated to the post of Deputy Director in the Department, it is equivalent to the newly
re-designated post of Deputy Director.
[6] Vide order dated 09.03.2016, the petitioner was posted against the newly re-designated post of
Deputy Director by an order dated 08.08.2016 issued by the Joint Secretary (Forests &
Environment), Government of Manipur in which the petitioner's name is at serial No. 1. A
notification dated 21.04.2020 issued by the Under Secretary (DP), Government of Manipur with

in the Directorate of Page 5 Environment & Climate Change, Manipur and the post of Joint Director

Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
Government of Manipur, the petitioner along with 2 (two) others (Deputy Directors) were given
in-charge of the work of Joint Director in the public interest as the post of Joint Director has been
lying vacant in the Department.
[7] The Director of the Department submitted a letter dated 10.08.2021 to the Addl. Chief Secretary
(Forest, Environment & Climate Change), Government of Manipur requested for
appointment/promotion of the 3 (three) Deputy Directors including the present petitioner to the 3
(three) vacant post of Joint Director on regular basis. Thereafter, seeking administrative approval in
order to issue final seniority of the 3 (three) Deputy Directors by a letter dated 06.09.2021 and the
petitioner's name appeared at serial No. 1 in the final seniority list of Deputy Directors in the
Department. Vide letter dated 07.02.2022, the Deputy Secretary (Forest, Environment & Climate
Change), Government of Manipur seeking information as to whether there is any claim on tentative
seniority list issued vide the Government letter of even number dated 17.08.2017 and the same has
been disposed of. Meanwhile, there was an objection from One Dr. T. Brajakumar (respondent No.
5) in respect of the tentative seniority list which was settled after due consideration. [8] In such
circumstances, the petitioner submitted a representation dated 04.03.2022 to the Addl. Chief
Secretary (Forest & Page 6 Environment), Government of Manipur requesting to consider the case
of the petitioner for promotion to the post of Joint Director in the Department. Thereafter, the said
representation was forwarded by the Director of Environment & Climate Change, Manipur to the
Addl. Chief Secretary (Forest, Environment & Climate Change), Manipur. As the representation
submitted by the petitioner was not conveyed and having no alternative, the petitioner approached
this Court praying for directing the respondents to consider the case of the petitioner for promotion
to the next higher post of Deputy Director to Joint Director as per RR as he has completed 5 (five)
years of regular service.
[9] Being aggrieved by the order dated 25.07.2022 issued by the Deputy Secretary, (For., Envt. &
CC), Government of Manipur, the petitioner challenged the same by filing a writ petition being
WP(C) No. 849 of 2022 wherein an interim order dated 19.10.2022 was passed directing the
respondents to carry out decision for promotion to the post of Joint Director in the Directorate and
to finalise the seniority list on or before 15.11.2022. As per the direction of the Hon'ble High Court,
the Deputy Secretary (For., Envt. & CC), Government of Manipur issued an order dated 11.01.2023
publishing a final seniority list of three Deputy Directors in the Directorate in which the petitioner is
at serial No. 1. Even though the final seniority list was published, no promotion to the post of Joint
Director was made despite the Hon'ble Courts' order. Thereafter, a notification dated 07.06.2023
was issued by the Deputy Secretary (For., Envt. & CC), Government of Manipur for holding the DPC
Meeting. On recommendation Page 7 of the DPC Meeting held on 09.06.2023 and vide order dated
15.06.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary (For., Envt. & CC), Government of Manipur, the
petitioner along with two incumbents were appointed on promotion to the post of Joint Director in
the Department of Environment and Climate Change, Manipur.
[10] However, the respondent No. 5 (who is at serial No. 3) in the seniority list of Deputy Director
challenged the said seniority list by filing a writ petition being WP(C) No. 262 of 2023 and the same
was dismissed as withdrawn. Thereafter, another writ petition being WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 was
filed and in the order dated 31.03.2023 wherein it is clearly mentioned that if the respondent No. 5

Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
[petitioner herein] and respondent No. 6 [Deputy Director at sl. No.2, and she is not a party in
WP(C) Nos. 613 & 634 of 2023] are given promotion on the basis of the seniority list, such
promotion shall be outcome of the said writ petition. However, there was no stay order of the final
seniority list of Deputy Directors. As per the notification dated 01.08.2017 issued by the Deputy
Secretary (For., Envt. & CC), Government of Manipur publishing the Rules regulating the method of
recruitment to the post of Director (re-designated from Senior Scientific Officer) in the Directorate
of Environment, Manipur, the feeder post of Director is Joint Director with 5 years of regular
service. [11] An Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 was issued by the Special Secretary (DP),
Govt. of Manipur regulating the appointment on in- charge basis to various post, when none is
found eligible from the feeder Page 8 cadre for appointment/promotion on regular basis. The
operative portion is reproduced herein below:
"4. Thus, with a view to bring uniformly, clarity and enforceable norms in making
such in-charge appointment, the following norms are nearby issued for compliance
by all concerned:
i. Appointment on in-charged basis shall be made against a post only when there is
no official eligible as per RR to fulfil the said post either by direct recruitment or
promotion through duly constituted DPC.
ii. In absence of any official eligible as per RR to fill up a particular post, the senior
most person amongst cadre/officials belonging to the feeder post of the said
particular post shall be appointed to hold the said post on in-charged basis, at no
extra remuneration and in addition to the substantial post held by the appointee in
lower post. Needless to say, the appointee shall draw pay against the lower post
substantially held by him.
iii. Where no arrangement can be made as in para (ii) above, an in-charge
appointment shall be made to a vacant post from a person holding a similar post (at
same rank and/or designation), at no extra remuneration.
iv. An official appointed on in-charge basis against any post shall have the same
financial power as a person appointed on substantial basis against the said post
would enjoy.
5. These instructions shall be applicable while making appointments on in-charge
basis to all posts under the State Government existing in all Government
departments, agencies, societies, bodies, offices, companies, PSUs, autonomous
bodies, etc."
Page 9 [12] Another Office Memorandum dated 09.03.2021 was issued by the Special Secretary
(DP), Govt. of Manipur in continuation of the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 adding (v) to
Para 4 and the same reads as below:

v. "Integrity certificate based on Vigilance Clearance, non-pendency of Departmental
Enquiry, non- pendency of FIR cases which has been taken cognizance by Magistrate
etc. is mandatory for in- charge appointments, especially the Head of Departments".
[13] In the light of the Office Memorandums dated 03.10.2020 and 09.03.2021, the
petitioner submitted a representation dated 19.06.2023 to the concerned authorities
requesting to consider his case for promotion to the post of Director in the
Directorate of Environment & Climate Change, Manipur on in-charge basis being the
senior-most incumbent and the said representation was not considered by the
concerned authorities. The petitioner filed a writ petition being WP(C) No. 491 of
2023 and the same was disposed of on 05.07.2023 directing the respondents
especially respondent No. 1 to consider the representation dated 19.06.2023
submitted by the petitioner on its own merit and in light of the Guideline of the Office
Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 and also directing to dispose of the same by issuing
a speaking order within a period of three months.
[14] Vide order dated 28.08.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary (DP), Govt. of Manipur, the
respondent No. 5 was appointed as Director on in-charge basis in violation of the Office
Memorandum dated 03.10.2020.
Page 10 By way of writ petition being WP(C) No. 613 of 2023, the petitioner has challenged the
order dated 28.08.2023 passed by the official respondents making the respondent No.5 herein as
Director on in-charge basis as violative of the OM dated 03.10.2020 as the latter is junior to the
petitioner who is the seniormost officer in the cadre of Deputy Director as well as Joint Director.
Vide order dated 31.08.2023 in WP(C) No. 613 of 2023, this Court stayed the impugned order dated
28.08.2023 till next date as violative of the OM dated 03.10.2020. It may be noted that respondent
No.5 appeared on 31.08.2023 by filing a caveat petition. However, the official respondent issued
another order dated 29.08.2023 in supersession of the earlier order dated 28.08.2023 making the
respondent No.5 to look after the charge of Director (Envt. & CC) as an interim arrangement till a
regular Director is appointed. It is submitted that the official respondent has malafidely issued the
impugned order dated 29.08.2023 by modifying the order dated 28.08.2023, which is under
challenge and the said impugned order is allegedly a back dated order because the same was neither
placed by the Government Advocate nor by the counsel for respondent No. 5 (who appeared on
caveat) before the Hon'ble Court while hearing the matter on 31.08.2023 for passing the interim
order dated 31.08.2023.

Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
[16] The short question of law involved in the present petitions is the interpretation and
applicability of the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 and subsequent Office Memorandum
dated 09.03.2021 issued by the Government of Manipur laying down guidelines for appointment of
the seniormost on in-charge basis, when none in the feeder cadre is eligible for appointment by
direct recruitment or by promotion as per Recruitment Rule.
[17] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that on the
recommendation of the Manipur Public Service Commission (in short, MPSC), vide order dated
02.03.2007 issued by the Govt. of Manipur, the petitioner was appointed on regular basis as Data
Analyst in the Forest & Environment Department, Manipur and vide another order dated
04.03.2009, his period of ad-hoc service wef 23.06.1999 to 01.03.2007 was linked up for the
purpose of pensionary benefit and not for other purposes including seniority. It is submitted that
the petitioner was regularly appointed on 02.03.2007. Learned senior counsel draws the attention
of this Court to an order dated 05.11.2011 appointing the respondent No.5 as Research Officer on
regular basis along with two other Page 12 persons as Junior Scientific Officers in the Environment
& Ecology Wing, Department of Forest & Environment, Manipur. Vide order dated 24.12.2011, the
Environment & Ecology Wing was upgraded to full fledged Directorate of Environment, Manipur
and by an order dated 04.11.2019, it was re-named as "Directorate of Environment & Climate
Change, Manipur". Thereafter, by an order dated 09.03.2016, there was a mass re-designation with
up-gradation along with incumbents in the new Directorate of Environment & Climate Change. In
this exercise, the post of Data Analyst (held by the petitioner), 2 post of Junior Scientific Officer and
one post of Research Officer (held by the private respondent No.5) were re-designated and upgraded
as four posts of Deputy Directors. The pay scale of the existing posts of Rs.9300-34800 + GP 4300
was upgraded to Rs.9300- 34800 + GP 5400. Consequently, an order dated 08.08.2016 was issued
appointing four employees as Deputy Directors on redesignation and the name of the petitioner was
placed at serial No.1 and that of the private respondent at No.4. In the Final Seniority List of 3
Deputy Directors (one died during service) dated 11.01.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary (For.,
Envt.&CC), Govt. of Manipur, the petitioner was placed at serial No.1 with initial date of regular
appointment as 02.03.2007 as Data Analyst and the respondent No.5 at serial No.3 with initial date
of appointment as 05.01.2011 as Research Officer. The final seniority of the Deputy Directors has
been challenged by the respondent No.5 herein by way of writ petition being WP(C) No. 289 of 2023
and vide order dated 30.03.2023, this Court passed an order that any appointment shall be subject
to the outcome of Page 13 the writ petition, but the final seniority was not stayed. Learned senior
counsel further submits that on the basis of a duly constituted DPC proceedings 09.06.2023 in
consultation with MPSC, the three incumbent Deputy Directors were recommended for promotion
to the three posts of Joint Directors on consideration of all relevant materials including the ACRs.
Accepting the recommendations of the DPC, the Deputy Secretary (For., Envt.&CC), Govt. of
Manipur promoted the three Deputy Directors to the higher posts of Joint Directors. In the
promotion order, the name of the petitioner is placed at serial No.1 while the respondent No.5 is
shown at serial No.3.
[18] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has stated that by an order dated
28.08.2023 (first impugned order) issued by the Deputy Secretary (DP), Government of Manipur,
the respondent No.5 was appointed to hold charge of Director (Environment & Climate Change) on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175406030/ 7
Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
in charge basis till appointment of a regular Director. Subsequently, by another order dated
29.08.2023 (first impugned order) and in supersession of earlier order dated 28.08.2023, the
respondent No.5 was allowed to look after the charge of Director (Environment & Climate Change)
on in charge basis till appointment of a regular Director as an interim measure subject to the
outcome of WP(C) No. 289 of 2023.
[19] Learned senior counsel has pointed out that the first impugned order dated 28.08.2023 was
challenged by the petitioner in WP(C) No. 613 of 2013 and vide order dated 31.08.2023, this Court
stayed the order dated 28.08.2023 till next date. It is submitted that the second Page 14 impugned
order dated 29.08.2023 was issued in order to frustrate the interim order dated 31.08.2023 of
suspending the first order dated 28.08.2023 granted by this Court in WP(C) No.613 of 2023. It is
vehemently submitted that the second order dated 29.08.2023 was back- dated for the simple
reason that both the State and private respondent No.5 who appeared on caveat in WP(C) No. 613 of
2013 did not produce the order dated 29.08.2023 during the course of hearing on 31.08.2023 and
the second impugned order dated 29.08.2023 was produced for the first time on 11.09.2023 by the
State respondent during the course of hearing of WP(C) No. 613 of 2013. The petitioner also
challenged the subsequent order dated 29.08.2023 in WP(C) No. 634 of 2013 on similar grounds as
taken in WP(C) No. 613 of 2013 and additional ground of back- dated order.
[20] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner draws the attention of this Court to
the order dated 09.03.2016 for re- designation and up-gradation, the order dated 08.08.2016 of
posting on actual re-designation of the petitioner and others in the cadre of Deputy Directors and
the final seniority list of Deputy Directors dated 11.01.2023. In the seniority list, the initial date of
regular appointment is shown as 02.03.2007 from the date of appointment as Data Analyst, while
for other incumbents including the respondent No.5, same is shown as 05.01.2011. It is submitted
that there is no illegality in placing the petitioner as the senior most Deputy Director. Learned
senior counsel has pointed out that the final seniority list is not stayed by this Court in the writ
petition being Page 15 WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 challenged by the respondent No.5 herein and only
promotion done on the basis of this seniority list will be subject to its outcome. It is stated that the
final seniority list of Deputy Directors can be considered for any including promotion, in-charge
arrangement, etc. [21] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner further refers to the
proceedings of the DPC dated 09.06.2023 for promotion to the post of the Joint Directors where the
petitioner was recommended at serial No.1 and the respondent No.5 at serial No.3 on the
consideration of the seniority, ACRs and other aspects and promotion order dated 15.06.2023. He
submits that in view of Para 2.2 of the Office Memorandum dated 03.07.1986 issued by Department
of Personnel & Training, Govt. of India determining the seniority position of the promotees in the
order in which they are recommended by the DPC. It is clarified that until a final seniority list which
is different from the order recommended by the DPC is issued by the competent authority, it will be
safe to consider the seniority list for the time being. Reference is made to the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of B. Thirumal v. Ananda Sivakumar:
(2014) 16 SCC 593 @ Para 18, 19 & 23 to the point that if no selection procedure is
involved in upgradation, it is merely giving a financial benefit and cannot be
considered as a promotion to higher post. It is stated that in the case in hand, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175406030/ 8
Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
order dated 09.03.2016 for re-designation and up-
gradation, the order dated 08.08.2016 of posting on actual re-designation of the petitioner and
others in the cadre of Deputy Directors, are nothing but simple re-designation of the earlier posts as
Deputy Directors and are Page 16 not promotion orders. Hence, the petitioner will retain his
seniority wef 02.03.2007 while the respondent No.5 and other wef 05.01.2011. It is emphasised that
the petitioner is seniormost both in the cadre of Deputy Director as well as Joint Director.
[22] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner explains the object behind the Office
Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 where the Govt. of Manipur laying down the guidelines for making
in- charge appointment to a post where none in the feeder post is eligible for. He refers to Para 4 of
the OM and as per Para 4(ii), the seniormost in the feeder cadre is to be made in-charge
appointment till regular appointment. It is further mentioned that the petitioner is seniormost in
the cadre of Deputy Director as well as Joint Director. The impugned orders dated 28.09.2023 and
29.08.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary (DP), Govt. of Manipur allowing the respondent No.5 to
look after the charge of Director till appointment of a regular Director is void ab-initio as the same
has been issued in violation of OM dated 03.10.2020. It is clarified that as there is no vigilance case
or FIR against the petitioner, the OM dated 09.03.2021 will not be applicable to the petitioner. Mr.
HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner vehemently submits that the OMS have
statutory value as issued in exercise of power under Article 309 of the Constitution. It is pointed out
that Para 4(iii) of OM dated 03.10.2020 will not be attracted at the first instance and the same is to
be resorted only when none is available under Para 4(ii). With respect to the passing of the interim
order, learned senior counsel refers to the decisions reported as (2004) 4 SCC Page 17 697, (2007) 11
SCC 447 and (2009) 10 SCC 388. It is prayed that the impugned orders dated 28.08.2023 and
29.08.2023 be set aside and the petitioner be made in-charge Director as stipulated under OM
dated 03.10.2020.
[23] Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special Counsel for State submits that the OM dated 03.10.2020 is not
issued under Article 309 of the Constitution and hence it has no statutory value for strict
compliance. Even if it is presumed to be applicable, Para 4(iii) of the OM has been invoked for
making in-charge arrangement by a person holding same rank. It is clarified that the respondent
No.5 is also holding the same rank as the petitioner, being promoted on the same day. In absence of
final seniority list in the feeder cadre of Joint Director, there is no wrong in preferring the
respondent No.5 considering his contribution and expertise in the filed of environment and climate
change. Learned counsel submits that in absence of final seniority list, Para 4(ii) of the OM will not
be applicable. Mr. Rarry, learned counsel refers to a judgment dated 31.08.2023 passed by a learned
Single Judge of this Court in WP(C) No. 527 of 2023 where Mr. HS Paonam successfully argued that
a junior can be made in-charge arrangement on the basis of the same OM. Mr. HS Paonam however,
clarifies that in the case cited herein, the senior was having vigilance case and was not considered in
view of Para 4(v) of OM dated 09.03.2021. [24] Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special Counsel for State
further has pointed out that there is no material to show that the second impugned order dated
29.09.2023 was issued backdated in order to frustrate the Page 18 interim order dated 31.03.2023
passed in WP(C) No. 613 of 2023 staying the first impugned order dated 28.08.2023. During the
course of hearing of these cases, learned counsel for State submits that one post of OSD equivalent

Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
to Director has been framed and offered to the petitioner. On instruction, Mr. HS Paonam, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner rejected the offer. Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special Counsel for State
relies on the decisions of (2009) 12 SCC 175 @ Pr 18 [wrong provision or non- mentioning of
provision does not make the order invalid], (1988) 4 SCC 275 @ Pr 12,13&14 [whole text should be
read from beginning to end while interpreting any document], (2007) 10 SCC 548 @ Pr 25, (2003) 5
SCC 604 @ Pr. 49, & (2003) 11 SCC 614 @ Pr 44 [seniority is not a fundamental right], (2008) 8
SCC 348 @ Pr. 16&17, & (2007) 3 SCC 470 @ Pr. 5,7,12,18,19 [limited effect of interim order, if not
extended], and (1988) 7 SCC 469 @ Pr. 8 [ case must establish on pleadings]. It is prayed that there
is no illegality in the impugned orders and the writ petitions may be dismissed being devoid of any
merit.
[25] Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. L. Sevananda, learned counsel for
the respondent No.5 has pointed out that the impugned orders are not as per the Office
Memorandum dated 03.10.2020. It is clarified that for applicability of the OM, there should be an
appointment of a person on in-charge basis at the first place. In the present case, the first order
28.08.2023 has been superseded by the second order dated 29.08.2023 to rectify the mistake of
considering the cadre Deputy Director while all the incumbents are holding posts of Joint Directors.
It is Page 19 pointed out that in the second order dated 29.08.2023, the crucial word 'appointment'
is not used and the said order has been issued in the administrative exigency. He further continues
that even if the OM is presumed to be applicable for the sake of argument, but not admitting, the
OM will not be applicable as there is no final seniority list in the cadre of Joint Directors. It is
pointed out that the allegation of backdated order is not proved by any material. Learned senior
counsel for the respondent No. 5 refers to Black Law Dictionary (4th Edition) with respect to the
definition of appointment and Principle of Statutory Interpretation (14th Edition) by Justice GP
Singh regarding giving plain and literal meaning to the contents of the impugned order dated
29.08.2023. To emphasise his other points, learned senior counsel refers to the case laws reported
as 1991 (2) SCC 773, (2007) 4 SCC 737 and (2003) 4 SCC 289. It is further submitted that judicial
review does not lie against the administrative order issued in the exigency of the service and in
public interest, unless patent illegality on face of it is apparent. Accordingly, it is prayed that the writ
petitions be rejected.
[26] This Court considers the rival submissions made at bar, the materials on record and settled
proposition of law. Since the pure question of law of applicability of OMs dated 03.10.2020 and
09.03.2021 are considered on the admitted facts without calling for counter and rejoinder affidavits,
this Court will not go into other allegations of back-dated order and final seniority list. The available
seniority lists will be considered for the Page 20 limited issue with respect to the OMs. It is clarified
that the final seniority list of Deputy Directors is not stayed in WP(C) No. 289 of 2023. [27] On a
bare perusal of the OM dated 03.10.2020, nothing is mentioned that it was issued in exercise of
power under Article 309 of the Constitution. Hence, there is force in the submission of Mr. M. Rarry
that the same does not have statutory value. However, it will be necessary to examine the object
behind issuing the same. In Para 4 of the OM, it is stated that the same is issued "... with a view to
bring uniformly, clarity and enforceable norms in making such in-charge appointments..." and Para
4(ii) stipulates consideration of the seniormost in the feeder cadre and 4(iii) empowers State to
appoint any other person when seniormost is not available. This Court is of the view that Para 4(ii)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175406030/ 10
Mr. Phurailatpam Vivekananda Sharma vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 15 December, 2023
has to be considered first if no eligible person as per Recruitment Rule is available and when such
senior person is not available, resort to Para 4(iii) may be made. In view of Para 4(v) of OM dated
09.03.2021, the seniormost incumbent may be ignored, if there is vigilance or FIR case is pending
against him, specially with respect to in-charge appointment of Head of Departments. The OMs will
be binding in case of appointment of in-charge arrangement is to be made. It is the considered
opinion of this Court that OMs dated 03.10.2020 and 09.03.2021 are binding on the State
Government while making in- charge appointment when such aspect are not found in the relevant
rules. The submission of Mr. M. Hemchandra that the impugned order dated 29.08.2023 is not
issued as per OM dated 03.10.2020 does not have any Page 21 merit. The order dated 29.08.2023 is
an in-charge appointment in disguise to frustrate the OMs and this submission is rejected. [28]
Applying the facts of the present case to the views observed in Para 27 above, the writ petitions can
be disposed of on the basis of materials available on record.
[29] It is admitted that as on the petitioner is seniormost in the cadre of the Deputy Director, unless
the final seniority list dated 11.01.2023 is set aside finally in WP(C) No. 289 of 2023. Moreover, as
per recommendation of DPC held on 09.06.2023 for promotion to Joint Director and actual
promotion order and posting dated 15.06.2023, the petitioner can be considered seniormost
tentatively until finalisation of seniority of Joint Directors, in view of Para 2.2 of OM dated
03.07.1986 issued by DoPT, Govt. Of India.
[30] In the case of Government of AP v. AV Venugopala Rao:
(1995) 1 SCC 159, Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld as rational and reasonable that
pending finalisation of seniority list, seniormost eligible employee in the provisional
list could be made in-charge of the promotional post to avoid administrative hardship
or heart burning among rival claimants. Reading the ration of this case along with the
OMs dated 03.10.2020 and 09.03.2021, pending finalisation of the final seniority list
of Joint Directors, the petitioner is at least provisionally seniormost in the cadre of
the Joint Directors. This Court is of the view that the petitioner Page 22 should be
considered as Director on in-charge basis till appointment of a regular Director as no
vigilance case or FIR is pending against him.
[31] In the circumstances, the writ petitions are allowed and impugned orders dated 28.08.2023
and 29.08.2023 are set aside. The State respondents are directed to appoint the petitioner as
in-charge Director (Envt. & CC), Manipur within a period of 15 days from the receipt of this
judgment. No cost. Misc. applications, if any, are disposed of accordingly.
[ 32] This Court appreciates the valuable assistance given by the learned counsel appearing for the
parties.
[33] List WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 on 15.01.2024 for further proceedings.
[34] Send a copy of this judgment to the respondent No.1 for information and doing needful.
