Nemichandra vs State Of U.P. on 2 January, 2025
Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the accused-applicant is innocent. He has been falsely
implicated in this very case crime number and is languishing in jail since 09.09.2024. He has no
criminal antecedent and there is no likelihood of his fleeing from course of justice or tampering with
evidence in case of release on bail. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is
not named in the FIR. Applicant's name disclosed in the statement of the co-accused. No specific
role has been assigned to the 87applicant. Nothing incriminating has been recovered from the
possession of the applicant. No useful purpose would be served by detaining the applicant. Learned
counsel for the applicant submits that co-accused Mukesh Kumar Agarwal has already been
enlarged on bail by this Court on 2.12.2024 in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 38235 of 2024.
Hence, bail has been prayed for.
Learned AGA has vehemently opposed the prayer for bail.
Considering all above facts and circumstances, the nature of accusations, severity of the punishment
in the case of conviction and nature of supporting evidence, reasonable apprehension of tampering
with the witness and prima facie case, but without commenting on merit of case, a case for bail is
made out.
Accordingly, the bail application is allowed.
Let the accused-applicant, Nemichandra, involved in above mentioned case crime number be
released on bail, on his executing a personal bond and two reliable sureties each, in the like amount
to the satisfaction of the court concerned, subject to the following conditions:
1. The applicant will not tamper with the evidence.
2. The applicant will not indulge in any criminal activity.
3. The applicant will not pressurize/intimidate the prosecution witnesses and
co-operate in the trial.
4. The applicant will appear regularly on each and every date fixed by the trial court,
unless his personal appearance is exempted through counsel by the court concerned.
In the event of breach of any of the aforesaid conditions, the court below will be at liberty to proceed
to cancel his bail.
