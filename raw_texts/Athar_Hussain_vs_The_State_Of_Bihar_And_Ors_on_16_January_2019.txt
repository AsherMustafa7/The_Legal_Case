CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and
HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA
Patna High Court CWJC No.17650 of 2017 dt.16-01-2019
2/7
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE) Date : 16-01-2019 This public interest litigation was
filed through Shri Ram Pravesh Nath Tiwari as a counsel for the petitioner. During the pendency of
this PIL, an application has been filed by the petitioner being I.A. No. 7008 of 2018 through a
different counsel stating therein that in view of the action taken he does not propose to press this
writ petition any further.
A supplementary counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the District Minority Welfare Officer
bringing on record the report of the committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Additional
Collector, Aurangabad to report on the allegations of unlawful constructions having been raised
while setting up a commercial complex on the property of the Wakf. In this supplementary counter
affidavit filed today it has been asserted that set back areas have been violated and shops in excess of
the sanctioned map appear to have been constructed.
In this regard, what is relevant is the affidavit of the Respondent No. 7 and the report submitted by
its officials. The notice which was given by the Junior Engineer informing the Executive Officer of
Nagar Parishad, Aurangabad on 29 th July, 2017 is on record as Annexure 4 to the writ petition
which Patna High Court CWJC No.17650 of 2017 dt.16-01-2019 indicates that on inspection it was
found that the constructions were being raised in violation of the sanctioned map. A counter
affidavit which has been filed on behalf of the contesting Private Respondent Nos. 9 and 10 contains
another report of three officials of the Nagar Parishad, Aurangabad, dated 21 st August, 2017
indicating the rectifications that were being carried out and if they are permitted, the deviations
would stand removed. This is Annexure R-9/5 to the said counter affidavit.
The Respondent No. 7 has filed a counter affidavit and along with it has appended the report dated
22nd November, 2017 in which slight deviations have been indicated in respect of the set back areas.

Athar Hussain vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 January, 2019
It appears that the property is a Wakf property and is undisputedly under the supervision, control,
and governed by provisions of the Muslim Wakf Act, 1995. One Mr. Khurshid Ahmed, who is a Ward
Councillor, filed Wakf Appeal No. 10 of 2017 before the Wakf Tribunal in respect of the same Wakf,
which is pending consideration. It is thereafter the present public interest litigation was filed and
when this was brought to the notice of the tribunal, the tribunal had to pass an order adjourning the
matter which order is Annexure 9/1 to the counter affidavit of the Respondent No. 9.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17650 of 2017 dt.16-01-2019 At this stage, we may put on record that
after entertaining this public interest litigation, an order was passed on 22nd February, 2018 which
is extracted hereinunder.
"Respondent No. 4 is granted four weeks' time to file counter affidavit.
However, it is clarified that in case it is finally found that construction has been made
illegally, respondent No. 4 will have to remove the construction at their own cost.
List after four weeks."
This was followed by an interim order on 4th July, 2018 directing the parties to maintain status quo
the same is extracted hereinunder.
"Let a copy of the counter affidavit filed by Respondent No. 7 be served on the
counsel appearing for Respondent No. 9 onwards. He may seek instructions in the
matter and submit a report.
In the meanwhile, Respondent No. 5, The District Magistrate, Aurangabad is directed
to look into the grievance of the petitioner, the counter affidavit filed by Respondent
No. 7 and give his say with regard to the allegations of illegal construction, the report
submitted by the Nagar Parishad and the consequential action taken in the matter.
List after four weeks.
In the meanwhile, status quo with regard to the construction as is existing today shall
be maintained. We are constrained to pass the aforesaid orders keeping in view the
report submitted by Respondent No. 7 which is before us indicating prima facie there
to be illegal construction in the area in question."
It is thereafter that the District Magistrate appears to have prepared his report and which has been
made now part of the supplementary counter affidavit of Respondent No. 5, filed Patna High Court
CWJC No.17650 of 2017 dt.16-01-2019 today in Court. In the said supplementary counter affidavit,
the deviations that were reflected in the report of the Nagar Parishad have been indicated, coupled
with some other deviations with regard to increase in the number of shops having been constructed
which, according to affidavit, is in deviation to the sanctioned plan.

Athar Hussain vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 January, 2019
Having considered the submissions raised and keeping in view the application for withdrawing the
PIL that has been filed today, it would be apt for us to comment that the petitioner is stated to be an
accused in a murder trial which fact has been categorically stated in paragraph 14 of the affidavit of
Respondent No. 9 mentioning that the petitioner is accused for an offence under Section 302,
Indian Penal Code, at Aurangabad in P.S. Case No. 446 of 1997, the trial whereof is still pending. We
are, therefore, constrained to observe that we are doubtful about the bona fides of the petitioner in
maintaining this Public Interest Litigation as the allegations against him are that keeping in view his
background he tried to pressurise the Managing Committee of the Wakf to gain favours of allotment
of shops. We are, however, not investigating the same, but suffice it to say that if this is the status of
the petitioner, then the filing of a PIL by such a person should be discouraged.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17650 of 2017 dt.16-01-2019 At the same time, since it has been
brought on record that there have been deviations in the constructions, then the Nagar Parishad,
Aurangabad, is entitled to take action against the Wakf for having deviated from the plan for which
it has ample powers under the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007.
So far as any mismanagement on the part of the Wakf is concerned, the same is already engaging the
attention in the Appeal filed by Mr. Khurshid Ahmed and we are of the considered opinion that such
matters stand covered by the provisions of Section 83 of the Muslim Wakf Act, 1995. Consequently,
the Wakf Tribunal shall hopefully deal with the matter keeping in view the entire fact relating to the
controversy which may fall within its jurisdiction for an appropriate decision. This will, however, not
prejudice the power of the Nagar Parishad to take action in respect of the Municipal laws applicable
for raising unlawful constructions.
We have also noticed that this Court has passed an order of status quo on 4th of July, 2018. We
would, therefore, maintain the said order for the time being with a direction to the Nagar Parishad
to pass an appropriate order in relation to the status of the constructions after putting the concerned
Wakf through its Mutawali or Managing Official to notice in Patna High Court CWJC No.17650 of
2017 dt.16-01-2019 accordance with law within a period of six weeks from today on presentation of a
certified copy of this order before the Executive Officer of the Nagar Parishad, Aurangabad.
We further direct that Appeal No. 10 of 2017 stated to be pending before the Wakf Tribunal shall
also be dealt with expeditiously and shall be disposed off preferably not later than 6 months from
today after giving opportunity in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed
thereunder to the respective parties.
The Public Interest Litigation, therefore, is disposed off with the aforesaid directions.
The order of status quo shall continue till the passing of the order by the Nagar Parishad,
Aurangabad or the Wakf Tribunal, as the case may be.
