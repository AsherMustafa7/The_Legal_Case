On the basis of the aforementioned common fact scenario, the individual cases are
analyzed as below.
2. The prosecution story in the present case runs as follows:
On 21.10.2017 at about 1.45 PM, one Suresh Chandra Jena of village Kumarpur,
District- Bhadrak lodged a written report before the I.I.C., Basudevpur Police Station
alleging that on 21.10.2017 at about 9.30 PM., while they were taking dinner, six
persons entered into his house from back door being covered their faces. One of the
accused abused the informant and snatched away his mobile phone and put a
'Bhujali' on his neck. The accused persons took away other two mobile phones. They
tied the informant, his son and parents by means of a napkin. Thereafter they took
away all the gold earrings, gold chain from the mother of the informant. They also
took away 5 nos. of gold rings, gold chain, one pair of ear flower and cash of
Rs.15,000/- from the room of the father of the informant. The informant alleged that
one of the accused person was armed with 'Bhujali' and another was holding 'Gun'
and rest accused persons were holding 'Knives'. Thereafter, the informant lodged the
F.I.R. against the accused persons in Basudevpur Police Station. Accordingly, I.I.C.,
Basudevpur Police Station registered F.I.R. in Basudevpur P.S. Case No.218 of 2017
against the accused persons.
3. Out of total eight accused persons, five accused persons were arrested and subjected to trial.

Chinmaya Mallick @ vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 6 March, 2024
4. Learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Basudevpur, District-Bhadrak, vide its judgment dated
29.06.2022 had recorded an acquittal in favour of five accused persons. The prime ground for
recording acquittal in favour of those accused persons are that the gold ornaments seized from the
possession of the accused were subjected to T.I. Parade and the ownership could not be established.
Learned trial Court has also recorded that in the said case, no offensive weapons have been seized
from the possession of the accused persons, though the allegation was that the accused persons have
used 'Bhujali', 'gun' and 'knife' for committing the crime. Therefore, learned trial Court had recorded
acquittal in favour of five accused persons.
5. In this case, there were eight accused persons, out of whom, five accused persons were
apprehended and including the petitioner, three accused persons were absconded.
6. The prosecution against five accused persons, inter alia, alleged that on 31.10.2017 at about 2.30
PM, one Santanu Kumar Jena of village Chandanpur, District- Bhadrak lodged a written report
before I.I.C., Basudevpur Police Station alleging therein that on the previous night at about 10.00
PM, while he was watching T.V., two miscreants entered into his house being armed with 'Bhujali'
by covering their faces. By showing 'Bhujali', the accused persons tied his son and wife. Thereafter,
the accused persons took away the gold ornaments, 2 nos. of ATM cards and cash of Rs.15,000/- by
breaking the godrej almirah. The informant lodged the F.I.R. against the accused persons in
Basudevpur Police Station. Accordingly, the I.I.C., Basudevpur Police Station registered F.I.R. in
Basudevpur P.S. Case No.226 of 2017 against the accused persons.
7. Learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Basudevpur, District- Bhadrak, vide its judgment dated
30.05.2022 had recorded an acquittal in favour of five accused persons. The ground of acquittal
primarily was that, though the accused persons were arrested on 26.11.2017, the Investigating
Officer had conducted T.I. Parade of those accused persons only on 19.03.2018 after a delay of 111
days. The delay this caused has not been explained. Therefore, the T.I. Parade was doubted. The
gold ornaments alleged to have been stolen in the case and recovered from the accused persons also
could not be proved. Therefore, five accused persons set to trial were acquitted.
8. In this case, there were seven accused persons. The prosecution case in nut-shell as projected in
F.I.R. is that the informant namely Biswanath Swain lodged an F.I.R. at Naikanidihi Police Station
on 26.06.2017 at 11.29 AM alleging therein that on 25.06.2017 night at about 8.15 AM, three
unknown persons covering their faces being armed with deadly weapons i.e. 'Knife' and 'Bhujali'
entered into his house and assaulted him. When his wife protested, they snatched away her mobile,
tied her hands and legs and by threatening to kill them and took away the gold ornaments and cash
breaking the almirah and confined them in a room by locking from outside. On receiving such
allegation, in absence of the then O.I.C., Naikanidihi Police Station, S.I. of Police Kulamani Patra
registered the F.I.R. in Naikanidihi P.S. Case No.110 of 2022 against the accused persons.
9. On the basis of the aforementioned acquittal orders have been passed by the learned trial Courts
in all the three cases in the separate trial qua the accused person. The present petitioner seeks
quashment of all the three cases qua him seeking parity with the accused persons who all are
acquitted.

Chinmaya Mallick @ vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 6 March, 2024
10. I have perused the case records in all the above three cases and found that the petitioner is a
deliberate absconder and was absconding till the outcome of the trial of the other accused persons.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution in all the three cases are qua the accused persons set for
trial. The primary ground for acquittal in all the three cases are because of the faulty T.I. Parade
conducted by the Investigating Officer and non-proving of the seized gold ornament. Since the
present petitioner has been absconding in all the three cases, question of subjecting him to T.I.
Parade does not arise. Therefore, the ground of acquittal of the co-accused persons in so far as
doubtful T.I. Parade is concerned, shall not enure to his benefit. In so far as non-proving of the
ownership of the recovered gold ornaments are concerned, it is pertinent to mention here that apart
from the gold ornaments, various other articles were allegedly stolen by the accused persons. Since
the petitioner has been absconding, obviously nothing was recovered from him. The recovery was
affected from the accused persons who were subjected to trial and the said recovery could not be
proved by the prosecution. Therefore, the benefit was extended to those accused persons. The
petitioner cannot derive benefit of the same. As per the prosecution, all the accused persons were
attributed separate overt act in committing the crime. Accused persons were armed with deadly
weapons. Therefore, who was holding which weapon and what is recovered from which accused is
definitely material to the case. There cannot be any recovery from the absconding accused,
therefore, the role of the absconding accused needs to be ascertained from trial.
11. Mr. Satya Narayan Mishra (4), learned counsel has appeared for the petitioner and relied upon
the judgment in the case of Satyaban Pradhan @ Kuna Pradhan vs. State of Odisha passed in
Criminal Misc. Case No.4441 of 2015 reported in (2016) 63 OCR 87 and submits that this Court in
similar case has given indulgence and quashed the criminal prosecution. He has relied upon para-6
of the said case which reads as under:
"6. In applying the principle laid down in the aforesaid cases, this Court finds that the
main accused Madhab Chandra Sahoo, who had allegedly assaulted the informant on
his face by means of a stone with an intention to commit his murder, has already
been acquitted. The allegation against the present petitioner is that he caught hold of
the informant and threw him on the ground and caught hold of him. When the
prosecution could not prove the main allegation of commission of offence under
Section 307 of the IPC against the co-accused and he has been acquitted of the
charges under Section 232 Cr.P.C., there is hardly any possibility of proving the case
under Section 307/34 of the IPC against the present petitioner. So, in this view of the
material on record, this Court is of the opinion that it will be appropriate for this
Court, for ends of justice and to prevent abuse the process of law to quash the
proceeding against the absconding accused i.e. the petitioner in its entirety by
exercising the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C."
12. The petitioner cannot derive benefit of the judgment in Satyaban Pradhan @ Kuna Pradhan
(supra) because he has no parity on facts with that case. The petitioner also relies upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Javed Shaukat Ali Qureshi vs. State of Gujarat
passed in Criminal Appeal No.1012 of 2022 reported in (2023) 9 SCC 164 and submits that if the
principal accused has been acquitted, the trial against him would be a futile exercise. I have perused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171590575/ 5
Chinmaya Mallick @ vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 6 March, 2024
the said judgment. Para-19 of the said judgment reads as under:
"19. We have found that the case of accused no.2 stands on the same footing as
accused nos.1, 5 and 13 acquitted by this Court. The accused no.2 must get the benefit
of parity. The principles laid down in the case of Harbans Singh will apply. If we fail
to grant relief to accused no.2, the rights guaranteed to accused no.2 under Article 21
of the Constitution of India will be violated. It will amount to doing manifest
injustice. In fact, as a Constitutional Court entrusted with the duty of upholding
fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, it is our duty and obligation
to extend the same relief to accused no.2. Therefore, we will have to recall the order
passed in the special leave petition filed by accused no.2."
Learned counsel for the petitioner further relies upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Mohd. Wajid vs. State of U.P. reported in (2023) 92 OCR (SC) 98 and submits that the
continuation of the criminal case against the accused persons would be nothing but abuse of the
process of law and noted that for the purpose of quashing the F.I.R. or criminal proceedings, the
criminal antecedents of the accused cannot be the sole consideration. It was also added that an
accused has a legitimate right to say before the Court that howsoever bad his antecedents may be,
still if the F.I.R. fails to disclose commission of any offence or his case falls within one of the
parameters as laid down by the Court in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), then the Court should not
decline to quash the criminal case only on the ground that the accused is a history - sheeter.
In so far as Mohd. Wajid (supra) case is concerned the said case was regarding quashment of the
F.I.R. On the basis of non- disclosure of any offence from the perusal of the case initiated against the
petitioner. Therefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has said that on the ground of criminal
antecedent, the quashing petition should not be turned down without looking into the merits of the
case.
13. Perusal of the aforementioned passage indicates that acquittal of the co-accused persons would
enure to the benefit of the petitioner, if he could establish parity with the acquitted accused persons.
However, in the instant case, the petitioner is involved in three cases and he has been absconding.
Therefore, he cannot draw parity with the facts of the cases he has cited.
14. Finally, the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the case of
Anant Mishra @ Amit Mishra @ Surya Prakash Mishra vs. State of U.P. and Another in an
Application U/S 482 No.1325 of 2021. He has relied upon para-6 of the said judgment which reads
as under:
"6. If two persons are prosecuted, though separately, under the same charge for
offences having been committed in the same transaction and on the basis of the same
evidence, and if one of them is acquitted for whatever may be the reason and the
other is convicted, then it will create an anomalous position in law and is likely to
shake the confidence of the people in the administration of justice. Justice is not only
to be done but also seem to be done. Therefore, I am clearly of opinion that as has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171590575/ 6
Chinmaya Mallick @ vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 6 March, 2024
been held in the case of Pritam Singh v. State of Punjab. (S) AIR 1956 SC 415, the
principle of stare decisis will apply in the present case and the applicant's conviction
cannot be sustained."
After going through the judgments relied by learned counsel for the applicant, it is very much clear
that Court has held that considering the testimony of witnesses, if one accused is acquitted, no
criminal proceeding can be sustained against co- accused on the same set of witnesses and in the
present case too, there is no separate witness and on the basis of testimony of same prosecution
witnesses, main accused was acquitted by the court below, whenever there is no prospect of the case
ending in conviction, valuable time of court should not be wasted for holding trial only for the
purpose of completing the procedure to pronounce the conclusion on future date. Therefore,
criminal proceeding cannot be permitted to continue against the applicant."
15. In the aforementioned case, there were two accused persons and both of them were similarly
situated. Therefore, acquittal of one accused person enure to the benefit of the other.
16. However, the facts scenario of the present case is completely different. Moreover, the petitioner
is involved in three cases. The co- accused persons in all the three cases were acquitted on the
ground that the prosecution could not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt on the strength of
evidence adduced vis-à-vis those accused persons.
17. The acquittal of all the accused persons are centered on the lack of evidence adduced by the
prosecution regarding the recovery and non- identification of the recovered articles from the
accused persons.
Apart from that, the T.I. Parade was not appropriately conducted. Therefore, it could be safely
inferred that the evidence adduced by the prosecution though was insufficient to secure conviction
against the accused persons, but definitely those evidences were vis-à-vis the accused persons those
who have faced the trial.
It is an admitted fact that the petitioner has been an absconder in all the three cases. Therefore,
there was no occasion for the investigating agency to affect any recovery from the petitioner and
there was no occasion for the police to subject the petitioner to T.I. Parade.
In that view of the matter, the inevitable conclusion is that the prosecution should get opportunity to
lead evidence qua the present petitioner so as to establish the guilt of the petitioner.
In view of the aforementioned facts, I am not inclined to quash the criminal prosecutions against the
petitioner in all the three cases. However, I am of the view that the learned Trial Court should do
well to see that the trial of all the three cases are concluded as expeditiously as possible, because all
the cases are as old as 7 years.
18. With the aforesaid observation, all the above three cases are disposed of.
