[2] The present five writ petitions had been filed with the prayer, inter alia, for quashing and setting

issued in favor of the petitioner, as well as for quashing and setting aside the fresh NITs dated

As the facts and issues involved in the five writ petitions are the same, all the writ petitions were

WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 2 The case of the petitioner is that with a view to enhance

meeting held on 12-10-2019 to adopt restricted tender for the contract work of infrastructure
development of 3 (three) Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) at Moreh, Tamenglong &
Gamnom, Sapermaina. Pursuant to the said Cabinet decision, the Under Secretary (Tribal Affairs &
Hills), Government of Manipur sent a proposal to the Director, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Govt. of
Manipur to adopt restricted tender in respect of the contract works for infrastructure development
for the said three EMRS where estimated cost of each work is less than 1.5 crore, vide letter dated

[5] After the issuance of the NIT dated 10-02-2020 and before issuing the work orders dated
12-06-2020, the Government of India imposed total lockdown in the whole country due to the
pandemic of Covid-19 from the later part of March, 2020. Even after partial lifting of the total
lockdown imposed by the Government of India, the State Government continued to impose total
lockdown in the whole state to contain the pandemic of Covid-19 and to safeguard the health and
lives of the citizens.
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 5 It is also the case of the petitioner that the premises of all the
three EMRSs' at Tamenglong, Sapermaina and Moreh were utilized as quarantine centers from the
month of May, 2020 as per the orders of the concerned District Magistrate and only after the
issuance of the order dated 02-11-2021, the Government stopped utilizing the said three school
premises as quarantine centers for covid patients. According to the petitioner, during the period
from the month of May, 2020 till the month of November, 2020, the premises of the said three
schools were utilized by the Government as quarantine centers/containment zone and because of
the strict restriction imposed by the Government, movement in and around the premises of the said
three schools were strictly prohibited. Due to the aforesaid situation prevailing in the state of
Manipur, the petitioner could not start execution of the work within the period stipulated under the
terms and conditions No. 2 of the work order dated 12-06-2020. It is also the case of the petitioner
that in view of the nature of the works awarded to him, he could not start executing the works unless
and until construction of the building for staff quarters, Science Blocks, Hostel Blocks etc., which
were awarded to other contractors are completed.
[6] The petitioner verbally requested the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government
of Manipur, for giving necessary technical guidance and selection of work site so as to enable him to
start the work and complete the same on time. Instead of providing necessary technical guidance
and selection of work site as requested by the petitioner, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs &
Hills, Government of Manipur issued an order dated 01-12-2020 cancelling all the work orders
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 6 issued in favor of the petitioner on the ground that the
petitioner failed to start executing the work within the time stipulated under clause (2) of the terms
and conditions of the work orders. [7] After issuance of the cancellation order dated 01-12- 2020,
the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur, issued an NIT dated
07-12-2020 in respect of the same works earlier awarded to the petitioner. Having been aggrieved,
the petitioner assailed the cancellation order dated 01-12-2020 and NIT dated 07-12-2020 by filing
a writ petition being WP(C) No. 146 of 2021 before this Court. In the said writ petition, this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22110800/ 4
Envision Construction And Suppliers vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
passed an interim order on 25-02- 2021 directing that the process of tender in respect of the
impugned NIT shall remain suspended. During the pendency of the said writ petition, the Executive
Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur issued an order dated 17-03-2021
cancelling the earlier NITs dated 10-02-2020 as well as the subsequent NIT dated 07-12-2020.
Subsequently, the Executive Engineer-II issued an order dated 22-03-2021 revoking the first
cancellation order dated 01-12-2020 as well as another order dated 01-12-2021 reviving/restoring
the earlier NIT dated 10-02- 2020.
[8] In view of the revocation of the first cancellation order and restoration of the earlier NITs dated
10-02-2020, this Court disposed of the pending writ petition by passing an order dated 10-12-2021.
In the said order, this Court directed the State respondents to re-schedule the time period that has
been prescribed in the work order dated 12-06-2020. The petitioner communicated the orders
passed by this Court to the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur,
by WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 7 submitting a representation dated 12-01-2022 and also
requested to allow the petitioner to commence the works and to extend the time period for
completion of the work. [9] Instead of allowing the petitioner to commence work by re-scheduling
the time period prescribed in the work order, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills,
Government of Manipur issued an order dated 29-12-2021 cancelling, for the second time all the
earlier work orders issued in favor of the petitioner. Thereafter, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal
Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur issued another three NITs all dated 13-01-2022 in respect of
the same work awarded earlier to the petitioner and without cancelling the first NITs dated 10-02-
2020. Having been aggrieved, the petitioner challenge the said cancellation order dated 29-12-2021
as well as the new NITs dated 13-01-2022 by filing WP(C) No. 63 of 2022 before this Court. In the
said writ petition, this Court passed an interim order on 27-01-2022 directing that the impugned
NITs shall remain suspended. Subsequently, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills,
Government of Manipur, issued two orders dated 04-03-2022 and 09-03-2022 cancelling the
impugned NITs as well as the impugned cancellation order dated 29-12-2021. In view of the said
two orders, all the writ petitions filed by the writ petitioner challenging the said NITs and the
impugned cancellation order were closed as infructuous. [10] The State Government filed a batch of
writ appeals challenging the common orders dated 06-12-2021, 08-12-2021 and 10-12-2021 passed
by the learned Single Judge in the batch of writ petitions directing the state authorities to
re-schedule the time period that was prescribed in the work order issued in favor WP(C)No. 378 of
2022 & Ors Page 8 of the petitioner. All the writ appeals were disposed of by a common order dated
28-03-2022 passed in Writ Appeal No. 6 of 2022 and other analogous writ appeals by setting aside
the direction given by the learned Single Judge to re-schedule the time period for execution of the
work pursuant to the work order issued in June, 2020. The Appellate Court further directed the
authorities to consider the reply submitted by the petitioner in response to the show cause notice
dated 14-01-2021 by giving an opportunity of personal hearing and thereafter, to decide each case as
to whether there was any willful delay or negligence on the part of the contractor concerned
warranting punitive action. The Appellate Court further observed that in the event, no such lapse is
found to be attributable to the contractor concerned, the authorities shall re-schedule the time
period for the execution of works.

[11] In purported compliance with the direction of this Court, the authorities issued a show cause
notice dated 04-04- 2022 directing the petitioner to submit in writing on or before 16- 04-2022 as
to why he could not execute the works awarded to him within the period stipulated under clause (2)
of the terms and conditions of the work order. In response to the said show cause notice, the
petitioner submitted his reply in writing on 13-04-2022 explaining in detail the reasons for the
inability to commence the works. Subsequently, the Additional Chief Secretary (TA & Hills),
Government of Manipur, issued an order dated 26-04-2022 cancelling all the work orders dated
12-06-2022 awarded to the petitioner and also directing to issue fresh tenders and fresh work
orders. Thereafter, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur issue
three fresh NITs all dated 11-
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 9 05-2022 in respect of the works earlier awarded to the
petitioner. Having been aggrieved, the petitioner filed the present writ petitions assailing the said
cancellation order dated 26-04-2022 and the NIT dated 11-05-2022 for redressing his grievances. In
the present writ petitions, this Court passed interim order dated 24-05-2022 directing that no
further steps should be taken up pursuant to the impugned NIT dated 11-05-2022 without leave of
this Court.
[12] Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that before issuance of impugned order
dated 26-04- 2022, the work orders awarded to the petitioner were cancelled by the authorities on
two earlier occasions. At the first instance of cancellation, the reason given by the authorities was for
non- commencement of the execution of work as per clause (2) of the terms and conditions of the
work order. Subsequently, the authorities revoked the cancellation order suo moto by issuing
another order, which clearly indicated that the reason for cancellation of the work order was
unjustified. At the time of issuing the second cancellation order, no reason whatsoever was given by
the authorities for cancelling the said work orders. Later on, the second cancellation order was again
revoked by the authorities suo moto, thereby clearly indicating that there was no justifiable reason
for cancelling the work orders awarded to the petitioner. For the third time, the authorities again
cancelled the work orders awarded to the petitioner by issuing the impugned orders dated
26-04-2022. The only reason given by the authorities for such cancellation is for breach of clause (2)
of the terms and conditions of the work orders dated 12-06-2020.
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 10
[13] Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
under clause (2) of the terms and conditions of the work order, there is no term and condition for
cancellation of the work orders if the contractor breach any of the conditions mentioned therein.
Only under clause (3) of the said terms and conditions, it is provided that if 50% of the work is not
executed within the given time of completion of the work, it will be sufficient ground for cancellation
of the work. Learned counsel further submitted that as the authorities cancelled the work orders
dated 12-06-2020 awarded to the petitioner on 01-12-2020 well before the expiry of the given
period for execution of the work, there was no reason whatsoever for cancelling the work orders
awarded to the petitioner. Learned counsel accordingly submitted that the authorities have acted
arbitrarily and unreasonably in issuing the impugned order and such action deserved interference
from this Court by quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated 26-04-2022.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22110800/ 6
Envision Construction And Suppliers vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
[14] Learned counsel also submitted that as there was no justifiable reason for cancellation of the
work orders awarded to the petitioner and as the authorities have not yet cancelled the earlier NIT
dated 10-02-2020, there was no reason for issuing the impugned NITs dated 11-05-2022 and that
the authorities have issued the impugned NIT without application of mind and accordingly, the
impugned NITs are also liable to be quashed and set aside.
[15] It is also submitted that in spite of the best intention and effort on the part of the petitioner,
work at the allotted sites could not be started because of the prevailing situation in the State due to
the pandemic of Covid-19. After the award of the WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 11 work order,
the petitioner was unable to commence the work because of several restrictions in entering the work
site as the premises of the three EMRS were declared as containment zone. It has also been
submitted that there was also acute shortage of labour as the labour force was unwilling to work
under the prevailing Covid-19 situation and that the Government SOP issued in connection with the
Covid-19 pandemic prohibits labour force to work in groups. The learned counsel for the petitioner
vehemently submitted that in view of the nature of works awarded to the petitioner, it was not
possible for the petitioner to start the work unless and until the construction of the building for staff
quarters, science blocks, hostel blocks etc., are completed by the other contractors. It has also been
submitted that if the authorities gave a little co-operation, the petitioner could have completed the
work within the stipulated time.
[16] Learned counsel also submitted that, the authorities ignored the request of the petitioner to
provide technical guidance and selection of work site etc., which are required to be followed as per
the terms and conditions of the work order before commencing the work and that without
specifically identifying the work site, without providing the specific task to be done and without
providing the technical guidance as to how the task are to be performed, it was not feasible and
practicable for the petitioner to execute the work. It is also submitted that the work orders awarded
to the petitioner have been cancelled without giving any valid and justifiable reason and by ignoring
the reply to the show cause notice as well as the reasons/explanations given therein. Accordingly,
the action of the authorities in cancelling the work orders are arbitrary, bias, unlawful and illegal.
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 12 Learned counsel also submitted that the authorities made an
unreasonable allegation against the petitioner in the impugned order that the petitioner failed to
start execution of the work despite lapse of more than 18 (eighteen) months. In this regard, learned
counsel for the petitioner submitted that the reason for non-commencement of the execution of
work was due to non- cooperation of the on the part of the officials of the department in giving
technical guidance and selection of work site as well as the impossibility of commencing the work
during the pandemic of Covid-19 as well as the nature of work to be executed by the petitioner and
that the authorities never consider these valid reasons at the time of issuing the impugned order.
[17] Mr. A. Vashum, learned G.A. appearing for the respondents, submitted that the petitioner was
awarded the contract works for infrastructure development of EMRS at Tamenglong, Gamnom,
Sapermeina and Moreh by issuing work the orders dated 12.06.2020. As per the terms and
conditions of the contract work, the petitioner was to attend the office of the respondents to
complete the agreement and other formalities within 7 (seven) days from the date of the issue of the
work order. Secondly, the petitioner was to start execution of the work from 18.06.2020, i.e., 7
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22110800/ 7
Envision Construction And Suppliers vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
(seven) days after the date of issue of the work order. Thirdly, if the petitioner does not execute 50
percent of the work within the time allocated for completion of the work, it is sufficient ground for
cancellation of the work order. Fourthly, as soon as the work order was issued, the petitioner was to
contact the Assistant Engineer In-charge of the work immediately and obtain a necessary technical
guidance and selection of work site etc. before the commencement of the work.
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 13
[18] The learned G.A. further submitted that in spite of
obtaining the work order dated 12.06.2020, the petitioner never contacted the Assistant Engineer
In-charge of the work and also did not complete the agreement and other formalities as stipulated in
the terms and conditions of the contract work. It has also been stated that since the petitioner did
not contact the Assistant Engineer In-charge of the work and since the petitioner did not commence
the work within the stipulated time, the authorities cancelled the work order on 01.12.2020 in terms
and conditions under clause (1), (2), (3) & (6) of the terms and conditions of the work order.
[19] The learned G.A. submitted that the Division Bench of this Court disposed of the batch of writ
appeals filed by the State Government by common order dated 28.03.2022 by setting aside the
direction given by the learned Single Judge to re- schedule the time period for execution of the work.
While disposing of the said batch of writ appeals, the Division Bench also directed the authorities to
consider the reply submitted by the petitioner in response to the show cause notice dated 14.01.2021
by giving an opportunity of personal hearing and thereafter to decide each individual case as to
whether there was any willful delay or negligence on the part of the contractor warranting punitive
action. It has been submitted that in compliance with the order passed by the learned Division
Bench, the authorities heard the petitioner in person and also considered the reply submitted by
him in response to the show cause notice dated 04.04.2022 and passed the impugned order dated
26.04.2022 thereby cancelling the work orders awarded to the petitioner.
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 14
[20] The learned G.A. also submitted that the authorities
issued similar work orders to different contractors for executing the work of water harvesting and
solar pumps installation in the same 3 (three) schools, i.e., EMRS at Tamenglong, Gamnom,
Sapermeina and Moreh, Tengnoupal during the same period of Covid pandemic. It has also been
submitted that the other contractors successfully executed the said works within the prescribed
period for completion of the works, whereas the petitioner failed to execute the works awarded to
him. It has also been submitted that if the other contractors can execute the work during the period
of Covid Pandemic, the petitioner cannot take the plea that he cannot execute the work awarded to
him because of the pandemic of Covid - 19, which shows that the petitioner does not want to execute
the work.
[21] The learned G.A. vehemently submitted that the claim of the petitioner that the authorities did
not provide necessary technical guidance and selection of work site etc. despite his request is
unacceptable because the petitioner requested the concerned Executive Engineer for providing such
technical support and selection of work site only after a gap of more than 5 (five) months and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22110800/ 8
Envision Construction And Suppliers vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
accordingly, the authorities cannot accede to the request made by the petitioner. It has lastly been
submitted by the learned G.A. that the authorities have not committed any illegality or irregularity
in issuing the impugned orders and accordingly, the present writ petitions are liable to be dismissed
as being devoid of merit.
[22] I have heard the submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length and also
carefully examined the materials available on record.
WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 15 It is an undisputed fact that the work orders dated 12.06.2020
issued in favour of the petitioner were earlier cancelled twice by the authorities. The first cancelation
order was issued on 01.12.21020, just hardly after about 6 (six) months from the date of issue of the
work order only on the ground that the petitioner failed to start execution of the work within the
period stipulated under clause (2) of the terms and conditions of the work order. The second
cancellation order was issued on 29.12.2021 without assigning any reason whatsoever. The
authorities subsequently revoked both the cancellation orders suo moto, thereby indicating that the
authorities did not find any justifiable reasons for cancelling the said work orders. For the third
time, the authorities again cancelled the work orders issued in favour of the petitioner by issuing the
impugned order dated 26.04.2022. The reason for the cancellation was that the petitioner failed to
start execution of the works despite the lapse of more than 18 months and the petitioner had
breached the conditions under Clause (2) of the terms and conditions of the work orders. The
authorities were also of the viewed that the reasons given by the petitioner in his written reply to the
show cause for not starting the work has no relevancy [23] On careful examination of the terms and
conditions provided under the work orders, this Court is of the considered view that Clause (2) does
not provide that the starting date of the work is the essence of the contract and that failure to strict
adherence thereto would attract cancellation of the contract. It is only under Clause (3) where there
is condition for cancellation of the work, if 50 percent of the work is not executed within the allotted
time of 12 months. In the present case, the cancellation WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 16 of the
work orders was not for breach of the condition under Clause (3) of the terms and conditions of the
work orders. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that the grounds given by the
authorities for cancellation of the works are unreasonable, arbitrary and ultra vires the terms and
conditions provided under the work orders.
[24] In the present case before issuance of the first cancellation order dated 01.12.2020, the
petitioner requested the concerned authorities of the government for providing necessary technical
guidance and selection of work site for starting the contract works, however, instead of providing the
necessary technical guidance and selection of work site, the authorities, in a most arbitrary manner
issued the first cancellation order. In fact till today, the constructions of the buildings of Staff
quarters, Science Block, Hostel Blocks etc., have not yet started by the other contractors, hence, it
will be impssible for the petitioner to start the work of water supply and sanitary installation,
internal electrification, etc., in the buildings which are yet to be constructed and the authorities have
not also provided the necessary technical guidance and selection of work site to enable the petitioner
to start execution of works despite the repeated request made by the petitioner. In view of this
factual aspects, this Court is constrained to hold that the authorities have acted unreasonably and
arbitrarily in accusing the petitioner that he failed to start execution of the work despite lapses of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22110800/ 9
Envision Construction And Suppliers vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
more than 18 months, when the fault lies with the authorities. [25] The sequence of events starting
from issuance of the first cancellation order leading to the cancellation of the work WP(C)No. 378 of
2022 & Ors Page 17 orders for the third time on the same invalid and unreasonable ground and
subsequent issuance of the fresh NIT indicates that the authorities do not want the petitioner to
execute the work at any cost. The work orders which have been lawfully awarded to the petitioner
after fulfilling all the legal norms and requirements cannot be cancelled at the whims and fancies of
the authorities. There should be a reasonable justification for the cancellation and absence of any
reasonable justification will render the official action unlawful and illegal.
[26] Only in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents, a new ground had been introduced by the
respondents for cancelling the work orders awarded to the petitioner. It had been stated by the
respondents in their counter affidavit that the authorities issued similar work orders to other
contractors for executing the work of Water Harvesting and Solar Pumps Installation in the same 3
(three) EMRS at Tamenglong, Sapermeina and Tengnoupal during the same period of pandemic of
Covid - 19 and that the other contractors successfully executed the said works within the prescribed
period for completion of the works, whereas the petitioner failed to execute the work awarded to
him. It has also been stated that if the other contractors can execute the work during the period of
Covid pandemic, the petitioner cannot take the plea that he could not execute the work awarded to
him because of the pandemic of Covid - 19, which shows that the petitioner does not want to execute
the works. These new grounds were never mentioned by the authorities in the impugned order
dated 26.04.2022.
In my considered view, the validity of the impugned order must be judged on the basis of the
reasons mentioned WP(C)No. 378 of 2022 & Ors Page 18 therein and the new grounds introduced
by the respondents in their counter affidavit cannot be entertained while judging the validity of the
impugned order. In this regard, we can gainfully rely to the principle of law laid down by a
constitution bench of 5 (five) Judges of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Mohinder Singh Gill &
Anr. Vs. The Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi & Ors. reported in (1978) 1 SCC 405 wherein
it is laid down as under:-
"8. The second equally relevant matter is that when a statutory functionary makes an
order based on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons so
mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or
otherwise. Otherwise, an order bad in the beginning may, by the time it comes to
Court on account of a challenge, get validated by additional grounds later brought
out. We may here draw attention to the observations of Bose, J. In Gordhandas
Bhanji:
Public orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed
in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of
what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do. Public orders
made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect
the actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed
objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself.
