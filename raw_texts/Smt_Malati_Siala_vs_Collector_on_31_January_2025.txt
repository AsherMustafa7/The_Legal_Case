CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A.C.BEHERA
Date of Hearing :15.01.2025 :: Date of Judgment :31.01.2025 A.C. Behera, J. The petitioner has
approached this Hon'ble Courts through this writ petition praying for quashing the final order dated
02.04.2014 passed in Consolidation Case No.28 of 2013 under Sections 34 & 35 of the Odisha
Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation of Land Act, 1972 (in short OCH & PFL
Act, 1972) vide Annexure-1 by the Collector, Balasore.
2. The factual backgrounds of the matter, which prompted the petitioner for filing of this writ
petition is that, the petitioner purchased A0.72 ½ decimals of chaka land of Plot No.1423, chaka
No.179 under Consolidation Khata No.270 in Mouza Samasundarpur under Simulia Tahasil in the
district of Balasore from its recorded owners i.e. Purna Chandra Jena and Damodara Jena with
consent of their other co-sharers i.e. Binod Jena and Purusottam Jena through Registered Sale Deed
No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 on payment of due consideration amount, to, which, Maheswar Dalai,
Narendra Prasad Dalai and Ananta Prasad Dalai challenged the same by filing a case vide
Consolidation Case No.28 of 2013 before the Collector, Balasore against the petitioner of this writ
petition arraying her as opposite party No.4 along with her vendors and consentors of the Sale Deed
No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 under Sections 34 & 35 of the OCH & PFL Act, 1972 praying for declaring
that sale deed in favour of the writ petitioner as void and to evict her (writ petitioner- purchaser)
from her above purchased Chaka land, as she has purchased the same creating fragment of Chaka
No.179 without being a land owner of a contiguous Chaka, because they (Maheswar Dalai, Narendra
Prasad Dalai and Ananta Prasad Dalai) are the land owners of its contiguous Chaka of the sold land
from Chaka No.179.

3. After hearing from both the sides, the Collector, Balasore allowed that Consolidation Case No.28
of 2013 filed by Maheswar Dalai, Narendra Prasad Dalai and Ananta Prasad Dalai as per its final
order dated 02.04.2014 (Annexure-1) holding that, the petitioner of this writ petition (who was
opposite party No.4 in Consolidation Case No.28 of 2013) has purchased the properties i.e. A0.72 ½
decimals of Chaka land of Plot No.1423, Chaka No.179 under consolidation Khata No.270 through
RSD No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 in violation of Section 34 of the OCH & PFL Act, 1972, for which, the
said sale deed vide R.S.D. No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 is declared as void and the purchaser i.e.
opposite party No.4 of that Consolidation Case No.28 of 2013 is to be evicted from the disputed land
covered under the above Sale Deed No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 and directed to the Tahasildar,
Simulia to evict her (opposite party No.4 in Consolidation Case No.28 of 2013) from the disputed
land forthwith.
The opposite party No.4 of that Consolidation Case No.28 of 2013 challenged that final order passed
on dated 02.04.2014 (Annexure-1) by the Collector, Balasore by filing this writ petition against the
Collector, Balasore arraying him as opposite party No.1 along with the petitioners and opposite
party Nos.1 to 3 in that Consolidation Case No.28 of 2013 as opposite party Nos.2 to 7.
4. I have already heard from the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned Addl. Standing
Counsel for the State (opposite party No.1), learned counsel for opposite party No.7 and learned
counsel for opposite party Nos.5 & 6.
5. As per the Odisha Gazette Notification No.2910 dated 29.12.2023, Chapter-V of OCH & PFL Act,
1972 relating to Prevention of Fragmentation containing Sections-33, 34 & 35 has already been
omitted from the Statute Book of The OCH & PFL Act, 1972 and a new Section as Section 36A has
been inserted into the said Statute Book i.e. OCH & PFL Act, 1972 and the said newly inserted
Section 36A is as follows:-
"Section 36A- Any transfer or partition of agricultural land in a locality creating
fragmentation made under the Principal Act before the commencement of the Odisha
Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation of Land (Amendment)
Act, 2023, shall be treated as valid:
Provided that cases where any eviction has been made by the Collector under
sub-Section (2) of Section 35 of the Principal Act as omitted in this Act shall not be
reopened."
Taking into account the above omissions and insertions as per Notification No.2910 dated
29.12.2023 in the Statute Book i.e. The OCH & PFL Act, 1972, it has been clarified by this Hon'ble
Courts in a case between Benudhar Swain Vrs. Bahudi Jena reported in 2024 (II) OLR- 261 that,
"this Section i.e. Section 36A has been introduced in the Statute as per Section 3 of the Amendment
Act, 2023, which have come into force w.e.f. 29.12.2023."
It has been envisaged in Section 36A of The OCH & PFL Act, 1972 that, "any transfer or partition of
agricultural land in a locality creating fragmentation made under the principal Act before

Smt. Malati Siala vs Collector on 31 January, 2025
commencement of the Amendment Act shall be treated as valid."
6. Here in this writ at hand, when the transfer of agricultural land has been made through RSD
No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 in respect of A0.72 ½ decimals out of A1.45 decimals of plot No.1423
from Chaka No.179 under Consolidation Khata No.270 in Mouza Samasundarpur before
commencement of Amendment Act, 2023 i.e. before 29.12.2023, then at this juncture, in view of the
above omissions of entire Chapter-V and insertion of Section 36A into the Statute Book of The OCH
& PFL Act, 1972 as well as the clarifications about the same made above in the ratio of the above
decision of the Hon'ble Courts in a case between Benudhar Swain Vrs. Bahudi Jena reported in
2024 (II) OLR-261, the above sale made by the opposite party Nos.5 to 7 in favour of the petitioner
in this writ though R.S.D. No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 cannot be held as invalid/void.
For which, in other words, it is held that, the said sale deed No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 in favour of
the writ petitioner is not void.
7. Therefore, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is allowed on contest.
Accordingly, the final order dated 02.04.2014 (Annexure-1) passed in Consolidation Case No.28 of
2013 by the Collector, Balasore declaring the R.S.D. No.1440 dated 31.10.2008 as void is set aside
and quashed.
8. As such, the writ petition is disposed of finally.
