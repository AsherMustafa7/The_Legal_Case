In case of default in payment of fine he has further been

conviction and sentence was passed in Sessions Trial No. 281
of 1982 { arising out of Andar P.S. Case No. 64 of 1982} by
Shri Om Prakash Rai, learned Sessions Judge, Siwan.
3. The case has got a chequered history. In the case
occurrence had taken place long back on 29.05.1982 in which
three persons from prosecution side were done to death and
number of others received injuries. Initially 19 accused
persons were put on trial and by judgment dated- 31.03.1992
learned Special Judge -cum -Additional Sessions Judge,
Siwan acquitted all the 19 convicts and discharged them from
charge under Section 302 read with 149 of the I.P.C. and also
under Section 302/34 of the I.P.C. and instead the learned
Special Judge -cum- Additional Sessions Judge, Siwan by
judgment dated 31.03.1992 in Sessions Trial No. 281 of 1982
convicted some of the accused persons under Section 304 read
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019
6/43
with Section 114 of the I.P.C. and other Sections of the I.P.C.
and also acquitted /discharged the accused persons from
offence under Section 27 of the Arms Act. After the judgment
of conviction and sentence dated 31st March, 1992 and
28.04.1992
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 5
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
respectively passed by Shri Jhauri Prasad Paul, learned Special Judge - cum- Additional Sessions
Judge, Siwan, the said judgment of conviction and sentence was assailed by all the 19 convicts
before this court by filing five different appeals i.e. Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 36 of 1992, Cr. Appeal
(D.B.) No. 37 of 1992 , Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 38 of 1992, Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 44 of 1992 and Cr.
Appeal (D.B.) No. 98 of 1992. The said appeals were finally taken up by a Division Bench of this
court and on considering the fact that conviction order was under Section 304 of the I.P.C. and there
were some discrepancies, by judgment dated 23.07.2015 the co-ordinate bench allowed all the
appeals and set aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence and remitted back the matter
with a direction for re- trial from the stage of hearing arguments of both the sides. It is apt to
incorporate the relevant concluding paragraphs of the judgment of Co- Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 ordinate Bench of this Court passed in earlier appeals, which
are as follows:-
"10. We after having heard the learned counsel for the appellants and after having
considered the evidence of the witnesses and without expressing any opinion as
regards the merits of the evidence and the findings recorded by the court below, want
to go the part of the judgment by which the learned trial judge had recorded the
findings of guilt against the appellants. If the charges had been proved by the
evidence then we find that there was no material discussed by he learned trial judge
to justify that it could be a case under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code and even
if it could be assumed by taking the worst view that an offence under Section 304 of
the Indian Penal Code was made out, we simply could not reconcile ourselves to the
sentence passed by the learned trial judge upon those appellants who had been held
guilty under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code and were directed to suffer
rigorous imprisonment for fourteen years. Likewise, if there was an unlawful
assembly, as appears held by the learned trial Judge, as he was convicting some of the
appellants under Section 147 of the Indian Penal Code and others of them under
Section 148 of the Indian Penal Code , which unlawful assembly had a common
object, as appears from the above finding of guilt, then we simply could not reconcile
ourselves again as to how the others who were not convicted for homicide either
punishable under Section 302 or under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code could
be acquitted for the charges under Sections 302/149 or 302/34 of the Indian Penal
Code. The learned trial judge had never stated in his judgment that there was any
grave and sudden provocation or that the accused persons had acted in exercise of
their right of private defence and exceeded it, rather the learned trial judge had held
that the accused persons, while the informant alongwith the three deceased were
retreating from the plot of land over which the Jamun tree was standing, were chased
down and beaten up as a result of which three persons died and seven others were
badly injured. This was a case in which a reasonable - consciencious person could not
come to a conclusion that there could be conviction only under Section 304 of the
Indian Penal Code and that too only against some of the nineteen appellants. Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 The way the learned trial
Judge approached the evidence in order to marshalling the facts indicates a pure
mechanical illegal approach without considering the facts in the light of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 6
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
provisions of the Indian Penal Code and further appears as if the learned trial Judge
was not trained in applying the provisions of the Indian Penal Code to the facts of a
case and then reaching a conclusion as to what offences were made out. He appears
probably falling in slumber while dictating the judgment as his own findings were
conflicting to each other as at the one time he was finding an unlawful assembly with
common object and at the other he was not applying the appropriate provision to
convict all the appellants under the principles of vicarious liability creating the
offence under Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The judgment was written in a
manner which defied the weight of the evidence on record.
11. Some of the submissions that Ram Bilash Pathak had not been charged under
Section 304/149 of the Indian Penal Code and was still convicted of that offence
appears serious contention. Likewise, the submission of the prosecution that the
learned trial Judge was unmindful of his duties of appreciating the facts so as to
reaching a just conclusion and, as such, it was urged that the judgment be set aside
and a direction be issued to the trial Court to hear the parties again and to pass a
fresh judgment. While making the above submission, it was contended that a time
frame should be fixed for delivery of the judgment after hearing the parties again.
12. None framing of charge or omission to frame charge or framing of wrong charge
are not going to have any impact on the judgment of conviction as regards the
findings recorded by the learned trial court in view of the provisions of Sections 468
and 465 Cr.P.C. In Kantilal Chandulal Mehta (supra), the Supreme Court was also
pointing out that position of law with reference to Section 535 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 which corresponds to the present provision of Section 464 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In that view of the matter, the conviction of Ram
Bilash Pathak under Sections 304/114 of the Indian Penal Code might not have been
of such importance as to allowing his appeal but what we found was that the learned
counsel for the parties had rightly pointed out that the judgment impugned herein
was so perverse as regards the application of the law to the established facts that it
was extremely desirable Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017
dt.20-08-2019 that this Court acting under Section 386 Cr.P.C. ought to direct
rehearing of the arguments of the parties so that a fresh judgment was passed after
due application of mind by appreciating the facts so as to applying the law properly to
them. The learned Judge was holding that there was an unlawful assembly and that
unlawful assembly had a common object as well in prosecution whereof the murder
of three persons was committed and, as such, he was convicting some of the accused
under Section 147 and some other under Section 148 of the Indian Penal Code but the
curious aspect of the judgment is that he was simply ignoring the application of
Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code by virtue of which a charge under Section 302 of
the Indian Penal Code had been framed and was not assigning any reason as to why
after being found members of an unlawful assembly some of the members of which
had committed culpable homicide the others who were acting in prosecution of the
same common object should not be convicted even for that offence. We do not want
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 7
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
to express our opinion in spite of holding a very concrete one as to what offence could
be constituted in the light of the evidence which was adduced by the prosecution
during the trial, but we do feel that the trial court is required to pass fresh judgment
as it was necessary to be done so as to imparting justice fully and completely. The
present judgment was ridiculous and had only heaped injustice not only to the
informant and the three deceased persons and their families but also to the accused
persons who had either been not adequately convicted or had been convicted and
sentenced improperly.
13. These are some of the reasons besides the others which we do not want to express
so as to avoid prejudicing the retrial which we are ordering. In the light of the
evidence and the observations which we have recorded in brief by giving brief
reasons, we allow the appeals, set aside the judgment of conviction and order of
sentence passed upon the appellants and direct the retrial of Sessions Trial No. 281 of
1982 from the stage of hearing arguments on both the sides. We shall request the
District & Sessions Judge, Siwan that he should list this case in his Court and take up
the hearing of the trial on a day to day basis. The appellants are on bail. They are
directed to surrender in the court below and the District & Sessions Judge shall allow
them to remain on bail and if he so desires, he may ask them to furnish fresh bail
bonds to his own satisfaction. We fix a Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of
2017 dt.20-08-2019 time frame of three months from the date of receipt of the lower
court records with the copy of the present judgment as the counsel for both the
parties have undertaken before us to conclude the hearing so that the judgment is
delivered within three months as noted above.
14. Before we part, we want to point out that we have noted down the age of some of
the appellants, like, accused Harendra Pathak, Keshav Pathak, Tarkeshwar Pathak,
Yogendra Pahak and Dilip Kumar Pathak who could be in our opinion less than 18
years on 29.05.1982. The learned trial Judge may examine their case in the light of
the provisions of the Juvenile Justice ( Care and Protection of Children ) Act, 2000
and after due enquiry, if they are found aged below 18 years on 29.05.1982 then their
case may be sent to the Juvenile Justice Board for enquiry as per the provisions of the
above noted act. We want further to point out that during pendency of these appeals,
Swaminath Pathak, Paras Nath Pathak, Ram Pravesh Pathak, Ramjee Pathak and
Prahalad Pathak died. As such, the trial court should not spend any time on that
aspect of the trial. The trial shall continue only against the surviving accused persons.
With the above observations and directions, the trial is remanded back in terms as
indicated above by allowing the five appeals.
15. We believe that the learned District & Sessions Judge, Siwan shall not be
prejudiced by any observation made herein nor he shall go through the impugned
judgment and shall pass his judgment independent of any observation/ findings
recorded by any court. The learned trial Judge shall not hesitate in passing any
judgment which, in his opinion, appears justified under the facts and circumstances
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 8
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
of the case."
4. It is evident that till disposal of earlier appeals altogether six convicts, namely: Swaminath
Pathak, Paras Nath Pathak, Ram Pravesh Pathak, Ramjee Pathak and Prahalad Pathak had already
died and as such trial was to continue only against surviving accused persons. In respect of some of
the accused considering their age the earlier Bench of Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of
2017 dt.20-08-2019 this Court also directed the learned trial judge to examine their cases in the
light of provisions contained in Juvenile Justice {Care and Protection of Children} Act, 2000. After
the case was remitted back the case of two convicts were considered and convicts - Dilip Kumar
Pathak and Keshav Pathak were declared juvenile and finally case of twelve accused persons who are
appellants before this court was tried from the stage of argument and by the impugned judgment of
conviction and sentence all twelve appellants were convicted and sentenced and same has been
assailed in the aforesaid two appeals.
5. Short fact of the case is that on 29.05.1982 at 22.30 Hours [ 10.30 P.M.] fardbyan of Brajesh
Kumar Pathak [P.W. 7] , S/o Sheo Shanker Pathak [deceased], resident of village- Barwan, P.S. -

- Surendra Giri and D.W. 12 - Gautam Prasad an other Advocate's Clerk, however primarily it was

11. On the basis of evidence available on record the learned Special Judge- cum -Additional Sessions
Judge, Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 Siwan firstly by judgment of
conviction dated 31 st March 1992 though convicted accused persons under Section 304 read with
114 of the I.P.C. and other penal Sections, acquitted the appellants from the charge under Section
302/ 149 and Section 302/ 34 of the I.P.C. however, the said judgment was assailed earlier by filing
appeals and appeals were allowed on 23.7.2015 and the case was remitted back to the court below
with a direction to the learned Sessions Judge to re-hear the case from the stage of argument and
now finally by the impugned judgment appellants have been convicted and sentenced even under
Section 302/149 of the I.P.C. By the impugned judgment altogether 12 accused persons were
convicted and sentenced.
12. Shri Kanhaiya Prasad Singh, learned senior counsel who has appeared on behalf of the sole
appellant- Ram Vilas Pathak @ Sudama Pathak @ Ram Velas Pathak in Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 771 of
2017 has argued that only evidence against appellant /Ram Vilas Pathak @ Sudama Pathak @ Ram
Velas Pathak was that he was an order giver who had simply ordered to assault and he did not
intend to order any one to kill however in the occurrence altogether Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 three persons from prosecution side were done to death. It has been
emphasized that while he had ordered there was no intention to kill anyone rather his intention was
only inflicting some injuries or assault the prosecution side and as such it has been argued that
learned Special Judge -cum -Additional Sessions Judge at first instance had rightly acquitted the
appellants from charge under Section 149 read with Section 302 I.P.C. and also Section 34 read with
Section 302 of the I.P.C. The case after being remitted back, the learned trial judge on the same
evidence has convicted the appellants under Section 302/149 of the I.P.C. besides other Sections of
the I.P.C. He has further argued that prosecution case may be considered as doubtful since during
the trial witnesses have come out with a case as if at time of occurrence this appellant exhorted that
"aisa mauka nahi milega" [he may not get such chance] however, this was not described in the
fardbyan of the informant -P.W. 7 which can be examined from paragraph 22 page no. 93 of the
evidence of P.W. 7 / informant.
13. Shri Kanhaiya Prasad Singh has further argued that the appellant had not shown any overt act in
the occurrence and this is the reason that P.W. 9 / Tribhuwan Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 Pathak who is also one of the injured witnesses in paragraph 1 page
no. 125 of his evidence has stated that this appellant was only cutting jamun tree by means of tangi
[axe] and he had done nothing. Similarly, P.W. 5 -Indrajeet Pathak in paragraph 1 has stated that all
the accused persons were cutting tree. Shri Singh has further argued that there was every possibility
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 12
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
of false implication of the appellants due to the reason that this appellant stood as a witness to the
fardbyan of the counter case i.e. Andar P.S. Case No. 63 of 1982.
14. Shri Ramakant Sharma, learned senior counsel assisted by Shri Rajesh Kumar , learned counsel
appearing on behalf of all the eleven appellants in Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 910 of 2017 has argued that
injuries found on the person of three deceased in the post mortem examination falsifies the oral
version of the prosecution. He highlighted that in respect of injuries inflicted on deceased -Sheo
Shanker Pathak, it was case of the prosecution that Radhey Shyam Pathak [A 11] had given bhala
blow and Ram Suresh Pathak [A 2] had given lathi blow however, post mortem report of Sheo
Shanker Pathak only reflects injuries caused by hard and blunt substance. Similarly, he has argued
that injuries found on the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 person of
deceased -Kanhaiya Pathak in the post mortem examination report falsifies the oral evidence since
in the evidence it was alleged that Ramagee Pathak, who died after earlier conviction had inflicted
bhala blow. Prabhunath Pathak [A 7] on injured gave lathi blow whereas Dilip Kumar Pathak [who
was declared juvenile] had allegedly inflicted farsa blow, however in the post mortem report of
Kanhaiya Pathak though six injuries were found, most of the injuries were found by hard and blunt
substance except injury no. 3 which was shown to be caused by sharp edged weapon. In respect of
injuries found on the person of deceased -Girijesh Kumar Pathak, it has been argued that it is case of
prosecution that Yogendra Pathak [A1] gave farsa blow on Girijesh Pathak, Bachcha Pathak [A4]
had inflicted bhala blow, Umanath Pathak [A8] and Amarnath Pathak [ A10] had assaulted him by
lathi, however in post mortem examination report out of seven injuries except injury no. 7 i.e. injury
caused by sharp cut weapon all other injuries were shown to be caused by hard and bunt substance.
15. Shri Ramakant Sharma has further questioned the credibility of evidence of Brajesh Pathak
[P.W. 7] who is Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 informant of the case
and submits that it was informant's case that he was given first farsa blow on his head and as such
after getting such injury there was no possibility for him to give description of other injuries inflicted
by number of other accused persons on number of other prosecution witnesses and as such, he has
argued that evidence of informant is not reliable. Shri Sharma has also argued that of- course
number of witnesses who were injured have deposed showing culpability/ involvement of the
appellants but their evidence as well as evidence of other so -called eyewitness appears to be parrot
type, which is not credible. Shri Sharma has further tried to persuade the court that it appears that
while dispute was going on regarding cutting of Jamun tree in spur of moment occurrence had taken
place and as such, it was not a case of causing intentional death of anyone and there was case and
counter case. Shri Sharma has emphasized that entire prosecution case is liable to be ignored and
judgment of conviction is required to be set aside only on the ground that prosecution has
suppressed the injuries received on the person of the accused side and on this very point he has
placed reliance on a judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 AIR 1976 SUPREME COURT 2263 Lakshmi Singh and others v.
State of Bihar.
16. Shri Ajay Mishra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor as well as Smt. Soni Shrivastava, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the informant have vehemently opposed the appeal. It has been
argued that it is consistent case of the prosecution that appellants had actively participated in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 13
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
occurrence and they had formed unlawful assembly and with common object they had in the
occurrence inflicted injuries causing death of three persons. Besides this in the said occurrence they
inflicted several injuries on number of witnesses and case is based on oral evidence as well as
corroborated by medical evidence. Smt. Srivastava, learned counsel for the informant has further
argued that there is no doubt regarding the date and time of occurrence and as such, manner of
occurrence is not in dispute. She further has argued that the place of occurrence has also been
established by the Investigating Officer and by most of the prosecution witnesses. According to Smt.
Shrivastava, the evidence of injured witnesses may not be considered as doubtful and it may not be
questioned. The genesis of the occurrence has also Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017
dt.20-08-2019 been established by the prosecution. She has also argued that though learned counsel
for the appellant Shri Ramakant Sharma at the time of hearing of appeal has argued that
prosecution has suppressed injures on the person of the accused persons, but defence though had
examined altogether twelve witnesses, none of defence witnesses have whispered regarding injuries
received by either of the accused - appellants. Even in cross -examination of prosecution witnesses
none of the witnesses were asked as to how prosecution had inflicted injuries on the accused
persons. According to her, in absence of any such evidence available on record the submission
advanced by learned senior counsel for appellants regarding suppression of injuries on the person of
the accused may not be looked into. Accordingly, it has been argued that learned trial judge has
correctly passed judgment of conviction and sentence.
17. Besides hearing learned counsel for the parties, we have minutely examined entire evidence on
record. Before proceeding further it may be recorded that even while the accused persons including
the appellants were earlier convicted in the year 1992 for the offence under Section 304 Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 read with Section 114 of the I.P.C. and for other
offences, in earlier appeals this Court had not considered the prosecution evidence as doubtful. Had
it been a case that prosecution was not able to establish its case, there was no reason for remitting
back the matter to the learned court below to hear the case from the stage of argument only,
otherwise, if on merit the High Court was earlier satisfied that there was no case, instead of
remitting back the matter the Division Bench would had simply set the matter at rest by passing
judgment of acquittal as we have noted the observation of earlier Division Bench of this Court in
preceding paragraphs of this judgment. It is evident that no apparent infirmity was noticed on
prosecution case. Only it was noticed that the learned Special Judge- cum- Additional Sessions
Judge, Siwan had incorrectly discharged the accused persons from charge under Section 302 /149 of
the I.P.C. and instead he converted the same from 302 of the I.P.C. to Section 304 of the I.P.C.
Besides this, on examination of entire evidence it is further reiterated that prosecution has
successfully proved its case, which is evident in view of the findings recorded hereinafter:-
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 (1) The occurrence
has categorically been established by the prosecution. The informant/ Brajesh Kumar
Pathak in the fardbyan had disclosed that the occurrence took place at 4 P.M. on
29.5.1982 in the orchard named Shri Ram ka Bagicha. It is his statement of P.W. 7
that when he along with his father Sheo Shanker Pathak, Kanhaya Pathak, Girgesh
Pathak, Brajesh Pathak, Tribhuwan Pathak, Kashi Nath Pathak and Dwarika Pathak
were returning back from the very Jamun tree on the suggestion of his father Sheo
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 14
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
Shanker Pathak and they came to the sugar cane field of Muneshwar Pathak, accused
persons armed with Bhala, Lathi and Farasa assaulted them. This statement of the
witness is corroborated by statement of P.W. 2 Ramayan Shukala, P.W. 4 Kedar Nath
Pathak, P.W. 5 Indrajit Pathak, P.W. 8 Kashi Nath Pathak, P.W. 9 Trihuwan Pathak,
P.W. 15 Dwarika Nath Pathak and P.W. 18 Upendra Pathak. Out of the witnesses
corroborating the statement of the informant, witnesses P.W. 8 Kashi Nath Pathak ,
P.W. 9 Tribhuwan Pathak and P.W. 18 Upendra Pathak received injuries in the
occurrence and as such although they belong to the family of the informant are eye
witness to the occurrence. Apart from above, P.W. 2 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 Ramayan Shukla, P.W. 4 Kedar Nath Pathak and P.W.
5 Indrajit Pathak have consistently corroborated the evidence of P.W. 7 that the
occurrence of Marpit took place on 29-5-
1982 at 4 p.m. in the sugar cane field of Muneshwar Pathak. P.W. 4 and P.W. 5 are not family
members of the prosecution rather they were neighbours and belong to the P.O. village and their
houses are situated in the vicinity of the houses of members of the prosecution and defence. P.W. 2
is a chance witness to the occurrence and saw the occurrence while he was passing though the way
to Aswan Bazar. In addition to it fardbyan of Ander P.S. Case No. 63 /82 and its F.I.R disclose that
the occurrence of assault between the members of the prosecution party and the defence took place
on 29-5-1982 at 4 p.m. This goes to further corroborate the evidence of the informant and other
prosecution witnesses as referred to above that the occurrence of assault took place on the alleged
date, time and place. It is therefore established from above materials on the record beyond doubt
that the occurrence as alleged by the prosecution took place on the alleged date, time and place.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 (2) Genesis of occurrence has also
been established beyond all reasonable doubts. It is admitted fact on the record that the genesis of
the occurrence is land dispute relating to orchard named Shri Ram Ka Bagicha having an area of 14
katha 5 dhurs bearing khata no. 89 and Keshara no. 205 in which members of the prosecution party
admittedly have ¼ th share and accused persons in the defence first set have ¾ th share. In the
boundary of it in western side there is orchard of accused persons in the second set. It is evidence of
P.W. 7 the informant Brajesh Kumar Pathak duly corroborated by his family members injured P.W.
8, 9 and 18 that accused persons were cutting the Jamun tree which was planted by them and was in
their ¼th share. P.W. 2 Ramayan Shukla, P.W. 4 Kedar Nath Pathak, P.W. 5 Indrajit Pathak and
P.W. 15 Dwarika Nath Pathak have also deposed so in their evidence before the trial court as well as
in their statement before I.O. in course of investigation. The I.O. of the case as C.W. 1 in para 55 of
the case diary has clearly stated in his evidence that he found fresh sign of cutting in the root of the
Jamun tree. C.W. 1 on getting information of the occurrence and drawing the F.I.R. rushed to the
place of occurrence and he found blood stained Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017
dt.20-08-2019 soil in sugar cane field of Muneshwar Pathak. Though this witness was cross
examined at length nothing has been brought on the record to disbelieve about the genesis of the
occurrence as stated by the informant and his witnesses i.e. C.W.1 The faradbeyan of Ander P.S.
Case No. 63 /1982 also discloses that the genesis of the occurrence is the land dispute between the
members of the prosecution and the defene resulting in commission of the offence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 15
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
(3) The manner of occurrence has fully been established. Now it is to be examined as to whether the
occurrence took place in the manner as alleged because P.W.7 in his fardbeyan, in his further
statement and in his evidence during the trial has consistently stated that the accused persons were
cutting the Jamun tree armed with bhala, lathi and farasa. In his evidence he deposed that after
noticing that accused persons were cutting his Jamun tree, he along with murdered and injured
persons and Dwarika Nath Pathak came from their house empty handed and they stopped
themselves on the bank of canal which was located north west of Jamun tree. They objected to it.
Accused persons disown their objection. Thereafter they were retreating and came to the Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 sugarcane field of Muneshwar Pathak, where on
the abetment of Ram Bilash Pathak accused Radheshyam Pathak gave bhala blow to his father Sheo
Shanker Pathak and Ram Suresh Pathak gave his father lathi blow. It is also his statement that
accused Ramagi Pathak gave bhala blow to Kanhaya Pathak and Prabhu Nath Pathak gave lathi
blow. Dilip Pathak gave the farasa blow to Kanhya Pathak. It is also his statement that Uma Pathak
and Amar Pathak assaulted Girgesh Pathak by means of lathi and Bacha Pathak gave him bhala
blow. Accused Yogendra Pathak assaulted Girgesh Pathak by means of farasa. Similarly it is
statement of this witness that Harendra Pathak and Tarkeshwar Pathak alias Timal Pathak
assaulted Brajesh Pathak by means of lathi and accused Prahalad Pathak gave him farasa blow. It is
said that on the abetment Parash Pathak, Pawahari Pathak gave lathi blow to the Tribhuwan Pathak
. It is also his statement that Veyash Pathak and Ram Prabesh Pathak assaulted Kashi Nath Pathak
by means of farasa and lathi respectively. Lastly it is his statement that Upendra Pathak also
received injury in the occurrence at the hands of accused persons. When this witness has been put to
test about the manner of occurrence by the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017
dt.20-08-2019 defence as appearing in para 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 , 19 and 37 in the deposition, he has
more or less corroborated the manner of the commission of the occurrence as stated above. Of
course there are some inconsistency in between his earlier version and evidence during trial, but
same are not so serious, rather it appears to be natural.
18. Apart from the above, P.W. 2 Ramayan Shukla, P.W. 4 -Kedar Nath Pathak, P.W. 5- Indrajit
Pathak, P.W. 8 - Kashi Nath Pathak, P.W. 9- Tribhuwan Pathak, P.W. 15
-Dwarikanath Pathak and P.W. 18- Upendra Kumar Pathak have more or less during their evidence
disclosed the manner of the commission of the offence as stated by the informant
-P.W. 7 Brajesh Kumar Pathak.
19. So far question of commission of offence by the accused persons is concerned, we have already
discussed the entire evidence which reflects as to how accused persons participated in the
occurrence. So far injuries caused on three deceased and weapon used by them is concerned,
following chart categorically clarifies the position;----

20. Besides this the evidence of injured witnesses entirely depicts the prosecution case as to what
role was Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 played by the accused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44065285/ 17
Yogendra Pathak And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 20 August, 2019
persons in the occurrence and it reflects that the accused persons right from the very beginning had
formed an unlawful assembly with unlawful object and it has come that with a common object the
accused persons had assaulted prosecution side by lethal weapons which were sufficient for causing
death.
21. It goes without saying that in a case of application of offence under Section 149 of the I.P.C., act
of one accused becomes act of other, and as such, in a situation like this, one may not claim that he
was only an order giver and one has only assaulted the prosecution by means of lathi or slapped. If
the object of causing death is evident which can be achieved even in spur of moment, in such
situation none of the accused persons can be absolved from the offence under Section 302 read with
Section 149 of the I.P.C.
22. So far plea taken by Shri Ramakant Sharma that prosecution has not explained injury of accused
persons is concerned, in this context it is relevant to examine the evidence of P.W. 17 - Dr.
Rameshwar Singh who conducted post mortem examination and also examined injured. In
paragraph 40 of his cross -examination he stated that none of Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 the injuries on the person of accused Prahalad Pathak , Tarkeshwar
Pathak [A3], Vyas Pathak [A6] were fatal. On question put by the prosecution he answered that all
the injuries save and except injury no. 1 of Prahalad Pathak, all injuries caused on Prahalad Pathak,
Tarkeshwar Pathak and Vyas Pathak were simple in nature and further on being asked P.W. 17
further stated in the same paragraph that all the injuries caused to the injured persons namely
Prahalad Pathak, Tarkeshwar Pathak , Vyas Pathak could be manufactured if risk is taken. In
paragraph 41 of his cross -examination P.W. 17 further stated that in all cases injuries which may
not be so serious he writes regarding dying declaration. Besides this P.W. 7 / Brajesh Kumar Pathak
who is injured and informant of the case is the son of one of the deceased-Sheo Shanker Pathak and
in his evidence he corroborated the fact disclosed in the fardbyan and gave descriptive picture as to
how in the occurrence accused persons had participated. Almost in similar manner all the witnesses
i.e. P.W. 2 - Ramayan Shukla, P.W. 4 / Kedar Nath Pathak, P.W. 5 - Indrajit Pathak, P.W. 8 - Kashi
Nath Pathak, who was injured and eye witness , P.W. 9 - Tribhuwan Pathak {injured and eye Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.910 of 2017 dt.20-08-2019 witness}, P.W. 15 - Dwarikanath Pathak (
eye witness ) and P.W. 18 - Upendra Kumar Pathak {injured and eye witnesses} have supported the
prosecution case. In the evidence of P.W. 18 - Upendra Kumar Pathak it has come that he has
received such serious injuries that he remained in hospital for 10-15 days.
23. P.W. 17 / Dr. Rameshwar Singh on 29th & 30th May , 1982 was posted as Civil Assistant
Surgeon , Sadar Hospital, Siwan and on the same day he had issued O.D. slip which has been
