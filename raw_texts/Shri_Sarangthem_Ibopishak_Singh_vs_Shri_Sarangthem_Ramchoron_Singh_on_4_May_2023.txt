counsel for the respondents 1 and 2.
2. This writ petition has been filed by the petitioners challenging the order dated 10.4.2023 passed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14901088/ 2
Shri Sarangthem Ibopishak Singh vs Shri Sarangthem Ramchoron Singh on 4 May, 2023
by the Sub- Divisional Officer, Lamphel, Imphal West in Eviction Case No.38 of 2019 in connection
with the Demarcation Case No.99/SDC/IW(C) of 2016 and to direct the respondents to conduct a
fresh demarcation.
3. The case of the petitioners is that the petitioners and the proforma respondents are absolute
owners of the homestead lands, namely (a) land covered in C.S. Dag No.586 having an area of
0.04890 acre by the third respondent and the second proforma respondent; (b) land covered in C.S.
Dag No.590 having an area of 0.0363 acre by the first petitioner and Page |4
(c) land covered in C.S. Dag No.589 having an area of 0.0353 acre by the second petitioner and the
proforma first respondent. According to the petitioners, a demarcation was took place on 20.6.2017
based on the map survey year, 1960. When a Memorandum dated 29.9.2017 was issued by the SDO,
Imphal West (Central), an objection was made by the first petitioner and the second proforma
respondent on 16.10.2017 against the said Memorandum dated 29.9.2017 stating that physical
demarcation must be based on the survey year 1990, but the demarcation was done based on the
survey year 1960 and also some distance were not properly measured and, therefore, a fresh
physical demarcation on the basis of survey year 1990 is to be conducted. However, final peg was
given in the absence of the petitioners and on 17.10.2019, an eviction notice was issued. According to
the petitioners, final peg lies six feet inside the land of the petitioners and the same affects the
dwelling house of the first petitioner. Without doing the physical demarcation properly, the final
eviction order was passed on 10.4.2023 by the SDO, Imphal West in Eviction Case No.38 of 2019.
Challenging the same, the petitioners have filed the present writ petition.
4. Assailing the impugned order dated 10.4.2023 passed by the Sub Divisional Officer, Lamphel,
Imphal West in Eviction Case No.38 of 2019, the learned counsel for the Page |5 petitioners
submitted that the SDO has passed the impugned order for eviction without following due process of
law thereby depriving the life and personal liberty of the Constitution of India, as no prior notice
was served on the petitioners before passing the impugned eviction order.
5. The learned senior counsel further submitted that a bare perusal of the impugned order shows
that the said order was passed not only without following the due process of law, but also without
doing correct demarcation. No copy of the order has been served to the would be evicted parties
which is evidence from the order dated 10.4.2023. He would submit that the natural justice
demands that it would be the affected parties be at least given advance notice of eviction to be
carried out. Aggrieved by order dated 10.4.2023, the petitioners have submitted an application
dated 21.4.2023 to the SDC, Imphal West (Central) for conducting fresh re-demarcation with
reference to Demarcation Case No.99/SDC/LW(C) of 2016. The petitioners have also filed CRP
No.26 of 2023 and the same was subsequently withdrawn with liberty to file afresh petition.
6. Before going to consider the merits of the impugned order dated 10.4.2023, let us first consider
the maintainability of the writ petition challenging the order dated 10.4.2023 passed in Page |6
Eviction Case No.38 of 2019, which has been filed by the respondents 1 and 2 herein for settlement
of boundary by evicting the land holders who are in wrongful possession of the homestead land
covered by C.S. Dag No.132 and 133 (old) situated at Revenue Village No.99, Ningthoujam

Leikai/IWT.
7. On a perusal of the impugned order dated 10.4.2023, it is seen that the Eviction Case No.38 of
2019 has been filed against the petitioners herein and others. Further perusal of the impugned order
reveals that vide order dated 16.1.2023, the SDO ordered eviction of the respondents therein,
particularly the petitioners 1 and 3 herein from the suit land covered in C.S.Dag No.132 and 1333
(old) situated at Revenue Village No.99, Ningthoujam Leikai/KWT in accordance with the final pegs
given on 26.6.2019 in Demarcation Case No.99/SDC/IT(C) of 2016 to be executed by the
Sub-Deputy Collector, Imphal West (Central) by 9.30 A.M. of 30th January, 2023. The impugned
order further records that the petitioners herein have filed Revenue Revision Case No.9 of 2023
before the Revenue Tribunal and initially, the Revenue Tribunal stayed the order dated 16.1.2023.
The said interim order was vacated by the order dated 17.2.2023 and disposed of the Revenue Case
No.9 of 2023 as infructuous. Observing so, the SDO directed the Sub-Deputy Collector, Imphal West
(Central) to execute the Page |7 eviction order dated 16.1.2023 by evicting the petitioners,
particularly the petitioners 1 and 3 herein from the suit land of the respondents 1 and 2 herein on
29.4.2023 at 9.30 A.M. The Officer-in-Charge, Singjamei PS was also directed to provide adequate
security for the eviction.
8. Admittedly, the eviction proceedings initiated by the respondents 1 and 2 against the petitioners
and others in respect of the land in C.S. Dag No.132 and 133 (old) situated at Revenue Village No.99,
Ningthoujam Leikai/IWT, is a private lis and in the private lis initiated by the respondents 1 and 2
before the SDO, Lamphel, the said authority after considering the respective cases put forth by the
parties, ordered eviction of the petitioners herein from the suit land. When the petitioners challenge
the eviction order passed by the SDO, Lamphel, they ought to have arrayed the SDO as party
respondent in the writ petition. The fact remains that the SDO, Lamphel has not been arrayed as
respondent in the instant writ petition. Behind the back of the SDO whose order is under challenge,
no direction can be passed.
9. As could be seen, aggrieved by the order dated 16.1.2023 passed by the SDO earlier the petitioners
have approached the Revenue Tribunal, Manipur. Now assailing the Page |8 impugned order of the
SDO, the petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
Exercising the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India the correctness of the order
of the SDO, Lamphel cannot be decided. Article 226 of the Constitution of India gives High Courts
the ability to issue instructions, orders, and writs to any person or authority, including the
Government.
10. As stated supra, without the authority who had passed the order having been arrayed as a party
respondent in the writ petition, the High Court cannot decide the correctness of the impugned
order. Since as against the impugned order passed by the SDO, a revision would lie, as filed earlier
by the petitioners, the petitioners cannot challenge the impugned order under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India that too without impleading the authority who had passed the impugned
order.

Shri Sarangthem Ibopishak Singh vs Shri Sarangthem Ramchoron Singh on 4 May, 2023
11. As could be seen, the petitioners have earlier filed CRP (CRP Art.227) No.26 of 2023 before this
Court and subsequently, by the order dated 21.4.2023, the CRP No.26 of 2023 has been withdrawn
by the petitioners with liberty to file a fresh one, if so advised, which does not mean that they have
right to challenge the impugned order under Article 226 of the Constitution of India when the order
under challenge has been Page |9 passed by the SDO directing the Sub-Deputy Collector, Imphal
West (Central) to execute the eviction order dated 16.1.2023. Therefore, the writ petition filed by the
petitioners assailing the order dated 10.4.2023 straightway invoking the jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution that too without impleading the authority who had passed the impugned
order is not maintainable.
12. Coming to the merits of the impugned order, the same was passed after the dismissal of the
Revenue Revision Case No.9 of 2023 which was preferred against the order dated 16.1.2023 passed
by the SDO, Lamphel in Eviction Case No.38 of 2019. If really, the petitioners are aggrieved by the
order passed by the Revenue Tribunal in Revenue Revision Case No.9 of 2023, they ought to have
assailed the same in the manner known to law. However, the petitioners have failed to do so. Having
failed to do so, now the petitioners cannot assail the impugned order by way of this writ petition.
That apart, exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, this Court cannot
test the correctness of the impugned order dated 10.4.2023. Moreover, the petitioners have failed to
convince this Court to entertain the writ petition.
13. For all the reasons stated above, P a g e | 10
a) the writ petition is dismissed as not maintainable.
b) The Registry is hereby directed strictly that if the litigant has not impleaded the State authorities
as party Respondent, the Registry should not number the writ petition.
c) There will be no order as to costs.
