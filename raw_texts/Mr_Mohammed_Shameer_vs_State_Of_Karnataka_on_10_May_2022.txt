THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482 OF
CR.P.C., PRAYING TO QUASH THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING IN
C.C.NO.3121/2021 ON THE FILE OF II ADDITIONAL SENIOR CIVIL
JUDGE AND J.M.F.C., DAVANAGERE FOR THE OFFENCE P/U/S
498-A, 323, 504, 506, 307, 313, 354, 114 R/W 34 OF IPC AND
SECTION 3 AND 4 OF DOWRY PROHIBITION ACT WHICH IS ARISING
OUT OF CR.NO.112/2021 OF WOMEN POLICE STATION OF
DAVANAGERE AS AN ABUSE OF PROCESS OF LAW.
THIS CRIMINAL PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS ON 16.03.2022, COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
The petitioners in the subject petition call in question proceedings in C.C.No.3121 of 2021 pending
on the file of the II Additional Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Davangere arising out of Crime No.112
of 2021 registered for offences punishable under Sections 506, 498A, 504, 307, 313, 323, 354, 114
and 34 of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.
2. Brief facts as projected by the prosecution are as follows:-
Before embarking upon consideration of the facts in the case it is appropriate to
notice the relationship between the protagonists in the alleged episode of crime. 2nd
respondent is the complainant and 1st petitioner/accused No.1 is her husband; 2nd
petitioner/accused No.2 is her father-in-law; 3rd petitioner/accused No.3 is her
mother-in-law; 4th petitioner/accused No.4 is the grand-mother of the 1st
petitioner/husband; 5th petitioner/ accused No.5 is the brother of the 1st petitioner;
6th petitioner/ accused No.6 is the sister-in-
law; 7th petitioner/accused No.7 is sister-in-law's husband and 8th
petitioner/accused No.8 is a distant relative of petitioner No.1.
3. The 1st petitioner and the complainant got married on 24-10-2020. The relationship of the
complainant and the 1st petitioner gets irrevocably strained. A complaint was lodged by the 2nd
petitioner herein against alleging harassment being caused by the complainant while residing in the
house of in-laws before the Vidyanagar Police, Davangere. This was treated as a non-cognizable case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 3
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
and thereto NCR No.137 of 2020 was registered on 12-12-2020, after which, it appears that the
complainant moves away from the matrimonial house and began to reside in her parents' house. On
08-03-2021 the complainant causes a legal notice against the petitioners alleging several instances
of harassment meted out to her by the petitioners. This is replied to by the petitioners on
15.03.2021.
4. Things standing thus, apprehending threat from the hands of the complainant, the 1st
petitioner/husband files O.S. No.125 of 2021 seeking restraint against the 2nd respondent/
complainant in interfering with the affairs in the house of the petitioners. The trial Court grants an
ad-interim injunction in the said civil suit by its order dated 20-03-2021. After which, the 1st
petitioner files another suit for divorce in O.S.No.223 of 2021 before the Principal Civil Judge and
JMFC at Chitradurga. The said suit is filed on 18-06-2021.
5. After the aforesaid proceedings, the complainant/2nd respondent registers the impugned
complaint, pursuant to which, a FIR is registered in Crime No.112 of 2021 for offences punishable
under Sections 506, 498A, 504, 307, 313, 323, 354, 114 and 34 of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The Police after investigation filed a charge sheet on 10-12-2021 for the
offences punishable under Sections 506, 498A, 504,307, 313, 323, 354, 114 and 34 of the IPC and
Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The learned Magistrate takes cognizance of the
aforesaid offences on 23-12-2021. It is at that juncture the petitioners have knocked the doors of this
Court in the subject criminal petition.
6. Heard the learned senior counsel Mr. Hashmath Pasha appearing for the petitioners and Sri
B.J.Rohith, learned High Court Government representing the 1st respondent/State. The 2nd
respondent/complainant is served and unrepresented.
7. The learned senior counsel would contend that the relationship between the husband and the wife
turned sore within few weeks after marriage. Incompatibility between the two became irrevocable
and in that light several proceedings are instituted by the husband against the wife and the wife
causing notices against the husband and his family members. After the husband initiating
proceedings - one suit seeking restraint of entry of the complainant into the house of the petitioners
and the other suit for divorce are filed and as a counter-blast, the wife registers a complaint against
all the members of the family who are not even connected. Even the grandmother of the accused
No.1who is 80 years old is also dragged into these proceedings. It is his submission that there cannot
be a better case of an abuse of the process of the law, than this.
8. On the other hand, the learned High Court Government Pleader would seek to refute the
submissions of the learned senior counsel and contends that the complaint and the result of
investigation as found in the summary of the charge sheet clearly narrate the circumstances and acts
of the petitioners which would point at offences punishable as afore-quoted. He would submit that
the charge sheet is filed in the case at hand and this Court should not interfere with the proceedings
at this stage and allow the trial to proceed further. If the petitioners are ignorant, they would be
acquitted and if guilty, the law would take its course. He seeks dismissal of the petition.

9. The 2nd respondent though served with a notice from the hands of this Court remains
unrepresented.
10. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the learned senior counsel
and the learned High Court Government Pleader and perused the material on record.
11. In furtherance of the facts obtaining in the case at hand and the submissions made by the
respective learned counsel, the issue that falls for my consideration is:
"Whether the proceedings instituted by the 2nd respondent/wife should be permitted
to be continued against the petitioners?
12. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The 1st petitioner and the 2nd
respondent/complainant got married on 24-10-2020 and resided at Davangere. The relationship
between the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent appears to have turned irretrievably sore not far
off of the marriage. Incompatibility drives the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent/complainant to
live separately. The petitioners though contend certain instances for the complainant to move away
from the house, the fact remains that the complainant did move away from the matrimonial house
and began to reside at her parents' house. On 04-03-2021 the facts transpire that the complainant
has moved out of the house and on 08-03-2021 causes a legal notice upon the petitioners. It is in
this legal notice the complainant narrates that during the first week of February 2021 she has left
the matrimonial house and is residing in her parents' house. Several other allegations are also made
in the said legal notice. The petitioners replied to the said legal notice on 15.03.2021. The next day,
the 1st petitioner - husband files a suit before the Principal Civil Judge and JMFC, Chitradurga
seeking permanent injunction against the complainant/2nd respondent and her family members
from interfering with the peaceful possession of the petitioners. Filing of such suit is itself a rarity.
This would demonstrate peculiarity in the facts of the case.
13. The Civil Court hearing the plaintiffs' counsel grants an ad-interim injunction against the 2nd
respondent/complainant and her family members in interfering or causing obstruction to the
peaceful possession of the property. The order of the trial Court dated 18.03.2021 reads as follows:
"Heard Counsel for the Plaintiff.
Perused the Plaint and documents available on record.
In support of I.A.No.1, the Plaintiff has produced notarized copy of registered sale
deed dtd:10-5-2010, certified copy Khata extract, Kandayam paid receipt (3), Copy of
Form No.2, medical reports of Plaintiff.
In the Affidavit, the Plaintiff contends that, be is absolute owner of in peaceful
possession and enjoyment of the Suit Schedule Property as per registered sale deed
dtd:10-5-2010 and the Defendant No.4 is his son, Defendant No.1 is his
daughter-in-law and Defendants Nos.2 and 3 are the parents of Defendant No.1. On

Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
10-2-2020 without any alternative, effected partition before the elderly persons of
locality and Defendant No.4 has received Rs.20-lakhs towards his share and other
children have got his family properties and the Defendant No.1 and 4 have left from
his house and began to reside independently since 10-12-2020. the Defendants by
colluding with each other and with other persons, without having any right, title,
interest or possession over the Suit Schedule Property, are making hectic efforts to
interfere by causing obstruction in his peaceful possession and enjoyment of the
same and he requested the Defendants not to make illegal act, but his efforts went in
vain. Hence, the present Application. The said apprehension of the Plaintiff is
pleaded in the Affidavit and at this stage, if emergent Order is not passed, it would
lead to multiplicity of proceedings and would create unnecessary hassle and
interference to the Plaintiffs' possession and enjoyment of the Suit Schedule
Property. Hence, it is necessary to pass emergent Order pending notice to the
Defendant. The Plaintiff has made our prima - facie case. Accordingly, this Court
passes the following:
ORDER Issue ad-interim Temporary Injunction against the Defendant.
The Descendants, their agents, men, servants, supporters and followers etc., are
hereby restrained from interfering by causing obstruction in the Plaintiff's peaceful
possession and enjoyment of the Suit Schedule Property, till the next date of hearing.
The Plaintiff's shall comply with Order 39 Rule 3(a) of CPC, forthwith. Issue T.I.
Order, notice of I.A.No.1 and Suit notice to the Defendants, returnable by
16/04/2021."
Thereafter, the 1st petitioner/husband registers another suit in O.S.No.223 of 2021 seeking
annulment of marriage with the 2nd respondent/complainant. The said suit is filed on 18-06-2021.
Notice being issued in the said suit seeking annulment of marriage triggers the complainant to
register the subject complaint against the petitioners who are husband and other members of the
family, notwithstanding whether they did reside with the couple or not. The link in the chain of
dates and events clearly make the complaint to be a counter-blast.
14. The complaint narrates several allegations against the 1st petitioner/husband and vague and
bald statements against all other members of the family. Since the entire issue initially sprang from
the complaint, it is necessary to quote the complaint for the purpose of ready reference:

Based upon the said complaint, a FIR is registered in Crime No.112 of 2021 for the afore-quoted
offences. A perusal at the complaint (supra) would indicate several instances of arguments taking
place between the husband and the wife and absolutely nothing against any other members of the
family who are dragged into these proceedings. Several instances of incompatible circumstances
between the husband and the complainant are narrated in the complaint.
15. The legal notice that is caused by the complainant indicates that the complainant leaves the
matrimonial house and begins to stay with her parents' house from the 1st week of February 2021.
The complaint narrates that on 22-08-2021 the husband/1st petitioner goes to the house of the
wife/complainant and beats her and attempts to kill her. It is the husband himself who had filed a
suit seeking restraint of entry of the complainant and her family members entering into the house of
the petitioners. Therefore, visualizing a circumstance that the 1st petitioner would go to the house of
the complainant and beat the wife and attempt to kill her cannot but be construed to be suffering
from want of bona fides. The wound certificate that is appended to the charge sheet reads as follows:
"(1) Pain with tenderness in lt-shoulder.
(2) Pain with tenderness in middle 1/3 of front of lt.thigh.
I am of the opinion that the above wounds (1) & (2) are simple in nature."
The wound certificate (supra) indicates what has happened on 04.03.2021 but the complaint is
registered on 22-08-2021. The instances narrated in the complaint are of 22-08-2021. There is no
evidence produced or gathered from the investigation about any injuries sustained by the
complainant on 22-08-2021. Therefore, an inference is to be drawn that the entire complaint suffers
from want of bona fides. The Police after investigation have filed a charge sheet. The summary of the
charge sheet reads as follows:

In the summary of the charge sheet repetition of words found in the complaint is found except
quoting certain instances of torture by the husband. Both in the complaint and in the summary of
the charge sheet there is nothing that can be found against other members of the family/petitioners
2 to 8. With regard to the husband, there are instances, but whether they would suffice for
permitting further proceedings to be continued against the husband is what is to be answered.
16. As observed hereinabove, the incident happened on 22-08-2021. In the teeth of proceedings
initiated by the husband
- one seeking restraint of entry of the wife into the house of the husband or his family and the other
for divorce, the allegation that he had been to the house of the wife on 22.08.2021 and attempted to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 12
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
kill her, cannot be on the face of it, believed. Therefore, even against the husband further
proceedings if permitted to continue would become an abuse of the process of law.
17. It is germane to notice judgments of the Apex Court which have delineated the power of
interference under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. from time to time. The Apex Court in the case of
MADHAVRAO JIWAJIRAO SCINDIA V. SAMBHAJIRAO CHANDROJIRAO ANGRE1 has held as
follows:
"7. The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is
asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the
uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the
court to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case
to consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a
prosecution to continue. This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for
any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an ultimate
conviction are bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by
allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may while taking into
consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceeding even though it may
be at a preliminary stage."
Later, the Apex Court in the case of STATE OF HARYANA v. BHAJANLAL2 has held as follows:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the (1988) 1 SCC 692 1992 Supp. (1)
SCC 335 Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following
categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised
either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of
justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and
sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an
exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 13
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a noncognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court in the aforesaid judgments has clearly delineated the power of
the Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to thwart injustice. The aforesaid judgments have been
followed by the Apex Court in plethora of cases in the aftermath of the judgment in the case
BHAJANLAL (supra). That being the powers of this Court, it is now germane to notice the
judgments of the Apex Court which have considered the fact of complainants dragging all the
members of family into the web of criminal proceedings despite there being no allegations against
them qua the facts obtaining in the case at hand.
18. The relationship, in the case at hand, is as noticed hereinabove. Accused No.4 is also drawn into
the proceedings. Accused No.4 is the grandmother of the 1st petitioner who is 80 years old and it is
submitted that she is bedridden. The sister of the 1st petitioner, the 6th petitioner and her husband
7th petitioner are living separately for the last 7 years and are in no way concerned with the family of
the 1st petitioner or the squabble between the husband and the wife. They are simply dragged into
these proceedings. The 8th petitioner who is a resident of Harihar had never interfered with the life
of the complainant is also dragged into these proceedings. The father- in-law and
mother-in-law/petitioners 2 and 3 herein who, though reside with the husband, no foundation is
laid of any harassment meted out against the complainant/2nd respondent to allege offences
punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 307, 313 or 354 of the IPC against them.
19. It is the 1st petitioner/husband who remains. The FIR registered was for offences punishable as
afore-quoted. The charge sheet reiterates it. Gravest of the offence that is indicated is Section 307 of
the IPC. Section 307 deals with attempt to murder. Offence under Section 307 is punishable with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 14
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
imprisonment upto 10 years and is considered to be grave offence. No foundation is laid in the
complaint or in the summary of the charge sheet to bring home the offence under Section 307 of the
IPC. Even according to the complainant, she and her husband were living separately from the 1st
week of February 2021. The attempt is alleged to have happened on 22-08-2021 that too in the
house of the parents of the complainant. Therefore, the very fact that the husband did enter the
house of the complainant despite the aforesaid civil proceedings instituted by him, that too for
torture of the complainant would definitely suffer from the vice of improbability. Attempt to murder
cannot be imaginary. There is no material placed to demonstrate any attempt to murder. Such
allegation is made in thin air and cannot be sustained in thinner air.
20. The other allegation is for offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC. Even to this
offence, there is no foundation laid. Bald and vague allegations galore in the case at hand. Section
313 of the IPC is also alleged, which depicts causing miscarriage without one's consent. There is only
a sentence in the complaint alleging that the complainant became pregnant which the parents of the
husband did not welcome. There is no material produced to drive home miscarriage without the
complainant's consent. There is not even a miscarriage in the case at hand.
21. Section 354 of the IPC again would not be tenable for the reason rendered while considering the
offence under Section 307 of the IPC. Section 114 of the IPC that is alleged deals with presence of
abettor when the offence is committed. The alleged offence is committed allegedly in the house of
the parents of the complainant. Who could abet the offence? None of the petitioners; as the incident
happened in the house of the parents of the complainant. Therefore, all the offences alleged lack any
foundation in the complaint or in the summary of the charge sheet. The Apex Court in the case of
PREETI GUPTA v. STATE OF JHARKHAND3 has held as follows:
"28. We have very carefully considered the averments of the complaint and the
statements of all the witnesses recorded at the time of the filing of the complaint.
There are no specific allegations against the appellants in the complaint and none of
the witnesses have alleged any role of both the appellants.
29. Admittedly, Appellant 1 is a permanent resident of Navasari, Surat, Gujarat and
has been living with her husband for more than seven years. Similarly, Appellant 2 is
a permanent resident of Goregaon, Maharashtra. They have never visited the place
where the alleged incident had taken place. They had never lived with Respondent 2
and her husband. Their implication in the complaint is meant to harass and
humiliate the husband's relatives. This seems to be the only basis to file this
complaint against the appellants. Permitting the complainant to pursue this
complaint would be an abuse of the process of law.
30. It is a matter of common knowledge that unfortunately matrimonial litigation is
rapidly increasing in our country. All the courts in our country including this Court
are flooded with matrimonial cases. This clearly demonstrates discontent and unrest
in the family life of a large number of people of the society.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 15
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
31. The courts are receiving a large number of cases emanating from Section 498-A of
the Penal Code which reads as under:
(2010) 7 SCC 667 "498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her
to cruelty.--Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman,
subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, 'cruelty' means--
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to
commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether
mental or physical) of the woman;
or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person
related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of
failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand."
32. It is a matter of common experience that most of these complaints under Section 498-A IPC are
filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues without proper deliberations. We come across a
large number of such complaints which are not even bona fide and are filed with oblique motive. At
the same time, rapid increase in the number of genuine cases of dowry harassment is also a matter
of serious concern.
33. The learned members of the Bar have enormous social responsibility and obligation to ensure
that the social fibre of family life is not ruined or demolished. They must ensure that exaggerated
versions of small incidents should not be reflected in the criminal complaints. Majority of the
complaints are filed either on their advice or with their concurrence. The learned members of the
Bar who belong to a noble profession must maintain its noble traditions and should treat every
complaint under Section 498-A as a basic human problem and must make serious endeavour to help
the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of that human problem. They must discharge their
duties to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fibre, peace and tranquillity of the society
remains intact. The members of the Bar should also ensure that one complaint should not lead to
multiple cases.
36. Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour, acrimony and
bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of common knowledge that in
cases filed by the complainant if the husband or the husband's relations had to remain in jail even
for a few days, it would ruin the chances of an amicable settlement altogether. The process of
suffering is extremely long and painful."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 16
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
(Emphasis supplied) In the case of GEETA MEHROTRA v. STATE OF U.P.4 the Apex Court holds as
follows:-
"25. However, we deem it appropriate to add by way of caution that we may not be
misunderstood so as to infer that even if there are allegations of overt act indicating
the complicity of the members of the family named in the FIR in a given case,
cognizance would be unjustified but what we wish to emphasise by highlighting is
that, if the FIR as it stands does not disclose specific allegation against the accused
more so against the co-accused specially in a matter arising out of matrimonial
bickering, it would be clear abuse of the legal and judicial process to mechanically
send the named accused in the FIR to undergo the trial unless of course the FIR
discloses specific (2012) 10 SCC 741 allegations which would persuade the court to
take cognizance of the offence alleged against the relatives of the main accused who
are prima facie not found to have indulged in physical and mental torture of the
complainant wife. It is the well-settled principle laid down in cases too numerous to
mention, that if the FIR did not disclose the commission of an offence, the court
would be justified in quashing the proceedings preventing the abuse of process of
law. Simultaneously, the courts are expected to adopt a cautious approach in matters
of quashing, especially in cases of matrimonial disputes whether the FIR in fact
discloses commission of an offence by the relatives of the principal accused or the
FIR prima facie discloses a case of over implication by involving the entire family of
the accused at the instance of the complainant, who is out to settle her scores arising
out of the teething problem or skirmish of domestic bickering while settling down in
her new matrimonial surrounding.
26. In the case at hand, when the brother and unmarried sister of the principal
accused Shyamji Mehrotra approached the High Court for quashing the proceedings
against them, inter alia, on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction as also on the
ground that no case was made out against them under Sections 498-A/323/504/506
IPC including Sections 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, it was the legal duty of the
High Court to examine whether there were prima facie material against the
appellants so that they could be directed to undergo the trial, besides the question of
territorial jurisdiction. The High Court seems to have overlooked all the pleas that
were raised and rejected the petition on the solitary ground of territorial jurisdiction
giving liberty to the appellants to approach the trial court.
27. The High Court in our considered opinion appears to have missed that assuming
the trial court had territorial jurisdiction, it was still left to be decided whether it was
a fit case to send the appellants for trial when the FIR failed to make out a prima facie
case against them regarding the allegation of inflicting physical and mental torture to
the complainant demanding dowry from the complainant. Since the High Court has
failed to consider all these aspects, this Court as already stated hereinbefore, could
have remitted the matter to the High Court to consider whether a case was made out
against the appellants to proceed against them. But as the contents of the FIR do not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 17
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
disclose specific allegation against the brother and sister of the complainant's
husband except casual reference of their names, it would not be just to direct them to
go through protracted procedure by remanding for consideration of the matter all
over again by the High Court and make the unmarried sister of the main accused and
his elder brother to suffer the ordeal of a criminal case pending against them specially
when the FIR does not disclose ingredients of offence under Sections
498-A/323/504/506 IPC and Sections 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
28. We, therefore, deem it just and legally appropriate to quash the proceedings
initiated against the appellants Geeta Mehrotra and Ramji Mehrotra as the FIR does
not disclose any material which could be held to be constituting any offence against
these two appellants.
Merely by making a general allegation that they were also involved in physical and mental torture of
Respondent 2 complainant without mentioning even a single incident against them as also the fact
as to how they could be motivated to demand dowry when they are only related as brother and sister
of the complainant's husband, we are pleased to quash and set aside the criminal proceedings
insofar as these appellants are concerned and consequently the order passed by the High Court shall
stand overruled. The appeal is accordingly allowed."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court in the case of RASHMI CHOPRA v. STATE OF U.P.5 holds as
follows:-
"18. The learned counsel for the appellant has also relied on various judgments of this
Court in support of his submissions. In K. Subba Rao v. State of Telangana [K. Subba
Rao v. State of Telangana, (2018) 14 SCC 452 :
(2019) 1 SCC (Cri) 605] , this Court laid down the following in paras 5 and 6 : (SCC p.
454) "5. A perusal of the charge-sheet and the supplementary charge-sheet discloses
the fact that the appellants are not the immediate family members of the third
respondent/husband. They are the maternal uncles of the third respondent. Except
the bald statement that they supported the third respondent who was harassing the
second respondent for dowry and that they conspired with the third respondent for
taking away his child to USA, nothing else indicating their involvement in the crime
was mentioned. The appellants approached the High Court when the investigation
was pending.
The charge-sheet and the supplementary charge- sheet were filed after disposal [T.S.K. Ashwin
Kumar v. State of Telangana, 2016 SCC OnLine Hyd 432] of the case by the High Court.
6. Criminal proceedings are not normally interdicted by us at the interlocutory stage unless there is
an abuse of the process of a court. This Court, at the same time, does not hesitate to interfere to
secure the ends of justice. See State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992
Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426] . The courts should be careful in proceeding against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 18
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
distant relatives in crimes pertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry deaths. The (2019) 15 SCC
357 relatives of the husband should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations unless
specific instances of their involvement in the crime are made out. (See Kans Raj v. State of Punjab
[Kans Raj v. State of Punjab, (2000) 5 SCC 207 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 935] and Kailash Chandra Agrawal
v. State of U.P. [Kailash Chandra Agrawal v. State of U.P., (2014) 16 SCC 551 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri)
536] )"
... ... ... ...
24. Coming back to the allegations in the complaint pertaining to Section 498-A and Sections 3/4 of
the Dowry Prohibition Act. A perusal of the complaint indicates that the allegations against the
appellants for the offences under Section 498-A and Sections 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act are
general and sweeping. No specific incident dates or details of any incident have been mentioned in
the complaint. The complaint having been filed after the proceeding for divorce was initiated by
Nayan Chopra in the State of Michigan, where Vanshika participated and divorce was ultimately
granted. A few months after filing of the divorce petition, the complaint has been filed in the Court
of CJM, Gautam Budh Nagar with the allegations as noticed above. The sequence of the events and
facts and circumstances of the case leads us to conclude that the complaint under Section 498-A and
Sections 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act have been filed as counter-blast to divorce petition
proceeding in the State of Michigan by Nayan Chopra.
25. There being no specific allegation regarding any one of the applicants except common general
allegation against everyone i.e. "they started harassing the daughter of the applicant demanding
additional dowry of rupees one crore" and the fact that all relatives of the husband, namely, father,
mother, brother, mother's sister and husband of mother's sister have been roped in clearly indicates
that the application under Section 156(3) CrPC was filed with a view to harass the applicants.
Further, prior to filing of the application under Section 156(3) CrPC there was no complaint at any
point of time by the girl or her father making allegation of demand of any dowry by any one of the
applicants. When both Nayan Chopra and Vanshika started living separately since November 2013,
had there been any dowry demand or harassment the girl would have given complaint to police or
any other authority. Further, in the divorce proceedings at Michigan, USA, parties have agreed for
dividing their properties including gifts given at marriage but no complaint was made in those
proceedings regarding harassment by her husband or his family members. ..."
Further, in the case of KAHKASHAN KAUSAR v. STATE OF BIHAR6 the Apex Court holds as
follows:
"Issue Involved "11. Having perused the relevant facts and contentions made by the
Appellants and Respondents, in our considered opinion, the foremost issue which
requires determination in the instant case is whether allegations made against the
in-laws Appellants are in the nature of general omnibus allegations and therefore
liable to be quashed?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 19
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
12. Before we delve into greater detail on the nature and content of allegations made,
it becomes pertinent to mention that incorporation of section 498A of IPC was aimed
at preventing cruelty committed upon a woman by her husband and her in-laws, by
facilitating rapid state intervention. However, it is equally true, that in recent times,
matrimonial litigation in the country has also increased significantly and there is a
greater disaffection and friction surrounding the institution of marriage, now, more
than ever. This has resulted in an increased tendency to employ provisions such as
498A IPC as instruments to 2022 SCC Online SC 162 settle personal scores against
the husband and his relatives.
13. This Court in its judgment in Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. , has observed:--
"14. Section 498-A was inserted in the statute with the laudable object of punishing
cruelty at the hands of husband or his relatives against a wife particularly when such
cruelty had potential to result in suicide or murder of a woman as mentioned in the
statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act 46 of 1983. The expression 'cruelty' in
Section 498A covers conduct which may drive the woman to commit suicide or cause
grave injury (mental or physical) or danger to life or harassment with a view to coerce
her to meet unlawful demand. It is a matter of serious concern that large number of
cases continue to be filed under already referred to some of the statistics from the
Crime Records Bureau. This Court had earlier noticed the fact that most of such
complaints are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues. Many of such
complaints are not bona fide. At the time of filing of the complaint, implications and
consequences are not visualized. At times such complaints lead to uncalled for
harassment not only to the accused but also to the complainant. Uncalled for arrest
may ruin the chances of settlement."
14. Previously, in the landmark judgment of this court in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar5, it was
also observed:--
"4. There is a phenomenal increase in matrimonial disputes in recent years. The
institution of marriage is greatly revered in this country. Section 498-A IPC was
introduced with avowed object to combat the menace of harassment to a woman at
the hands of her husband and his relatives. The fact that Section 498-A IPC is a
cognizable and non- bailable offence has lent it a dubious place of pride amongst the
provisions that are used as weapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives. The
simplest way to harass is to get the husband and his relatives arrested under this
provision. In a quite number of cases, bed-ridden grandfathers and grand-mothers of
the husbands, their sisters living abroad for decades are arrested."
15. Further in Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand6, it has also been observed:--
"32. It is a matter of common experience that most of these complaints under section
498A IPC are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues without proper
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 20
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
deliberations. We come across a large number of such complaints which are not even
bona fide and are filed with oblique motive. At the same time, rapid increase in the
number of genuine cases of dowry harassment are also a matter of serious concern.
33. The learned members of the Bar have enormous social responsibility and
obligation to ensure that the social fiber of family life is not ruined or demolished.
They must ensure that exaggerated versions of small incidents should not be reflected
in the criminal complaints. Majority of the complaints are filed either on their advice
or with their concurrence. The learned members of the Bar who belong to a noble
profession must maintain its noble traditions and should treat every complaint under
section 498A as a basic human problem and must make serious endeavour to help
the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of that human problem. They must
discharge their duties to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fiber, peace
and tranquillity of the society remains intact. The members of the Bar should also
ensure that one complaint should not lead to multiple cases.
34. Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the complaint the implications and
consequences are not properly visualized by the complainant that such complaint can
lead to insurmountable harassment, agony and pain to the complainant, accused and
his close relations.
35. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the truth and punish the guilty and
protect the innocent. To find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these
complaints. The tendency of implicating husband and all his immediate relations is
also not uncommon. At times, even after the conclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult
to ascertain the real truth. The courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in
dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realities into consideration
while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment of husband's
close relations who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely
visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different
complexion. The allegations of the complaint are required to be scrutinized with great
care and circumspection.
36. Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour,
acrimony and bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of
common knowledge that in cases filed by the complainant if the husband or the
husband's relations had to remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin the
chances of amicable settlement altogether. The process of suffering is extremely long
and painful."
16. In Geeta Mehrotra v. State of UP7, it was observed:--
"21. It would be relevant at this stage to take note of an apt observation of this Court
recorded in the matter of G.V. Rao v. L.H.V. Prasad reported in (2000) 3 SCC 693
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 21
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
wherein also in a matrimonial dispute, this Court had held that the High Court
should have quashed the complaint arising out of a matrimonial dispute wherein all
family members had been roped into the matrimonial litigation which was quashed
and set aside. Their Lordships observed therein with which we entirely agree that:
"there has been an outburst of matrimonial dispute in recent times. Marriage is a
sacred ceremony, main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down
in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly erupt which
often assume serious proportions resulting in heinous crimes in which elders of the
family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and
brought about rapprochement are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as
accused in the criminal case. There are many reasons which need not be mentioned
here for not encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over
their defaults and terminate the disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of
fighting it out in a court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and in that
process the parties lose their "young" days in chasing their cases in different courts."
The view taken by the judges in this matter was that the courts would not encourage
such disputes."
17. Recently, in K. Subba Rao v. The State of Telangana8, it was also observed that:--
"6. The Courts should be careful in proceeding against the distant relatives in crimes
pertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry deaths. The relatives of the husband
should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations unless specific instances of
their involvement in the crime are made out."
18. The above-mentioned decisions clearly demonstrate that this court has at numerous instances
expressed concern over the misuse of section 498A IPC and the increased tendency of implicating
relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes, without analysing the long term ramifications of a
trial on the complainant as well as the accused. It is further manifest from the said judgments that
false implication by way of general omnibus allegations made in the course of matrimonial dispute,
if left unchecked would result in misuse of the process of law. Therefore, this court by way of its
judgments has warned the courts from proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband
when no prima facie case is made out against them.
19. Coming to the facts of this case, upon a perusal of the contents of the FIR dated 01.04.19, it is
revealed that general allegations are levelled against the Appellants. The complainant alleged that
'all accused harassed her mentally and threatened her of terminating her pregnancy'. Furthermore,
no specific and distinct allegations have been made against either of the Appellants herein, i.e., none
of the Appellants have been attributed any specific role in furtherance of the general allegations
made against them. This simply leads to a situation wherein one fails to ascertain the role played by
each accused in furtherance of the offence. The allegations are therefore general and omnibus and
can at best be said to have been made out on account of small skirmishes. Insofar as husband is
concerned, since he has not appealed against the order of the High court, we have not examined the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74640611/ 22
Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
veracity of allegations made against him. However, as far as the Appellants are concerned, the
allegations made against them being general and omnibus, do not warrant prosecution.
20. Furthermore, regarding similar allegations of harassment and demand for car as dowry made in
a previous FIR. Respondent No. 1 i.e., the State of Bihar, contends that the present FIR pertained to
offences committed in the year 2019, after assurance was given by the husband Md. Ikram before
the Ld. Principal Judge Purnea, to not harass the Respondent wife herein for dowry, and treat her
properly. However, despite the assurances, all accused continued their demands and harassment. It
is thereby contended that the acts constitute a fresh cause of action and therefore the FIR in
question herein dated 01.04.19, is distinct and independent, and cannot be termed as a repetition of
an earlier FIR dated 11.12.17.
21. Here it must be borne in mind that although the two FIRs may constitute two independent
instances, based on separate transactions, the present complaint fails to establish specific
allegations against the in-laws of the Respondent wife. Allowing prosecution in the absence of clear
allegations against the in-laws Appellants would simply result in an abuse of the process of law.
22. Therefore, upon consideration of the relevant circumstances and in the absence of any specific
role attributed to the accused appellants, it would be unjust if the Appellants are forced to go
through the tribulations of a trial, i.e., general and omnibus allegations cannot manifest in a
situation where the relatives of the complainant's husband are forced to undergo trial. It has been
highlighted by this court in varied instances, that a criminal trial leading to an eventual acquittal
also inflicts severe scars upon the accused, and such an exercise must therefore be discouraged."
(Emphasis supplied) The aforesaid judgments were the cases where the Apex Court was considering
the acts of the complainants in drawing every member of the family into the web of criminal
proceedings despite there being no allegation against them.
22. The afore-quoted judgments would apply on all fours to the facts obtaining in the case at hand,
as every other member of the family is dragged into these proceedings without there being any
allegation. Even a 80 year old bedridden lady is also made an accused on bald and vague statements
in the complaint or in the summary of the charge sheet. Insofar as the husband is concerned, for the
allegations made against him, it is germane to notice the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of
MIRZA IQBAL @ GOLU AND ANOTHER v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH AND ANOTHER - 2021
SCC OnLine SC 1251 wherein the Apex Court considers the plea of assault and holds that there
should be material produced and when there are no external injuries noticed, it cannot be said that
allegations made for offences punishable under Section 323 of the IPC would become tenable. Even
in the case at hand there are no materials produced to demonstrate that attempt to kill the
complainant was made by the husband. Barring this allegation, every other allegation against the
husband and all other members of the family are in common. Therefore, permitting any further
proceedings to continue against the petitioners would become an abuse of the process of law and
degenerate into harassment against them.

Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
23. Noticing certain observations of the Apex Court in the case of PREETI GUPTA (supra), in the
circumstances, would be apposite and they read -
34. Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the complaint the implications and consequences are not
properly visualized by the complainant that such complaint can lead to insurmountable harassment,
agony and pain to the complainant, accused and his close relations.
35. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the truth and punish the guilty and protect the
innocent. To find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these complaints. The tendency of
implicating husband and all his immediate relations is also not uncommon. At times, even after the
conclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult to ascertain the real truth. The courts have to be extremely
careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realities into
consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment of husband's
close relations who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place
where the complainant resided would have an entirely different complexion. The allegations of the
complaint are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection.
The Apex Court holds that unfortunately at the time of filing of the complaint the implications and
complications are not visualized by the complainant and the agony and pain that is caused to the
accused or his close relations. The Apex Court further holds to find out the truth in the complaint is
a herculean task. Therefore, if the complaint and the averments in the complaint or the summary of
the charge sheet do not make out any offence, it would become a duty of this Court to interfere and
obliterate such proceedings, which would become an abuse of the process of the law. Reference
being made to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of MANOJ MAHAVIR PRASAD
KHAITAN v. RAM GOPAL PODDAR7, in the circumstances, is apposite. In the said judgment the
Apex Court holds as follows:
"12. We reiterate that when the criminal court looks into the complaint, it has to do so
with an open mind. True it is that that is not the stage for finding out the truth or
otherwise in the allegations; but where the allegations themselves are so absurd that
no reasonable man would accept the same, the High Court could not have thrown its
(2010) 10 SCC 673 arms in the air and expressed its inability to do anything in the
matter. Section 482 CrPC is a guarantee against injustice. The High Court is invested
with the tremendous powers thereunder to pass any order in the interests of justice.
Therefore, this would have been a proper case for the High Court to look into the
allegations with the openness and then to decide whether to pass any order in the
interests of justice. In our opinion, this was a case where the High Court ought to
have used its powers under Section 482 CrPC."
24. With regard to the offence alleged under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961,
some bald allegations are found in the FIR, as also in the charge sheet, but no proof thereof is
produced to sustain the charge. The allegations under these sections are made to somehow bring the
petitioners to book. Such an approach cannot be countenanced in law.

Mr. Mohammed Shameer vs State Of Karnataka on 10 May, 2022
25. In the light of the preceding analysis of the facts, the judgments of the Apex Court on the subject
and the powers of this Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. I deem it appropriate to obliterate the
proceedings against the petitioners.
26. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Criminal Petition is allowed.
(ii) The proceedings in C.C.No.3121 of 2021 pending before the II Additional Senior
Civil Judge and JMFC, Davangere, stand quashed.
