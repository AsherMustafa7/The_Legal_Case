CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR TRIPATHI
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 21-07-2016 Petitioner is one of the candidate, who was initially selected for the post of a
Constable after purportedly having fulfilled all the requirements and procedure laid down in this
regard. The problem of the petitioner started when he reported for joining to the assigned district,
which is said to be the district of Rohtas in the present case.
Since every candidate reporting for such joining was Patna High Court CWJC No.16156 of 2015
dt.21-07-2016 required to be put through the standards of re-measurement with regard to height
and chest, petitioner was also subjected to such measurement and the authorities of the Rohtas
district police found the petitioner's required chest measurement to be lower than the standards laid
down. Though at the time of initial measurement during the recruitment drive the PET sheet
indicated his chest as 81- 86 cms. The actual measurement only indicated the said dimension to be

79-84 cms.
Petitioner was recommended for re-measurement before the Central Selection Board of Constables
which the petitioner underwent. The re-measurement at the Board also threw up the figure of 79-84.
In other words, there was no element of mischief involved by the district police in recording the
figure of 79-84 as to the actual chest measurement of the petitioner.
Keeping in view that there is a consistent finding with regard to two measurements conducted on
the petitioner and both the measurements do not get the minimum laid down standards of 81-86
cms, obviously either there was some mischief or mistake with regard to the chest measurement,
which was recorded in the PET sheet.
Since the re-measurement has already been done and the figures are consistent, therefore, the Court
is not willing to accept any prayer for re-remeasurement of the petitioner. Patna High Court CWJC
No.16156 of 2015 dt.21-07-2016 Writ application is dismissed. The Court is not inclined to exercise
its discretion.
