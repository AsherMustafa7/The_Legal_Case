ORDER
This writ petition by a Civil Servant of the State lays a challenge to the order dated 12.08.2020 made
by the Kalaburagi Bench of Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal (hereafter 'KSAT') in his
Application No.1270/2020 denying relief against the unilateral termination of his deputation by the
borrowing department (RDPR) on the ground of efflux of time.
2. After service of notice, the official respondents have entered appearance through the learned
Additional Advocate General and the private respondent is represented by his learned advocate;
both they make submission in justification of the impugned judgment & order.
3. Brief fact matrix of the case:
a) Both the petitioner and the third respondent are borne on the service of Public
Works Department i.e. (PWD), the second respondent herein which vide Notification
dated 09.05.2017 (Annexure-A1) had lent the services of the petitioner on deputation
to the first respondent-RDPR Department, which in turn issued a Notification dated
02.06.2017 (Annexure-A2), posting him as the Assistant Executive Engineer in the
Project Sub-Division, Vijayapur; the petitioner took the charge vide Charge Transfer
Memo dated 14.06.2017 (Annexure-A3); all this is not in dispute.

b) The borrowing RDPR Dept. vide Notification dated 15.07.2017 (Annexure-A4) had
shifted the petitioner as Technical Assistant, Project Division at Bagalkot, which he
had called in question in Application No.4434/2017 and the KSAT had continued him
in the earlier post by granting an interim order of stay against this displacement;
however, this case came to be disposed off vide order dated 03.10.2019
(Annexure-A5) as having become infructuous by passage of time; be that as it may;
c) The borrowing dept. vide Notification dated 27.02.2020 (Annexure-A6)
unilaterally cancelled the deputation of the petitioner and sent him back to his parent
department i.e., PWD; the petitioner had laid a challenge to this Notification in
Application No.1270/2020, which came to be negatived by the KSAT vide impugned
order; that is how the petitioner is knocking at the doors of Writ Court.
4. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the petition papers, we are
inclined to grant indulgence in the matter, for the following reasons:
i) Admittedly, petitioner and the third respondent as already mentioned, belong to
the second respondent-
PWD which has lent the services of the former to the first respondent-RDPR Dept., which by the
Notification that was impugned before the KSAT has unilaterally terminated the deputation and
thereby reverted him to the parent department; this is bit difficult to countenance; learned author
Samaraditya Pal in "LAW RELATING TO PUBLIC SERVICE" Third Edition (LexisNexis
Publication) at paragraph-145.1 explains the concept of deputation as under and we agree with that:
"The concept of deputation in the law relating to public service is in essence derived
from the significance of the word 'deputy' and the appropriate meaning of 'deputy' in
this context would be 'substitute'. From this pivotal sense of substitution, many of the
incidents of deputation discussed here will follow logically. Although it is usually said
that a person has been appointed on deputation, the better expression would be
'assignment on deputation'. It would, therefore, be more proximate to accuracy to
describe deputation as an assignment of an employee (commonly referred to as the
deputationist) of one department or cadre or even an organization (commonly
referred to as the parent department or lending authority) to another department or
cadre or organization (commonly referred to as the borrowing authority)..."
ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court had an occasion to discuss the concept of deputation as obtaining in
Service Jurisprudence in State of Punjab vs. Inder Singh AIR 1998 SC 7, observing as under:
"19. Concept of "deputation" is well understood in service law and has a recognized
meaning. 'Deputation' has a different connotation in service law and the dictionary
meaning of the word 'deputation' is of no help. In simple words 'deputation' means
service outside the cadre or outside the parent department. Deputation is deputing or
transferring an employee to a post outside his cadre, that is to say, to another
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120927525/ 3
Sri C B Chikkalagi vs The State Of Karnataka And Others on 28 September, 2020
department on a temporary basis. After the expiry period of deputation the employee
has to come back to his parent department to occupy the same position unless in the
meanwhile he has earned promotion in his parent department as per Recruitment
Rules. Whether the transfer is outside the normal field of deployment or not is
decided by the authority who controls the service or post from which the employee is
transferred. There can be no deputation without the consent of the person so deputed
and he would, therefore, know his rights and privileges in the deputation post. The
law on deputation and repatriation is quite settled as we have also seen in various
judgments which we have referred to above. There is no escape for the respondents
now to go back to their parent departments and working there as Constables or Head
Constables as the case may be."
iii) To put it shortly, the idea of deputation involves three ingredients namely, lending department,
the borrowing department and the lent hand; ordinarily, a valid deputation envisages a consensus
amongst all the three agencies involved, unless the law otherwise states; Rule 50 of KCS Rules
provides for deputation of a Government servant from one department to another and his
entitlement to the emoluments on such deputation; Rule 50 (1) reads as under:
"50. (1) When a Government servant is permanently transferred or deputed from one
department to another under the provisions of Rule 16 of the Karnataka State Civil
Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977, he will draw pay in the new post at the
same stage in which he was drawing in the old post and earn the next increment on
the date on which he would have earned it had he continued in the old post."
Rules 15 & 16 of the KCS (CCA) Rules, 1957 provide for the disciplinary proceedings for the
misconduct of deputationists; going by the text and context of these rules, it can be safely stated that
in the matter of deputation in Government service, an employee may not have much say; however,
no department can thrust it's employee on deputation to another, as a general rule; similarly, a
borrowing department cannot cut short the tenure of the deputation unilaterally, in the absence of
authorization.
(iv) In the present case, the borrowing department has unilaterally sent the petitioner back to the
parent department abruptly and unceremoniously, that too without any prior or post-consultation
with the lending department; this according to us, apart from being contrary to rules, involves
denigration of the civil servant who need to be treated with some respect; it hardly needs to be
stated that the Government being a model employer cannot act like the East India Company of the
bygone days when the conditions of service are broadly regulated by the Service Rules; thus, the
impugned action falls short of "fair standard procedures"; we gather an impression that the
impugned action of the borrowing department is prompted by the act of petitioner in approaching
the KSAT earlier and getting reprieve against his displacement.
(v) The learned Additional Advocate General Mr. Prasanna Deshpande, appearing for the State
sought to justify the action of the first respondent by placing reliance on the decision in Ashok
Kumar Ratilal Patel Vs. Union of India, (2012) 7 SCC 757; this case does not say anything
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120927525/ 4
Sri C B Chikkalagi vs The State Of Karnataka And Others on 28 September, 2020
inconsistent with what has been herein above stated; although the concept of deputation has been
discussed, it was in the context of appointment by deputation as contradistinguished from
deputation simplicitor; Lord Halsbury more than a century ago had observed in Quinn vs. Leathem,
1901 AC 495 that a decision is an authority for the proposition that it actually lays down and not for
all that which logically follows from what has been so laid down. Thus, the said ruling does not help
the respondents.
(vi) The deputationist has no legal right to the post/office to which he is deputed, as rightly argued
by the respondents; but that is not the case here and therefore this decision does not come to the
rescue of the respondents especially when Rule 50 of KCSR provides for a maximum period of five
years for deputation; there are some Government Orders presumably issued under this Rule which
broadly formulate the policy of deputation and it's tenure; the Government Order dated 19.11.1981
(reproduced in the writ petition and not controverted by the official respondents), prescribes the
consultation between the borrowing and the lending departments as a pre- condition for cutting
short the tenure of or extending the period of deputation; true it is that these Government
Orders/Circulars arguably may not have force of law so as to give a concrete cause of action for a
legal proceeding; but they provide the standards with which the validity of administrative action can
be assessed; even these orders have not been borne in mind by the first respondent in issuing the
impugned Notification.
(vii) The KSAT has disposed off the agitated cause of the petitioner without duly considering all the
above aspects urged by him in the Application; the only reason for disposing off the same is that
matter has become infructuous; what is stated at para-4 of the impugned judgment reads as under:
"4. Perused the materials. This application was filed in the year 2017 and as on today,
the period claimed by the applicant of two years has already been expired (sic).
Hence, the application becomes infrutcuous as on today."
It is very difficult for us to appreciate the approach of the Hon'ble KSAT to the grievance of the civil
servant, and with this observation, we part with this case, with no joy in heart.
In the above circumstances, this writ petition succeeds; a Writ of Certiorari issues quashing the
impugned order of the KSAT; a direction issues to the respondent Nos.1 & 2 to restore the petitioner
to the office which he had held on deputation immediately preceding the impugned Notification
dated 27.02.2020 at Annexure-A6; time for compliance is 15 days.
Now, no costs.
