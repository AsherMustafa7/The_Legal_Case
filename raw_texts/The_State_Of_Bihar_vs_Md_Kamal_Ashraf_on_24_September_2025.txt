2011 till 11.08.2022, the date on which the medical reimbursement has been settled in full and if the
interest is not paid within the stipulated period, the petitioner shall also be entitled to litigation cost

Heart Hospital, Patna where his angiography was conducted and three arteries were found blocked.
The doctor advised him to undergo bypass surgery as soon as possible. Thereafter, the petitioner
approached AIIMS, New Delhi for operation but immediate accommodation was not available.
Thereafter, he was admitted in ESCORT Heart Hospital, New Delhi where he underwent successful
bypass surgery and was discharged on 29.01.2009. On 21.10.2009, the petitioner applied for
reimbursement of medical expenses amounting to Rs. 5,59,772/-. However, vide letter no. 846

The State Of Bihar vs Md. Kamal Ashraf on 24 September, 2025
dated 21.03.2011, petitioner's claim was rejected on the ground that prior permission was not taken
from the Department for treatment outside the State of Bihar, which is in violation of the
Notification dated 20.05.2006 of the Health Department. Aggrieved by this, the petitioner preferred
CWJC No. 12317 of 2011 seeking reimbursement of the aforesaid medical expenses.
3. The learned Single Judge found that during the pendency of the writ petition, petitioner's claim
has been settled in respect of medical reimbursement on 11.08.2022. The learned Single Judge
further held that since there was belated settlement Patna High Court L.P.A No.163 of 2023
dt.24-09-2025 on the part of the concerned respondent, petitioner is entitled to interest on the
belated settlement of medical reimbursement and directed the respondents/appellants herein to pay
interest at the rate of 6% per annum from 1st August, 2011 till 11.08.2022, the date on which
medical reimbursement has been settled in full. The said interest was to be paid within a period of
two months from the date of the order of the learned Single Judge. The learned Single Judge further
held that if interest is not paid within the stipulated period, the petitioner shall be entitled to
litigation cost of Rs. 25,000/-.
4. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the present appeal has been preferred.
5. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the delay in reimbursement was partly
attributable to the respondent as he had not countersigned the documents as also had not complied
the terms and conditions stipulated in the Notification dated 20.05.2006. It is further submitted
that before filing the writ petition, the respondent could have approached the authority concerned
under the Bihar Litigation Policy, 2011 and avoided the litigation, but since the respondent did not
do so, the appellants herein could not pay the concerned amount as the matter was sub-judice.
Further, the learned counsel for the Patna High Court L.P.A No.163 of 2023 dt.24-09-2025
appellants submitted that after an order of the learned Single Judge, the appellants immediately
reimbursed the amount to him on 11.08.2022, and therefore, appellants cannot be held responsible
for the delay by imposition of interest at the rate of 6% in addition to the litigation cost of Rs.
25,000/-.
6. It is undisputed that the respondent herein is entitled to the amount for reimbursement of his
medical expenses, and the same had been paid by the concerned department when the writ petition
was pending. The singular question before the writ court was that whether the respondent herein
was entitled for the interest on the amount of medical reimbursement which had already been
settled by the concerned department. The said question was answered in affirmative by the learned
Single Judge taking into account the inaction of the appellants (respondent therein).
7. For a period of almost 13 years, there was non- payment of the medical reimbursement by the
appellants and the respondent had to approach this court for settlement of medical reimbursement.
The arguments of the appellants cannot be accepted by this court, as the appellants themselves
made the payment of the amount in pendency of litigation. Thus, the claim of the respondent has
not been disputed and the claim of Patna High Court L.P.A No.163 of 2023 dt.24-09-2025 the
respondent was delayed due to inaction on part of the appellants.

8. Therefore, we are of the view that the learned Single Judge has rightly held the petitioner entitled
for interest on the reimbursement amount.
9. Accordingly, we do not find any reason to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge, and
the present appeal stands dismissed.
10. Interlocutory application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.
