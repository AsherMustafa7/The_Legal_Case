He died on 14.04.1976. However, order dated 12.05.1997 was passed by the competent authority on
a dead person under Section 9(5) of the Urban Land Act, 1978 as amended. The notice under
Section 12(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was also not issued to the petitioners. Though the
respondents have taken symbolic possession of the lands, physical https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
possession still continues with the petitioners.
3. Mr.David Tyagaraj, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the entire acquisition
proceedings is bad in law under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 since the repealed Act viz., the Right
to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act
2013 is applicable and the principles laid down under Section 24(2) is applicable to the case of hand.
Therefore, the notification under Section 4(1) and Section 6(1) Declaration under the old Act are
liable to be quashed. The 4(1) notification has been issued in the name of a dead person which
cannot be sustained.
4. However, names of some of the petitioners did not find in the Section 6 Declaration and also does
not find some of the petitioners name.
Further, no notice of inquiry was issued under Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act. The
possession of the proposed land to be acquired is continuously in the possession and enjoyment of
the petitioners. So far, no compensation has been deposited and no compensation is received by the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis petitioners. Therefore, the entire acquisition proceedings have
been lapsed as per Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
5. Mr.A.Selvendran, Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submitted that the
acquisition proceedings were initiated for the Project of Outer Ring Road for the land admeasuring
12.96.0 Hec. situated at Karunakaracheri Village, Poonamallee Taluk, Tiruvallur District under the
Land Acquisition Act. The subject property in this writ petition admeasuring 500 sq.mtrs comprised
in Survey No.68/3A was also acquired.
The notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was approved by the Government in G.O.Ms.No.280
dated 06.07.2000. In fact, the petitioners had knowledge about the 4(1) notification and the inquiry
was conducted on 29.09.2000, 03.10.2000, 04.10.2000 and 05.10.2000 as contemplated under
Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act.
6. The physical possession of the subject property had already been taken as early as 18.12.2003 and
the compensation amount was also kept under the Revenue Deposit on 18.11.2003. Thereafter, the
subject land was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis handed over to the requisitioning body namely
the second respondent herein on 18.12.2003. In fact, the final notice regarding taking over
possession under Section 13 of the Survey and Boundaries Act, 1923 was also published in the
Tiruvallur District Gazette No.21 dated 14.06.2004.
7. It is also revealed that the notice under Section 9(3) and 10 of the Land Acquisition Act were
issued to the petitioners requesting them to appear for award inquiry and to produce the original
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182099338/ 3
Babyammal vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 29 November, 2021
documents to prove the ownership of the land comprised in Survey No.68/3A. However, petitioners
have not appeared for inquiry.
8. Therefore, though the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act in the
name of dead person, the petitioners being the legal heirs of the deceased Ganesan had knowledge
over the notification and they duly attended the inquiry conducted under Section 5A of the Land
Acquisition Act. They also raised their objections and sought for compensation to be paid to all the
legal heirs equally.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9. Therefore, the petitioners, being the legal heirs of the said Ganesan had knowledge about the 4(1)
notification and they have attended the inquiry conducted under Section 5A of the Land Acquisition
Act and raised their objections. Therefore, there is no prejudice caused to the petitioners by issuance
of notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act in the name of dead person namely the
first petitioner's husband Ganesan.
10. In so far as the compensation is concerned, the entire award amount was kept under Revenue
Deposit on 18.11.2003. In so far as the possession is concerned, the subject property had already
been taken as early as 18.12.2003 and handed over to the requisitioning body namely the second
respondent herein. Therefore, the acquisition proceedings have not lapsed as contended by the
petitioners.
11. That apart, the writ petition has been filed after a period of 13 years from the date of notification
issued under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act. In this regard, it is relevant to rely upon the
decision of Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and others etc
reported in 2020 8 SCC 129, wherein it is held as follows:
"366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years
excluding the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall
continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of 1894
as if it has not been repealed.
366.3. The word ‘or’ used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has
to be read as ‘nor’ or as ‘and’. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings
under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of
authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182099338/ 4
Babyammal vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 29 November, 2021
possession of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis land has not 317 been taken nor
compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession has been taken,
compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly, if compensation
has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
366.4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does
not include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is
provided in proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to
majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to
compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.
In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled,
interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of compensation (in court)
does not result in the lapse of land acquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit with respect to
the majority of holdings for five years or more, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis compensation
under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date of notification for land
acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
366.5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the
Act of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to
non-payment or 318 non-deposit of compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by
tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or
who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had
lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
366.6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not
part of Section 24(1)(b).
366.7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under Section
24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking
possession under Section 16 of the Act of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 1894, the land vests in
State there is no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has
been taken there is no lapse under Section 24(2).
366.8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in
case authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five
years or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending
with concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court
has to be excluded in the computation of five years.
366.9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the
legality of concluded proceedings of land 319 acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending
on the date of enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182099338/ 5
Babyammal vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 29 November, 2021
claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of
mode of taking possession to reopen https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis proceedings or mode of
deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition."
12. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that if the respondents made Revenue
Deposit, without production of any records, the petitioners are entitled for compensation under the
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement
Act, 2013 as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.
13. Considering the said submission, the consequence of non-deposit is provided in the proviso to
Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to the land owners as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894, shall be entitled to compensation
in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.
Therefore, this writ petition is devoid of merits and liable to be dismissed.
14. Accordingly, this writ petition is dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are
closed. No order as to costs.
