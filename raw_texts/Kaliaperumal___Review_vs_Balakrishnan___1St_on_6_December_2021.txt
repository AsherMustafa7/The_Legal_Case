COMMON ORDER
Both the Review Applications are directed against the common order passed in C.R.P.(MD)Nos.234
and 330 of 2021, dated 06.12.2021, on the file of this Court.
2. The first defendant is the review petitioner in both the review applications. For the sake of
convenience and brevity, the parties will hereinafter be referred as per their status/ranking in their
original suit. The gist of the journey of the cases up to the review application is as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022
(a) The plaintiff has filed a suit claiming the relief of specific performance of the
document dated 29.06.2009 in O.S.No.26 of 2010, on the file of the Subordinate
Court, Pudukkottai. Since both the defendants had remained expate, the decree was
passed on 15.02.2011 granting the relief as prayed for by the plaintiff. Thereafter, the
plaintiff has filed the execution petition in E.P.No.85 of 2011 for execution and
registration of the sale deed. Since the defendants had again remained exparte, the
Executing Court has executed the sale deed, dated 29.04.2013 and got the sale deed
registered. Subsequently, the plaintiff has laid another execution petition in
E.P.No.33 of 2016, seeking delivery of the suit property. The defendants had
remained exparte in the second execution proceedings and hence, delivery ws
ordered on 28.08.2019. Thereafter, the plaintiff has taken possession of the suit
property through Court and on that basis, the execution proceedings were ordered to
be terminated on 02.12.2019.
(b) The first defendant's wife Shanthi has filed three applications, one is in E.A.No.168 of 2019,
seeking possession of the suit property, second application in E.A.No.169 of 2019 for temporary
injunction and the third one in E.A.No.170 of 2019 for appointment of Advocate
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022 Commissioner. During
enquiry in E.A.168 of 2019, the said Shanthi has produced four documents and the same were
exhibited as Exs.P.1 to P.4 on her side. At that juncture, the plaintiff/decree holder has filed a
petition in E.A.No.11 of 2020 to eschew the documentary evidence adduced in Exs.P.1 to P.4 from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100870628/ 2
Kaliaperumal : Review vs Balakrishnan : 1St on 6 December, 2021
the evidence, as they are inadmissible in evidence and to receive the report of the Commissioner and
to record that the third party objector has no oral evidence and then to commence the enquiry from
the side of the plaintiff's side. The Executing Court, after enquiry in E.A.No.11 of 2020, partly
allowed the petition and dismissed the relief with respect to eschew of the documents in Exs.P.1 to
P.4 from the records. Aggrieved by the said dismissal of his petition in part, the plaintiff/decree
holder has preferred a revision in C.R.P.(MD)No.330 of 2021.
(c) The second defendant, who had remained exparte in the entire proceedings, has filed revision
petition in C.R.P.(MD)No.234 of 2021, seeking quashment of execution proceedings in E.P.No.33 of
2016.
(d) This Court, on perusal of the materials available and the records which were sent for from the
concerned Courts and on hearing https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99
of 2022 the arguments of both sides, has passed the impugned common order dated 06.12.2021,
allowing the revision in C.R.P.(MD)No.234 of 2021 and thereby quashing the entire proceedings in
E.P.No.33 of 2016 and further directed the plaintiff/decree holder to return back the possession of
the suit property to the defendants within a period of four weeks from the date receipt of copy of
that order and dismissed the revision in C.R.P. (MD)No.330 of 2021 as infructuous.
(e) This Court has further ordered that the judgment and decree dated 15.02.2011 passed in
O.S.No.26 of 2010 and the sale deed dated 29.04.2013 executed in favour of the plaintiff by the
Executing Court will be set aside on depositing a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- by the defendants before the
trial Court within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of that order, faling
which, the judgment and decree dated 15.02.2011 and the sale deed dated 29.04.2013 shall remain
in force and further directed the trial Court, on fulfilment of the above conditions, to set aside the
judgment and decree and permitted the plaintiff to make necessary amendments in the plaint within
fifteen days and to permit the defendants to file their written statement within 15 days thereafter
and then to proceed with the trial and dispose of the case https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022 within three months thereafter. Aggrieved by the impugned
common order, the plaintiff has come forward with the present Review Applications.
3. The main contention of the review petitioner/plaintiff is that the defendants/judgment debtors
have not prayed to set aside the judgment of the trial Court, that the judgment passed on 15.02.2011
was set aside after the lapse of ten years and the same would cause irreparable loss to the decree
holder, that the decree holder cannot be made responsible for the cryptic judgment passed by the
trial Court, that the second defendant has suppressed the pendency of the petition filed under Order
9 Rule 13 C.P.C., at the time of revision, that the second defendant has given false affidavit as if he
has gone abroad and remained there till 2019 and that the unregistered sale agreement relied on by
the plaintiff is admissible as per the decisions of this Court.
4. The learned Counsel for the second defendant would submit that the review applications are
legally not maintainable, that there is no apparent error on the face of the record warranting the
review of the order, that the above review applications do not fit within the purview of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022 Order 47 Rule 1 C.P.C.,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100870628/ 3
Kaliaperumal : Review vs Balakrishnan : 1St on 6 December, 2021
and that therefore, the review applications are liable to be dismissed.
5. A perusal of the Order 47 Rule 1 C.P.C., shows that the review of a judgment or an order could be
sought (a) from the discovery of the new and important matters or evidence which after the exercise
of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the applicant; (b) such important or evidence could
not be produced by the applicant at the time when the decree was passed or the order made and (c)
on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or any other sufficient
reason. It is settled law that the review proceedings are not by way of an appeal and have to be
strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order 47 Rule 1 C.P.C.. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Parsion Devi and Others vs Sumitri Devi and Others reported in (1997)8 SCC 715, has observed
thus:
“9. Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is
a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record. An error which is not self
evident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an
error apparent on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99
of 2022 the face of the record justifying the court to exercise its power of review
under Order 47 Rule I CPC. In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC
it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be "reheard and corrected". A review
petition, it must be remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be
"an appeal in disguise". “
6. In Lily Thomas, Etc. vs Union Of India and Others reported in (2000)6 SC 224, the Hon'ble Apex
Court has held that the power of review can be exercised for correction of a mistake and not to
substitute a view and such powers can be exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the
exercise of power. It is beyond any doubt or dispute that the review Court does not sit in appeal over
its own order. It is settled law that a rehearing of the matter is impermissible in law. The word
“review” would mean the act of looking offer something again with a view to correction or
improvement. No doubt, the review is the creation of a statute and not an inherent power. It is also
not an appeal in disguise. A judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an
error apparent on the face of the record under Order 47 Rule 1 C.P.C. An error which is not self
evident and has to be detected by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99
of 2022 a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record
justifying the Court to exercise its power to review under Order 47 Rule 1 C.P.C, and it is not
permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and corrected, but a review petition must be
remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an 'appeal in disguise'.
7. The learned Counsel for the review petitioners would contend that the plaintiff was in possession
of the suit property till the lodging of the complaint of the first defendant's wife Shanthi and a case
came to be registered in Cr.No.13 of 2010 of Thirumayam P.S., on 19.02.2010 under Sections 147,
148, 294(b), 353 and 506(ii) I.P.C., that the plaintiff was arrested and was in judicial custody, that
the plaintiff has preferred a complaint to the Legal Service Authority, Thirumayam alleging that a
false case was foisted against him and he was dispossessed from the suit property and that therefore,
directed the authority to give suitable directions to the Thirumayam P.S., to redeliver the suit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100870628/ 4
Kaliaperumal : Review vs Balakrishnan : 1St on 6 December, 2021
property and thereafter only the plaintiff was constrained to file execution petition for delivery of
possession in E.P.No.33 of 2016.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022
8. As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for the second respondent, this Court after reserving
orders in the revisions, has sought for clarification as to how the plaintiff had taken the sale deed, as
if he was not in possession and is entitled to take possession through Court proceedings, when he
himself has admitted that he was in possession of the suit property on the date of the suit and was
enjoying the injunction order protecting the possession till the disposal of the suit. At that time, the
learned Counsel for the plaintiff has submitted an explanation that during the pendency of the suit,
the plaintiff was dispossessed by the defendants forcibly and that is why the plaintiff was
constrained to lodge the police complaint. This Court has then observed that the plaintiff has not
filed the copies of the complaint alleged to have been given and the wife of the first defendant has
lodged a complaint to the Chairman of the Taluk Legal Service Authority, Thirumayam, complaining
that the plaintiff along with his henchmen has tresspassed into the suit property and after throwing
all household articles outside, locked the premises.
9. This Court, considering the above, has held that the plaintiff has not taken any steps to amend the
plaint alleging his dispossession and for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68
and 99 of 2022 seeking the relief of possession. This Court has further observed that the judgment
and decree dated 15.02.2011 does not speak about the possession and that the plaintiff has not
obtained any decree for the recovery of the possession of the suit property. The present contention
of the plaintiff that the complaint given by him and the reply given by the Legal Service Authority
will disclose the action taken by the plaintiff seeking redelivery of the suit property, was not all
raised, when this Court has specifically sought for clarification and it is only an after thought.
10. The learned Counsel for the plaintiff would further contend that the second defendant before
filing the Civil Revision Petitions, has filed an application in I.A.No.332 of 2020 under Section 5 of
the Limitation Act to condone the delay of 3298 days in filing the petition for setting aside the
exparte decree and that the second defendant has purposely suppressed the pendency of the delay
condonation petition and that the same would amount to material suppression.
11. In the common order, this Court has referred the petition filed under Section 5 of the Limitation
Act by the first defendant and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of
2022 condoning the delay and that the dismissal of the petition filed under Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C.,
for setting aside the exparte decree for default, as cost was not paid. No doubt, the second defendant
has not stated about the pendency of his petition filed under Sectin 5 of the Limitation Act before
the trial Court. It is pertinent to note that the plaintiff has also not whispered anything about the
pendency of the said petition in I.A.No.332 of 2020. As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for
the second defendant, the pendency of the delay condonation petition filed by the second defendant,
by no stretch of imagination, can be considered as relevant or material point for deciding the Civil
Revision Petitions. It cannot be stated that if the pendency of the delay condonation petition was
brought to the notice of this Court, this Court could not have granted the reliefs given to the second
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100870628/ 5
Kaliaperumal : Review vs Balakrishnan : 1St on 6 December, 2021
defendant.
12. The learned Counsel for the petitioner would submit that the second defendant without
exhausting the alternative remedies, filed the Civil Revision and this Court, by invoking powers
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, has quashed the entire execution proceedings and
also set aside the exparte decree and the judgment and relied on the recent judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Mohamed Ali https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of
2022 Vs.V.Jaya and Others reported in 2022 AIAR (Civil) 879, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has
held as follows:
“7.1 Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision to the facts of
the case on hand, the High Court ought not to have entertained the revision petition
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the exparte judgment and
decree passed by the learned Trial Court in view of a specific remedy of appeal as
provided under the Code of Civil Procedure itself. Therefore, the High Court has
committed a grave error in entertaining the revision petition under Article 227
challenging the exparte judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court and in
quashing and setting aside the same in exercise of powers under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India.”
13. As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for the second defendant, the above referred
judgment was passed on 11.07.2022, subsequent to the impugned common order and as such, the
explanation to Order 47 Rule 1 C.P.C., is very much applicable, which is to the effect that the
subsequent decision of the superior Court in any other case shall not be a ground for review of such
a judgment. Moreover, in the said https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99
of 2022 decision case, the dismissal of the petition filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act by the
first defendant has attained finality, that the defendants 2 to 4 have filed a petition under Section 5
of the Limitation Act to condone the delay of 2345 days in filing the petition for setting aside the
exparte decree and that since the said delay condonation petition was dismissed, they have
preferred a revision and whereas the first defendant has filed a revision for setting aside the exparte
judgment and decree and that this Court has allowed the two revision petitions and thereby setting
aside the exparte decree and judgment passed by the trial Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has
observed that the High Court has committed a grave error in entertaining the revision petition
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, challenging the exparte decree and judgment passed
by the trial Court and in quashing and setting aside the same in exercise of power under Article 227
of the Constitution of India. Since the facts of the case on hand are entirely different, the same
cannot be made applicable.
14. The learned Counsel for the plaintiff would further contend that this Court has gone into the
admissibility of unregistered sale agreement – Ex.A.1 and held that it is insufficiently stamped and
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022 unregistered document,
that while exercising power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the same cannot be
exercised as the Appellate Court appreciating the evidence that even the unregistered sale
agreement is admissible even after the amendment in the Registration Act in the year 2012, as per
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100870628/ 6
Kaliaperumal : Review vs Balakrishnan : 1St on 6 December, 2021
the decisions of this Court in D.Devarajan Vs. Alphonsa Mary reported in 2019(2) CTC 290 and in
G.Veeramani and N.Soundaramoorthy and others reported in 2019(6) CTC 580.
15. At the outset, it is pertinent to note that Ex.A.1 is titled as sale deed ( Rj;j fpiua rhrdk; ) and the
same is written in Rs.20/- stamp paper and unregistered and there was a specific averment that a
sum of Rs.4,75,000/- was received and possession was handed over on that day itself.
16. This Court, on considering the recitals of Ex.A.1 has specifically observed that the said document
can be considered as possessory contract of sale and that in the absence of the the defendants or
even in the presence of the defendants and on their failure to raise objections, it is the duty of the
Court to decide about the admissibility of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68
and 99 of 2022 the document and determine judicially about the admissibility of the documents
with respect to the Stamp Act.
17. This Court, after referring to the judgment of the Andrapradesh High Court in Syed Yusuf Ali Vs.
Mohammed Yusuf and Others, has held that the trial Court has failed to consider the admissibility of
Ex.A.1 nor gave any finding with respect to the same. Even assuming that the finding in this regard
is erroneous, that cannot be considered as a ground for review.
18. It is settled law that in exercise of review jurisdiction, the Court cannot re-appreciate the
evidence to arrive at a different conclusion even if two views are possible in a matter. Under the garb
of filing review petition, any party cannot be permitted to repeat old and over ruled arguments for
reopening the conclusions arrived at in a judgment. It is pertinent to note that power of review is not
to be confused with the power of appellate Court, which enables the superior Court to correct errors
committed by a Subordinate Court.. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/S Jain Studios Limited
Through its President vs Shin Satellite Public Co. Ltd in Review Petition (Civil) No.5970 of 2006,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022 dated 11.07.2006, has
observed as follows:
“11. So far as the grievance of the applicant on merits is concerned, the learned
counsel for the opponent is right in submitting that virtually the applicant seeks the
same relief which had been sought at the time of arguing the main matter and had
been negatived. Once such a prayer had been refused, no review petition would lie
which would convert rehearing of the original matter. It is settled law that the power
of review cannot be confused with appellate power which enables a superior Court to
correct all errors committed by a subordinate Court. It is not rehearing of an original
matter. A repetition of old and overruled argument is not enough to reopen
concluded adjudications. The power of review can be exercised with extreme care,
caution and circumspection and only in exceptional cases.”
19. Even assuming that the decision of this Court was erroneous on merits, the review power cannot
be exercised. In Inderchand Jain (D) through LRs., Vs. Motilal (D) through LRs., reported in
2009(5) CTC 365, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has specifically held that the power of review may not
be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits. As already pointed out, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/100870628/ 7
Kaliaperumal : Review vs Balakrishnan : 1St on 6 December, 2021
plaintiff has canvassed the very same points that were already raised and decided by this Court.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis REV.APLC(MD)Nos.68 and 99 of 2022 As already pointed out,
the review petitioner cannot re-argue the matter on merits.
20. Considering the above, this Court is of the view that the review petitioner has not shown any
error apparent on the face of the record or any other ground so as to attract Order 47 C.P.C., to
interfere with the order of the revisional Court. Hence, this Court concludes that the both the review
applications are absolutely devoid of merits and the same are liable to be dismissed.
21. In the result, both the Review Applications are dismissed. No costs. Consequently, the connected
Miscellaneous Petitions is also dismissed.
