2. Mr. R. Bharanidharan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that as against the
preliminary decree passed in A.S. No.12 of 2012, the petitioners have filed Second Appeal in S.A.
No.34 of 2013 and the same is pending before this Court.
3. Since the private respondents have registered the preliminary decree in A.S.No. 12 of 2012, which
is under challenge in the Second Appeal, in the event of the petitioners succeeding in the Second
Appeal, the Judgment and Decree to be passed in the Second Appeal may be registered by them
instead of cancelling the registration of the preliminary decree dated 24.11.2012. So far as the sale
deed dated 01.07.2013 is concerned, it is open to the petitioners to work out their remedy in the case
of they succeeding in the Second Appeal.
With these observations, the Writ Petition is disposed of. No costs. Consequently the connected
Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
