injection and they are going to sale the injection on higher price. The police reached to the spot and
apprehended the present applicant. The injection was found in possession of Ankit Solanki. Since
this applicant was also present in the car therefore, he was also arrested.

applicant died due to Covid-19 on 12.04.2021 and the injections were procured for
him but one injection could not have been used. For the purpose of treatment of
Covid-19 one injection is not sufficient, there is a prescribe dose of five injections.
Nothing is going to be served by selling one injection.
Learned Panel Advocate for the respondent/State opposes the bail application.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the arguments advanced by
learned counsel for the parties, without commenting on the merits of the case, the
application is allowed. The applicant is directed to be released on bail furnishing a
personal bond in the sum of Rs.30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand) with one solvent
surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court for his regular
appearance before the trial Court during trial with a condition that he shall remain
present before the Court concerned during trial and shall also abide by the conditions
enumerated under section 437(3) Cr.P.C.
Before releasing the applicant from the custody the jail authorities are directed to
medically examine him in order to rule out the possibility of COVID-19 infections and
shall comply with the direction given by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Writ Petition
No.1/2020.
