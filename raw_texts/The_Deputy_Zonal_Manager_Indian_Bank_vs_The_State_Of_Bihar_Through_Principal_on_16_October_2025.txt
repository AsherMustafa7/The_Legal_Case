issuance of appropriate writ/order/direction which the petitioner in the facts and
circumstances of this case be found entitled to".
3. The learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the petitioner is the
Deputy Zonal Manager of Indian Bank, Zonal Office, Gaya and the said bank is a public sector bank.
The learned senior counsel further submits that the certain quantity of gold was pledged before the
bank and loans were extended to a number of customers. Subsequently, the fact came to the notice
that there has been theft of gold so pledged with the involvement of certain staff of the branch
concerned. Thereafter, the FIR bearing Sheikhpura P.S. Case No. 239/2024 dated 31.05.2024 under
Sections 379, 406, 409, 420, 201 and 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code was lodged. During
investigation, police recovered the stolen gold. Subsequently, the customers came before the bank
for redeeming the gold. Thereafter, the bank moved before the court concerned for release of the
gold. But the court concerned has Patna High Court CR. WJC No.2518 of 2025 dt.16-10-2025 put
onerous condition for release of gold in violation of the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the cases of Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai vs. State of Gujarat, (2002) 10 SCC 283, Sunderbhai Ambalal
Desai vs. State of Gujarat, (2002) 10 SCC 290 & General Insurance Council vs. State of A.P., (2010)
6 SCC 768.
4. The learned senior counsel further submits that the learned trial court did not take into
consideration the fact that the bank is a public sector bank and the gold which has been stolen was
pledged by the customers for getting the loans and now if the customers want their gold to be
returned, the bank would not be able to return the same. The learned senior counsel further submits
that there is no objection from the side of prosecution in returning the gold to the bank. The learned
senior counsel further submits that the bank is ready to provide indemnity bond of Rs.2 crores, but
the learned trial court has been insisting upon furnishing two sureties of like amount in addition to
furnishing indemnity bond. But, this order is contrary to the aforesaid decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Sunderbhai Ambelal Desai (supra) & General Insurance Council
(supra). The learned senior counsel further submits that the bank is a corporate body and asking it
to Patna High Court CR. WJC No.2518 of 2025 dt.16-10-2025 furnish personal surety would
frustrate the whole purpose.
5. The learned senior counsel further submits that an application has been filed on 27.11.2024 for
modification of the order dated 01.10.2024, but the said application has not been disposed of by the
learned trial court till date.
6. The learned senior counsel, thus, confines his only prayer for disposal of the application dated
27.11.2024 pending before the learned trial court seeking modification in the release order of the
stolen gold, within the stipulated time period.
7. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State-respondents has no objection to such prayer
of the petitioner.
8. Since the petitioner has limited his prayer only for disposal of his application dated 27.11.2024
seeking modification in the release order dated 01.10.2024, this Court thinks it fit and proper to

direct the learned trial court to proceed in the matter showing urgency considering the submission
made on behalf of the petitioner.
9. Therefore, the learned trial court is directed to dispose of the aforesaid application dated
27.11.2024 within four weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order in the light
of new provisions contained in Section 497 of Patna High Court CR. WJC No.2518 of 2025
dt.16-10-2025 BNSS as well as law settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sunderbhai
Ambelal Desai (supra) & General Insurance Council (supra).
