Udhaw Singh vs Directorate Of Enforcement Lko. on 31 January, 2025
Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS) corresponding to Section 482 Cr.P.C. may kindly be
allowed and the impugned order dated 09.01.2025 along with order dated
08.01.2025 passed by the learned Court of Special Judge, Anti Corruption CBI West/
Special Judge, PMLA, Lucknow passed in Case No.1008 of 2024
ECIR/5/PMLA/LKZO/2021 U/S 3 & 4 of PMLA, 2002, Police Station-Directorate of
Enforcement, Lucknow Zonal Office may kindly be quashed/ set aside in the interest
of justice,"
3. Attention has been drawn towards Annexure No.3 of the petition/application, which is an
application filed by the Director of Enforcement (ED) under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money
Laundering Act, 2002 (here-in-after referred to as the "PMLA, 2002"). The aforesaid application
was filed on 08.01.2025 and the same has been decided on the same date i.e. 08.01.2025 whereby
that application has been allowed giving permission to Investigating Agency to confront the
applicant in Jail in respect of the material / evidence collected during further investigation in
respect of other accused persons by recording statement.
4. Shri Purnendu Chakravarty has stated that against the present applicant the charge-sheet has
been filed after completion of the investigation, therefore, the statement of the present applicant
should have not been recorded during the course of further investigation of other persons. Even if
during further investigation any material or evidence etc. has been found, which is relating to the
present applicant, at least an advance copy of the application filed by the ED should have been
provided to the present applicant in Jail so that he may approach his Advocate to oppose such
application but no advance copy of that application has been provided to the present applicant or his
counsel and that application was allowed by the learned trial court without any opposition on behalf
of the present applicant.
5. Shri Chakravarty has stated that on the next date of order dated 08.01.2025 the counsel for the
present applicant has filed an application on 09.01.2025 for recall of order dated 08.01.2025
making prayer that order dated 08.01.2025 be recalled and the applicant be provided an
opportunity of hearing before disposal of such application. That application has been rejected by the
learned trial court on the same date i.e. 09.01.2025 in the light of Explanation (ii) of Section 44 (1)
of the PMLA, 2002.
6. Since learned counsel for the applicant had placed reliance upon the decision of this Court
rendered in the case in re: Jaspreet Singh Garewal vs. State of U.P. & another (Case: Application
U/S 482 No.38644 of 2016) wherein this Court recalled its order only for the reason that before
passing order an opportunity to the opposite party was not given, learned trial court has observed
that the aforesaid decision would not be applicable in the present case inasmuch as the investigation
is going on in an issue in question and during investigation some material have been found which
should be confronted with the present applicant as that material relates with the present applicant.
7. The learned trial court has also observed that the issue in question is a serious issue having fraud,
forgery and bungling etc. to the tune of thousands crore and the accused applicant would have an
opportunity to admit such material or deny the same. The learned trial court has also observed that

Udhaw Singh vs Directorate Of Enforcement Lko. on 31 January, 2025
the Investigating Agency has right to file subsequent complaint under Section 44 of the PMLA,
2002.
8. Shri Purnendu Chakravarty has drawn further attention of this Court towards Section 50 (3) of
the PMLA, 2002, which categorically provides that all the persons so summoned shall be bound to
attend in person or through authorized agents, as such officer may direct, and shall be bound to
state the truth upon any subject respecting which they are examined or make statements, and
produce such documents as may be required.
9. Shri Chakravarty has submitted that the mandate of the aforesaid provision is that before
recording the statement of an accused person he should be summoned and this exercise has not
been undertaken in this case inasmuch as an application dated 08.01.2025 has been allowed
without providing an advance copy to the present applicant or his counsel.
10. Replying the aforesaid contention of Shri Chakravarty, Shri Kuldeep Srivastava, learned counsel
for the ED/ opposite party has placed reliance upon the dictum of Apex Court rendered in the case
in re: Abhishek Banerjee and another vs. Directorate of Enforcement reported in (2024) 9 SCC 22
referring para-22 whereby the Apex Court has interpreted the scope of Section 50 of PMLA, 2002.
Para-22 of the aforesaid decision reads as under:-
"22. It has been specifically laid down in the said decision that the statements
recorded by the Authorities under Section 50 of PMLA are not hit by Article 20(3) or
Article 21 of the Constitution, rather such statements recorded by the authority in the
course of inquiry are deemed to be the Judicial proceedings in terms of Section 50(4),
and are admissible in evidence, whereas the statements made by any person to a
Police Officer in the course of an investigation under Chapter XII of the Code could
not be used for any purpose, except for the purpose stated in the proviso to Section
162 of the Code. In view of such glaring inconsistencies between Section 50 PMLA
and Section 160/161 Cr.P.C, the provisions of Section 50 PMLA would prevail in
terms of Section 71 read with Section 65 thereof."
11. Therefore, as per Shri Srivastava, the Investigating Agency has rightly filed an application before
the learned trial court as during the course of further investigation in respect of other accused
persons some relevant material and evidence have been found which relates to the present applicant
and without confronting such material with the present applicant, he could have not been declared
the property of the present applicant. He has further submitted that had the applicant been not
languished in the judicial custody he would have been given a summon but since he is in judicial
custody, therefore, the permission has been sought from the Court to confront those material with
the present applicant by recording his statement in the Jail.
12. Shri Srivastava has further submitted that if the material/ evidence does not belong to the
present applicant, as it would be shown to him at the time of recording his statement, he may very
well deny but if that material belongs to him, he may apprise the Investigating Agency clearly.

13. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the material available on
record, I am of the considered opinion that in view of Section 44 of PMLA, 2002 the subsequent
complaint may be filed and in view of Section 50 of PMLA, 2002 such statement of the present
applicant may be recorded but as an abundant precaution a copy of the application dated
08.01.2025 should have been given to the present applicant. However, further investigation is going
on in an issue in question and some material / evidence is said to have been collected by the
Investigating Agency, which is/ are related to the present applicant, therefore, such material or
evidence must be confronted with the present applicant and his statement should be recorded on
that point.
14. In view of the facts and circumstances of the issue in question, non providing the advance copy
of the application dated 08.01.2025 to the present applicant would not violate his principles of
natural justice inasmuch as he could have not opposed such application but so as to balance the
equity and protecting the rights of the present applicant of fair trial, I find it appropriate that the
statement of the present applicant pursuant to the order dated 08.01.2025 would be recorded in the
Room of the Superintendent of Jail or Jailer of the Jail, Lucknow in the presence of his counsel so
that he could take proper assistance from his counsel.The Superintendent of Jail, Lucknow shall
make proper arrangements to that effect so that the aforesaid statement could be recorded smoothly
without any pressure. The aforesaid statement would be recorded on 06.02.2025 at about 10:30
a.m.. It is needless to say that no interruption of any kind whatsoever would be done from either
side.
15. In view of the aforesaid observations and directions, the instant application/petition is disposed
of finally.
16. Let a copy of this order be provided to the Superintendent of Jail, Lucknow by the Registry of
this Court within three working days for making appropriate arrangements in terms of this order.
