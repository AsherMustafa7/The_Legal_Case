ORDER
(18.07.2019) Per: Sujoy Paul, J.
This order will dispose of these batch of petitions, which are analogously heard on the joint request
of the parties.
WP-17859-2016 & WP-18489-2016 (2) These petitions are filed by the employer M/s. Rajasthan
Patrika Pvt. Ltd. feeling aggrieved by the order of the Deputy Labour Commissioner, passed in
exercise of power under Section 17(1) of the Working Journalists and Other Newspaper Employees
(Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1955 (hereinafter be called as the "WJ
Act"), pursuant to which the Revenue Recovery Certificate (for short the "RRC") was issued
commanding the employer to deposit difference of wages claimed by the respondent- employee.
(3) Shri Girish Patwardhan, learned counsel for the employer fairly submits that these two petitions
are identical. Facts are narrated from WP-17859-2016. Learned counsel for the employer submits
that the respondent-employee preferred an application claiming difference of wages to the tune of
Rs.9,06,108/-. The said claim application was served to the employer alongwith show cause notice
dated 02.07.2016 (Annexure-P/5). In turn, the employer filed his reply (Annexure-P/6). The
employee filed the rejoinder (Annexure-P/8). Thereafter, the employer filed written arguments
(Annexure-P/11) before the said authority. The said authority after hearing the parties, passed the
impugned order dated 19.09.2016 (Annexure-P/13). The learned Deputy Labour Commissioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67826273/ 4
M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
opined that there exists no dispute which requires adjudication and in absence of any rebuttal of the
factual claim of the employee, it is a fit case for exercising power under Section 17(1) of the WJ Act.
(4) Shri Patwardhan, learned counsel for the employer criticized the order by contending that in the
claim application the employee has not mentioned the basis on the strength of which he derived the
figures of Rs.9,06,108/-. The amount so claimed was never accepted by the employer while filing
response (Annexure-P/6). Pertinently, in written arguments (Annexure-P/11), the employer
categorically stated that in the manner amount is calculated in the statement of claim, the amount is
not acceptable. The employee has treated the petitioner-Institution as a Class-I Institution and
treated himself in Group-3, whereas petitioner-Institution falls within the ambit of Class-VII. Shri
Patwardhan submits that in view of existence of serious dispute, it was not open to the learned
Deputy Labour Commissioner to exercise power under Section 17(1) of the WJ Act. In addition,
when it was pointed out to him that Jaipur Labour Court in certain matters decided on 18th June,
2015 and 29th September, 2015 opined that such disputed claims cannot be subject matter of
adjudication under Section 33(C) (2) of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The respondent- employee
preferred an option/undertaking to get less wages than the wages payable as per Majithia Wage
Board Award and, therefore, he was not entitled to get higher wages than the wages for which
undertaking was furnished. Reliance is placed on the undertaking (Annexure-P/7). To elaborate the
aforesaid arguments, Shri Patwardhan placed reliance on the judgment of this Court passed in
MP-311-1980, [Ms/. Nav Bharat Press vs. State of M.P.]; 1980 Lab IC 684, [M/s. Newpapers and
Perodical, Banglore vs. State of Karnataka] and judgment of this Court reported in (2000) 3 MPHT
240, [Nav Bharat Press (Pvt. Ltd.) vs. State of M.P.]. It is pointed out that the aforesaid judgments
were considered by this Court in its recent order dated 09.05.2019, passed in WP- 18372-2018,
[M/s. Rajasthan Patrika Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of M.P.] and other connected matters. On the strength of
these authorities, it is argued that when there exists a dispute between the parties in relation to a
claim of amount, jurisdiction of authority, option by employee etc. the proper course is to refer the
matter under Section 17(2) of the WJ Act for its proper adjudication by labour Court. In support of
same principle, reliance is placed on the judgment of Delhi High Court in WP (C)-3783-2008, [The
Associated Press, through its General Manager vs. Laurinda Keys Long & another]; judgment of
High Court of Bombay in the case of D.B. Corporation Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra, WP-
1821-2018; judgment of Aallahbad High Court in Writ Petition (C) No.14105/2017, [Hindustan
Media Ventures Ltd. vs. State of U.P. & others] decided on 11.08.2017 and judgment of Gujarat High
Court in the case of Divya Bhaskar Corporation Ltd. vs. State of Gujarat, Special Civil Application
No.764 of 2018 decided on 02.02.2018. It is argued that since serious disputed questions of fact and
law were raised by the petitioners against the claim submitted by the Workmen, in the fitness of
things and in consonance of principle laid down in aforesaid cases, the dispute should have been
referred to the labour Court for its adjudication as per Section 17(2) of the Act.
(5) Per-contra, Shri Abhishek Arjaria, learned counsel for the employee in WP-17859-2016
supported the impugned order. By taking this Court to Sections 13 & 16 of the WJ Act, learned
counsel for the employee urged that it is the legislative mandate ingrained in the said Act to provide
statutory wages to the employees. In the case of Avishek Raja & others vs. Sanjay Gupta, reported in
(2017) 8 SCC 435, the Supreme Court has made it clear that Majithia Wage Board Award is to be
implemented as per the machinery mentioned under Section 17 of the WJ Act. By taking this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67826273/ 5
M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
to the reply submitted by the employer before the Deputy Labour Commissioner, Shri Arjaria
submits that there exists no dispute which requires adjudication and, hence, the order impugned is
in consonance with the principle laid down in Avishek Raja (supra) and the recent judgment of
Delhi High Court in the case of Living Media India Ltd. vs. Deputy Labour Commissioner and
another, W.P. (C) No.4048/2016 & CM. Appl. 17072/2016 decided on 28.05.2019.
(6) In rejoinder submissions, Shri Patwardhan has taken pains to contend that the question of
category of employee and class of employer coupled with the fact whether employer is running in
loss etc. are required to be seen before deciding the question of making payments to the employee.
All these aspects have been ignored by the learned Deputy Labour Commissioner and, therefore,
said order became valnerable.
(7) No other point has been pressed by the learned counsel for the parties.
(8) We have bestowed our anxious consideration on the rival contentions of the parties and perused
the record.
(9) Before dealing with the rival contention of the parties, it is apposite to mention that the Apex
Court has finally drawn curtains on the question of implementation of Majithia Wage Board Award
in the case of Avishek Raja (supra), wherein the Apex Court opined as under:
"26. Insofar as the highly contentious issue of Clause 20(j) of the Award read with the
provisions of the Act is concerned, it is clear that what the Act guarantees to each
"newspaper employee" as defined in Section 2(c) of the Act is the entitlement to
receive wages as recommended by the Wage Board and approved and notified by the
Central Government under Section 12 of the Act. The wages notified supersedes all
existing contracts governing wages as may be in force. However, the legislature has
made it clear by incorporating the provisions of Section 16 that, notwithstanding the
wages as may be fixed and notified, it will always be open to the employee concerned
to agree to and accept any benefits which is more favourable to him than what has
been notified under Section 12 of the Act. Clause 20(j) of the Majithia Wage Board
Award will, therefore, have to be read and understood in the above light. The Act is
silent on the availability of an option to receive less than what is due to an employee
under the Act. Such an option really lies in the domain of the doctrine of waiver, an
issue that does not arise in the present case in view of the specific stand of the
employees concerned in the present case with regard to the involuntary nature of the
undertakings allegedly furnished by them. The dispute that arises, therefore, has to
be resolved by the fact- finding authority under Section 17 of the Act, as adverted to
hereinafter.
27. In any event having regard to the legislative history and the purpose sought to be
achieved by enactment of the Act i.e. to provide the minimum if not a fair wage to
newspaper employees, the ratio of the pronouncement in Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd. v.
State of Ajmer [Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd. v. State of Ajmer, AIR 1955 SC 33], holding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67826273/ 6
M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 to be non-negotiable would
squarely govern the wages notified under the present Act. Para 4 of the Report in
Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd. [Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd. v. State of Ajmer, AIR 1955 SC 33]
which deals with the above issue is extracted hereinbelow for specific notice: (AIR p.
35) "4. It can scarcely be disputed that securing of living wages to labourers which
ensure not only bare physical subsistence but also the maintenance of health and
decency, is conducive to the general interest of the public. This is one of the directive
principles of State policy embodied in Article 43 of our Constitution. It is well known
that in 1928 there was a Minimum Wages Fixing Machinery Convention held at
Geneva and the resolutions passed in that convention were embodied in the
International Labour Code. The Minimum Wages Act is said to have been passed
with a view to give effect to these resolutions. (Vide South India Estate Labour
Relations Organisation v. State of Madras [South India Estate Labour Relations
Organisation v. State of Madras, 1953 SCC OnLine Mad 297 : AIR 1955 Mad 45 at p.
47] .) If the labourers are to be secured in the enjoyment of minimum wages and they
are to be protected against exploitation by their employers, it is absolutely necessary
that restraints should be imposed upon their freedom of contract and such
restrictions cannot in any sense be said to be unreasonable. On the other hand, the
employers cannot be heard to complain if they are compelled to pay minimum wages
to their labourers even though the labourers, on account of their poverty and
helplessness are willing to work on lesser wages."
(emphasis supplied)
28. There is nothing either in the provisions of the Act or in the terms of the Wage Board Award
which would enable us to hold that the benefits of the Award would be restricted to the regular
employees and not contractual employees. In this regard, we have taken note of the definition of
"newspaper employees", "working journalist" and "non-journalist newspaper employees"
as defined in Sections 2(c), 2(f) and 2(dd) of the Act. Insofar as "variable pay" is
concerned, as already noticed and extracted in para 10 above, this Court while
dealing with the concept of variable pay has taken the view that the said relief has
been incorporated in the Majithia Wage Board Award in order to give fair and
equitable treatment to employees of newspapers. Therefore, no question of
withholding the said benefit by taking any other view with regard to "variable pay"
can arise. In fact, a reading of the relevant part of the Award would go to show that
the concept of "variable pay" which was introduced in the Award stems from grade
pay contained in the Report of the Sixth Pay Commission and was intended to bring
the working journalist and non-journalist employees covered by the Act on a par with
the Central Government employees to the extent possible. So far as the concept of
heavy cash losses is concerned, we are of the view that the very expression itself
indicates that the same is different from mere financial difficulties and such losses
apart from the extent of being crippling in nature must be consistent over the period
of time stipulated in the Award. This is a question of fact that has to be determined
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67826273/ 7
M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
from case to case.
29. Having clarified all doubts and ambiguities in the matter and upon holding that none of the
newspaper establishments should, in the facts of the cases before us, be held guilty of commission of
contempt, we direct that henceforth all complaints with regard to non-implementation of the
Majithia Wage Board Award or otherwise be dealt with in terms of the mechanism provided under
Section 17 of the Act. It would be more appropriate to resolve such complaints and grievances by
resort to the enforcement and remedial machinery provided under the Act rather than by any future
approaches to the courts in exercise of the contempt jurisdiction of the courts or otherwise.
30. Insofar as the writ petitions seeking interference with transfer/termination, as the case may be,
are concerned, it appears that the same are relatable to service conditions of the writ petitioners
concerned. Adjudication of such question in the exercise of high prerogative writ jurisdiction of this
Court under Article 32 of the Constitution would not only be unjustified but such questions should
be left for determination before the appropriate authority either under the Act or under cognate
provisions of law (Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, etc.), as the case may be."
[Emphasis Supplied] (10) A careful reading of Para-26 of Avishek Raja (supra) leaves no room for
any doubt that after taking into account Section 2(e), Section 12 & Section 16 of WJ Act, the Apex
Court poignantly held that the wages cannot be less favourable to the employee other than that is
payable under Section 12 of the Act. In clear terms, it was held that Clause 20(j) of Majithia Wage
Board Award needs to be read and understood in the aforesaid light. In this view of the matter, in
our opinion, this cannot be doubted that claim arising of Majithia Wage Board Award preferred by
employees of News-paper Establishment needs to be examined as per the mechanism prescribed
under Section 17 of the WJ Act.
(11) Sections 17(1) & 17(2) in our opinion deals with two different eventualities. Section 17(1) of WJ
Act is almost pari materia to Section 33(C)(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This provision is
in the nature of execution proceedings whereas Section 17(2) deals with a situation where in the
event of a dispute, the appropriate Government is empowered to refer the dispute for its lawful
adjudication to a competent labour Court. Thus, Sub-section (1) of Section 17 proceeding is
execution proceeding which can be pressed into service when there exists no dispute. If there exists
a live dispute between the parties, the proper course is to follow the mechanism prescribed under
Section 17(2) of the WJ Act. Interestingly, this is the principle laid down in all the judgments cited
by Shri Patwardhan and Shri Arjariya. Interestingly, in certain judgments where the employer was
able to establish before the Court that there exists a real dispute and without considering this aspect,
mechanically RRCs are directed to be issued by invoking Section 17(1) of the WJ Act, interference
was made. Thus, spinal issue in these two cases is whether there exists any such factual dispute
which requires adjudication by the Court on a reference made under Section 17(2) of the Act.
(12) The claim application Annexure P/4 submitted by the respondent shows that alongwith this
application, a detailed chart was annexed wherein the basis of computation of amount was shown.
The claimant specifically stated that he is a senior reporter and an employee of present petitioner.
His salary is required to be paid as per Majithia Wage Board Award. Since salary has not been paid
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67826273/ 8
M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
as per said Wage Board, he computed the difference of salary which is mentioned in the annexures
to the claim application. The petitioner/ employer filed response to the show cause notice which was
pregnant with the claim application. In the reply Annexure P/6, the petitioner raised following
objections (i) as per clause 20(j) of Magithia Wage Board Award, if an employee prefers an option
for getting less salary/ emoluments, it will be open to pay him lesser wages. Since, respondent/
employee preferred such option (Annx.P/7), he is not entitled to claim the wages arising out of
Majithia Wage Board; (ii) the Labour Court, Jaipur decided two matters filed under section 33 (C) 2)
of the I.D. Act wherein the claim of newspaper employee for grant of Majithia Wage Board wages,
was declined; (iii) the claimant has already tendered resignation in December, 2013 and received all
dues.
(13) The claimant filed a rejoinder and specifically stated that he had not preferred any such
declaration (Annx.P/7). The order of Labour Court, Jaipur has neither been filed nor provided and,
therefore, no reliance can be placed on those orders. The petitioner filed written arguments
(Annx.P/11) on which heavy reliance was placed by Shri Patwardhan during the course of
arguments. A careful reading of reply to show-cause notice/ claim (Annx.P/6) makes it clear that
petitioner has neither disputed that claimant was an employee of institution nor disputed the claim
amount of Rs.9,06,108/-. It is for the first time by way of written submission (Annx.P/11), it is urged
that as per the statement of claim, the quantification of wages are not acceptable.
(14) This is settled in law that if something is pleaded in the claim application, the same must be
denied with accuracy and precision while filing the reply. If reply is pregnant with relevant
pleadings, necessary arguments can be advanced based thereupon either orally or by way of filing
written submission. In the main reply, there is no denial of quantification of amount claimed by the
employee. In absence thereto, it cannot be said that there exists a dispute on the question of claim
(to the tune of Rs.9,06,108/-). In other words, a party can say that there exists a dispute when a
claim preferred is categorically denied by the other side while filing reply. In 2008 (4) MPLJ 536,
[Smt. Gomti Bai Tamrakar & ors. vs. State of M.P. & ors.] and 2007 (3) MPHT 309 (DB), [Nagda
Municipality vs. ITC Ltd.], the Courts opined that if reply or pleading are silent on a question of fact,
no amount of argument can be advanced and accepted. For this reason, we are unable to hold that
present petitioners disputed the claim of the petitioner. The alleged dispute raised was founded
upon Clause 20(j) of the Majithia Wage Board award. At the cost of repetition, in our opinion, in
Para-26 of the judgment of Avishek Raja (supra), the Apex Court made it clear that by invoking
clause 20(j), lesser wages than the wages flowing from W.J. Act cannot be granted. Thus, dispute in
this regard raised by the employer is no dispute in the eyes of law. So far the orders of Labour Court
Jaipur are concerned, the said orders were neither placed before the authority below nor before this
court. Accordingly, this dispute also does not exist in the eyes of law. In Avishek Raja (supra), it is
made clear that if there exists no dispute, Section 17(1) can be invoked. In the instant case, as
analyzed, the employer has failed to raise any actual dispute while filing the reply before the Deputy
Labour Commissioner.
(15) We will be failing in our duty if argument of Shri Patwardhan in relation to category of
employee and class of newspaper establishment is not considered. Shri Patwardhan has taken pains
to canvass this argument on the strength of judgment of Allahabad High Court in the case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67826273/ 9
M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
Hindustan Media Venture (supra). In page-24, the court categorically recorded that petitioner from
very beginning stated that it shall be falling under clause 7 for the purpose of computation of gross
revenue. The classification of employees was also categorically pleaded which is taken note of by the
court in page-24 and 26 of the judgment. At the cost of repetition, there is no such factual
foundation in the reply filed by the employer before the court below. Thus said judgment cannot be
pressed into service.
(16) In the impugned order dated 19.9.2016, the learned Deputy Labour Commissioner has
categorically recorded that under clause 20(j) of Majithia Wage Board award, undertaking claiming
wages less than the Wage Board Award, is not enforceable. In categorical terms, it is recorded that
employer has not denied the calculation sheet annexed with the claim application and, therefore, the
claim amount is not disputed.
(17) We do not find any procedural impropriety or perversity in the order dated 19.9.2016
(Annx.P/13). In absence of any "dispute", the learned Deputy Labour Commissioner has rightly
issued the order dated 19.9.2016. In absence of any illegality which warrants interference by this
court, interference is declined. Petitions are dismissed.
WP-6102-2018 (18) In this matter also, the order of Deputy Labour Commissioner dated
30.09.2016 (Annx.P/3) is called in question whereby in exercise of power under section 17(1) of W.J.
Act, the learned authority issued RRC for ensuring payment to the claimant to the tune of
Rs.1,29,594/-.
(19) Shri Patwardhan, learned counsel for the employer by taking this court to the show-cause
notice dated 2.7.2016 (Annx.P/1) submits that although this notice was served on the petitioner, the
notice shows that enclosed claim application was not supplied and, therefore, the word "enclosed
application" was scored out in the notice. The petitioner filed a detailed reply to the show cause
notice which is running in eight pages. The petitioner categorically stated that the copy of claim
application and related documents were not supplied to him. In absence of supplying the said
application showing method of quantification, effective reply could not be filed. Even otherwise, the
claim of applicant was not tenable. The claimant is not entitled to any payment whatsoever.
Repeatedly it was mentioned that no chart has been supplied by the authority while issuing show
cause notice. The notice was issued without application of mind and without proper adjudication.
(20) Shri Patwardhan urged that without considering the aforesaid aspects, the learned Deputy
Commissioner mechanically passed the order dated 30.09.2016, It was erroneously held in this
order that there is no dispute between the parties. It was wrongly held that the petitioner, although
had raised certain disputes but there is no basis for such objection. The authority erred in holding
that the petitioner has not filed any objection with necessary particulars/ basis while disputing the
claim of the workman. It is argued that once claim is not admitted and is categorically denied, the
Deputy Labour Commissioner has erred in exercising power under sub-section 1 of section 17 of the
Act. Lastly reliance is placed on certain order of Depty Labour Commissioner filed with rejoinder.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67826273/ 10
M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
(21) Per contra, Shri Ashok Shrivastav, learned counsel for the claimant supported the impugned
order. He argued that if claim application and details were not supplied to the present petitioner, he
should have procured that application from the office of Deputy Labour Commissioner. Having not
done so, it is no more open to raise this objection for the first time before this court. Shri Shrivastav
also placed reliance on the claim application dated 8.12.2014 filed by the petitioner with the
rejoinder. The written submission of petitioner dated 2.9.2016 (Annx.P/8) with the rejoinder were
referred, to contend that the only objection raised by the employer is regarding jurisdiction/
competence of the authority and source of power has already been described by the competent
authority in the impugned order. Thus, no interference be made.
(22) No other point is pressed by learned counsel for the parties.
(23) We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length on this aspect and perused the
record.
(24) In the previous case, it was clearly held that power under section 17(1) is in the nature of
execution proceedings. This power can be exercised when there exists no real dispute between the
parties in relation to claim of amount. Thus, the spinal issue in this case is whether there exists any
"dispute" in relation to claim or not.
(25) In the reply, the respondents have categorically denied the claim. They averred that claim
applications were never served on them. Interestingly, alongwith rejoinder, orders dated 21.3.2017
(Smt. Mamta Bartriya Vs. Managing Director, order dated 25.03.2017 (Shri Kamlesh Dahare Vs.
Managing Director) and order dated 29.05.2017 (Shri Mahesh Giri Vs. Managing Director) are filed.
On these orders, heavy reliance was placed by Shri Patwardhan during arguments. It was pointed
out that these claim applications were also filed by respective claimants under section 17(1) of the
Act. However, the employer filed the reply and categorically denied the claim on facts. The authority
below opined that since there exists a dispute between the parties in relation to claim, the amount
cannot be said to be an admitted one and, therefore, RRC cannot be issued in exercise of power
under section 17(1) of the Act. Resultantly, in these three matters, recommendation were made to
the appropriate government for referring the matter/ dispute to the Labour Court in exercise of
power under section 17(2) of W.J Act.
(26) We find substantial force in the argument of Shri Patwardhan in this matter. We are unable to
hold that in this case there exists no dispute. It is seen that employer had specifically denied the
claim and raised certain legal objections in the reply. In this view of the matter, we are constraint to
hold that in the impugned order, learned Deputy Labour Commissioner has erred in holding that
employer has failed to raise the dispute. In our opinion, in the factual backdrop of this case, the
learned Deputy Labour Commissioner has erred in passing the impugned order dated 30.09.2016.
(27) Resultantly, the order dated 30.09.2016 is set aside. The matter is remitted back before the
learned Deputy Labour Commissioner to examine this aspect in entirety. This order will not come in
the way of respondent No.1 to pass appropriate order/making reference to the appropriate
government in exercise of power under section 17(2) of the Act.

(29) Shri Sankalp Kochar, learned counsel for the employer urged that all these matters are identical
in nature. Shri Ashok Shrivastava, learned counsel for the workmen did not dispute the said
contention. Accordingly, the matters are analogously heard.
(30) The facts are taken from WP No.1397/2017. In this case, the claimant preferred his application
Annexure P/3 before the Deputy Labour Commissioner. In this application, he claimed wages as per
Majithia Wage Board Award for the period between 11.11.2011 to 31.03.2014. In the prayer clause of
this application, he requested the Deputy Labour Commissioner to enquire about the non-payment
of said wages and apprise the Hon'ble Supreme Court. On this application, the petitioner was put to
notice vide notice dated 02.07.2016 Annexure P/4. In turn, the employer preferred a reply Annexure
P/5. Shri Sankalp Kochar submits that in the reply, petitioner raised an objection that the claimant
being a 'Carpenter' is not covered under the WJ Act. Petitioner's financial claim was disputed. It was
stated that the necessary amount has already been paid to the claimant. Since there exists a dispute,
power under Section 17(2) of the WJ Act can be exercised and matter may be referred to the Labour
Court for adjudication.
(31) Shri Ashok Shrivastava, learned counsel for the employee vehemently opposed the said
contention. It is submitted that there exists no dispute between the parties and; therefore, power
under sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the WJ Act was rightly exercised by the authority below.
(32) No other point is pressed by the learned counsel for the parties.
(33) In this case also, the pivotal question is whether there existed any "dispute" between the parties
in relation to the claim of the claimant. This point requires a microscopic scrutiny of the pleadings
before the authority below. As noticed, the claimant in this application has not even prayed for
issuance of Revenue Recovery Certificate or for direction to make the payment. His application was
filed to inquire into the matter and submit the inquiry report before the Supreme Court. When
petitioner was put to notice, on this application he filed reply and raised a legal objection that
claimant being a Carpenter is not covered under the said Act. On more than one occasion, a factual
assertion was made denying the claim submitted by the claimant. In the impugned order dated
28.09.2016, the learned Deputy Labour Commissioner opined that there is no dispute between the
parties because reason for "dispute" is not furnished with proof by the present petitioner. We are
unable to countenance this finding of learned Deputy Labour Commissioner. At the cost of
repetition, in our opinion, Section 17(1) power is in the nature of executing proceeding. If there
exists no dispute about the claim amount or there had been an adjudication in relation to said
amount which is derived after adjudication, RRC can be issued under Section 17(1) of the WJ Act but
this power cannot be exercised when claim is disputed by other side in specific. In the instant case,

M/S. Nai Duniya vs Dy. Labour Commissioner on 18 July, 2019
learned Deputy Labour Commissioner has erred in holding that there exists no dispute (as analysed
in the earlier portion of this order). In similar nature of disputes, Deputy Labour Commissioner has
sent the terms of reference to the appropriate Government for sending the same for adjudication to
appropriate Labour Court in exercise of power under sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Act. We fail
to understand as to why a different view is taken in these matters of similar nature. Resultantly, all
the impugned orders in these batch of petitions are set aside. To clarify, impugned orders of Deputy
Labour Commissioner, consequential RRCs and the order passed in review jurisdiction are set aside.
The matters are remitted back before the Deputy Labour Commissioner to pass appropriate orders
by taking into account the observations made herein above. It is made clear that this Court has not
expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. It will be lawful for the Deputy Labour
Commissioner to refer the dispute to Government to enable it to send it to Labour Court for
adjudication.
(34) Petitions are allowed to the extent indicated above.
