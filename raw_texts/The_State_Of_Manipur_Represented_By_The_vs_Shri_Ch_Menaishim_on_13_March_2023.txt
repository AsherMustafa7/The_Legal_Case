AND ORDER (CAV) (M.V. Muralidaran, Acting CJ) Heard Mr. M. Devananda, learned Addl. AG for
the petitioners and Mrs. H. Bisheshwari, the learned counsel for the first respondent.
MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C)
No. 308 of 2015) Page |4
2. MC (WA) No.48 of 2020 has been filed by the petitioners to condone the delay of 538 days in
filing the writ appeal against the order dated 6.8.2018 passed in W.P.(C) No.308 of 2015.
3. MC (WA) No.75 of 2021 has been filed by the petitioners to stay the operation of the order dated
6.8.2018 passed in W.P.(C) No.308 of 2015.
4. Mr. M. Devananda, the learned Addl. AG submitted that the first respondent has filed the writ
petition for a direction on the petitioners herein for payment of remuneration or allowances in
favour of the members of the village authority of Kambang Khunou Village, who were duly
appointed/elected by the villagers under the provisions of Manipur (Village Authorities in Hill
Areas) Act, 1957 and related Rules, 1957, in view of their duties discharged under the statute. By the
order dated 6.8.2018, the learned Single Judge disposed of the said writ petition with a direction to
the respondent authorities therein to work out appropriate remuneration for the members of the
Village Authorities not only in respect of Kabang Khunou village, but also in respect of all the other
Village Authorities constituted under the Manipur (Village Authorities in Hill Areas) Act, 1957 in the
State of Manipur who shall be paid remuneration and allowances as MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:-
WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) Page |5 fixed by
the State respondents in this respect within a period of six months from the date of passing the said
order.
5. The learned Addl. AG would submit that the order dated 6.8.2018 was communicated to the
Government authority by the State counsel on 7.8.2018 and on 9.8.2018, the Deputy Secretary has
put up the file to the Secretary (TA & Hills). On 22.10.2018, official correspondence was sent for
placing the matter in the meeting of the Committee for consideration and, on 18.3.2019, the
Additional Chief Secretary (TA & Hills) addressed a letter to the Chairman, Hill Areas Committee for
necessary action. In the meanwhile, on 6.7.2019, the writ petitioner's counsel sent a legal notice for
non-compliance of the order and, on 24.8.2019, Kuki Chiefs Association submitted a representation
requesting for appointment of Secretary and Members of Village Authorities.
6. The learned Add. AG further submitted that the petitioners have received notice in Contempt
Case No.142 of 2019 for non-compliance of the order and, on 18.2.2020, an order has been passed
for preferring an appeal against the order dated 6.8.2018 and after applying the certified copy of the
order and after obtaining of the same, on 6.3.2020, the appeal has been preferred with a delay of
578 days. After deducting the statutory MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140172229/ 3
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Ch. Menaishim on 13 March, 2023
MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) Page |6 period of 30 days and the 10 days
time gap between the application and obtaining the certified copy, there is a delay of 538 days in
preferring the appeal.
7. According to the learned Addl. Advocate General, there was a necessity to put up the file to two
major Departments i.e. TA & Hills Department and the Hills Areas Committee, Manipur Legislative
Assembly, wherein meetings/discussions were to be convened and while processing the files, it takes
much time. That apart, in between, there have been various Secretariat strikes from time to time in
connection with the revision of pay and, therefore, the delay is neither willful nor wanton. Unless
the delay of 538 days so caused in filing the appeal is not condoned and the appeal is taken up on its
merit, the petitioners would be put to irreparable loss. Thus, a prayer has been made to condone the
delay of 538 days in filing the writ appeal.
8. Per contra, Mrs. H. Bisheshwari, the learned counsel appearing for the contesting first
respondent/writ petitioner submitted that after processing of the file by the Deputy Secretary (TA &
Hills) and sent it to the Secretary (TA & Hills) on 9.8.2018, there is no proper explanation for the
period from 10.8.2018 to 21.10.2018, 23.10.2018 to 17.03.2019, 19.03.2019 MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020
(Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) Page |7
to 05.7.2019 and that the time taken by the petitioners from 9.8.2018 to 26.9.2019 to ascertain
whether the matter pertains to Manipur Legislative Assembly or TA & Hills is not satisfactory. In
fact, the decision to file an appeal was taken only after filing of the Contempt Case No.142 of 2019
only to evade the contempt proceedings. The 10 days' time between the filing of copy application
and obtaining of the certified copy cannot be deducted, as the petitioners have filed the copy
application only after the expiry of 30 days statutory period.
9. Mrs. H. Bisheshwari, the learned counsel for the first respondent further submitted that the
petitioners cannot give lame excuses that there have been various Secretariat strikes from time to
time in connection with the revision of pay etc. because it is an abuse of the process of law. Since the
petitioners failed to satisfy the sufficient cause for the delay and the explanation given by the
petitioners is not convincing, the learned counsel prayed for dismissal of the miscellaneous case.
10. We have considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
11. The order in W.P.(C) No.308 of 2015 was made on 6.8.2018 and it is not the case of the
petitioners that they have MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No.
75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) Page |8 no knowledge about the order dated 6.8.2018
passed in the writ petition. As per their own averments, the petitioners started communicating the
order on 9.8.2018 itself and the official correspondences were also exchanged between them.
According to the petitioners, only on 18.2.2020, an order was passed for preferring an appeal
against the order dated 6.8.2018 passed in the writ petition.
12. It is pertinent to note that the petitioners themselves admitted that they have applied the
certified copy of the order only on 25.2.2020 and obtained the same on 5.3.2020. At this juncture, it
is pertinent to point out that it is the bounden duty of the Government authorities to instruct the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140172229/ 4
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Ch. Menaishim on 13 March, 2023
State counsel to apply the certified copy of the order on the next date for preferring an appeal, if they
aggrieved. In the case on hand, the petitioners have failed to do so, which will clearly prove that they
have not taken due care even for applying the certified copy of the order of the learned Single Judge
passed in the writ petition. Such an act of the petitioners is not appreciable.
13. Coming to the explanation offered by the petitioners for the delay occurred qua the time taken by
the petitioners to ascertain whether the matter pertains to Manipur Legislative Assembly or TA &
Hills is not the proper explanation for the delay. MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of
2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) Page |9 The another explanation
given by the petitioners that there have been various Secretariat strikes from time to time in
connection with the revision of pay etc. is also not the proper explanation for the delay and such
lame excuses given by the petitioners cannot be countenanced. As rightly argued by the learned
counsel for the first respondent, faced with the contempt notice in Contempt Case No.142 of 2019,
the petitioners have decided to file the writ appeal against the order dated 6.8.2018 and it is to be
pointed out that they have applied the certified copy of the order only on 25.2.2020.
14. At this juncture, the learned Addl. Advocate General appearing for the petitioners argued that
liberal approach has to be adopted in delay condonation application and refusal to condone the
delay would cause serious prejudice to the petitioners. The aforesaid argument of the learned Addl.
Advocate General cannot be countenanced for the simple reason that the petitioners have failed to
explain the delay so caused and the explanation given for the delay in filing the appeal is not
satisfactory.
15. It appears that the affidavit filed in support of the petition, does not disclose sufficient cause for
condonation of such huge delay. As stated supra, it is simply stated that MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020
(Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e |
10 because of the time taken to ascertain whether the matter pertains to Manipur Legislative
Assembly or TA & Hills and there have been various Secretariat strikes from time to time, the
petitioners are unable to file the appeal in time. Nothing has been produced by the petitioners to
prove the same. Further, the aforesaid explanation cannot be the reason for not preferring the
appeal within the statutory period of limitation.
16. Under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, it is only sufficiency of the cause that matters and not the
length and breadth of the delay. While dealing with the Section 5 application, the question of
diligence or bonafides are to be considered.
17. It is settled law that length of delay is no matter, acceptability of the explanation is the only
criterion. Sometimes delay of the shortest range may be uncondonable due to want of acceptable
explanation whereas in certain other cases delay of very long range can be condoned as the
explanation thereof is satisfactory. Admittedly, in the case on hand, the explanation offered by the
petitioners is not satisfactory.
18. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Esha Bhattacharjee v. Managing Committee of
Raghunathpur Nafar Academy and others, 2013 (5) CTC 547 (SC) held that MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020

11 there should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice oriented, non- pedantic approach while dealing with
an application for condonation of delay. The Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to its earlier
judgments in G. Ramegowda, Major and others v. Special Land Acquisition Officer, Bangalore, 1988
(2) SCC 142; O.P. Kathpallia v. Lakhmir Singh (dead) and others, 1984 (4) SCC 66; State of
Nagaland v. Lipok AO and others, 2005 (3) SCC 752; New India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shanti Misra,
1975 (2) SCC 840; Oriental Aroma Chemical Industries Limited v. Gujarat Industrial Development
Corporation and another, 2010 (5) SCC 459, which declared that the Court should be liberal in
dealing with condone delay petition. In paragraphs 15 and 16, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held thus:
"15. From the aforesaid authorities the principles that can broadly be culled out are:
(i) There should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice-
oriented, non-pedantic approach while dealing with an application for condonation of delay, for the
Courts are not supposed to legalise injustice but are obliged to remove injustice.
(ii) The terms sufficient cause should be understood in their proper spirit, philosophy and purpose
regard being had to the fact that these terms are basically elastic and are to be applied in proper
perspective to the obtaining fact-situation.
(iii) Substantial justice being paramount and pivotal the technical considerations should not be
given undue and uncalled for emphasis.
(iv) No presumption can be attached to deliberate causation of delay but, gross negligence on the
MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C)
No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 12 part of the Counsel or litigant is to be taken note of.
(v) Lack of bona fides imputable to a party seeking condonation of delay is a significant and relevant
fact.
(vi) It is to be kept in mind that adherence to strict proof should not affect public justice and cause
public mischief because the Courts are required to be vigilant so that in the ultimate eventuate there
is no real failure of justice.
(vii) The concept of liberal approach has to en capsule the conception of reasonableness and it
cannot be allowed a totally unfettered free play.
(viii) There is a distinction between inordinate delay and a delay of short duration or few days, for to
the former doctrine of prejudice is attracted whereas to the latter it may not be attracted. That apart,
the first http://www.judis.nic.in one warrants strict approach whereas the second calls for a liberal
delineation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140172229/ 6
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Ch. Menaishim on 13 March, 2023
(ix) The conduct, behaviour and attitude of a party relating to its inaction or negligence are relevant
factors to be taken into consideration. It is so as the fundamental principle is that the Courts are
required to weigh the scale of balance of justice in respect of both parties and the said principle
cannot be given a total go by in the name of liberal approach.
(x) If the explanation offered is concocted or the grounds urged in the application are fanciful, the
Courts should be vigilant not to expose the other side unnecessarily to face such a litigation.
(xi) It is to be borne in mind that no one gets away with fraud, misrepresentation or interpolation by
taking recourse to the technicalities of law of limitation.
(xii) The entire gamut of facts are to be carefully scrutinized and the approach should be based on
the paradigm of judicial discretion which is founded on objective reasoning and not on individual
perception.
(xiii) The State or a public body or an entity representing a collective cause should be given some
acceptable latitude.
MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C)
No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 13
16. To the aforesaid principles we may add some more guidelines taking note of the present day
scenario. They are:
(a) An Application for condonation of delay should be drafted with careful concern
and not in a half hazard manner harbouring the notion that the Courts are required
to condone delay on the bedrock of the principle that adjudication of a lis on merits is
seminal to justice dispensation system.
(b) An application for condonation of delay should not be dealt with in a routine
manner on the base of individual philosophy which is basically subjective.
(c) Though no precise formula can be laid down regard being had to the concept of
judicial discretion, yet a conscious effort for achieving consistency and collegiality of
the adjudicatory system should be made as that is the ultimate institutional motto.
(d) The increasing tendency to perceive delay as a non-serious matter and, hence,
lackadaisical propensity can be exhibited in a non-challan manner requires to be
curbed, of course, within legal parameters."
19. In Esha Bhattacharjee, supra, the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to some of its judgments
regarding Law of Limitation. It may be useful to extract paragraphs 10, 11 and 12, which read as
follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140172229/ 7
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Ch. Menaishim on 13 March, 2023
"10. In this context, we may refer with profit to the authority in Oriental Aroma
Chemical Industries Limited v. Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation and
another, 2010 MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA)
No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 14 (5) SCC 459, where a
Two-Judge Bench of this Court has observed that the law of limitation is founded on
public policy. The legislature does not prescribe limitation with the object of
destroying the rights of the parties but to ensure that they do not resort to dilatory
tactics and seek remedy without delay. The idea is that every legal remedy must be
kept alive for a period fixed by the legislature. To put it differently, the Law of
Limitation prescribes a period within which legal remedy can be availed for redress of
the legal injury. At the same time, the Courts are bestowed with the power to condone
the delay, if sufficient cause is shown for not availing the remedy within the
stipulated time. Thereafter, the learned Judges proceeded to state that this Court has
justifiably advocated adoption of liberal approach in condoning the delay of short
duration and a stricter approach where the delay is inordinate.
11. In Improvement Trust, Ludhiana v. Ujagar Singh and others, 2010 (6) SCC 786, it
has been held that while considering an Application for condonation of delay no
straitjacket formula is prescribed to come to the conclusion if sufficient and good
grounds have been made out or not. It has been further stated therein that each case
has to be weighed from its facts and MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308
of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 15 the
circumstances in which the party acts and behaves.
12. A reference to the principle stated in Balwant Singh (dead) v. Jagdish Singh and
others, 2010 (8) SCC 685 would be quite fruitful.
In the said ca se the Courtreferred to the pronouncements in Union of India v. Ram Charan, AIR
1964 SC 215; P.K. Ramachandran v. State of Kerala, 1997 (2) CTC 663 (SC) :
1997 (7) SCC 556; and KatariSuryanarayana v. KoppisettiSubba Rao, 2009 (4) CTC
286 (SC):
2009 (11) SCC 183 and stated thus:
"We may state that even if the term sufficient cause has to receive liberal
construction, it must squarely fall within the concept of reasonable time and proper
conduct of the party concerned. The purpose of introducing liberal construction
normally is to introduce the concept of reasonableness as it is understood in its
general connotation.
The Law of Limitation is a substantive law and has definite consequences on the right
and obligation of a party to arise. These principles should be adhered to and applied
appropriately depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case. Once a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140172229/ 8
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Ch. Menaishim on 13 March, 2023
valuable right has accrued in favour of one party as a result of the failure of the other
party to explain the delay by showing sufficient cause and its own conduct, it will be
unreasonable to take away that right on the mere asking of the applicant, particularly
when the delay is directly a result of negligence, default or inaction of that party.
Justice must be done MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and
MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 16 to both parties
equally. Then alone the ends of justice can be achieved. If a party has been
thoroughly negligent in implementing its rights and remedies, it will be equally unfair
to deprive the other party of a valuable right that has accrued to it in law as a result of
his acting vigilantly."
20. In Maniben Devaraj Shah v. Municipal Corporation of Brihan Mumbai, (2012) 5 SCC 157, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held thus:
"24. What colour the expression "sufficient cause" would get in the factual matrix of a
given case would largely depend on bona fide nature of the explanation. If the court
finds that there has been no negligence on the part of the applicant and the cause
shown for the delay does not lack bona fides, then it may condone the delay. If, on the
other hand, the explanation given by the applicant is found to be concocted or he is
thoroughly negligent in prosecuting his cause, then it would be a legitimate exercise
of discretion not to condone the delay.
21. In Maniben Devaraj Shah, supra, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, upon perusal of the application for
condonation of delay and the affidavit on record, came to hold that certain necessary facts were
conspicuously silent and, accordingly, MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and
MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 17 reversed the decision of the High
Court which had condoned the delay of more than seven years. In the present case, the delay is more
than one-and-half years.
22. As stated supra, in the present case, the explanation for the delay given by the petitioners is not
acceptable. Though liberal approach is to be taken in a petition under Section 5 of the Limitation
Act, the petitioners have not shown semblance of bona fide for the delay on their part in preferring
the writ appeal within the period of limitation.
23. We are in full agreement with the proposition that refusal to condone the delay would result
foreclosing a suitor from putting forth his cause and there is no presumption that delay in
approaching the Court is always deliberate. But at the same time the other side should not be
suffered.
24. In the instant case, the first respondent has filed the writ petition seeking for a direction on the
petitioners for payment of remuneration in favour of the members of the Village Authority of
Kambang Khunou Village, who were duly appointed by the villagers under the provisions of the
Manipur (Village Authorities in Hill Areas) Act, 1957 and related Rules, 1957, in view of the duties
discharged under the statute. Though the petitioners have resisted the writ petition contending that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140172229/ 9
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Ch. Menaishim on 13 March, 2023
neither the Act nor the MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75
of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 18 Rules provide for payment of remuneration to the
members of the Village Authority, having found that the said explanation given by the petitioners is
unacceptable for the reason that no authority who is exercising certain statutory duties of certain
body created by the statute should be deprived of any such remuneration unless specifically stated
to that effect in the statute, the learned Single Judge of this Court held that it is the duty of the State
Government to give adequate remuneration commensurate with the status and duties discharged by
the members of the Village Authorities constituted under the Act.
25. On a reading of the order of the learned Single Judge, we find that taking note of the duties
discharged by the members of the Village Authorities constituted under the Act, the learned Single
Judge directed the authorities of the State Government, the petitioners herein, to work out
appropriate remuneration for the members of the Village Authorities not only in respect of
Kambang Khunou village but also in respect of all the other Village Authorities constituted under
the Act in the State of Manipur. We find that the learned Single Judge after considering the larger
interest involved has issued such a direction and we find no fault in it, as the petitioners herein have
failed to substantiate their plea. However, they had filed the writ MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:-
WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 19
appeal on their own with a delay of 538 days without showing the sufficient cause.
26. It is to be pointed out that if a litigant chooses to approach the Court long after the time
prescribed under the relevant provisions of law, he/she cannot say that no prejudice would be
caused to the other side by the delay being condoned. The other side would have in all probability
destroyed the records thinking that the records would not be relevant as there was no further
proceedings in the matter.
27. In the case on hand, the length of the delay is a relevant matter to be taken into account while
considering whether the delay should be condoned or not. Further, the failure of the petitioners in
applying the certified copy of the order of the learned Single Judge would disentitle for condonation
of the delay. It is not open to any litigant to fix his own period of limitation for instituting
proceedings for which law has prescribed periods of limitation.
28. From a reading of the averments, it is seen that the petition seeking to condone the delay of 538
days has been filed in a casual manner without giving proper reasons, much less MC(WA) No. 48 of
2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of 2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a
g e | 20 acceptable reasons and, therefore, the same cannot be sustained in law.
29. At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the petitioners have not shown sufficient cause to
condone the delay as contemplated in the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, supra. The
petitioners are seriously lacking to apply the provision of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, as the
affidavit filed by the petitioners in support of the petition is very vague and bereft of material
particulars without any convincing explanation for the period commencing from the date of the
order passed and/or the expiry of statutory period till the date of filing of the petition. In the case on
hand, the inordinate delay of 538 days in filing the appeal has not been properly explained by the

petitioners.
30. Applying the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to the facts and circumstances of the
case on hand, we are of the view that the petitioners have failed to explain each and every day delay
and the explanation given by the petitioners is not convincing and only to maintain the present
petition, the petitioners have invented such explanation.
31. For the foregoing discussions, MC (WA) No.48 of 2020 is dismissed. In view of the dismissal of
MC (WA) No.48 of MC(WA) No. 48 of 2020 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) and MC(WA) No. 75 of
2021 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 308 of 2015) P a g e | 21 2020, the question of considering the stay of
operation of the order of the learned Single Judge in W.P.(C) No.308 of 2015, dated 6.8.2018 does
not arise. Accordingly, MC (WA) No.75 of 2021 fails and it is also dismissed. No costs.
