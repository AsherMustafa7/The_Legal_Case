P a g e 3 | 18 [4] The respondent No. 1, on 01.02.2024, issued grounds of detention
and furnished a copy thereof to the petitioner vide letter No. Cril/NSA/No. 1 of 2024.
[5] Brief facts of the case are as follows:
The present petitioner has filed this Writ Petition challenging the veracity and
correctness of the order of detention dated 30/01/2024 and subsequent order of
approval and confirmation order issued by Joint Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur. The allegations in short are that the petitioner is a member of Kangleipak
Communist Party (Noyon Group) and is involved in activities prejudicial to the
security of state and maintenance of public order. As per the allegations in the
grounds of detention; reliable information was received by the Imphal East Police
Station on 05/01/2024 at about 4:00 p.m. that some active members of the outfit
KCP (Noyon Group) were present at the Sangakpham Bazar, Imphal East District,
Manipur. A team of Imphal East District Police led by Inspector Kh. Henery,
Officer-in-charge of Commando, Imphal East Unit and Inspector Kh. Pathou Meitei,
OC/HNG-PS/Imphal East and a column of 4 AR under the overall supervision of Shri
Dr. S. Ibomcha Singh, MPS Superintendent of Police, Imphal East rushed to the said
area and conducted a search operation. In that operation the combined team
detained one suspect for verification. On verification, the detenu identified himself as
one Imtiyas Khan, an active member of outfit KCP (Noyon Group). The said Imtiyas
further disclosed that he was working under one Thokchom Romeschandra P a g e 4 |
18 Singh and at his instance he had extorted money from Pharmacy Shops at
Sangakpham Bazar and he also disclosed that his associate Th. Romeschandra and
one Md. Salim are waiting for him at Keirang, Imphal East. Immediately the
combined team rushed to Keirang and arrested Thokchom Romeschandra @
Ayangba, aged about 33 years and one Md. Salim, aged about 30 years. The O/E was
submitted to the officer-in-charge HNG-PS on the same day at about 9:20 p.m. After
that the accused was produced before the Special Judge (NIA) and remanded to
Judicial Custody. [6] The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner
submits that the detaining authority did not formulate the grounds of detention
before passing the detention order; asserting that the grounds of detention are a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56131610/ 3
Shri Thokchom Romeschandra Singh @ ... vs The District Magistrate on 25 October, 2024
pre-condition, as observed by a catena of decisions of Hon'ble Apex Court, and as
such, the detention order is an unfounded one. [7] Further, the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that after going through the grounds of
detention and the detention order, it is crystal clear that there is no material before
the detaining authority for coming to the conclusion that the petitioner is likely to be
released on bail. The decisions of Hon'ble Apex Court have struck down the detention
orders and confirmation orders on the ground of the vitiation of the subjective
satisfaction of the detaining authority. The asseveration of the detaining authority in
the detention order that bail is granted by Criminal Courts in similar cases are a
totally self-serving and false statement. Moreover, the said assertion not supported
by any material facts and it is P a g e 5 | 18 only ipse-dixit of the detaining authority
and therefore, the impugned orders are liable to be set aside.
[8] The petitioner, through his former counsel, on 08.02.2024, submitted an
application to the Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail Sajiwa requesting him to
supply copies of the representation to the respondent No. 1, 2 & 4 for revocation of
the detention order.
On the same day, an order was issued by the Home Department, Government of
Manipur approving the impugned detention order passed by the District Magistrate,
Imphal East, is approved (Annexure
- A/4), which reads as follow:
"GOVERNMENT OF MANIPUR SECRETARIAT: HOME DEPARTMENT ORDERS

[9] The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner further more submits
that he filed a Bail Application before the Special Judge (NIA), Imphal East, being
Cril. Misc. (B) No. 6 of 2024 [Ref. : 02(01)2024 HNG-P.S. U/S 17/20 UA(P) Act. The
said application was disposed of as uncontested - not pressed.
The said representation dated 08.02.2024 for revocation of the detention order was rejected by the
respondent No. 1 vide letter No. Cril/NSA/No. 1 of 2024, dated 13.02.2024. However, there was a
delay while rejecting the representation in relation to the detention order. Operative portion of the
said letter is extracted herein below:
"In inviting a reference to your representation dated 08.02.2024 addressed to the
Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur forwarded by Inspector General of Police
(Prisons), Manipur vide his letter No. 9/4/2022-IG(J)/3385 dated 08.02.2024
against the detention under NSA regarding the above subject, and to inform you that
your representation has been considered carefully by the State Government and it
has come to the conclusion that your request for revocation of the detention order
cannot be acceded to as the representation is found to be devoid of merit."
P a g e 7 | 18 The respondent No. 2 also rejected the said representation vide letter No.
Cril/NSA/No. 1 of 2024, dated 13.02.2024. However, there is also a delay in rejecting the
representation based on the detention order. Operative portion of the said letter is extracted herein
below:
"12. Hence, it is highly regretted, to inform you that the request for revocation of the
detention orders under reference No. Cril/NSA/No. 1 of 2024 dated 30th January,
2024 and allegation made by you has not been acceded to by this Office, as the
submissions made therein are not maintainable."
[10] The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the respondent No. 4 did
not consider the representation for revocation of the detention order on the report submitted by the
respondent No. 2. The respondent No. 1 also did not consider the representation till date. Therefore,
the impugned orders are liable to be set aside on the following grounds:

Shri Thokchom Romeschandra Singh @ ... vs The District Magistrate on 25 October, 2024

orders annexed in Annexures - A/1 and A/4 are liable to be set aside.
(ii) The detaining authority did not formulate the grounds of detention before passing

P a g e 8 | 18
(iii) There is no material before coming to the conclusion that the petitioner is likely

(iv) There was no material before the detaining authority for coming to the

(v) There is no bail order for graining bail with respect to FIR No. 146(9)2008
MRG-PS and FIR No. 28(6)2020 BPR-PS enclosed to the grounds of detention and
as such, the satisfaction of the detaining authority for likely to be released on bail is
nothing but ipse-dixit and as such, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.
(vi) The documents annexed to the ground of detention are not readable, so could not
provide an effective representation and as such, the impugned order is liable to set
aside.
(vii) The respondent No. 1 is not aware of the likelihood of continuation of prejudicial
activity after releasing on bail and as such, the impugned orders are liable to be set
aside.
P a g e 9 | 18
(viii) Nothing is mentioned in the detention order that the detenue would continue
his prejudicial activity after releasing on bail and as such, the impugned order is
liable to be set aside.
(ix) The respondent No. 1 did not forward the approved report to the respondent No.
1 as required by Section 3(5) of NSA and as such, the impugned orders are liable to be
set aside.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56131610/ 6
Shri Thokchom Romeschandra Singh @ ... vs The District Magistrate on 25 October, 2024
(xi) The respondent No. 4 did not dispose of the representation dated 08.02.2024 till
date and as such, the impugned orders are liable to be set aside.
[11] During the course of hearing, Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner advanced arguments only on the solitary ground that there is an unexplained delay in
disposal of the petitioner's constitutionally enabled representation, on the part of the Central
Government.
In this behalf, the petitioner filed a representation addressed to the respondent No. 4, i.e. Union of
India on 03.08.2024, through P a g e 10 | 18 respondent No. 3, i.e. the Superintendent of Police,
Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa with a forwarding letter requesting the respondent No. 3 to obtain
signature from the detenu and forward the same to the respondent No. 4 with 6 (six) copies of the
representation. As per the tracking report of Speed Post, it is indicated that the same was received
on 09.08.2024. [12] The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the
respondent No. 4 filed affidavit on 08.10.2024 stating that the said representation was received by
the Central Government only on 09.09.2024 at 12:15 p.m. through e-mail submitted by the Home
Department, Government of Manipur and that thereafter, his representation was considered and
rejected on the 12.09.2024.
The respondent No. 3 also filed affidavit to the additional affidavit filed by the petitioner on
13.09.2024 wherein they stated that they have received the said representation on 05.08.2024 and
the same was forwarded to the concerned authority after obtaining the signature of the detenu on
the same day.
It is, thus, factually evident that there is a delay of 1 (one) month in consideration of the said
representation by the Central Government. In the present case, there is absolutely no explanation
forthcoming, particularly from the State respondents for the axiomatic delay in forwarding the
representation dated 03.08.2024. There is a total unexplained delay of 1 (one) month i.e. from
09.08.2024 to 09.09.2024 by P a g e 11 | 18 the State respondents. The delay in transmitting the
representation affects adversely the further detention of the detenu. In this regard, the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court
rendered in Aslam Ahmed Zahiri Ahmed Shaid V. Union of India & Ors. [AIR 1989 SC 1403].
Wherein, it was held as follows:
"11. Reverting to the instant case, we hold that the above observation in Vijay
Kumar's case will squarely be applicable to the facts herein. Indisputedly the
Superintendent of Central Prison of Bombay to whom the representation was handed
over by the detenu on 16-6-88 for mere on-ward transmission to, the Central
Government has callously ignored and kept it in cold storage unattended form a
period of 7 days, as a result of that, the representation reached the Government 11
days after it was handed over to the Jail Superintendent. Why the representation was
retained by the jail Superintendent has not at all been explained in spite of the fact
that this Court has permitted the respondent to explain the delay in this appeal, if not
before the High Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56131610/ 7
Shri Thokchom Romeschandra Singh @ ... vs The District Magistrate on 25 October, 2024
12. In our view, the supine indifference, slackness and callous attitude on the part of
the Jail Superintendent who had unreasonably delayed in transmitting the
representation as an intermediary, had ultimately caused undue delay in the disposal
of the appellant's representation by the Government which received the
representation 11 days after it was handed over to the Jail Superintendent by the
detenu. This avoidable and unexplained delay has resulted in rendering the
continued detention of the appellant illegal and constitutionally impermissible."
The operative portion of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's order passed in Vijay Kumar's case (supra) is
extracted herein below; for the sake of completeness:-
10. A contention similar to one pressed before us was examined by this Court in Vijay Kumar's case
(AIR 1982 SC 1023) (supra) wherein the facts were that the representation of the detenu therein
dated 29-7-81 was forwarded to Government by 'the Superintendent of Jail on the same day by post
followed by a wireless message, but according, to the Government, the representation was not
received by them. Thereafter, a duplicate copy was sent by the Jail Superintendent on being
requested and P a g e 12 | 18 the same was, received by the Government on 12-8-81. Considering the
time lag of 14 days in the given circumstances of that case, this Court though over- looked the same
and allowed the Writ Petition on the subsequent time lag, made the following observation (at P.
1028 of AIR):
"The Jail authority is merely a communicating channel because the representation
has to reach the Government which enjoys the power of revoking the detention order.
The intermediary authorities who are communicating authorities have also to move
with an amount of promptitude so that the statutory guarantee of affording earlier
opportunity of making the representation and the same reaching the Government is
translated into action. The corresponding obligation of the State to consider the
representation cannot be whittled down by merely saying that much time was lost in
the transit. If the Government enacts a law like the present Act empowering certain
authorities to make the detention order and also simultaneously makes a statutory
provision of affording the earliest opportunity to the detenu to make his
representation against his detention to the. Government and not the detaining
authority, of necessity the State Government must gear up its own machinery to see
that in these cases the representation reaches the Government as quickly as possible
and it is considered by the authorities with equal promptitude. Any slackness in this
behalf not properly explained would be denial of the protection conferred by the
statute and would result in invalidation of the order."
[13] The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner also relied on the decision of the
Hon'ble Apex Court passed in Rajamal V. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors. [(1999) I SCC 417] (para No. 8
& 9) wherein, it was held that if delay was caused on account of indifference of lapses in considering
the representations, such delay will adversely effect further detention of detenu. In other words, it is
for the authority concerned to explain the delay in disposing of the representation. It is not enough
to say that the delay was very short. Even the longer day can well be explained, so P a g e 13 | 18 the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56131610/ 8
Shri Thokchom Romeschandra Singh @ ... vs The District Magistrate on 25 October, 2024
test is not duration or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned.
[14] Mr. Th. Vashum, learned GA appearing on behalf of the respondents No. 1, 2 & 3 submits that
affidavit-in-opposition in respect of the said respondents have been filed.
It has been stated that the petitioner is a member of banned unlawful organization namely,
Kangleipak Communist Party (Noyon) [KCP(N)] and carried out various prejudicial activities to the
security of the State and maintenance of public order and he was involved in many FIR cases i.e. (i)
FIR No. 146(9) 2008 MRG-PS U/S 18 UA(P) Act of Moirang Police Station, Bishnupur District, (ii)
FIR No. 28(6) 2020 BPR-PS U/S UA (P) Act of Bishnupur Police Station, Bishnupur District and
(iii) FIR No. 02(01)2024 HNG-PS U/S 17-20 UA(P) Act of Heingang Police Station, Imphal East
District.
In regard to the charge sheet, the learned GA submits that there no mandate as to charge sheet
should be submitted before issuance of the impugned detention order and the detention order was
purely on the basis of his past and present unlawful prejudicial activities. The detention order has
been issued after due investigation and fact findings that the petitioner has been a repeated offender
as per past police records and there is likelihood of his release on bail again, since he has applied for,
and in view of his prejudicial activities in the immediate past, there is likelihood of continuation of
such prejudicial acts in future. Therefore, it is evident from P a g e 14 | 18 the facts mentioned above
that normal criminal laws are not sufficient to prevent the petitioner from the commission of
prejudicial activities and have found to be a fit case for preventive detention under NSA, 1980;
accordingly the detention order is passed under the relevant provision of Section 3(2) of NSA, 1980.
[15] The learned GA submits that the petitioner himself admitted that he had already been released
on bail in two previous occasions i.e. in 2008 and 2020 and the same has been reflected in the
interrogation statement recorded in connection with FIR No. 02(1)2024 NHG-PS U/S 17/20 UA(P)
Act.
After passing the impugned detention order dated 30.01.2024, the same has been approved by the
State on 08.02.2024. On the same day, the petitioner submitted his representation and the same
has been considered and rejected on 13.02.2024 which has also been sent to the petitioner.
As regards the representation dated 03.08.2024, they have received the same on 05.08.2024 and
forwarded the same to the concerned authority after obtaining signature of the detenu on the same
day. [16] Mr. BR Sharma, learned CGSC appearing on behalf of the Union of India submits that
affidavit-in-opposition has been filed stating that the representation dated 08.02.2024 of the detenu
was duly considered and not acceded to by the Central Government. Accordingly, the detenu along
with P a g e 15 | 18 the authorities concerned were informed vide wireless message No.
II/15023/01/2024-NSA, dated 20.02.2024. The said representation of the detenu was dealt
promptly with utmost care and caution and there was no any willful or deliberate delay in disposal
of the same on the part of the Union of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56131610/ 9
Shri Thokchom Romeschandra Singh @ ... vs The District Magistrate on 25 October, 2024
It has been further submitted that the report as envisaged under Section 3(5) of the NSA, 1980, was
forwarded by the State Government vide letter dated 08.02.2024. A copy of the same was received
in the Ministry vide e-mail dated 09.02.2024. Thereafter, the Central Government considered the
report as envisaged under Section 3(5) of the NSA, 1980 on 13.02.2024. After due consideration, it
was felt that there was no reason to interfere with the aforesaid detention order. Further, there is no
provision in the act which provides that the Central Government has to inform the detenu about the
consideration of the report as envisaged under Section 3(5) of the NSA, 1980.
[17] Furthermore, the learned CGSC submits that after filing the affidavit-in-opposition on behalf of
the respondent No. 4, a copy of the representation dated 03.08.2024 was forwarded to the
Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India only on 09.09.2024, vide its letter dated
09.09.2024 through e-mail.
Subsequently, the representation dated 03.08.2024 of the detenu was duly considered and not
acceded to by the Central Government.
P a g e 16 | 18 Accordingly, the detenu along with authorities concerned were informed vide wireless
message dated 12.09.2024.
[18] After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, it is unequivocally emerges that there is a
delay of 1 (one) month in considering the representation of the petitioner by the Central
Government. The fact of lapses in disposing the representation of the petitioner by more than 1
(one) month is factually correct and the same is admitted by the learned counsels for the
respondents. The only recourse adopted by the learned counsel for the official respondents is
blaming each other in regard to the admitted delay in disposing of the representation.
[19] At this stage, we are not concerned as to whose fault it is for delaying and taking more than 1
(one) month in disposing of the representation. We are concerned with the admitted delay in
disposing of the representation. In this regard, reference may be made to the observations of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court order as narrated hereinabove and the relevant paragraphs of the reports
reproduced herein above. Accordingly, the facts and circumstances of the present case are squarely
covered by the ratio of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's report above extracted decisions.
[20] As per the Hon'ble Supreme Court's decision in Aslam Ahmed Zahiri Ahmed Shaid (supra) and
the observations made in Vijay Kumar's case (supra); it is well settled that a representation should
be considered with reasonable expedition and any delay, supine indifference, slackness and P a g e
17 | 18 callous attitude on the part of the authority shall effect the further detention of the detenu.
[21] In our view, the supine indifference, slackness and callous attitude on the part of the authority
which caused unreasonably delay in transmitting the representation, which was more than 1 (one)
month, and in disposing of the representation, was avoidable and unexplained and has resulted in
rendering the continued detention of the appellant illegal and constitutionally impermissible. We,
accordingly, allow the writ petition (cril) and quash the impugned detention order dated 30.01.2024
and direct the detenu to be set at liberty forthwith, if not wanted in any other case. [22] The present
