Subhash vs Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nd 2 Others on 2 January, 2025
"To grant, allow and pay the assured career pay scale/pay band and other benefit
including salary arrears in the pay scale of Rs.5200-20,200/-GP-2400/- as per the
calculation in the noting/sanction order dated 09.08.2010/10.08.2010 made and
approved by the respondent authorities as contained in Annexure No. 4 to the writ
petition, w.e.f. 06.08.1996 till the date of his retirement along with 18% interest on
the arrears."
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that grievance of petitioner would sufficiently be met in case
representation of petitioner for the said purposes is considered and decided in a time bound
manner.
Shri Shashi Prakash Rai, learned counsel for the respondents has no objection to the same.
In view thereof, petitioner is permitted to make a fresh detailed representation to respondent
no.2-Registrar/Deputy Registrar, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Gorakhpur University Gorakhpur, raising
all his grievance, annexing therewith a copy of this writ petition along with annexures and all the
documents in support of his claim within a period of two weeks from today along with a certified
copy of this order.
In case such a representation is moved by petitioner, respondent no.2 shall consider and decide the
same in accordance with law by a reasoned and speaking order within a period of two months from
the date a certified copy of this order along with representation is placed before him.
It is made clear that this court has not applied itself on the merits of the case and all questions are
left open to be considered and decided by the competent authority in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid directions, the writ petition is disposed of.?
3. In compliance of above order, District Inspector of Schools, Gorakhpur has passed an order and
granted amount of about Rs. 1.98 lacs on basis of a calculation.
4. Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner is still aggrieved since entire payment in
accordance with law is not provided and, therefore, present writ petition is filed. An amendment
application is also filed for enlarging the scope of prayer, i.e., to grant, allow and pay all assured
arrears of pay scale/ pay band and other benefits including salary arrears and consequential
pensionary benefits from 22.05.1978 to 06.08.1996 which was not considered and paid by order
dated 01.04.2024.
5. Learned counsel for Respondent-University has raised a preliminary objection that prayer, as
made in writ petition as well as in amendment application, is barred by principle of constructive res
judicata as petitioner has full opportunity to raise all his grievance when he has filed first writ
petition.

6. Learned counsel for petitioner submits that prayer is based on subsequent events since on basis of
calculation made in pursuance of earlier order passed by this Court, petitioner is entitled for other
relief also. Learned counsel refers para 15 of writ petition that it was a bona fide mistake since some
facts were not mentioned in first writ petition. For reference para 15 of writ petition is reproduced
hereinafter:
?15. That the Finance Officer calculated the arrear of the petitioner from the dated
07.08.1996 to 24.07.2013 (the date of retirement) amounting Rs. 1,98,004/-. It is
important to mention here that the respondent authorities has calculated the arrears
of petitioner w.e.f. 06.08.1996 though he became permanent on 22.05.1978. In the
earlier writ petition, unfortunately the date was written as 06.08.1996. It is
important to mention here that the respondent authorities have not given interest on
the belated amount of arrear. A photocopy of calculation dated 12.06.2024 is being
filed herewith and marked as Annexure No. 9 to this writ petition.?
7. I have considered above submissions and since it is a matter of pension, therefore, an opportunity
is granted to petitioner to make a fresh representation alongwith all necessary documents and if
such a representation is filed within four weeks from today, concerned respondent will consider the
same in accordance with law and take appropriate reasoned decision, as earlier as possible. It is
made clear that this Court has not entered into merit of case, i.e., whether claim of petitioner is
legally admissible or not.
8. With aforesaid observations/ directions, this writ petition is disposed of.
