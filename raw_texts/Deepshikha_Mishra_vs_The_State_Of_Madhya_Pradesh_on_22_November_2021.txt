It is pointed out that in pursuance to the earlier transfer order dated 31.12.2020, a writ petition was
preferred by the petitioner challenging transfer order from District Satna to District Bhind which
was stayed by this court vide order dated 03.02.2021 in W.P.No.1876/2021. Now, the impugned
order of attachment of the petitioner by Vikas Khand, Ramnagar has been passed on the ground that
certain complaints have been made against the petitioner for which inquiry is required to be made.

illegality committed by the petitioner and the guilt has been proved till date. There are no
allegations against the petitioner that she is interfering with the committee who is inquiring into the
matter.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and also considering the fact that the earlier
writ petition is still pending. The effect and operation of the order impugned is stayed till the next
date of hearing.
