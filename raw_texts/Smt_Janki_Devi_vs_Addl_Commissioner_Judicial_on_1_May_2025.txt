passed by the opposite party No. 1 and judgment and order dated 17.11.2023 passed
by the opposite party No. 2."
At the very outset, learned counsel for the side opposite raised a preliminary objection regarding
maintainability of this petition. The preliminary objection has been raised on the ground of having a
statutory remedy of filing a revision against the impugned order dated 07.04.2025. He stated that in
view of Section 210 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the "Code of 2006")
as amended in the year 2019, the petitioner is having a remedy of filing a revision before the
Authority concerned against the impugned order dated 07.04.2025.
Considering the aforesaid, this Court is of the view that in the statute itself a mechanism for
redressal of the grievance is provided, as such, this Court is not inclined to entertain the present
petition. It is accordingly disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to approach the Authority
concerned under Section 210 of the Code of 2006.
In the facts and circumstances of the case, it is also provided that if the remedy aforesaid is availed
by the petitioner, then the Authority concerned shall consider and decide the same expeditiously say
within a period of six months from the date of approaching the said Authority. It is in view of Rule
183(4) of the U.P. Revenue Code Rules, 2016 made under U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 and para 458(2)
of U.P. Revenue Court Manual, as per which, a revision or appeal should preferably be decided
preferably within six months.
