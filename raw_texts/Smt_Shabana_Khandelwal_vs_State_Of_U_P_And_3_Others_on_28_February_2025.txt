Smt. Shabana Khandelwal vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025
of N.I. Act, Police Station Lohamandi, District Agra, and impugned order dated
16.7.2024 (Annexure no. 2 to the instant petition) passed by Presiding Officer,
Special Court, N.I. Act, Agra in Complaint Case no. 5110 of 2017 (Smt. Shabana
Khandelwal vs. Anupam Omarion Infra Pvt. Ltd. & others) under Section 138 N.I.
Act, Police Station Lohamandi, District Agra.
2. Issue a direction directing the court below to summon the respondent no. 2 i.e.
Company namely Anupam Omarion Infrastructure Private Limited in the complaint
case no. 5110 of 2017 (Smt. Shabana Khandelwal vs. Anupam Omarion Infra Private
Limited & others) under section 138 N.I. Act, in accordance with the provision of
Section 319 Cr.P.C."
3. The legal arguments has been raised for challenging the order dated 02.05.2017 and 16.07.2024
passed by learned court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court no. 11, Agra and Special
Court, 138 N.I. Act, Agra, through which only the respondent nos. 3 and 4 have been summoned and
application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. has been rejected by learned concerned court respectively.
4. Being aggrieved with the order dated 16.07.2024, petitioner preferred Criminal Revision no. 598
of 2024 (Smt. Shaban Khandelwal vs. State of U.P. and others) but the same was also dismissed vide
order dated 16.10.2024.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the instrument executed in favour of the
petitioner was on behalf of respondent no. 2 by the authorised signatory, although after preferring
Complaint Case no. 5110 of 2017, respondent nos. 3 and 4 have been summoned but at the same
time, respondent no. 2 was left to be summoned without any plausible and cogent reasons, whereas
the law held by Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Aneeta Hada vs M/S Godfather Travels & Tours
Pvt.Ltd decided, AIR 2012 SC(Criminal) 892 and Sukhpal Singh Khaira vs The State Of Punjab,
2022 SCC OnLine SC 1679 wherein it is crystal clearly mentioned that in case the instrument put for
honor is executed in favour of drawee, in case of failure of payment the company/firm will be the
mandatory party and as such learned court concerned was mandated under the law to issue
summoning orders against respondent no. 2 also.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that regarding the discrepancy arising while
passing the order dated 02.05.2017, the same has been brought to the notice before learned
concerned court by way of filing a specific application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. but the same was
rejected in gross violation of the settled principles of law as enunciated by Hon'ble Apex Court.
7. While challenging the dismissal order passed over application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. dated
17.05.2024, before learned revisional court the same grounds were raised but no credence has been
given by the revisional court which impugned the present petition.
8. Learned AGA vehemently opposed the prayer as made in the petition and submitted that on the
basis of the proceedings which has been culminated into recording statement under Section 251 and
313 Cr.P.C. and as such the application preferred at the behest of petitioner at highly belated stage

Smt. Shabana Khandelwal vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025
has been rightly rejected by learned concerned court.
9. Since, learned counsel for petitioner argued the matter only on the legal issues and as such
process of issuing notice to respondent nos. 2 to 4 is hereby dispensed with.
10. After hearing the rival submissions extended by learned counsel for the parties and while
examining the findings returned with learned revisional court it transpires that learned revisional
court admitted the arguments raised by learned counsel for the petitioner and showed his
agreement over the same that the company is the mandatory party who has to be summoned, if the
instrument has to be executed on behalf of the company/firm but the same fact has been brought at
highly belated stage into the notice of the learned concerned court and as such the denial of the
same is having no infirmity which culminated into order dated 16.10.2024.
11. The role of the complainant is to seeking prayer for ensuring payment in respect of the
instrument executed by respondents by way of filing specific application under Section 138 N.I. Act,
so far as procedural part is concerned, the same has to be ensured by learned concerned court
specifically in shape of at the stage of summoning and under which circumstances, the company was
left to summon that has to be carefully considered by learned concerned court, if the same has left at
the time of issuing summoning orders against respondent nos. 3 and 4 and the same has been
brought to the notice of learned concerned court by the complainant there was no reasons to not
rectify the legal error which is apparent from the face of record but the rejection of the application
only on the ground that the matter has already been proceeded up to the stage of recording
statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C, the same cannot be given any excuse for mistake available at
law and once the Hon'ble Apex Court has held in several judgments which has been considered by
learned revisional court at the time of preferring revision at the behest of petitioner and admitted
the law along with the arguments raised by learned counsel appearing for petitioner, denial of the
same amounts to perpetuation of the illegality which has been made by learned concerned court.
12. The scope of revisional court although very limited but at the same time, the revisional court
must record proper reasoning if the order is having perversity and illegality if involved which is put
for revision before learned revisional court, once it has been mentioned in the order itself that there
is an illegality involved while passing the order by learned concerned court, it is highly surprising
that under which circumstances the same has not been indicated by learned revisional court in
shape of direction by way of only reconsidering the summoning orders which was left to be issued
against the respondent no. 2. There was also no occasion to set aside the summoning order already
issued against respondent nos. 3 and 4 and as such the finding returned by learned revisional court
is highly illegal and the same is not sustainable in the eye of law.
13. In view of the aforementioned discussions and in the light of the judgment of Aneeta Hada and
Sukhpal Singh Khaira (supra) rendered by Hon'ble Apex Court, order dated 16.07.2024 passed by
learned Presiding Officer, Special Court, N.I. Act, Agra in Complaint Case no. 5110 of 2017 and order
dated 16.10.2024 passed by learned Additional District & Special Judge/Special Judge (POCSO Act),
Court no. 30, Agra in Criminal Revision no. 598 of 2024 are hereby set aside. Matter is remitted
back to learned Presiding Officer, Special Court, N.I. Act, Agra/concerned court for issuing fresh

Hada and Sukhpal Singh Khaira (supra).
14. The instant petition stands allowed accordingly.
