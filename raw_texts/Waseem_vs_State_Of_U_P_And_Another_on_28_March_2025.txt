Waseem vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 March, 2025
03.04.2024 passed by learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bulandshahar in Misc. Case No.13813 of
2022, arising out of Case Crime No.293 of 2021, under Section 147, 148, 149, 307, 352, 452, 324,
504, 506, 325 IPC, Police Station Gulawati, District Bulandshahar.
3. Brief facts of the present case are that respondent no.2 lodged an FIR bearing Case Crime No.293
of 2021 against six persons including petitioner in pursuance of alleged incident dated 23.04.2021,
whereupon inquiry was conducted and after culmination of the same, the concerned Investigating
Officer preferred police report on dated 07.03.2022 whereupon cognizance was taken by learned
court concerned on dated 11.03.2022. Thereafter petitioner preferred an application under Section
173(8) Cr.P.C. before concerned Senior Superintendent of Police seeking further investigation
whereupon, the matter was transferred to Crime Branch for further investigation vide order dated
05.10.2023. Thereafter, the Investigating Officer of Crime Branch further investigated the matter
and on the basis of CDR as well as receipt of toll plaza, found that petitioner was not present at the
spot on the date and time of the alleged incident and he preferred police report on dated 21.01.2024
to the fact that petitioner was wrongly implicated in the present case.
4. Being aggrieved with police report dated 21.01.2024, respondent no.2 preferred protest petition
on dated 29.02.2024 which was disposed of vide impugned order dated 06.03.2024 by learned
court concerned without accepting or rejecting the police report. Thereafter petitioner preferred an
application dated 20.03.2024 before the court concerned with a prayer to quash the said criminal
proceedings qua to him on the ground that as per the police report dated 21.01.2024, he was not
involved in commission of alleged crime. The said application was rejected by learned court
concerned vide impugned order dated 03.04.2024. Being aggrieved with orders dated 06.03.2024
and 03.04.2024, petitioner preferred criminal revision which was also dismissed by learned
revisional court vide order dated 06.05.2024 which impugned the present petition.
5. While challenging order dated 06.03.2024, learned counsel for petitioner submitted that the trial
court has limited scope under the provision of Code of Criminal Procedure either to accept the police
report or reject the same with reasons and apart from these two provisions, the trial court has power
to direct for further investigation or to treat the same as a complaint case but learned court
concerned without adopting the said procedure, vide impugned order dated 06.03.2024, exceeding
its jurisdiction, disposed of the protest petition preferred at the behest of respondent no.2 against
police report dated 21.01.2024 and as such, order dated 06.03.2024 is bad in the eye of law. In sofar
as impugned order dated 03.04.2024 is concerned, learned counsel for petitioner submitted that
once the concerned Investigating Officer of Crime Branch found in the further investigation that
petitioner was not involved in the commission of alleged incident, there was no occasion before
learned court concerned to reject the application preferred at the behest of petitioner seeking
quashing of the criminal proceedings initiated against him in pursuance of the first police report and
as such, the said order is also liable to be quashed. Learned counsel for petitioner further submitted
that learned revisional court has also committed gross illegality while rejecting the criminal revision
preferred at the behest of petitioner vide order dated 23.01.2025 since the same has been passed
without considering the grounds mentioned in the criminal revision and as such, the same may be
set aside.

6. Per contra, Sri Sushil Dubey, learned counsel for respondent no.2 as well as learned AGA for the
State-respondent vehemently opposed the prayer as sought through the instant petition and
rebutted the stands taken up by learned counsel for petitioner by way of submitting that after
conclusion of inquiry, chargesheet was submitted on dated 11.03.2022 whereupon cognizance has
also been taken on the same day whereas petitioner was absconding due to which NBW and
proceedings under Section 82 have already been initiated against him on dated 08.07.2022 and
after lapse of two years, petitioner preferred an application before the concerned police authority for
further investigation and as such, no relief may be extended to him.
7. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 submitted that learned court concerned rightly rejected the
application for quashing the case because he has no power to discharge an accused under Section
307 IPC and the said power is vested with learned Sessions Judge to discharge an accused under
Section 227 Cr.P.C. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 further submitted that the Magistrate has
also no power to review its own order once he has already taken cognizance for offence whatsoever
and as such, he has not committed any error in passing the orders impugned. It has also been
submitted by learned counsel for respondent no.2 that legal value of police report under Section
173(8) Cr.P.C. is treated as same police report filed under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. whereupon learned
court concerned has already taken cognizance and as such, there was no occasion to pass fresh
cognizance order over police report under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. therefore, the present petition
lacks merit and the same may be dismissed as such.
8. After having the rival contentions raised by learned counsel for parties as well as written
arguments submitted on their behalf, it is crystal clear that initiation of prejudice caused to
petitioner, is arising out of order dated 06.03.2024 through which protest petition preferred at the
behest of respondent no.2, has been disposed of by learned court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Bulandshahar. By bare perusal of order dated 06.03.2024, it is apparent that although learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Bulandshahar returned with the finding having disagreement with the final
report submitted by the concerned Investigating Officer, Crime Branch and the same has been
declared as illegal since order of further investigation passed by concerned police authority under
Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., was mentioned as illegal since chargesheet has already been submitted
before learned court concerned, whereupon cognizance has already been taken up in pursuance to
Section 190 Cr.P.C.
9. Although learned court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bulandshahar discussed all the
abovementioned legal aspects involved in the matter and justified his action in pursuance to Section
190(1)(b) Cr.P.C. over final report preferred by concerned Investigating Officer, Crime Branch under
Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. but at the same time, no specific orders available in the order impugned dated
06.03.2024 in shape of rejecting the subsequent final report under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. while
adjudicating the protest petition preferred by respondent no.2. Specific absence of rejecting the final
report submitted by the concerned Investigating Officer of Crime Branch, has also not been dealt
with by learned revisional court which is apparent from the order dated 23.01.2025.
10. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, order dated 23.01.2025 passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.8, Bulandshahar in Criminal Revision No.168 of 2024 as well

as orders dated 06.03.2024 and 03.04.2024 passed by learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Bulandshahar in Misc. Case No.13813 of 2022, arising out of Case Crime No.293 of 2021, under
Section 147, 148, 149, 307, 352, 452, 324, 504, 506, 325 IPC, are hereby set aside. Matter is hereby
remitted back to the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bulandshahar for passing fresh orders over
the protest petition preferred by respondent no.2 by way of specific orders necessary to be passed in
light of the discussions made herein above.
11. However, it is made clear that the abovementioned exercise shall be finalized within a period of
four months from the date of presentation of a certified copy of this order before learned court
concerned and till disposal of the protest petition preferred at the behest of respondent no.2, no
coercive action shall be initiated against petitioner herein in pursuance of the present case.
12. Accordingly, the present petition stands allowed.
