the observations made by Apex Court in the case of State of Karnataka Vs. L. Muniswamy and
Others, 1977 (2) SCC 699; State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal and Others, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335;

Principal Secretary and others (2014) 2 SCC 532 and Supreme Court Bar Association Vs. Union of
India (1998) 4 SCC 409, according to which, in given facts, based upon the settlements between the
parties the criminal proceedings can be quashed,as also the nature of dispute/crime, this Court is of
the view that the present application is liable to be allowed as chances of ultimate conviction are
extremely bleak and hence no useful purpose would be served by allowing the criminal proceedings
to continue.
Accordingly, present application is allowed. Consequently, the entire proceedings arising out of
Chargesheet dated 09.04.2021, relating to Case Crime No.0582/2020, under Sections 498A, 323,
506 IPC and Section 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act (State Vs Shubham Verma and others), pending in

2 to this Petition), as quoted above, are hereby quashed qua the applicants.
Office/Registry is directed to send the copy of this order to the court concerned through email/fax
for necessary compliance.
