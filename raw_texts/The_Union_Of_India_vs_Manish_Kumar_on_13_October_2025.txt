. Resultantly, second wife submitted application for compassionate appointment to his younger
son-Manish Kumar on 10.07.2012. The same was rejected on 14.08.2012 on the ground that the said
Manish Kumar was not eligible to be appointed with reference to the fact that he was a minor at the
relevant time. Subsequently, second wife once again submitted application for appointment on
behalf of Manish Kumar on 16.05.2014. Simultaneously, she had submitted another application to
her elder son on 18.07.2014 Mukund Kumar on 18.07.2014. Manish Kumar application was rejected

employee got re-married with on Ranju Devi without taking permission from the Railway
Administration. The deceased Patna High Court CWJC No.18338 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 employee

5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the Railway Board vide letter
no.E(NG)II/91/RC-1/136 dated 24.01.1992 had issued instruction as under:-
"It is clarified that in case of Railway employees dying in harness etc. leaving more
than one widow along with children born to 2nd wife, while settlement of dues may
be shared due to Court orders or otherwise on the merits of each case, so far as the
appointment on compassionate grounds to the 2nd wife and her children are not to
be considered, unless the administration has permitted the second marriage in
special circumstances, taking into account the personal Law etc. The fact that the
second marriage is not permissible is invariably clarified in the terms and conditions
advised in the offer of initial appointment."
6. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in view of the aforesaid instructions the cases for
compassionate appointment to the second widow or her wards need not be forwarded to the Railway
Board.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the Railway board vide letter dated 24.01.1992

period of four months from production/receipt of certified copy of the order. It was further held that
the respondent was entitled for consideration for appointment on compassionate grounds.
9. In fact the learned Central Administrative Tribunal did not consider the matter it is true
perspective and allowed the O.A. application on basis of conjectures and surmises. Patna High Court
CWJC No.18338 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025
10. In fact the O.A. Application filed by the respondent barred by the law of limitation as the father
of the Respondent died on 11.08.2009 and thereafter the claim of compassionate appointment of the
son of the deceased namely Mukund Kumar, was rejected on 02.03.2015 and the O.A. Application
was filed by one Manish Kumar before the learned Tribunal in the year 2019.
11. We have perused the material available on record and the order dated 28.05.2024 passed by the
learned Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna Bench, Patna in O.A. No. 050/00676/2019. It
transpires that the learned Court has been pleased to set aside the order on the basis of judgment of
full Bench of this Court reported in 2019(2) PLJR 500 in the case of Bihar State Electricity Board &
Anr. vs Chandra Shekhar Paswan and apart from that learned Court has come to the conclusion that
the Railway Board Circular dated 02.01.1992 as mentioned aforesaid, the same was set aside in the
case of Smt. Namita Goldar vs Union of India & Ors reported in 2010(1) Cal.L.J.464 and apart from
that the order of full Bench of Patna High Court in case of Bihar State Electricity Board & Anr. vs
Chandra Shekhar Paswan (supra) which is produced herein after:-
"53. The Supreme Court also noticed the Division Bench judgment of Calcutta High
Patna High Court CWJC No.18338 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 Court in Namita Goldar
(supra) whereby circular of the Railway Board dated 2.1.1992 to the extent that it
prevented the children of second wife from being considered for appointment on
compassionate ground was quashed. Its attention was also drawn to the judgment of
the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in Union of India vs. M. Karumbayee
(supra), which had followed Namita Goldar (supra) The Supreme Court noticed that
Special Leave Petition filed against the judgment of the Division Bench was dismissed
by the Supreme Court on 18.9.2017.
54. Having noticed the aforesaid judgments, the Supreme Court observed:-
"Finally, it would be necessary to dwell on the submission which was urged on behalf
of the respondent that once the circular dated 2 January, 1992 was struck down by
the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Namita Goldar (supra) and which
was accepted and has been implemented, it was not thereafter open to the railway
authorities to rely upon the same circular which has all India force and effect There is
merit in the submission. Hence, we find it improper on the part of the Railway Board
to issue a fresh circular on 3 April, 2013. reiterating the terms of the earlier circular
dated 2 January, 1992 even after the Patna High Court CWJC No.18338 of 2024
dt.13-10-2025 decision in Namita Goldar (supra), which attained finality.

55. Apparently, the judgment passed in Union of India vs. V.R. Tripathi (supra) by
the Supreme Court is contrary to the Full Bench of this Court in Union of India vs.
Sanjay Kumar (supra) as it has acknowledged the right to the child of the second
marriage and has also held that while designing a policy of compassionate
appointment, the State can prescribe the terms on which it can be granted. However,
it is not open to the State while making the scheme or rules to lay down a condition,
which is inconsistent with Article 14 of the Constitution.
It has acknowledged the right to compassionate appointment to the child of second
marriage under Section 16(1) and 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The principle laid
down by the Supreme Court supersedes those taken by the Full Bench of this Court in
Union of India vs Sanjay Kumar (supra). The said principle having enunciated by the
highest Court of the land has a binding force. The authoritative pronouncement of
Apex Court on the point of compassionate appointment in V.R. Tripathi (supra)
eclipses the decision of the Full Bench of this Court in Union of India vs Sanjay
Kumar (supra), which was even based on misconstruction of Railway Board's circular
Patna High Court CWJC No.18338 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 dated 2.1. 1992 as the said
circular was not in existence after Namita Goldar's case
56. In the light of the authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Union of
India vs. V.R. Tripathi (supra), we find that the condition imposed by the circular no.
937 dated 23.6.2003 issued under the signature of Joint Secretary, Personnel and
Administrative Reforms Department, Government of Bihar Patna which inter alia
bars compassionate appointment to the children born from second marriage of the
deceased employee cannot be held to be legal and justified. Once Section 16 of the
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 regards a child born from a marriage entered into while
the earlier marriage is subsisting to be legitimate, the State cannot exclude such a
child by issuing circular or letter from seeking the benefit of compassionate
appointment Such a condition of exclusion is arbitrary and ultra vires.
57. We are also of the opinion that in view of the ratio laid down by the Supreme
Court in Union of India vs. V.R. Tripathi (supra), an employer, who is amenable to
Part III of the Constitution cannot deny the benefit of compassionate appointment,
which is available to the other legitimate children. The State cannot lay down a
condition while making the scheme or rules inconsistent with Article 14 of Patna
High Court CWJC No.18338 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 the Constitution. In view of
Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which regards a child born from a
marriage entered into while the earlier marriage is subsisting to be legitimate, the
condition of prior approval of the employer before the second marriage of the
deceased employee cannot be sine qua non to the children born out of second
marriage. Such a condition of exclusion would be arbitrary and ultra vires as it would
bring out unconstitutional discrimination between legitimate children, who form one
class."

12. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, perused the materials available on the record
and in view of the decision above, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the CAT has rightly
passed the order in accordance with law, and the matter is remitted back to the petitioners to
consider the case of the respondent for appointment on compassionate ground on merits within a
period of four months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order.
13. While considering the case of the respondent for appointment on compassionate ground, the
petitioners are directed to consider the aforesaid judgment as mentioned in CAT order dated
28.05.2024, and take a decision within a period of three months.
