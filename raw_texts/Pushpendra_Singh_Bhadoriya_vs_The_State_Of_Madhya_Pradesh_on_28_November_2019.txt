THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
MCRC-30460-2019 1
(PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHADORIYA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)
Gwalior, Dated : 28/11/2019
Shri Dharmendra Rishiswar, learned counsel for petitioner.
Shri S.S . Rajput, learned Public Prosecutor for
respondent/State.
With consent, heard finally.
The present petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashment of
FIR vide Crime No.219/2018 registered at Police Station Umri, District Bhind for alleged offences
punishable under Sections 498-A of IPC and Sec. 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act as well as
consequential proceedings in R.C.T. No. 278/2019 pending before J.M.F.C, Bhind registered against
the petitioner on the compliant being made by respondent No.2.
2. It is alleged by learned counsel for the petitioner that a false case has been filed by the respondent
No. 2 against the present petitioner. He has drawn attention of this Court to Annexure P/2 which is
an application under Section 13(1) and 13(1-A) of Hindu Marriage Act which was filed on 03.11.2017.
Notices were issued on the aforesaid application vide order dated 18.05.2018, the respondent No. 2
has given her appearance before the trial Court. Thereafter, on 18.07.2018, an FIR has been
registered against the present applicant.
It is alleged that the FIR has been registered after thought which is total abuse of process of law. The
respondent No. 2 was well aware of THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (PUSHPENDRA
SINGH BHADORIYA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) proceeding under Section 13(1),
13(1-A) of HMA and just to counter blast of the aforesaid, an FIR has been registered against the
present applicant. He has relied upon the judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases
of Varala Bharath Kumar vs The State Of Telangana reported in (2017) 9 SCC 413, Sundar Babu &
Ors vs State Of Tamil Nadu reported in (2009) 14 SCC 244 and State Of Haryana And Ors vs Ch.
Bhajan Lal And Ors reported in 1992 AIR
604. Therefore, he prays for quashment of the FIR as well as consequential proceedings.

3. Per contra, learned counsel for respondent/State has opposed the prayer and has submitted that
initial complaint was made by the respondent No. 2/wife on 27.04.2018 at Mahila Police Station, i.e.
the complaint was made in the month of April, 2018 itself, thereafter, the proceedings under Section
13(1) & 13(1-A) of HMA has been filed by the husband, therefore, it cannot be said that registration
of FIR is after thought and wife has already initiated the proceedings in the month of April 2018
regarding cruelty and demand of dowry against the present petitioner. He has argued that the
proceedings initiated by the husband under Section 13(1) and 13(1-A) of HMA after thought. It is
further argued that he has relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Arnesh Kumar Ve. State of Bihar, reported in AIR 2014 SC 2756, wherein the Hon'ble
Supreme THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHADORIYA Vs
THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) Court has given a liberty in such matters which is available to
the petitioner, therefore, there is no reasons for quashing the impugned order. He has relied upon
the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Amit Kapoor vs Ramesh Chander
& Anr. reported in (2012) 9 SCC 460, wherein it is held that power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C for
quashment of FIR, should be used sparingly and with utmost care and caution.
4. Heard learned counsel for parties and perused the documents.
5. From perusal of the record, it is seen that initial complaint was made on 27.04.2018 i.e. much
prior to the registration of the case under Section 13(1) & 13(1-A) of H.M.A. Admittedly, proceedings
of Hindu Marriage Act was registered on 03.11.2017 and notices were served upon to give her
appearance before the Court on 08.05.2018 and compliant was made with respect to harassment in
April, 2018.
Thus, it is clear the case to show that the respondent No. 2/wife is not aware the proceedings of
HMA, thus it cannot be said that complaint made by the wife is an after thought.
6. Even otherwise, protection is granted to the petitioner by the Supreme Court in the case of Arnesh
Kumar (Supra) which reads as under:-
"7.1. From a plain reading of the provision u/S.41 Cr.P.C., it is evident that a person accused of an
offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years or which may
extend to seven years with or without fine, cannot be THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
(PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHADORIYA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) arrested by the
police officer only on his satisfaction that such person had committed the offence punishable as
aforesaid. A police officer before arrest, in such cases has to be further satisfied that such arrest is
necessary to prevent such person from committing any further offence; or for proper investigation
of the case; or to prevent the accused from causing the evidence of the offence to disappear; or
tampering with such evidence in any manner; or to prevent such person from making any
inducement, threat or promise to a witness so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the
court or the police officer; or unless such accused person is arrested, his presence in the court
whenever required cannot be ensured. These are the conclusions, which one may reach based on
facts. 7.2. The law mandates the police officer to state the facts and record the reasons in writing
which led him to come to a conclusion covered by any of the provisions aforesaid, while making such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95117852/ 2
Pushpendra Singh Bhadoriya vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 November, 2019
arrest. The law further requires the police officers to record the reasons in writing for not making
the arrest.
7.3. In pith and core, the police officer before arrest must put a question to himself, why arrest? Is it
really required ? What purpose it will serve ? What object it will achieve ? It is only after these
questions are addressed and one or the other conditions as enumerated above is satisfied, the power
of arrest needs to be exercised. Before arrest first the police officers should have reason to believe on
the basis of information and material that the accused has committed the offence. Apart from this,
the police officer has to be satisfied further that the arrest is necessary for one or the more purposes
envisaged by sub-clauses (a) to (e) of clause (1) of Section 41 Cr.P.C.
9. Another provision i.e. Section 41-A Cr.P.C. aimed to avoid unnecessary arrest or threat of arrest
looming large on the accused requires to be vitalised. This provision makes it clear that in all cases
where the arrest of a person is not required under Section 41(1) Cr.P.C., the police officer is required
to issue notice directing the accused to appear before him at a specified place and time. Law obliges
such an accused to appear before the police officer and it further mandates that if such an accused
complies with the terms of notice he shall not be arrested, unless for reasons to be recorded, the
police officer is of the opinion that the arrest is necessary. At this stage also, the condition precedent
for arrest as envisaged under Section 41 Cr.P.C. has to be complied and shall be subject to the same
scrutiny by the Magistrate as aforesaid."
7. The Supreme Court in the case of Taramani Parakh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in
(2015) 11 SCC 260, has held as under :-
"10. The law relating to quashing is well settled. If the allegations are absurd or do
not make out any case or if it can be held that there is abuse of process of law, the
proceedings can be quashed but if there is a triable case THE HIGH COURT OF
MADHYA PRADESH (PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHADORIYA Vs THE STATE OF
MADHYA PRADESH) the Court does not go into reliability or otherwise of the
version or the counter-version. In matrimonial cases, the Courts have to be cautious
when omnibus allegations are made particularly against relatives who are not
generally concerned with the affairs of the couple. We may refer to the decisions of
this Court dealing with the issue.
11. Referring to earlier decisions, in Amit Kapoor vs. Ramesh Chander (2012) 9 SCC
460, it was observed (SCC pp. 482- 84, para 27):
"27.1. Though there are no limits of the powers of the Court under Section 482 of the
Code but the more the power, he more due care and caution is to be exercised in
invoking these powers. The power of quashing criminal proceedings, particularly, the
charge framed in terms of Section 228 of the Code should be exercised very sparingly
and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95117852/ 3
Pushpendra Singh Bhadoriya vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 November, 2019
27.2. The Court should apply the test as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as
made from the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith prima facie
establish the offence or not. If the allegations are so patently absurd and inherently
improbable that no prudent person can ever reach such a conclusion and where the
basic ingredients of a criminal offence are not satisfied then the Court may interfere.
27.3. The High Court should not unduly interfere. No meticulous examination of the
evidence is needed for considering whether the case would end in conviction or not at
the stage of framing of charge or quashing of charge. 27.4. Where the exercise of such
power is absolutely essential to prevent patent miscarriage of justice and for
correcting some grave error that might be committed by the subordinate courts even
in such cases, the High Court should be loath to interfere, at the threshold, to throttle
the prosecution in exercise of its inherent powers. 27.5. Where there is an express
legal bar enacted in any of the provisions of the Code or any specific law in force to
the very initiation or institution and continuance of such criminal proceedings, such a
bar is intended to provide specific protection to an accused. 27.6. The Court has a
duty to balance the freedom of a person and the right of the complainant or
prosecution to investigate and prosecute the offender. 27.7. The process of the court
cannot be permitted to be used for an oblique or ultimate/ulterior purpose. 27.8.
Where the allegations made and as they appeared from the record and documents
annexed therewith to predominantly give rise and constitute a "civil wrong"
with no "element of criminality" and does not satisfy the basic ingredients of a criminal offence, the
court may be justified in quashing the charge. Even in such cases, the THE HIGH COURT OF
MADHYA PRADESH (PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHADORIYA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA
PRADESH) court would not embark upon the critical analysis of the evidence.
27.9. Another very significant caution that the courts have to observe is that it cannot examine the
facts, evidence and materials on record to determine whether there is sufficient material on the basis
of which the case would end in a conviction; the court is concerned primarily with the allegations
taken as a whole whether they will constitute an offence and, if so, is it an abuse of the process of
court leading to injustice.
27.10. It is neither necessary nor is the court called upon to hold a full-fledged enquiry or to
appreciate evidence collected by the investigating agencies to find out whether it is a case of
acquittal or conviction. 27.11. Where allegations give rise to a civil claim and also amount to an
offence, merely because a civil claim is maintainable, does not mean that a criminal complaint
cannot be maintained.
27.12. In exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 228 and/or under Section 482, the Court cannot
take into consideration external materials given by an accused for reaching the conclusion that no
offence was disclosed or that there was possibility of his acquittal. The Court has to consider the
record and documents annexed therewith by the prosecution.

Pushpendra Singh Bhadoriya vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 November, 2019
27.13. Quashing of a charge is an exception to the rule of continuous prosecution. Where the offence
is even broadly satisfied, the Court should be more inclined to permit continuation of prosecution
rather than its quashing at that initial stage. The Court is not expected to marshal the records with a
view to decide admissibility and reliability of the documents or records but is an opinion formed
prima facie.
27.14. Where the charge-sheet, report under Section 173(2) of the Code, suffers from fundamental
legal defects, the Court may be well within its jurisdiction to frame a charge. 27.15. Coupled with any
or all of the above, where the Court finds that it would amount to abuse of process of the Code or
that the interest of justice favours, otherwise it may quash the charge. The power is to be exercised
ex debito justitiae i.e. to do real and substantial justice for administration of which alone, the courts
exist.

27.16. These are the principles which individually and preferably cumulatively (one or more) be
taken into consideration as precepts to exercise of extraordinary and wide plenitude and jurisdiction
under Section 482 of the Code by the High Court. Where the factual foundation for an offence has
been laid down, the courts should be reluctant and should not hasten to quash the proceedings even
on the premise that one or two ingredients have not been stated or do not appear to be satisfied if
there is substantial compliance with the requirements of the offence."
12. In Kailash Chandra Agrawal & Anr. vs. State of U.P. (2014) 16 SCC 51, it was observed: (SCC p.
553, paras 8-9): "8. We have gone through the FIR and the criminal complaint. In the FIR, the
appellants have not been named and in the criminal complaint they have been named without
attributing any specific role to them. The relationship of the appellants with the husband of the
complainant is distant. In Kans Raj vs. State of Punjab [(2000) 5 SCC 207], it was observed:- (SCC
p.217, para
5) "5. ... A tendency has, however, developed for roping in all relations of the in-laws of the deceased
wives in the matters of dowry deaths which, if not discouraged, is likely to affect the case of the
prosecution even against the real culprits. In their over enthusiasm and anxiety to seek conviction
for maximum people, the parents of the deceased THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
(PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHADORIYA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) have been found
to be making efforts for involving other relations which ultimately weaken the case of the
prosecution even against the real accused as appears to have happened in the instant case."
The Court has, thus, to be careful in summoning distant relatives without there being specific
material. Only the husband, his parents or at best close family members may be expected to demand
dowry or to harass the wife but not distant relations, unless there is tangible material to support
allegations made against such distant relations. Mere naming of distant relations is not enough to
summon them in absence of any specific role and material to support such role.
9. The parameters for quashing proceedings in a criminal complaint are well known. If there are
triable issues, the Court is not expected to go into the veracity of the rival versions but where on the
face of it, the criminal proceedings are abuse of Court's process, quashing jurisdiction can be
exercised. Reference may be made to K. Ramakrsihna and Ors. vs. State of Bihar [(2000) 8 SCC
547], Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Judicial Magistrate [(1998) 5 SCC 749], State of Haryana v. Ch. Bhajan Lal
[(1992) Supp (1) SCC 335] and Asmathunnisa v. State of A.P.[(2011) 11 SCC 259]."
8. Thus, from the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the considered view that not
only the allegations made in the FIR/complaint primafacie discloses commission of offence and the
criminal proceedings are rightly initiated and cannot be quashed against the petitioner, at this stage.
The same is a matter of evidence, and cannot be quashed.
9. By way of caution, it is made clear that any observation made in this order should not come in the
way of the Trial Court while deciding the trial on merits. As the arguments were raised by the
counsel for the petitoners, therefore, in order to consider those arguments, in the light of limited
Scope of powers of High Court THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (PUSHPENDRA
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95117852/ 6
Pushpendra Singh Bhadoriya vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 November, 2019
SINGH BHADORIYA Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) under Section 482 of CrPC, the
above mentioned observations have been made.
10. The Trial Court should not get influenced by any of the observations made in this order and
should decide the trial/case on the basis of evidence which would ultimately come on record.
11. Accordingly, this petition fails and is hereby dismissed.
