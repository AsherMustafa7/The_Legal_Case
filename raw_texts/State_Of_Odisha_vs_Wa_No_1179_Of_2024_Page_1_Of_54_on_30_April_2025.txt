J UDGMENT
MURAHARI SRI RAMAN, J.--
W.A. No.1179 of 2024 and I.A. No.3001 of 2024 The Interlocutory Application has been filed for
condonation of delay of 184 days in filing the intra-Court appeal, being W.A. No.1179 of 2024, by the
functionaries of the Government of Odisha.
1.1. Aggrieved by Order dated 05.10.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No.31545 of 2023 by a learned Single
Bench of this Court exercising power under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India to set
aside the Office Order dated 08.05.2023 of the appellant No.3 (Annexure-10) and remand the
matter to consider compassionate appointment of the respondent afresh under the Rehabilitation
Assistance Scheme in the light of decisions rendered by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Malaya
Nanda Sethy Vrs. State of Orissa and others, 2022 (II) OLR (SC) 1 = (2022) 4 SCR 707 = 2022 INSC
617; State of West Bengal Vrs. Debabrata Tiwari, (2023) 3 SCALE 557 = (2023) 2 SCR 611 = 2023
INSC 202; and this Court in Suchitra Bal Vrs. State of Odisha, in W.P.(C) No.2081 of 2021 & batch,
disposed of on 27.06.2023 and State of Odisha and others Vrs. Bindusagar Samantaray, in W.A.
No.810 of 2021, disposed of on 25.09.2023, the appellants have preferred writ appeal.
Facts:
2. The record reveals that the father of the respondent while working as Fitter Mistry
in the Office of the Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Division,
Bhadrak died in harness on 19.11.2017 which led to making an application under Rule
8 of the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 (for short,
"Rules, 1990") before the competent authority on 28.05.2018.
2.1. Indifference of the opposite parties compelled the respondent to approach this
Court by way of a writ petition, being W.P. (C) No.324 of 2023, which came to be
disposed of on 10.01.2023, whereby the Additional Chief Engineer, Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Circle, Balasore was directed to consider the application and
representation within stipulated period. Upon consideration of application and
subsequent representation, vide Order dated 08.05.2023 the said authority rejected
the claim of the respondent adhering to provisions of the Odisha Civil Services
(Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020 ("Rules, 2020", for brevity) on the premise
that it is the law which prevails on the date of consideration of application is relevant.

State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
2.2. Assailing the Order, a writ petition, W.P.(C) No.31545 of 2023, was filed, which
got disposed of by Order dated 05.10.2023, by the learned Single Bench with the
following observation:
"***
6. Considering the submissions made by the respective parties, this Court deems it
proper to dispose of the application at the stage of admission by setting aside the
impugned office order dated 08.05.2023 of opposite party No.3 under Annexure-10
and further remand the matter back to the opposite party No.3 to consider the
application of the petitioner afresh in the light of the law laid down of the Hon(cid:128)ble
Supreme Court in the case of Malaya Nanda Sethy [2022 (II) OLR (SC) 1 = (2022) 4
SCR 707 = 2022 INSC 617] and Debabrata Tiwari [(2023) 3 SCALE 557 = (2023) 2
SCR 611 = 2023 INSC 202] as well as in Suchitra Bal and Bindusagar Samantaray(cid:128)s
case (supra) the petitioner is directed to approach the opposite party No.3 along with
certified copy of this order within a period of two weeks from today. On appearance
of the petitioner, opposite party No.3 shall do well to consider the case of the
petitioner and dispose of the matter by passing a speaking and reasoned order in
accordance with law within a period of two months. Any decision so taken on the
same shall be communicated to the petitioner within a period of ten days thereafter.
7. With the aforesaid observation/direction, the writ petition is disposed of."
2.3. Dissatisfied thereby, the appellants-functionaries of the Government of Odisha have filed the
writ appeal with delay.
2.4. The reason for delay ascribed by the appellants is decision making process. There was dilemma
whether to file the intra-Court appeal as the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of State
of Odisha Vrs. Biswajit Swain, Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary No(s). 9245 of 2024 (arising out
of Judgment and Order dated 31.10.2023 of this Court in WP(C) No.5214 of 2021) in connection
with declaration of Rule 6(9) 1 of the Rules, 2020 as ultra vires2.
2.5. However, stemming on the ratio decided in the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of N.C. Santhosh Vrs. State of Karnataka, (2020) 7 SCC 617 = (2020) 3 SCR 1177 that norms
prevailing on the date of consideration of the application should be the basis for consideration of
claim of compassionate appointment, the writ appeal has been filed on the ground that the decision
of the learned Single Bench of this Court in the writ petition runs counter to said decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court.
1 Rule 6(9) of the OCS (RA) Rules, 2020 stood thus:
"6. Mode of Appointment.--
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 3
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
*** (9) All pending cases as on the date of publication of these rules in the Odisha
Gazette shall be dealt in accordance with the provision of these rules."
2 This Court in Biswajit Swain Vrs. State of Odisha, in Judgment dated 31.10.2023 in WP(C)
No.5214 of 2021 held as follows:
"74.1. The Scheme for compassionate appointment is a policy decision of the
Government, as such the same doesn(cid:128)t confer an absolute right in favour of the
claimant to claim appointment as a matter of right. 74.2. Even a policy decision like
every State action has to be in conformity with Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
India. In the event it is found that the same is discriminatory or arbitrary, this Court
in exercise of its writ jurisdiction can always declare such scheme/Rules/Legislation
to be ultra vires the Constitution of India.
74.3. In the present batch of cases the provision in the shape of Rule 6 (9) of the
Rules, 2020 is held to be ultra vires Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India as
the same creates a class within the class with any intelligible
differentia/reasonableness. Accordingly, Rule 6 (9) is hereby declared ultra vires of
Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. 74.4. The Opp. Parties are directed to
consider the cases of the Petitioner under the O.C.S. (R.A.) Rules, 1990 without
insisting on filing of a fresh application under the OCS (R.A.) Rules, 2020. All
pending cases are directed to be considered under the old rules of the year 1990 as
amended upto the year 2016 (wherever such amendment is applicable). 74.5.
Applications filed for appointment on compassionate ground after 17.02.2020 are to
be considered under the new rules of the year 2020."
2.6. The appellants, therefore, filing the intra-Court appeal prayed for condonation of delay to
adjudicate the question of law as to the applicability of Rules for consideration of appointment on
compassionate grounds.
Hearing:
3. This matter was on board under the heading "Orders" for consideration of condonation of delay.
Even prior to issue of notice, the respondent entered appearance through M/s. Chandan Kumar
Sahoo, Advocate and Associates.
3.1. Since the matter relates to compassionate appointment in consideration of Rehabilitation
Assistance Scheme for extending succour to the family of the respondent, whose father is dead while
in Government service, on the concession of counsel for the respondent, delay in filing the writ
appeal is condoned.
3.2. It is submitted at the Bar that since writ appeal is pending before this Court for adjudication as
to applicability of appropriate Rules, the authority concerned has not been taking up the application
as directed by the learned Single Bench. The counsel for both the sides consented for hearing and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 4
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
disposal of the present matter at this stage in view of subsequent developments qua Rule 6(9) of the
Rules, 2020.
3.3. Accordingly, heard Sri Saswat Das, learned Additional Government Advocate for the appellants
and Sri Swoyam Prabhu Jena, learned Advocate representing the respondent.
Rival contentions and submissions:
4. Sri Saswat Das, learned Additional Government Advocate for the appellants submitted that the
application for compassionate appointment of the respondent was taken up by the authority
concerned in the year 2023, when the RA Rules, 2020 was in vogue.
4.1. The authority is empowered to consider application made under the Rules, 1990 as per Rule
6(9) of the Rules, 2020. Therefore, the Order dated 08.05.2023 being in consonance with the RA
Rules, 2020 needed no interference by this Court in exercise of provisions contained in Article 226
of the Constitution of India. The Order dated 05.10.2023 passed in the writ petition is, thus,
contrary to the proposition in N.C. Santhosh (supra).
4.2. Placing reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sheo Raj Singh Vrs.
Union of India, (2023) 10 SCC 531, he submitted that a liberal and justice oriented approach by this
Court is solicited so as to consider the question of law in the writ appeal and prayed for condonation
of delay.
4.3. Beseeching indulgence of this Court, Sri Saswat Das, learned Additional Government Advocate,
insisted for setting aside the Order passed in writ petition by learned Single Bench and prayed to
restore the Order of rejection dated 08.05.2023 of the Additional Chief Engineer, Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Circle, Balasore.
5. Sri Swoyam Prabhu Jena, learned Advocate, per contra, strenuously argued that this Court in the
case of Biswajit Swain Vrs. State of Odisha and others, W.P.(C) No.5214 of 2021 vide Judgment
dated 31.10.2023 declared Rule 6(9) of the RA Rules, 2020 ultra vires. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
of India though issued notice in the matter and directed to tag with SLP(C) No.28521 of 2023, no
stay of operation of the Judgment dated 31.10.2023 of this Court granted. Hence, he would submit
that no infirmity or illegality can be perceived in the direction to the Additional Chief Engineer to
consider the application of the respondent for compassionate appointment under the Rules, 1990,
since the same was furnished before the authority prior to the Rules, 2020 came into force.
5.1. Expanding his argument further, he urged that this Court in the case of Suchitra Bal Vrs. State of
Odisha, in W.P.(C) No.2081 of 2021 & batch, disposed of on 27.06.2023 and State of Odisha and
others Vrs. Bindusagar Samantaray, in W.A. No.810 of 2021, disposed of on 25.09.2023 having
already interpreted the application of relevant Rules, the same question cannot fall for
reconsideration. In the said cases it has been held that the application for compassionate
appointment under the Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme filed under the Rules, 1990 is to be
considered as per the Rules prevailing on the date of application, but not in terms of the Rules,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 5
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
2020. Such view of this Court finds support of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
the case of Malaya Nanda Sethy Vrs. State of Odisha and others, 2022 (II) OLR (SC) 1 = (2022) 4
SCR 707 = 2022 INSC 617.
5.2. It is submitted that since the father of the respondent died in harness on 19.11.2017 and the
application for compassionate appointment was filed on 28.05.2018, the applicable rules for
consideration is the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990. Because of delay
in entertaining of application dated 28.05.2018 on the part of the authority concerned, the
applicable Rules to present context cannot be said to be Rules, 2020. The approach of the Additional
Chief Engineer as reflected in Order dated 08.05.2023 is palpably erroneous inasmuch as the
subsequent Rules, i.e., the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020 has no
impact on the fact-situation of the present case.
5.3. Therefore, he submitted that the writ appeal, being devoid of merit, warrants dismissal with
cost.
Discussions and analysis:
6. Scrutiny of record reveals that there is no dispute with regard to fact that the father of the
respondent died while he was working as Government employee on 19.11.2017 and application for
consideration of compassionate appointment under the Rules, 1990 was submitted to the authority
concerned on 28.05.2018, and the said application was rejected by the Additional Chief Engineer,
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Circle, Balasore vide Order dated 08.05.2023.
7. The seminal question which arises for consideration is whether the learned Single Bench is
justified in directing the authority to consider the application of the respondent for compassionate
appointment in term of the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 in the light
of Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra); Suchitra Bal (supra) and Bindusagar Samantaray (supra)?
7.1. To answer this question this Court takes an excursion of certain judgments on the point.
7.2. In the case of Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has been
pleased to observe as follows:
"Thus, from the aforesaid, it can be seen that there was no fault and/or delay and/or
negligence on the part of the appellant at all. He was fulfilling all the conditions for
appointment on compassionate grounds under the 1990 Rules. For no reason, his
application was kept pending and/or no order was passed on one ground or the
other. Therefore, when there was no fault and/or delay on the part of the appellant
and all throughout there was a delay on the part of the department/authorities, the
appellant should not be made to suffer. Not appointing the appellant under the 1990
Rules would be giving a premium to the delay and/or inaction on the part of the
department/ authorities. There was an absolute callousness on the part of the
department/authorities. The facts are conspicuous and manifest the grave delay in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 6
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
entertaining the application submitted by the appellant in seeking employment which
is indisputably attributable to the department/authorities. In fact, the appellant has
been deprived of seeking compassionate appointment, which he was otherwise
entitled to under the 1990 Rules. The appellant has become a victim of the delay
and/or inaction on the part of the department/authorities which may be deliberate or
for reasons best known to the authorities concerned. Therefore, in the peculiar facts
and circumstances of the case, keeping the larger question open and aside, as
observed hereinabove, we are of the opinion that the appellant herein shall not be
denied appointment under the 1990 Rules."
7.3. In the case of State of West Bengal Vrs. Debabrata Tiwari, (2023) 2 SCR 611, laying emphasis on
the observations made in Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
observed thus:
"11. It may be apposite at this juncture to refer to the following observations of this
Court in Malaya Nanda Sethy Vrs. State of Orissa, AIR 2022 SC 2836, as to the
manner in which the authorities must consider and decide applications for
appointment on compassionate grounds:
„9. Before parting with the present order, we are constrained to observe that
considering the object and purpose of appointment on compassionate grounds, i.e., a
family of a deceased employee may be placed in a position of financial hardship upon
the untimely death of the employee while in service and the basis or policy is
immediacy in rendering of financial assistance to the family of the deceased
consequent upon his untimely death, the authorities must consider and decide such
applications for appointment on compassionate grounds as per the policy prevalent,
at the earliest, but not beyond a period of six months from the date of submission of
such completed applications.
We are constrained to direct as above as we have found that in several cases,
applications for appointment on compassionate grounds are not attended in time and
are kept pending for years together. As a result, the applicants in several cases have to
approach the concerned High Courts seeking a writ of Mandamus for the
consideration of their applications. Even after such a direction is issued, frivolous or
vexatious reasons are given for rejecting the applications. Once again, the applicants
have to challenge the order of rejection before the High Court which leads to
pendency of litigation and passage of time, leaving the family of the employee who
died in harness in the lurch and in financial difficulty. Further, for reasons best
known to the authorities and on irrelevant considerations, applications made for
compassionate appointment are rejected. After several years or are not considered at
all as in the instant case.
If the object and purpose of appointment on compassionate grounds as envisaged
under the relevant policies or the rules have to be achieved then it is just and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 7
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
necessary that such applications are considered well in time and not in a tardy way.
We have come across cases where for nearly two decades the controversy regarding
the application made for compassionate appointment is not resolved. This
consequently leads to the frustration of the very policy of granting compassionate
appointment on the death of the employee while in service. We have, therefore,
directed that such applications must be considered at an earliest point of time. The
consideration must be fair, reasonable and based on relevant consideration. The
application cannot be rejected on the basis of frivolous and for reasons extraneous to
the facts of the case. Then and then only the object and purpose of appointment on
compassionate grounds can be achieved.(cid:128) In the said case, the claim of the
appellant-applicant therein for compassionate appointment was directed by this
Court to be considered by the competent authority. This Court noted that in the said
case, there was no lapse on the part of the appellant- applicant therein in diligently
pursuing the matter. The delay in considering the application of the appellant therein
was held to be solely attributable to the authorities of the State, and no part of it was
occasioned by the appellant-applicant. Further, in the said case, the
appellant-applicant was prejudiced not only because of the prolonged delay in
considering his application but also by the fact that in the interim, the policy of the
State governing compassionate appointment had changed to his detriment.
Therefore, the facts of the said case were distinct from the facts involved herein. In
the present case, the conduct of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners cannot be said to
be blameless in that they did not pursue their matter with sufficient diligence.
However, the observations made in the said case as to the manner in which
applications for compassionate appointment are to be considered and disposed of are
relevant to the present case."
7.4. In the cases of Suchitra Bal Vrs. State of Odisha, in W.P.(C) No.2081 of 2021 & batch, disposed
of on 27.06.2023 this Court held as follows:
"71. In State Bank of India Vrs. Sheo Shankar Tewari, (2019) 5 SCC 600, a
two-Judges Bench of the apex court noticed that the view in State Bank of India Vrs.
Raj Kumar, (2010) 11 SCC 661 and MGB Gramin Bank Vrs. Chakrawarti Singh,
(2014) 13 SCC 583 is on one side and the contrary view as expressed in Canara Bank
vs. M. Mahesh Kumar:
(2015) 7 SCC 412 is on the other side. In State Bank of India Vrs. Sheo Shankar
Tewari (2019) 5 SCC 600, the necessity of resolution of the conflicting views was
emphasized. The matter was referred for consideration by a Larger Bench so these
conflicting views can be reconciled.
72. Having considered all these decisions, it has been held in N.C. Santhosh Vrs. State of Karnataka:
(2020) 7 SCC 617 that the norms, prevailing on the date of consideration of the
applications should be the basis for consideration of the claim for the rehabilitation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 8
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
appointment or the compassionate appointment. The dependants of a Government
employee in absence of any vested right accruing on the date of death of the
Government employee can only demand consideration on his/her application. They
are disentitled to seek consideration in accordance with the norms as applicable on
the day of death of the Government employee. For that reason, N.C. Santosh (supra)
is a departure.
73. Having considered N.C. Santhosh (supra) and the law as decided by the apex court in various
other judgments including the case of the Secretary to the Government, Department of Education
(Primary) and others Vrs. Bheemesh @ Bheemappa, 2021 SCC Online SC 1264, the observation in
Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra) was framed. In Bheemesh @ Bheemappa (supra), it has been held that
the relevant scheme and/or the Rules prevalent at the time of death of the employee who died in
harness is required to be considered and not under the amended rules prevalent at the time of
consideration of the application.
74. In Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), the decision has been rendered on the issue whether the Odisha
Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 which we have referred as the old Rules would
apply in respect of all the applications which were submitted prior to 17.02.2020 on which day, the
Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020 was brought in force in total
suppression of the Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990.
75. In Rule 6(9), all the pending cases were saved for consideration under the new Rules, 2020. We
have reproduced the provisions of Rule 6(9) of the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance)
Rules, 2020.
76. The petitioner has challenged Rule-6(9) of the new Rules asserting that it takes away their right
to be considered under the old Rules i.e. the Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules,
1990. They are entitled to be considered under the old Rules for two reasons:
(1) Death of the deceased employee/worker had taken place prior to 17.02.2020 and
the application for rehabilitation assistance in all the cases had been filed prior to
17.02.2020.
(2) It is for the delay caused by the opposite parties, the petitioner(cid:128)s case was not
considered under the old Rules i.e. the Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation
Assistance) Rules, 1990.
77. In all the cases, the opposite parties asked for resubmission of the application for rehabilitation
assistance in the prescribed format under the new rules. One of the petitioners, as noted by us, had
filed such petition for consideration under the new Rules, i.e. Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation
Assistance) Rules, 2020.
78. As discussed already, in Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), a two Judges Bench, having considered
N.C. Santosh (supra) and Bheemesh @ Bheemappa (supra) has observed as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 9
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
"***"
80. Accordingly, the authorities were directed for appointing the petitioner on compassionate
grounds under the 1990 Rules in terms of the original application. It has been also observed in
Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra) that if the object and the purpose of appointment on compassionate
grounds as envisaged under the relevant policy or the Rules is to be achieved, then it is necessary
that the applications are considered in time and not otherwise.
81. We have come across the cases where for nearly about two decades, the applications made for
compassionate appointment have not been considered. Such apathetic inaction frustrates the very
object of granting compassionate appointment 3 on the death of an employee in service.
82. In Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), the apex court did not make any comment on the correctness of
the decision of N.C. Santosh (supra), but it has been clearly laid down that the delay in making the
decision on the rehabilitation assistance/ appointment shall not give any premium to the
authorities. As such, if the delay is attributable to the opposite parties, the application of the
petitioners for rehabilitation assistance/appointment should not be frustrated by bringing them
under the new Rehabilitation Assistance Rules, 2020. Such application shall be considered, if filed
before the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020 came into force under the
provisions of the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990.
83. The apex court thus in effect, read down the Rule 9(6) of the Odisha Civil Services
(Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020.
3 The Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990, in Rule 4 has specified the
object as follows:
"4. Objective of the Scheme.--
The rehabilitation assistance is conceived as a compassionate measure of saving the family of a
Government servant from immediate distress when the Government servant suddenly dies while in
service. The concept is based on the premises that in case of sudden death his family would not face
starvation. The scheme has a direct relationship with the economic condition of the family of the
Government servant. Appointment of the family member of the Government servant under these
rules shall be subject to the provisions contained in Rule 9 and can not be claimed as a matter of
right."
84. In view of the above decision, we are of the view that the application for the petitioners shall be
considered under the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 in as much as on
scrutiny, it is found that all the applications were filed before 17.02.2020 and the delay in
considering the applications in time is entirely attributable to the opposite parties. Such exercise
shall be completed within a period of three months from the day when a copy of the judgment/order
shall be placed before the opposite parties by the petitioners.

State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
85. That apart, while dealing with the applications in which the petitioners have sought the
rehabilitation assistance/appointment against a direct payment/ Grant-in-Aid Rules at the
Government aided educational institution, the applicability of the rehabilitation scheme in those
institutions shall be separately determined by the opposite parties on the basis of the policy of the
Government as discussed by us. If it is found that the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation
Assistance) Rules, 1990 was applicable on the date of death of the deceased employee, the petitioner
shall be considered for rehabilitation assistance/appointment. So far as the retrospective operation
of the rehabilitation assistance/appointment is concerned, this Court cannot direct the opposite
parties to give the appointment retrospectively under the Rehabilitation Assistance/Appointment
Scheme inasmuch as it is no more res integra, the petitioner does not have any vested right of
appointment under such rehabilitation assistance/appointment scheme. They are only entitled to be
considered under the scheme for that purpose.
86. Consequently, the opposite parties shall consider the applications of the petitioners under the
Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 read with the relevant policy extending
such scheme to the Government aided educational institutions at the relevant time of the death of
the deceased employee for the purpose of the rehabilitation assistance/appointment within the time
as prescribed above."
7.5. In State of Odisha Vrs. Bindusagar Samantaray, W.A. No.810 of 2021, the following
observations are made by this Court in the intra-Court appeal vide Judgment dated 25.09.2023:
"7. At this juncture, this Court would like to add that in Malaya Nanda Sethy Vrs.
State of Odisha, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 684, the Hon(cid:128)ble apex Court in no uncertain
terms has observed that when such delay is clearly attributable to the State or the
State instrumentalities, that cannot be used against the person who is seeking
rehabilitation assistance from the State. In a recent judgment of a Division Bench of
this Court, the aspects of developing law including difference of opinion in certain
points have been dealt with. In the said case being W.P.(C) No. 2081 of 2021
[Suchitra Bal Vrs. State of Odisha & others] and batch, decided on 27.06.2023 it has
been observed as follows:
„***(cid:128)
9. It has been stated by the learned counsel for writ petitioners-respondents that in
one case, since the mother is alive; the son(cid:128)s prayer for rehabilitation assistance
appointment was denied on that ground that when mother is alive, no other person
can be given benefit from the family. Mr. P.K. Mishra, learned counsel has pointed
out that this Court has already decided the said issue in Ajit Kumar Barik Vrs. State of
Odisha and others reported in 2018 (II) OLR 10. The State had challenged the said
decision in Ajit Kumar Barik (supra), but the apex Court declined to interfere in the
decision of Ajit Kumar Barik (supra), where this Court had an occasion to hold that
under Rule 9(7) of the Orissa Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990
„ward(cid:128) who is minor at the time of death of a Government servant will not be

State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
covered under the said provision, we are presently dealing with, due to delay and
latches on the part of the Collector in issuing the distress certificate, after 13 years
from the date when the Registrar, Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide his letter
dated 26.12.2002 forwarded the application for enquiry into the distress condition of
the family as required under Rule 8(1) (b) of the Rules, the appointment letter was
issued in favour of widow of the deceased employee in the year 2016.
However, she was not fit to discharge the duties and which fact has not been disputed by the
appellants.
10. For reference, paragraph 7 of Ajit Kumar Barik (supra) is reproduced below :
„7. Of course the first preference is to be given wife/husband of the deceased
employee then son and unmarried daughter. However nowhere it was stated that in
the case a family member in order of preference in the hierarchy is unfit and a
medical certificate furnished to that effect, claim shall not be considered for
engagement of the other eligible members in case of distress condition of the family.
Therefore, the finding given by the Tribunal in the impugned order that since she is
not prepared to accept Group-D post and offered it to her son in ignoring the material
on records is not sustainable.(cid:128) The crux of the said observation is that if there is no
conflicting claim, if the family can choose whom they would like to get the benefit
under the scheme.
In our considered opinion the impugned order is erroneous, in view of Ajit Kumar
Barik (supra). Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order dated 17.11.2017 passed
by the Odisha Administrative Tribunal, Cuttack Bench, Cuttack in O.A. No. 375(C) of
2016 and direct the opposite party No.2 to issue the appointment order in favour of
the petitioner within a period of two months.
11. Having appreciated the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties, we find that all these
writ appeals can be disposed of in terms of the direction as issued in Suchitra Bal (supra), but with
some explanations in respect of certain aspects which are not categorically dealt in Suchitra Bal
(supra).
We direct the appellants to consider the case of the petitioner-respondent under the old scheme
called Orissa Civil Services Rehabilitation Assistance Rules 1990. We make it abundantly clear that
those applications which do come within the parameters of that scheme, will be considered for
rehabilitation appointments. However, notwithstanding the above observation, on humane
consideration and on consideration of the distress condition, the State Government may provide
rehabilitation appointment to the distressed families of the employees, who died in harness but this
is left in the absolute discretion of the State Government.
So far as question relating to the aided Government institutions or the block grant institutions is
concerned it appears that the cases of rehabilitation will be covered by the Government policy as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 12
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
framed by the General Administration & Public Grievance Department vide their circular dated
14.10.1998, as referred above.
So far as the objection as raised by the learned counsel for the appellants that some of the
applications have been filed after the new Rule came into force, in this regard, nothing more is
required to be explained. The scheme under the old Rules itself contains the rule of limitation and
hence, all applications are to be filed within a period of one year from the date of death. If any
application is filed even after new Rules came into force, that was not barred by limitation if filed
within one year.
But those applications are to be considered under the old Rules. Applications filed within one year
from the date of death, have to be considered as valid. We lay emphasis that consideration for
rehabilitation assistance has to be made on the date of death, not on the date of consideration. In
this regard, we are governed by the law, as laid down in Malaya Nanda Sethy Vrs. State of Odisha,
2022 SCC OnLine SC 684.
We direct the appellants to consider the cases of the petitioner-respondents within the period of
four months from today. For that, the State shall form a Special Committee for consideration of the
cases of the writ petitioners-respondents in order to assist the authorities to issue the rehabilitation
appointments. We make it further clear that this Court will not extend the stipulated time. Keeping
that in view, State Government shall expedite the process of the formation of Committee. The cases
of rehabilitation appointments are to be considered with empathy and hence the rigid technicalities
are not germane. Before parting with the records, we direct the respondent-petitioners to extend all
out cooperation to the State Government so that their appointments can be considered at earliest."
7.6. In Biswajit Swain Vrs. State of Odisha, W.P.(C) No.5214 of 2021 and batch, disposed of by a
learned Single Bench of this Court vide Judgment dated 31.10.2023, it has been observed as follows:
"1. *** The above noted batch of writ applications involve an identical issue/question
as to which Rules i.e. Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990,
which was in force at the time of death of the deceased Government employee, or the
new Rules i.e. Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020 would
apply to the facts of their cases as the common factual background in all above noted
cases is that the deceased Government employees had died prior to the new Rules,
2020 came into force and the applications were also made by the petitioners-legal
heirs much prior to the new Rules, 2020 were notified in the Gazette by the
Government of Odisha.
***
40. On scrutiny of the facts of that case, it is revealed that under the Circular dated
29.09.2014 the dependent family member was paid a sum on compassionate ground
of Rs.1,00,000/-. Although the said grant of Rs.1,00,000/- was subsequently
enhanced to Rs.2,00,000/- by another Circular dated 31.08.2016. However, finally
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 13
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
the Supreme Court in exercise of their power under Article 142 of the Constitution of
India and to do complete justice between the parties enhanced the amount of
compensation from Rs.1,00,000/- to Rs.2,00,000/-. On a plain reading of the
judgment in State of M.P. Vrs. Amit Shrivas reported in (2020) 10 SCC 496, it
appears that the three Judge Bench has affirmed the ratio laid down in Indian
Bank(cid:128)s Case supra.
41. In State of Madhya Pradesh Vrs. Ashish Awasthi reported in (2022) 2 SCC 157,
the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India was dealing with a case of compassionate
appointment, wherein the father of the applicant died on 08.10.2015 while he was
working as a work-charged employee. The question arose as to whether the applicant,
who is not entitled to employment, would get compensation under the circular of the
year 2014 or 2016 i.e. a subsequent circular enhancing the compensation amount.
The Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court referring to the judgment in Indian Bank and Ors. Vrs.
Promila and Another reported in 2020 (2 SCC 729) (supra) and State of M.P. Vrs.
Amit Shrivas reported in (2020) 10 SCC 496 finally held that the policy/circular
prevalent at the time of the death of the Government employee shall apply and
accordingly benefits under such scheme/policy/ circular be given to the applicant.
Although the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court did not disturb the appointment of the
applicant under the subsequent circular pursuant to the direction of the High Court.
42. In the case of The Secretary to Govt., Department of Education (primary) &
others Vs. Bheemesh alias Bheemappa reported in AIR 2022 SC 402, it has once
again been reiterated that the relevant Scheme and/or the Rules prevalent at the time
of time of the death of the Government employee, who died in harness, and/or at the
time of submitting the application is required to be considered and not the amended
Rules prevalent at the time of consideration of the application.
43. While the above-discussed legal position was holding the field, the learned
counsel for the petitioner cited a judgment of the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court in Malaya
Nanda Sethy Vrs. State of Odisha and others reported in AIR 2022 SC 2836 : 2022
(II) OLR (SC) 1 in support of his contention that the rule prevalent at the time of
death of the deceased employee shall be applicable to the claim made by the
dependents/family members of the deceased Government Employee who died in
harness. On a perusal of the judgment delivered by the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court in
Malaya Nanda Sethy(cid:128)s case (supra), this court observed that the issue involved in the
said case was pertaining to a claim by a dependent-claimant under the
compassionate appointment Orissa Rules, 1990. Further, the said judgment,
rendered by a two-Judge Bench, has taken note of several other judgments rendered
by the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court on the issue of compassionate appointment.
44. In Malaya Nanda Sethy(cid:128)s case (supra), Hon(cid:128)ble Apex Court took note of the
judgment in N.C. Santhosh Vrs. State of Karnataka and others reported in (2020) 7
SCC 617 which has been heavily relied upon by the learned counsel for the State to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 14
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
impress upon this Court that the Rules, 2020 is the only Rule now in force and the
same is required to be followed in the case of the petitioner and similarly placed other
persons. Further, in Malaya Nanda Sethy(cid:128)s case (supra) the applicability of Odisha
Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 as well as Odisha Civil Service
(Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020 was directly involved. On a careful scrutiny
of the facts of the aforesaid case, it appears that the deceased Government employee,
who is the father of the appellant-claimant, while working as an Assistant
Sub-Inspector of Police in the Government Department died in harness on
02.01.2010.
Thereafter, the appellant submitted his application for appointment as a Junior Clerk on
compassionate grounds under the OCS (R.A) Rules, 1990 in July 2010.
45. However, the said application was not considered by the Competent Authority for a considerable
period of time. The Competent Authority, from time to time, deferred the consideration of the
appellant(cid:128)s application for want of compliance with some of the requirements under the rules and
as a result, final adjudication of the matter was delayed. Thereafter, the OCS (RA) Rules, 1990 was
replaced by a new set of Rules namely, OCS (RA) Rules, 2020 vide Notification dated 17.02.2020,
which provides that the family member of a deceased Government servant could be appointed on
compassionate grounds against Group-D level post.
46. Thereafter, the application of the appellant was remanded to the authority for fresh
consideration under the 2020 Rules. The appellant preferred a writ petition before this court by
taking a specific stand that the rule prevalent at the time when the application for compassionate
appointment was made shall be applicable and not the subsequent rules that were in force at the
time of consideration of the application for compassionate appointment. This court after
considering the contentions raised by the parties and by relying upon the judgment of the Hon(cid:128)ble
Supreme Court in N.C. Santhosh(cid:128)s case (supra) dismissed the writ petition by holding that the
claim should be considered under the new Rules that is the Rules, 2020.
47. Finally, feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment of this Court, the appellant
approached the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India by filing Civil Appeal No.4103 of 2022 arising out
of SLP (Civil) No. 936/2020. On a careful perusal of the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court
in Malaya Nanda Sethy's Case, this court observed that the issue involved in the present case was
directly and substantially in issue before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Malaya Nanda Sethy's Case.
Furthermore, in Paragraph 3 of the judgment the issue has been crystallized by the Supreme Court,
and in Paragraph 3.1 several judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court have been referred to
including the judgment in N.C. Santhos's case (supra) in Paragraph 5 of the judgment.
***
53. Now, let us examine the issue(s) involved in the present writ applications as well as a batch of
other similar writ applications from a legal and Constitutional validity point of view. Both, the OCS
(Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 as well as the OCS (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 15
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
are Rules made under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India by the State of Odisha
for compassionate appointment of the family members of a deceased Government employee died in
harness. The Rules of the year 1990 came into force w.e.f. 24.09.1990 and the Rules of the year
2020, which superseded 1990 Rules, came into force w.e.f. 17.02.2020 4 . Therefore, there is no
doubt that the family members of the Government employee who died in harness after 17.02.2020
are to be governed by the 2020 Rules for compassionate appointment.
4 Rule 1 of the OCS (RA) Rules, 2020, reads thus:
"1. Short Title and Commencement.--
(1) These rules may be called the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance)
Rules, 2020.
(2) They shall come into force on the date of their publication in the Odisha Gazette."
Said OCS (RA) Rules, 2020 promulgated under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of
India [vide General Administration and Public Grievance Department Notification
No.5651-GAD-SC-RAS-0029-2014/Gen], dated 17.02.2020 was published in the Extraordinary
issue No.395 of the Odisha Gazette on 27.02.2020.
Rule 6 Sub-rule (9) of the 2020 Rules provides that all applications for compassionate appointment
pending as of the date on which the new set of rules came into force shall be governed by the Rules,
2020.
54. On a comparison of the two Rules as demonstrated by the learned counsel for the petitioners, it
appears that the Rules, 1990 is less cumbersome and more beneficial to the family members of the
deceased Government employee. However, it is seen from the record that many applications filed
prior to 17.02.2020 were kept pending for reasons best known to the authorities. In some cases, the
applications for appointment on compassionate ground were kept pending for more than a decade.
Furthermore, the applications received were scrutinized and a list of applicants was prepared by the
appointing authority/ agencies. Out of the list so prepared, appointments were being made from
time to time by various competent authorities. In some cases, it was found that some of the persons
named on the list were given appointments, however, some were not so lucky. As has been stated
here in above, some applications were kept pending for years together although those candidates
were eligible for appointment under the scheme/Rules. Their applications were not rejected. When
the new Rule, 2020 came into force, the authorities asked such applicants, whose applications are
pending as on that date, to apply afresh under the provisions of the new Rules.
55. As has been already stated, both Rules were framed in exercise of power conferred under the
proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India by the State of Odisha. It is too well known that
the recruitment, and service conditions of a person under the State/Union to the public service/post
are regulated by the appropriate Legislature/ Parliament. The power to regulate by bringing
appropriate legislation is left to the appropriate Legislature under List II Entry 41 for the State and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 16
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
List I Entry 70 for the Union under the Constitution of India. The power of appointment belonging
to the Executive shall be governed and guided by the appropriate legislation in that regard. The
power conferred by Article 309 of the Constitution of India is subject to other provisions of the
Constitution of India as has been reflected in the opening words of Article 309. Therefore, it is
needless to state here that the law/rules framed under Article 309 if contravenes any of the
provisions of the Constitution of India including the provisions of Part III i.e. Fundamental Rights
guaranteed under Articles 14, 16, 19, 21, such law/rules shall be void.
56. In the case of Rules of 1990 and 2020, the same were framed under the proviso to Article 309 of
the Constitution by the Governor of Odisha. Although laying down the conditions of service is
primarily a duty bestowed upon the Legislatures/Parliament, the proviso to Article 309 carves out
an exception where the President of India or the Governor of the State, as the case may be, may
notify an appropriate rule to regulate the recruitment/ service conditions of Government servants.
Such a provision is a transitional provision conferring power upon the executive to frame rules
having the force of law and the same shall remain in force till the legislatures legislate on the subject
matter as has been decided by the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India in A.K. Krishna Vs. State of
Karnataka reported in AIR 1998 SC 1050.
57. Furthermore, a benefit that has accrued under the existing rules cannot be taken away by an
amendment with retrospective effect and no statutory rule or administrative order can whittle down
or destroy any right, which has become crystallized and no rule can be framed under this proviso,
which affects or impairs the vested rights as has been held in the case of R.S. Ajara Vrs. State of
Gujurat reported in (1997) 3 SCC 641 and in Chairman Railway Board Vrs. C.R. Rangadhamaiah
reported in (1997) 6 SCC 623. It has also been held by the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India in State
of Karnataka Vrs. Ameerbi reported in (2007) 11 SCC 681 that the Rules framed under the proviso to
Article 309 of the Constitution of India are not attracted in the case of appointees under a scheme
which is not of a permanent nature, although the employees might have continued for a long time.
57.A. Rule-6 of the OCS (RA) Rules, 2020 provides for the mode of appointment under the new
Rules. Sub-rule (1) deals with the form of the application. Sub-rule (2) deals with marks to be
awarded on evaluation. Similarly, sub-rule (3) provides for appointment against any vacant
Group-„D(cid:128) post. Sub-rule (5) provides that in the event the applicant does not join, he/she shall
forfeit his/ her claim under the said Rules and what he/she shall not be provided with any choice.
Sub-rule (6) provides that the applications are to be considered in order of date of death of the
deceased employee. Sub-rules (7) & (8) deals with process of evaluation. In the present batch of writ
petitions, we are concerned with sub- rule (9) of Rule 6, which is quoted herein below:
„6. Mode of Appointment.--
*** (9) All pending cases as on the date of publication of these rules in the Odisha
Gazette shall be dealt in accordance with the provision of these rules.(cid:128) The above
quoted sub-rule (9) of Rule 6 of the 2020 Rules mandates that all pending
applications for compassionate appointment for whatever reasons shall now be
considered under the Rules, 2020 w.e.f. 17.02.2020. All applications involved in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 17
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
present batch of writ petitions having been considered under the new Rules, 2020
and the same having been rejected under the 2020 Rules, although the Government
employees in these writ petitions having died much prior to the date 17.02.2020, the
petitioners have approached this Court by filing the present batch of writ petitions.
This Court observes that the validity of Rule 6(9) is required to be tested with the
parameters prescribed in Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India to effectively
adjudicate all the pending writ petitions.
58. The Rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution of India may be struck down only on the
grounds that may invalidate a legislative measure. That is when the rules so framed infringes upon
the provisions contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and not because the Court
considers the same to be unreasonable or that it has been enacted with an improper motive.
Needless to say here that the constitutional mandate in Article 14 includes non-arbitrariness.
Therefore, this Court can only interfere and declare the provisions contained in Rule 6, Sub-Rule (9)
of the 2020 Rules as void, only if the provision violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
59. Even assuming that the Rules in question are policy decisions of the Government or a scheme by
the State to provide benefit to the distressed family members of the Government employees who
have died in harness, this Court would not get jurisdiction to interfere with the same unless this
Court holds that the same is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The Govt. has full
freedom to change any policy decision and the Court shall not interfere with the same unless such
administrative policy/ scheme violates some of the provisions of the Constitution like Article 14,
which requires that, even the administrative authority must act fairly and treat its employees equally
as has been laid down by the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Distt. Registrar Vrs.
M.B. Koyakutty reported in AIR 1979 SC 1060 and S.L. Sachdev Vrs. Union of India, reported in AIR
1981 SC 411.
60. Thus, where the Rules/Policy/Scheme violates the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution,
the Court would be perfectly justified in interfering with the Rules/Policy/Scheme and may pass
suitable directions as to how fairness or equality of treatment could be achieved. Further, a change
of policy is also controlled by the doctrine of promissory estoppel, however, in the context of the
present case this Court would not like to go into that aspect of the matter and shall confine itself to
violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
61. Now, reverting back to the issue of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, this court
need not reiterate the guiding principles under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. So far
appointments on compassionate grounds in the State of Odisha are concerned, in a large number of
cases that have reached this Court it was observed that the authorities have slept over the matter for
a long time. In some of the cases it was also observed that the applications have been pending for
more than a decade. In some cases, it was found that while giving appointment under the scheme to
a selected few, other applications were not even attended to for years together and finally they were
asked to submit a fresh application under the new rules of the year 2020. The new rules, as
discussed above, is a cumbersome one and less beneficial to the family members of the deceased
Government employee. Under the old Rules of the year 1990, the authorities used to prepare a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 18
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
year-wise list of applicants and appointments were being made out of the said list. In many cases it
was observed that appointments were being made by adopting the pick-and-choose method, thereby
compelling this Court to intervene in the matter repeatedly. Although the mandate of the
amendment Rules, 2016 was to consider the applications in the order of date of death of the
deceased Government employee, however, the same was not followed scrupulously and diligently.
Thus, the aforesaid conduct of the authorities definitely indicates that the families of the deceased
Government employees were not treated equally and the competent authorities have acted in an
arbitrary manner.
62. It is now a well-settled principle of law that Article 14 applies to cases of appointment, by
whatever mode, to public employment and Government jobs. Therefore, the conduct of the
authorities in compelling the family members of the deceased Government employees to apply
afresh after an inordinate delay, solely attributable to the appointing authorities, that too under the
new Rules of 2020, while already giving appointments to family members of some of the deceased
Government employees irrespective of the date of death of such employee, in the considered view of
this Court, is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Furthermore, any rule compelling
them to do so would not stand the scrutiny of law under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
Therefore, Rule 6, sub- rule (9) of the 2020 Rules would not pass the test of judicial scrutiny upon
the same being tested with the touchstone of Article 14 in the factual background of the present
cases and similar other cases pending for adjudication before this Court. The discrimination in the
present case i.e. the family members of some of the employees who have been given appointment
under the old Rules, 1990 in comparison to the ones who have been asked to apply afresh under the
new Rules, 2020, although their predecessors have died prior to 2020 Rules came into force, is an
actual one and not abstract or theoretical.
63. No doubt the appointment means an actual appointment by posting the person concerned to a
particular post lying vacant, whereas, recruitment means the process preceding such appointment.
This Court also observed that in certain cases the recruitment year is the same, however, out of the
common list appointments were given to some and in some cases the authorities slept over the
matters for years. Therefore, the principle of equality demands that both sets of employees should
have been treated similarly. However, the authorities by asking some of the leftover candidates to
apply again under the new rules and by compelling them to undergo the recruitment process again
as provided under the 2020 Rules, have created two different classes of employees under the same
category without having any specific object or purpose to achieve thereby. This is clearly hit by
Article 14 of the Constitution of India and any rule in that regard is ultra-vires the principles
enshrined in Article of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the Rule 6, sub-rule (9) of the Rules,
2020 is unconstitutional being hit by Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and as such the
same is unsustainable in law. In the factual background of the present batch of writ applications, the
incorporation of Rule 6, sub-rule (9) of the Rules, 2020 may not withstand the test of judicial
scrutiny under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
64. It was also contended by the learned counsel for the Petitioners that the Rules, 1990 was
amended by 2016 amendment rules which was notified on 5.11.2016. By virtue of Rule 4 of the
amending Rules, 2016, the existing Rule 5 of the 1990 Rules was amended to the extent that a quota
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 19
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
of 10% was fixed for the first time. It says "Provided that a maximum of 10% of the total vacancies in
a year shall be earmarked to be filled up by applicants under Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme."
However, the aforesaid quota of up to 10% of the total vacancies arising in a year was never adhered
to by the authorities thereby violating the provisions of the Rules itself. No data whatsoever was
produced before this Court with regard to the utilization of the aforesaid quota. Upon a careful
consideration of the said plea, this Court is of the considered view that such contention raised by the
learned counsel has force in it.
65. Finally, this Court would like to test the State action or a policy decision of the State Authorities
with the touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In National Highway Authority of
India Vrs. Madhukar Kumar (Civil Appeal No.11141 of 2018 decided on 23.09.2021 [(2021) 13 SCR
299 = 2021 INSC 532], the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India has held that in India, every State
action must be fair, failing which, it will fall foul of the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India. Similarly, in Ajay Hasia Vrs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi reported in AIR 1981 SC 487, the
Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India has held that Article 14 of the Constitution of India strikes at
arbitrariness because an action that is arbitrary, must necessarily involve negation of equality.
Whenever, therefore, there is arbitrariness in State action, whether it be legislature or of the
executive, Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such action. Similar view has
also been taken in E.P.Royappa Vrs. State of T.N. reported in AIR 1974 SC 555 and Maneka Gandhi
Vrs. Union of India reported in AIR 1978 SC 597.
66. The word "arbitrariness" has been defined in a judgment of the Hon(cid:128)ble Apex Court in Sharma
Transport Vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh reported in (2002) 2 SCC 188. The Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme
Court has defined arbitrariness by observing that a party has to satisfy that action was not
reasonable and was manifestly arbitrary. The expression "arbitrarily" means, act done in an
unreasonable manner, as fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure without adequately determining
the principle, not founded in the nature of things, non-rational, not done or acting according to
reason or judgment, depending on the will alone. In Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing Co. Ltd Vrs.
Bombay Environmental Action Group reported in (2006) 3 SCC 434, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court,
in para 205 of the judgment, has held that arbitrariness on the part of the legislature so as to make
the legislation violative of Article 14 of the Constitution should ordinarily be manifest arbitrariness.
67. In Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Assn. Vs. Central Valuation Board reported in AIR 2007 SC
2276 and in Grand Kakatiya Sheraton Hotel and Towers Employees and workers union Vs. Srinivasa
Resorts Ltd. reported in (2009) 5 SCC 342, the Apex Court has observed that a law cannot be
declared ultra vires on the ground of hardship but can be done so on the ground of total
unreasonableness. The legislation can be questioned as arbitrary and ultra vires under Article 14.
However, to declare an Act ultra vires under Article 14, the Court must be satisfied in respect of
substantive unreasonableness in the statute itself.
68. In A.P. Dairy Development Corpn. Federation Vs. B. Narasimha Reddy reported in (2011) 9 SCC
286, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court has held that it is a settled legal proposition that Article 14 of the
Constitution of India strikes at the arbitrariness because an action that is arbitrary, must necessarily
involve negation of equality. This doctrine of arbitrariness is not restricted only to executive action,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 20
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
but also applies to the legislature. Thus a party has to satisfy that the action was reasonable, not
done in unreasonably or capriciously or at the pleasure without adequate determining principle,
rational and has been done according to reason or judgment, and certainly doesn(cid:128)t depend on the
will alone. However, the action of the legislature, violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, should
ordinarily be manifestly arbitrary. There must be case of substantive unreasonableness in the
Statute itself for declaring the Act ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
69. In E.P. Royappa(cid:128)s case (supra), which is a Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court
of India, Justice Bhagawati in a concurring judgment observed as follows:
„The basic principle which, therefore, informs both Article 14 and 16 is equality and
inhibition against discrimination. Now, what is the content and reach of this great
equalizing principle? It is a founding faith, to use the words of Bose, J., "a way of life",
and it must not be subjected to a narrow and pedantic and lexicographic approach.
We cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all- embracing scope and
meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic
concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be „cribbed(cid:128), cabined and
confined within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view,
equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn
enemies; one belongs to the Rule of Law in a republic while the other, to the whim
and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that
it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore
violative of Article 14, and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it is
also violative of Article 16. Article 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and
ensure fairness and equality of treatment.(cid:128)
70. Let us now proceed to analyze the validity of a policy decision, the unreasonableness/
arbitrariness of such decision and to what extent the same can be reviewed by this Court in exercise
of its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. In Krishnan Kakkanth
Vrs.
Government of Kerala reported in (1997) 9 SCC 495, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India in para 36
of the judgment has observed as follows:
„36. To ascertain unreasonableness and arbitrariness in the context of Article 14 of
the Constitution, it is not necessary to enter upon any exercise for finding out the
wisdom in [sic. the policy decision of the State Government. It is immaterial whether
a better or more comprehensive policy decision could have] been taken. It is equally
immaterial if it can be demonstrated policy decision of the State Govt. It is
immaterial whether a better or more comprehensive policy decision could have been
taken. It is equally material if it can be demonstrated that the policy decision is
unwise and is likely to defeat the purpose for which such decision has been taken.
Unless the policy decision is demonstrably capricious or arbitrary and not informed
by any reason whatsoever or it suffers from the vice of discrimination or infringes any

State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
statute or provisions of the Constitution, the policy decision cannot be struck down.
It should be borne in mind that except for the limited purpose of testing a public
policy in the context of illegality and unconstitutionality, courts should avoid
"embarking on uncharted ocean of public policy".(cid:128) In the context of public policy in
public employment two more judgments are relevant for the purpose are
(i) S.Nagaraj Vrs. State of Karnataka reported in (1993) Supp. 4 SCC 595 and (ii)
Shrilekha Vidyarthi (Kumari) Vs. State of U.P. reported in (1991) 1 SCC
212.
71. In the present batch of writ applications, the predecessor in interest of the applicants die in
harness much prior to the new Rule, 2020 came into force. Although they had submitted their
respective applications in time, however, the authorities have failed to consider their cases for
appointment under OCS (RA) Rules, 1990 (as amended in the year 2016 wherever, the same is
applicable). This court further observed that it is a matter of record that while not considering the
case of the Petitioners, the authorities have considered and appointed persons who had applied
along with the petitioner or subsequent to the petitioner. No reasonable explanation is coming forth
from the side of Government-Opp. Parties as to why some persons were shown favour by appointing
them and the petitioners and many others were not appointed. Moreover, it has also not been
satisfactorily explained as to why the petitioners have been asked to apply under the Rules, 2020
which is unfavourable to them except the provision contained in Rule 6, sub-rule (9) of the Rules,
2020. The opposite parties have thus failed to come up with an intelligible differentia so far the class
of the present petitioners are concerned in contrast to the persons who have been appointed under a
more favourable Rule, 1990. Such conduct on the part of the opposite parties either rejecting the
petitioners application or asking some of them to apply afresh under the new Rule, 2020, which is
admittedly less favourable, is definitely discriminatory and arbitrary.
72. It would be profitable to refer to the words of S.R. Das, J, in State of W.B. Vs. Anwar Ali Sarkar
reported in 1952 SCR 284, which speaks that a classification is reasonable when the same satisfies
the twin test of:
(i) the classification must be based on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes
persons or things that are grouped, from others left out of the group; and
(ii) The differentia must have a rational relationship to the object sought to be
achieved by the statute.
Das, J. further observed that there must be some yardstick to differentiate the class included and the
others excluded from the group. The differentia used for the classification in the scheme is the total
extent of landholding by every individual. Therefore, there is a yardstick used for constituting the
class for the purpose of the scheme. By applying the aforesaid test to the facts of the present batch of
cases, this court found that there exists no intelligible differentia between the two groups i.e. the
ones who have been appointed under the old Rules, 1990 and the ones (the petitioners) whose cases
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 22
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
were kept pending and by operation of Rule 6(9) of the New Rules, 2020, their cases have been
taken out of the purview of the old Rules, 1990 which was more favourable and there was a certainty
of getting the job on compassionate ground. The background facts in both classes of persons
remains the same i.e. they are children or dependents of deceased Government employee who dies
in harness. Since the petitioners stand in a similar footing with the persons who have been given
appointment giving them preference over and above the petitioner, their cases deserve to be
considered under the old Rules, 1990 i.e. the Rule that was in force at the time of the death of the
Government employee."
7.7. The aforesaid matter in Biswajit Swain has been carried to Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special
Leave Petition (Civil) Diary No(s). 9245 of 2024. On 15.03.2024, the following Order was passed:
"Permission to file Special Leave Petition(s) is granted.
Delay condoned.
Issue notice.
Tag with SLP (C) No. 28521 of 2023."
7.8. Coming back to the instant case, it is apparent from the order of the learned Single Bench that
on death of the Government employee on 19.11.2017, though the application was submitted on
28.05.2018 (within the period stipulated under Rule 9(6) 5 of the Rules, 1990), the Order refusing
employment on compassionate ground was passed on 08.05.2023. Thus, there appears delay in
taking up the application for consideration of the case of the respondent. Due to delay in
consideration by the appellant-Additional Chief Engineer, in view of 5 Sub-rule (6) of Rule 9 of
Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 stood thus:
"Application for appointment under these rules shall be considered if it is received
within one year from the date of death of the Government servant."
the Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra), the benefit of RA Rules, 1990 cannot be denied to the respondent.
During pendency of consideration of application furnished under the Rules, 1990, another set of
rules, i.e., the RA Rules, 2020 came into force. In the said Rules, sub-rule (9) of Rule 6 was the bone
of contention, wherein it has been laid down that all pending applications were to be considered
under said new Rules. However, in Biswajit Swain (supra), such provision has been declared as ultra
vires. As is evinced from Annexure-3 enclosed to the writ appeal that the Hon'ble Supreme Court
while condoning the delay, issued notice. Nonetheless, in Suchitra Bal (supra) said provision has
been read down.
7.9. Since no stay of operation of the Judgment in Biswajit Swain (supra) has been granted, the
effect of judgment cannot be stated to have been ceased. The principle decided in Biswajit Swain
(supra), Bindusagar Samantaray (supra) and Suchitra Bal (supra) therein is applicable to the case at
hand by extending deference to the decision rendered in the context of the Odisha Civil Service
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193586529/ 23
State Of Odisha vs Wa No.1179 Of 2024 Page 1 Of 54 on 30 April, 2025
(Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990 vis-à-vis the Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance)
Rules, 2020 with particular reference to Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra). It may be worthwhile to take
note of the following enunciation of this Court in the case of Indera Motors Vrs. The Commissioner
of Commercial Taxes, CT and GST, Odisha, W.P.(C) No.6382 of 2025, vide Judgment dated
08.04.2025 (rendered by one of us, Hon'ble the Chief Justice Shri Harish Tandon):
"Whether the High Court was within its competence to direct the compensatory
interest to be levied on the assessee for the interregnum period between the date of
filing of the return and the judgment of the Apex Court, is a matter to be decided by
the Apex Court. Since there is no express order of stay of operation of the said order
and the petitioner being not an applicant in any of the special leave petitions pending
before the Supreme Court, we do not find any justification in extending the benefit of
the interim order at this stage. Furthermore, in order to bring equilibrium between
the rights of the parties, any deposit as demanded would subserve the justice as the
same would be subject to an outcome of the decision taken by the apex Court
provided it inure to the benefit of all the assessees whether they approached the apex
Court or not. We are conscious that because of the confusion having created in the
mind of the several assessees on the applicability of the interim order, we feel that an
opportunity should be given to the petitioner to deposit the said demand within two
months from today. Such deposit shall be without prejudice to the rights and
contentions of the parties."
7.10. Considering the present matter in the aforesaid light, it is quite clear, therefore, that the law
declared by the highest Court in the State is binding on authorities or Tribunals under its
superintendence, and that they cannot ignore it either in initiating a proceeding or deciding on the
rights involved in such a proceeding.
[See, East India Commercial Co. Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1893; Chowhan Machinery Mart Vrs. State of
Orissa, (2009) 19 VST 178 (Ori)].
7.11. As it transpires from close perusal of the record, the appellant No.3-Additional Chief Engineer
has delayed the matter in considering application dated 28.05.2018, taking cue from the principle
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Malaya Nanda Sethy (supra). It can safely be said that
the learned Single Bench was correct in its approach to direct the authority to consider the case of
the respondent in terms of Suchitra Bal (supra) and Bindusagar Samantaray (supra).
7.12. This Court is of the considered view that the Order dated 05.10.2023 of the learned Single
Bench suffers no illegality nor infirmity in law in view of principles stated in Suchitra Bal (Supra)
and Bindusagar Samantaray (Supra).
8. This Court is taken to have a look at another angle.
8.1. At the stage of the hearing of the present matter, learned counsel for the respondent brought to
the notice of this Court subsequent event. Though the matter relating to rendering sub-rule (9) of

Rule 6 of the Odisha Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 2020 ultra vires has been
pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Government of Odisha in General
Administration and Public Grievance Department vide Notification dated 4th April, 2025 (published
in Odisha Gazette Extraordinary No.818, Cuttack, dated 04.04.2025) promulgated the Odisha Civil

„distress condition(cid:128)."
(ii) The sub-rule (10) shall be omitted."
8.2. In the instant case, as the date of death of the Government employee was on 19.11.2017, i.e., on
or after commencement of the Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Amendment Rules,
2016, in terms of proviso to clause (a) of sub-rule (9) of Rule 6 as substituted by virtue of the Odisha
Civil Services (Rehabilitation Assistance) Amendment Rules, 2025, it is unequivocal and admit of no
doubt that the application dated 28.05.2018 submitted by the respondent shall be governed by the
provisions of the Odisha Civil Service (Rehabilitation Assistance) Rules, 1990.
