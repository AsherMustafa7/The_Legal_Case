2. Heard Sri. Udaya Holla, learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, learned AGA for
respondent No.1, learned counsel for respondent Nos.2 and 3 and learned counsel for respondent
No.4 and perused the material on record.
3. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the Memorandum of Petition and
referring to the documents produced by the petitioner, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner
submits that on 10.04.2020, petitioner-Institution obtained requisite affiliation from the Pharmacy
Council of India for B.Pharma and D.Pharma and also obtained permission from the State
Government on 13.10.2020 to start fresh B.Pharma Course for the academic year 2020-21. On
22.06.2021, the Local Inspection Committee of respondent Nos.2 and 3-RGUHS conducted
inspection of the petitioner-Institution on 22.06.2021. Subsequently, on 02.08.2021, petitioner
requested the RGUHS to increase/enhance the intake with regard to B.Pharma Courses for the
academic year 2021- 22 from 60 seats to 100 seats and also brought to their notice that the
petitioner had constructed a new building/campus at No.129/47, Kambayyanapalya, Jakkasandra
Post, Thyamagondlu Road, Nelamangala, Bengaluru, pursuant to which the Local Inspection
Committee conducted an inspection of the new campus/building and reported that the
petitioner-Institution possessed the required infrastructure and facilities for enhancement. In the
meanwhile, the affiliation for B.Pharma Course for the academic year 2021-22 was continued by the
RGUHS in favour of the petitioner.
3.1 Learned Senior counsel invited my attention to the material on record in order to point out that
despite the petitioner submitting a letter/representation on 09.03.2022 to RGUHS seeking
enhancement/increase of the intake for B.Pharma course for the academic year 2021-22, the
RGUHS neither took any steps to address the request of the petitioner nor placed the same before its
Syndicate. Instead, the RGUHS addressed a letter dated 01.04.2022 to the petitioner calling upon it
to furnish documents in relation to the land and building where the institution was being run and
for an explanation regarding the new building/campus of the petitioner referred to supra. The
petitioner submitted its reply dated 09.04.2022 along with all relevant documents and submitted
additional documents on 12.04.2022 to the RGUHS. Since RGUHS did not take necessary
steps/action on the request for increase in intake sought for by the petitioner for the academic year
2022-23, petitioner submitted representation dated 14.07.2022 requesting the RGUHS to place the
petitioner's application before the Syndicate and to take a decision in this regard expeditiously and
forward the same to the Government for appropriate action. It is the grievance of the petitioner that
despite the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the repeated requests made by the petitioner, its
application was not placed before the meeting of the Syndicate conducted/held on 16.07.2022 and
consequently, petitioner is before this Court by way of the present petition. It is submitted that since
the request of the petitioner for increase/enhancement of intake is pending for considerable length
of time as stated supra, if the respondents were to delay the matter any further, the petitioner would
not be entitled to increase in intake for the academic year 2022-23 also resulting in irreparable
injury and hardship to the petitioner and the students and justice would suffer. In support of his
contentions, learned Senior counsel placed reliance upon the following decisions:
1) Navodaya Medical College Vs. Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences and
others -

Harsha College Of Pharmacy vs The State Of Karnataka on 5 September, 2022
W.P.No.15341/2022 dated 16.08.2022.
2) Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre and another Vs. Rajiv Gandhi
University of Health Sciences and others - W.P.No.14961/2022 dated 16.08.2022.
3) MVJ Medical College and Research Hospital Vs. Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences and
others - W.P.No.16220/2022 dated 18.08.2022.
4. Per contra, learned AGA and learned counsel for the respondents submits that if reasonable time
is granted, they would address the grievances of the petitioner and take appropriate steps/decision
and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.
5. The material on record clearly discloses that despite repeated requests made by the petitioner
seeking enhancement/increase in the intake of students for B.Pharma Course from 60 students to
100 students coupled with the fact that the Local Inspection Committee of the RGUHS has
submitted its report to the effect that the petitioner possesses all infrastructural requirements and
facilities, the delay and inaction on the part of the RGUHS to place the request/application of the
petitioner before its Syndicate and take appropriate decision and forward the same to the State
Government has resulted in prejudice being caused to the petitioner and as such, I deem it just and
appropriate to allow the petition and direct the respondents to take appropriate steps/action in this
regard at the earliest, within a stipulated timeframe.
6. In the result, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) The petition is hereby allowed.
(ii) Respondent Nos.2 and 3 - RGUHS is directed to convene a meeting of its
syndicate for the purpose of considering the application of the petitioner-Institution
for increase in intake for B.Pharma Course for the academic year 2022-
23 and take a decision in this regard forthwith and at any rate on or before 09.09.2022, in
accordance with law bearing in mind the material on record produced by the petitioner in the
present petition and the principles referred to in the decisions of this Court referred to supra.
(iii) It is further directed that immediately upon taking a decision as stated supra, respondent Nos.2
and 3 shall forward the same to the State forthwith without any delay and pursuant to the same, the
State Government shall also take an appropriate decision forthwith in accordance with law and
without any delay on or before 15.09.2022.
