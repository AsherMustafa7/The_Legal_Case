1989, Annexure-E, so far as the petitioner herein concerned.

3. The facts in both the matters are the same. The facts are:
3.1. The petitioners in both these petitions and respondent No.2 who is a complainant
are stated to be residents and owners of apartment in Kailash apartments
constructed by the BDA.
The owners of the various apartments have subjected the development to the provisions of
Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972 (for short 'KAOA') by executing a deed of declaration
dated 16.10.2015 which is C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 registered with the office of the Senior Sub-
registrar, Jayanagar.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 4
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
3.2. It is contended that the affairs of the said apartment is run by an Association formed under
Deed of declaration in terms of the bye- laws forming part of the Deed of declaration. 3.3. There are
office bearers who are elected to the Executive committee of the Association viz., [for short
'Association']. The governing council of the Association consists of 31 members including 9 office
bearers or members of the Executive Committee, all of who are nominated or elected by the
governing body. The governing council having two members from each block, there being 11 blocks,
the governing council and the Executive Committee is in-charge of the day-today affairs of the
Association and the executive committee C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 comprising of 9 office bearers
viz., President, Vice-President, Secretary, 4 Joint Secretaries, Treasurer and a Joint Treasurer, who
would exercise powers and perform all duties for the proper administration of the Association. One
of the powers and duties being in terms of Rule 3(i) of the Rules as under:
"3(i) Collect the monthly assessments towards common expenses, contributions
towards Sinking Fund, corpus Fund, and Application Fee, Membership Fee and any
other payments and contributions/assessments from the Owners/ members."
3.4. Thus, these amounts which are collected are used for the purpose of monthly upkeep of the
Apartment complex. In terms of bye-law (6), if there is any default/defaults, the defaulter shall be
disqualified and the Executive committee could terminate the common amenities and facilities and
services to that particular C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 apartment which is reproduced hereunder
for easy reference:
"6. Disqualification:
a) A member, who has not paid the assessments or ad-hoc assessments of regular
nature beyond 90 days from the due date, will be treated as a "DEFAULTER" and
may result in termination of common amenities, facilities, services and utilities to the
said member and his Apartment, after notice of ten days. Display of defaulter's names
in the Notice Board and/or on the outside walls of their respective Apartments may
also be made as per the decision of the Executive Committee. To reinstate the usage
of common amenities and facilities & Services, the member has to clear all past dues
with interest and of restoration charges.
The restoration charges will be as decided by the Governing Council.
b) Defaulters are not entitled to vote in any of the meetings of the Association.
c) Defaulters are not eligible to be/continue to be as a member of the Management Committees or
any other committee.
3.5. It is on account of respondent No.2 having defaulted in payment of the assessments and
maintenance charges, by exercising power under bye-law (6), the Executive Committee C/W WP
No.27468 OF 2019 had disconnected the common services and utilities including electricity to the
Apartment of respondent No.2, which has resulted in respondent No.2 filing criminal complaint and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 5
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
it is in that background the petitioners in both the petitions are before this Court seeking for
quashing of the complaint.
4. Sri. Sandesh J.Chouta, learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioners would submit that:
4.1. Respondent No.2 is in arrears of monthly maintenance, as a result of which
several notices were issued when the monthly maintenance was not paid, repeated
follow up was made by the office bearers of the Association, respondent No.2
threatened the Association and its office bearers with dire consequences. Respondent
No.2 claiming to belong to Schedule Caste had filed several false
- 10 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 complaints before the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, State Human
Rights Commission and Karnataka State Commission for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
alleging that respondent No.2 was being targeted on account of his caste.
4.2. Respondent No.2 also filed a private complaint on 26.12.2018 under Section 200 of Code of
Criminal Procedure ['Cr.P.C.' for short] against the petitioners in both the matters and others for
investigation into the offences under Section 120-B, mischief, nuisance and criminal conspiracy in
illegally disconnecting the power supply to the complainant's flat, as also under Section 3(1)(x) of
the Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 [for short 'POA Act']
alleging that on three occasions i.e. on 15.04.2018, 21.10.2018 and 22.12.2018 electricity connection
to the
- 11 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 apartment of respondent No.2 was disconnected without notice to him
citing non- payment of monthly maintenance, due to which respondent No.2 and his wife suffered
mental and financial losses and alleges that BESCOM officers are acting at the behest of the
Association members, despite respondent No.2 having made payment of electricity to the BESCOM
authorities, the BESCOM Authorities are harassing respondent No.2.
4.3. The office bearers of the Association are targeting respondent No.2. Allegations were made with
regard to there being no transparency in the day-today account maintenance and the petitioner No.1
has been using areas which are not meant for parking. 4.4. Respondent No.2 was alleged to be facing
severe hardship and mental agony due to illegal
- 12 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 disconnection of electricity. His wife who is pursuing PhD was unable
to use her laptop to carryout research and respondent No.2 could not prepare himself properly and
take up All India Bar Council Examination conducted by the Bar Council of India.

Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
4.5. On this basis, action was requested to be taken against the petitioners and other accused for the
aforesaid offences.
4.6. Learned Senior counsel submits that Special Court mechanically directed the jurisdictional
Asst. Commissioner of Police to register the case already referred, as a result of which, FIR in Crime
No.82/2019 was registered by Kengeri Police Station, Bengaluru for the offences punishable under
Section 3(1)(g), 3(1)(p), 3(1)(q), 3(1)(u), 3(1)(z), 3(1)(zc), 3(2)(va) and Section 4 of the POA Act. A
reading of the
- 13 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 allegations in complaint and FIR do not prima facie constitute any
offence or make out any case against the petitioners. The complaint is malafide and vexatious one
which has been filed as a counter blast to the demand made by the Association for payment of
maintenance charges. By making use of the complaint, respondent No.2 has successfully defaulted
in making payment of the maintenance charges which has an adverse impact on the other residents
of the Apartment complex. 4.7. Registration of complaint under POA Act is completely
impermissible, inasmuch as though the respondent No.2 may belong to Scheduled Caste, no offence
under the said Act has been committed. The only demand made was for payment of maintenance
amounts, which respondent No.2 from time to time agreed to make payment and it is only on
account of non-
- 14 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 payment of the electricity charges, electricity was disconnected, this he
submits cannot be a reason to invoke and/or make applicable POA Act.
4.8. Respondent No.2 has abused and misused the provisions of POA Act to achieve his nefarious
objective inasmuch as, there is no particular incident which is attributable to the petitioners which
would constitute an offence under the POA Act. The complaint is completely malafide, vengeful and
has been filed only to default in payment of maintenance charges. The private complaint filed is in
violation of the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court. He relies upon the decision in Priyanka
Srivastava v. State of U.P., [(2015) 6 SCC 287], more particularly paragraphs 22, 30 and 31, which
are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
- 15 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019
22. In Anil Kumar v. M.K. Aiyappa [(2013) 10 SCC 705 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 35] , the
two-Judge Bench had to say this : (SCC p. 711, para 11) "11. The scope of Section
156(3) CrPC came up for consideration before this Court in several cases. This Court
in Maksud Saiyed [Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, (2008) 5 SCC 668 :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 7
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
(2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 692] examined the requirement of the application of mind by the
Magistrate before exercising jurisdiction under Section 156(3) and held that where
jurisdiction is exercised on a complaint filed in terms of Section 156(3) or Section
200 CrPC, the Magistrate is required to apply his mind, in such a case, the Special
Judge/Magistrate cannot refer the matter under Section 156(3) against a public
servant without a valid sanction order. The application of mind by the Magistrate
should be reflected in the order. The mere statement that he has gone through the
complaint, documents and heard the complainant, as such, as reflected in the order,
will not be sufficient. After going through the complaint, documents and hearing the
complainant, what weighed with the Magistrate to order investigation under Section
156(3) CrPC, should be reflected in the order, though a detailed expression of his
views is neither required nor warranted. We have already extracted the order passed
by the learned Special Judge which, in our view, has stated no reasons for ordering
investigation."
30. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this country where Section 156(3) CrPC
applications are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks the
invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart, in an appropriate case, the learned
- 16 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth and also can verify
the veracity of the allegations. This affidavit can make the applicant more responsible. We are
compelled to say so as such kind of applications are being filed in a routine manner without taking
any responsibility whatsoever only to harass certain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing
and alarming when one tries to pick up people who are passing orders under a statutory provision
which can be challenged under the framework of the said Act or under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. But it cannot be done to take undue advantage in a criminal court as if
somebody is determined to settle the scores.
31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior applications under Sections 154(1) and
154(3) while filing a petition under Section 156(3). Both the aspects should be clearly spelt out in the
application and necessary documents to that effect shall be filed. The warrant for giving a direction
that an application under Section 156(3) be supported by an affidavit is so that the person making
the application should be conscious and also endeavour to see that no false affidavit is made. It is
because once an affidavit is found to be false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance with
law. This will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate under Section 156(3). That
apart, we have already stated that the veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned
Magistrate, regard being had to the nature of allegations of the case. We are compelled to say so as a
number of cases pertaining to fiscal sphere, matrimonial dispute/family disputes, commercial
offences, medical negligence cases, corruption cases and the cases where there is abnormal
delay/laches in
- 17 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 8
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 initiating criminal prosecution, as are illustrated in Lalita Kumari
[(2014) 2 SCC 1 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 524] are being filed. That apart, the learned Magistrate would
also be aware of the delay in lodging of the FIR.
4.9. Relying on the above, he submits that the private complaint filed is in violation of the above
Judgment, inasmuch as there is no affidavit enclosed along with the said complaint, as also there are
no averments made in the private complaint as regards the petitioner having approached the Station
House Officer for registration of the complaint and thereafter having approached the superior
officer for registration of a complaint. The present complaint is one more complaint in a long line of
complaints filed by respondent No.2 to harass the office bearers of the Association. 4.10. He relies
upon the decision of the Apex Court in Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra
reported in [(2018) 6 SCC
- 18 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 454], more particularly para 30 which is reproduced hereunder for
easy reference:
Submissions of the learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG)
30. The learned ASG submitted that in view of the decisions in Balothia [State of M.P.
v. Ram Kishna Balothia, (1995) 3 SCC 221 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 439] and Manju Devi
[Manju Devi v. Onkarjit Singh Ahluwalia, (2017) 13 SCC 439 : (2017) 4 SCC (Cri)
662] there is no occasion to go into the issue of validity of the provisions of the
Atrocities Act.
He also submitted that the decisions of this Court in Vilas Pandurang Pawar v. State of Maharashtra
[Vilas Pandurang Pawar v. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 8 SCC 795 : (2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 1062] and
Shakuntla Devi v. Baljinder Singh [Shakuntla Devi v. Baljinder Singh, (2014) 15 SCC 521 : (2015) 4
SCC (Cri) 682] permit grant of anticipatory bail if no prima facie case is made out. Thus, in genuine
cases anticipatory bail can be granted. He also submitted that the Government of India had issued
advisories on 3-2-2005, 1-4-2010 and 23- 5-2016 and also further amended the Atrocities Act vide
Amendment Act 1 of 2016 which provides for creation of Special Courts as well as Exclusive Special
Courts. Referring to the data submitted by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) it was
further submitted that out of the total number of complaints investigated by the police in the year
2015, both for the persons belonging to the SC category and also belonging to the ST category, in
almost 15-16% cases, the competent police authorities had filed closure reports. Out of the cases
disposed of by the courts in 2015, more than 75% cases have resulted in
- 19 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 acquittal/withdrawal or compounding of the cases. It was submitted
that certain complaints were received alleging misuse of the Atrocities Act and a question was also
raised in Parliament as to what punishment should be given against false cases. The reply given was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 9
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
that awarding punishment to members of SCs and STs for false implication would be against the
spirit of the Act. A press statement dated 19-3-2015 was issued by the Central Government to the
effect that in case of false cases, relevant sections of IPC can be invoked. It was submitted that no
guideline should be laid down by this Court which may be legislative in nature.
4.11. Learned counsel submits that directions under Section 156(3) could only be issued to an officer
incharge of police station and not to a specific officer muchless the Asst. Commissioner of Police and
therefore, the order of the Special Court directing enquiry is bad in law. In support of the above
argument, he relies upon the decision in CBI v. State of Rajasthan, [(2001) 3 SCC 333] more
particularly para No. 1, 11, 16 and 17, which are extracted hereunder for easy reference:
- 20 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019
1. Has a Magistrate power to direct the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct
investigation into any offence? This question, seemingly ingenuous, has become
compounded with divergent verdicts pronounced by different High Courts. While the
High Courts of Rajasthan and Delhi answered the question in the affirmative, the
High Courts of Gujarat and Karnataka have answered it in the negative. These
appeals are filed at the instance of the Central Bureau of Investigation (for short
"CBI") in challenge of the judgments of the High Courts of Rajasthan and Delhi by
which the orders passed by certain Magistrates were upheld.
11. This means any other police officer, who is superior in rank to an officer in charge
of a police station, can exercise the same powers of the officer in charge of a police
station and when he so exercises the power he would do it in his capacity as officer in
charge of the police station.
But when a Magistrate orders investigation under Section 156(3), he can only direct an officer in
charge of a police station to conduct such investigation and not a superior police officer, though
such officer can exercise such powers by virtue of Section 36 of the Code. Nonetheless, when such an
order is passed, any police officer superior in rank of such officer, can as well exercise the power to
conduct an investigation, and all such investigations would then be deemed to be the investigation
conducted by the officer in charge of a police station. Section 36 of the Code is not meant to
substitute the magisterial power envisaged in Section 156(3) of the Code, though it could
supplement the powers of an officer in charge of a police station. It is permissible for any superior
officer of police to take over the investigation from such officer in charge of the
- 21 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 police station either suo motu or on the direction of the superior officer
or even that of the Government.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 10
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
16. As the present discussion is restricted to the question whether a Magistrate can direct CBI to
conduct investigation in exercise of his powers under Section 156(3) of the Code it is unnecessary for
us to travel beyond the scope of that issue. We, therefore, reiterate that the magisterial power cannot
be stretched under the said sub-section beyond directing the officer in charge of a police station to
conduct the investigation.
17. The appeals are accordingly allowed and the impugned orders of the Magistrates as well as the
judgments of the High Court are hereby set aside. But this would not prejudice any investigation to
be conducted on the FIR registered or to be registered by the police station concerned in respect of
the complaints involved in these appeals.
4.12. The Special Court has in a mechanical manner referred the matter for investigation without
appreciating whether there is indeed an offence which has been made out or not. Thus, he submits is
in violation of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Maksud Saiyed v. State of
Gujarat, [(2008) 5 SCC 668],
- 22 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 more particularly para No.13, which is extracted hereunder for easy
reference:
13. Where a jurisdiction is exercised on a complaint petition filed in terms of Section
156(3) or Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Magistrate is required
to apply his mind. The Penal Code does not contain any provision for attaching
vicarious liability on the part of the Managing Director or the Directors of the
Company when the accused is the Company. The learned Magistrate failed to pose
unto himself the correct question viz. as to whether the complaint petition, even if
given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety, would lead to the conclusion
that the respondents herein were personally liable for any offence. The Bank is a body
corporate. Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and Director would arise
provided any provision exists in that behalf in the statute.
Statutes indisputably must contain provision fixing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said
purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations which would
attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability.
4.13. In this regard, he also relies upon the Judgment in Anil Kumar v. M.K. Aiyappa [(2013) 10 SCC
thereof, which are extracted hereunder for easy reference:
- 23 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 "10. We may first examine whether the Magistrate, while
exercising his powers under Section 156(3) CrPC, could act in a mechanical or casual
manner and go on with the complaint after getting the report.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 11
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
11. The scope of Section 156(3) CrPC came up for consideration before this Court in
several cases. This Court in Maksud Saiyed case [(2008) 5 SCC 668 : (2008) 2 SCC
(Cri) 692] examined the requirement of the application of mind by the Magistrate
before exercising jurisdiction under Section 156(3) and held that where jurisdiction is
exercised on a complaint filed in terms of Section 156(3) or Section 200 CrPC, the
Magistrate is required to apply his mind, in such a case, the Special Judge/Magistrate
cannot refer the matter under Section 156(3) against a public servant without a valid
sanction order. The application of mind by the Magistrate should be reflected in the
order. The mere statement that he has gone through the complaint, documents and
heard the complainant, as such, as reflected in the order, will not be sufficient. After
going through the complaint, documents and hearing the complainant, what weighed
with the Magistrate to order investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC, should be
reflected in the order, though a detailed expression of his views is neither required
nor warranted. We have already extracted the order passed by the learned Special
Judge which, in our view, has stated no reasons for ordering investigation."
4.14. Learned counsel submits that if the Special Court had applied its mind to the
facts of the case, the Special Court could have only come to
- 24 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 a conclusion that the dispute is civil in nature inasmuch as the
maintenance amount had not been paid resulting in disconnection of electricity which is permissible
as per the Deed of Declaration and as such, the Special Court could not have referred the matter for
investigation. In this regard, he relies upon the decision in Thermax Ltd. -vs- K.M.Johny reported in
[(2011) 3 SCC 412] more particularly para No.34 thereof, which is extracted hereunder for easy
reference:
"34. The principles enunciated from the above quoted decisions clearly show that for
proceeding under Section 156(3) of the Code, the complaint must disclose relevant
material ingredients of Sections 405, 406, 420 read with Section 34 IPC. If there is a
flavour of civil nature, the same cannot be agitated in the form of criminal
proceeding. If there is huge delay and in order to avoid the period of limitation, it
cannot be resorted to as a criminal proceeding."
4.15. He submits that respondent No.2 having suppressed the material facts, the petitioners
- 25 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 have produced the correspondence between the Association and
respondent No.2, as also the statement given by respondent No.2 agreeing to make payment of due
maintenance amounts. 4.16. These documents can be looked into even in a proceeding under
Section 482 since they would go into the root of the matter. In this regard, he relies upon the
decision in Prashant Bharti v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2013) 9 SCC 293], more particularly para

No.22 thereof which is extracted hereunder for easy reference:
22. The proposition of law, pertaining to quashing of criminal proceedings, initiated
against an accused by a High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (hereinafter referred to as "CrPC") has been dealt with by this Court in
Rajiv Thapar v. Madan Lal Kapoor [Rajiv Thapar v. Madan Lal Kapoor, (2013) 3 SCC
330 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 158] wherein this Court inter alia held as under: (SCC pp.
347-49, paras 29-30) "29. The issue being examined in the instant case is the
jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 CrPC, if it chooses to quash the
initiation of the prosecution against an accused at the stage of issuing
- 26 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 process, or at the stage of committal, or even at the stage of framing of
charges.
These are all stages before the commencement of the actual trial. The same parameters would
naturally be available for later stages as well. The power vested in the High Court under Section 482
CrPC, at the stages referred to hereinabove, would have far-reaching consequences, inasmuch as it
would negate the prosecution's/complainant's case without allowing the prosecution/complainant
to lead evidence. Such a determination must always be rendered with caution, care and
circumspection. To invoke its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC the High Court has to be
fully satisfied that the material produced by the accused is such that would lead to the conclusion
that his/their defence is based on sound, reasonable, and indubitable facts; the material produced is
such as would rule out and displace the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the
accused; and the material produced is such as would clearly reject and overrule the veracity of the
allegations contained in the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant. It should be
sufficient to rule out, reject and discard the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant,
without the necessity of recording any evidence. For this the material relied upon by the defence
should not have been refuted, or alternatively, cannot be justifiably refuted, being material of
sterling and impeccable quality. The material relied upon by the accused should be such as would
persuade
- 27 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the actual basis of the
accusations as false. In such a situation, the judicial conscience of the High Court would persuade it
to exercise its power under Section 482 CrPC to quash such criminal proceedings, for that would
prevent abuse of process of the court, and secure the ends of justice.
30. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate the following
steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashing raised by an accused by invoking the power
vested in the High Court under Section 482 CrPC:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 13
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
30.1. Step one: whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable,
and indubitable i.e. the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?
30.2. Step two: whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out the
assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused i.e. the material is
sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint i.e.
the material is such as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn
the factual basis of the accusations as false?
30.3. Step three: whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been
refuted by the prosecution/complainant;
and/or the material is such that it cannot be justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant?
- 28 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 30.4. Step four: whether proceeding with the trial would result in an
abuse of process of the court, and would not serve the ends of justice?
30.5. If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, judicial conscience of the High Court should
persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings in exercise of power vested in it under Section 482
CrPC. Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious court time,
which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as proceedings arising therefrom)
specially when it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the accused."
4.17. He submits that none of the ingredients under Section 3(1)(g) of the POA Act have been
satisfied and in this regard he relies upon the decision of this Court in Criminal Petition No.80/2021
dated 4.10.2021 [Sri Lokanath, vs. State of Karnataka and another], more particularly para 11
thereof, which is extracted hereunder:
"11. Then so far as the offence under Section 3(1)(g) of the Act is concerned, the
essential ingredient is wrongful dispossession or wrongful interference. There is no
material indicating
- 29 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 wrongful dispossession of second respondent from his
land or wrongful interference with his land. If the premise of the litigation is seen, it
is nothing more than a dispute between two adjacent land owners; it is pertinent to
mention here that the petitioner disputes the very identity of the second respondent's
land and therefore, a competent Civil Court can alone take a decision in this regard.
For this reason Section 3(1)(g) is also not attracted."

4.18. He submits that most of the grounds enunciated in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, [1992 Supp
(1) SCC 335] would be applicable to the present case requiring quashing of the criminal proceedings,
more particularly para No.10 and 22 thereof which is extracted hereunder for easy reference:
10. At the same time, one should also be alive to cases where false and frivolous
accusations of corruption are maliciously made against an adversary exposing him to
social ridicule and obloquy with an ulterior motive of wreaking vengeance due to past
animosity or personal pique or merely out of spite regardless of the fact whether the
proceedings will ultimately culminate into conviction or not.
22. Initially three separate written statements were filed before the High Court, one
by Inspector Kartar Singh (on behalf of the State of Haryana, the SP and SHO who
were respondents 1, 3 and 4 in the writ petition and who are the appellants
- 30 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 herein); another by respondent 2 Shri Devi Lal (who is the third pro
forma respondent in this appeal) and the third one by respondent 5 in the writ petition (who is the
complainant and respondent 2 in this appeal). Subsequently realising that Kartar Singh was not
competent to file the written statement on behalf of the State, SP and SHO in terms of the Rules of
Business, separate written statements one by the then SP Lekhi Ram and another by Inspector Tara
Chand (who registered the case) were filed on July 14, 1988. However, no written statement was
filed on behalf of the State of Haryana. The High Court before which several contentions were raised
by the respective parties examined each of the allegations in detail in the light of the explanatory
and denial statement which according to the High Court has not been either explained or denied by
the State and rejected the plea of the appellants 2 and 3 submitting that it is wholly premature to say
anything with regard to the truthfulness or otherwise of the allegations and observed as follows:
1. "... it is clear that the allegations made are just imaginary and fantastic."
2. "... his (respondent 2 Dharam Pal) sole object in putting complaint Annexure P-9
was to set the machinery of the criminal law in motion against the petitioner without
verifying the truth or otherwise of his own allegations before levelling them against
the petitioner in the complaint Annexure P-9 and that he was solely depending upon
the fishing enquiry which may be undertaken by the police in the course of its
investigation without being himself possessed or known to or seen any material or
documents justifying his allegations of benami purchases, or under valuation of
property allegedly purchased by the petitioner."

3. "Allegations obtaining in Annexure P-9 are, therefore, the outcome of a desperate, frustrated
mind ...."
4. "Irresponsible manner in which indiscriminate allegations have been levelled by Dharam Pal,
respondent 5 against the petitioner in Annexure P-9 is patent from the assertions made in respect of
benami ownership of house No. 1028, Friends Colony, New Delhi by the petitioner."
5. "Respondent 5 appears to have made these allegations only to curry favour with respondent 2 and
to avenge his own insult of defeat in elections against the petitioner's wife. The charges levelled in
the complaint Annexure P-9 by respondent 5 against the petitioner are, therefore, all groundless."
6. "It was only the SP Lekhi Ram and the Inspector Tara Chand both of whom filed their individual
written statements on July 14, 1988 more than eight months after the filing of the writ in December
1987, who tried to be more loyal to the king than the king himself and in turn respectively ordered
the registration of the case against the petitioner and proceeded to the spot (God knows which one
and for what purpose) with duly armed constabulary. Mala fides, if at all these can be attributed are
attributable to SP Lekhi Ram and Inspector Tara Chand but not to Chaudhary Devi Lal, Chief
Minister Haryana arrayed as respondent 2 in the writ petition."
4.19. Hence, learned Senior counsel submits that the above petition may be allowed.

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019
5. Sri.K.S.Ravikumar, the complainant who has appeared as party in-person submitted as under:
5.1. Respondent No.2 is an advocate belonging to Schedule Caste community,
residing in the flat since March 2015. The complainant being a person belonging the
Schedule caste and he being allotted an apartment under the Scheduled caste
reservation category is being targeted. He submits that 50% flats are allotted to
general category and 50% are allotted to reservation category, Apartment being
developed by the BDA, it is a government apartment complex and as such, the same
could not have been made subject to KAOA. It is the higher caste groups who have
misled the residents of the Kailash Apartment owners to subject the apartment
complex under KAOA, fraudulently obtained their signatures and
- 33 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 thereafter started extorting huge maintenance charges from the
residents.
5.2. He submits that within three months of occupying the apartment, problems started for him that
he being targeted on account of being a person of scheduled caste, the tyres of his motorcycle were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 16
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
deflated, dustbin contents were scattered, the spark plug of his motorcycle were disconnected, etc.
and it is in that background that the office bearers of the Association have conspired together to
show the complainant in bad light and to bring disrepute to him. He has been having problems with
parking his motorcycle since his parking slot has been used by other apartment owners, when he
had brought the same to the notice of the then president of the Association Sri.Ramanjaneyalu,
instead of solving the same, he had abused the complainant and
- 34 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Sri.Ramanjaneyalu had sent an e-mail to the apartment owners
referring to the complainant as hooligan, uncivilized, filthy and unruly only because he belongs to
the scheduled caste. 5.3. The complainant though filed a complaint on 4.01.2008 with Kengeri
police, no action was taken on the same. The complainant attended the Association meeting on
1.4.2018 when he was allegedly verbally abused by certain of the members viz., Ramaiah,
M.P.Nagaraj, Sachin, Surendra and others who also threatened him. 5.4. Upon accused No.2
becoming the president of the Association, he states that accused No.2 along with others criminally
conspired to harass the complainant and his family by illegally disconnecting electricity supply to
the complainant's flat. Hence, he had called the BESCOM customer care on several occasions to
- 35 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 restore the electricity connection. When jurisdictional personnel did
not initiate any action, he made a representation to the higher officials of the BESCOM, who refused
to take action against the accused since they are influential persons. It is in that background, the
complainant filed a private complaint in PCR No.68/2018 on 26.12.2018 which came to be referred
to the Kengeri Police station for investigation.
5.5. He submits that petitioners are not entitled for anticipatory bail on account of the petitioners
have endangered the life of the complainant and his family. There is a ban under Section 18-A of the
POA (Amendment) Act, as amended in the year 2018 from granting anticipatory bail. The
complainant has only set the law into motion by filing a private complaint as regards the repeated
atrocities committed on him.
- 36 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 5.6. The apartment complex having been constructed by the BDA, same
could not have been subjected to the KAOA and Rules. The title of the property vests with the BDA
which is a government organisation. Mere registration of Deed of Declaration would not create an
Association. Bye-laws have not received the assent of any public authority and as such, the
complainant is not bound by the same. 5.7. He submits that he is not required to make payment of
any charges towards common amenities. If at all the respondents can disconnect common lights
etc., and not provide any common services to the complainant since complainant is not interested in
obtaining such common services, the complainant is only concerned with his apartment and happy
to be residing in his own apartment as regards which he has made payment of electricity dues.

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 5.8. He submits that police and the BESCOM authorities are hand in
glove with the office bearers of the Association as regards which he has filed a complaint against the
BESCOM officials with the higher officials. Electricity is an essential service and forms the human
right and fundamental right to live and as such, the disconnection of electricity by the petitioner
requires stringent action against them. It is the obligation of this Court to protect the respondent
No.2 from said disconnection of electricity when he has paid electricity bill to the BESCOM on
separate meter being installed. He does not intend to make payment of any amount as regards
common amenities as that has nothing to do with the supply of electricity to his apartment.

DISTRICT COLLECTOR REPORTED IN LAWS (MAD)-
- 38 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 2013 (9) 175, more particularly para 66, 67, 68, 70 and 87 thereof,
which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
66. Lack of electricity supply is one of the determinative factors, affecting education,
health, cause for economic disparity and consequently, inequality in the society,
leading to poverty.
Electricity supply is an aid to get information and knowledge. Children without electricity supply
cannot even imagine to compete with others, who have the supply. Women have to struggle with
firewood, kerosine, in the midst of smoke. Air pollution causes lung diseases and respiratory
problems. Electricity supply to the poor, supports education and if it is coupled with suitable
employment, disparity is reduced to certain extent. Lack of education and poverty result in child
labour.
67. When right to education upto the age of 14 years is a fundamental right, when right to health is
also recognised as a right to life, under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, access to electricity
supply should also be considered as a right to life, in terms of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
The respondents ought to have addressed all the issues, instead of banking on the Committee's
decision, which in the humble opinion of this Court, is not in aid of human right, but inapposite to
the need for, providing the basic amenity, electricity. The authorities ought to have considered,
whether it would be effective enforcement of Article 21 or Article 21-A of the Constitution of India,
while denying the petitioners, access to electricity supply.
68. The respondents ought to have visualised the difficulties of the women, children and aged
persons, living in the huts for several years, without electricity. Electricity supply is an essential and
important factor for achieving socio-economic rights,

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 to achieve the constitutional goals with sustainable development and
reduction of poverty, which encompasses lower standards of living, affects education, health,
sanitation and many aspects of life. Food, shelter and clothing alone may be sufficient to have a
living. But it should be a meaningful purpose. Lack of electricity denies a person to have equal
opportunities in the matter of education and consequently, suitable employment, health, sanitation
and other socio-economic rights. Without providing the same, the constitutional goals, like Justice,
Liberty, Equality and Fraternity cannot be achieved.
70. Access to electricity should be construed as a human right, of course, to the requirements to be
satisfied under the electricity laws. Denial of the same, upon even satisfying the requirements,
would amount to violation of human rights. The action of the respondents is regressive. Electricity
supply under the Electricity Act, the Distribution and Supply Code, is a legal right. At this juncture,
this Court deems it fit to consider the meaning of the word, 'right' and few decisions, as to when a
Mandamus, can be sought for,
87. It is the fundamental duty of the respondents to show compassion to those who are living in huts
and tenements for long number of years, taking into consideration their socio-economic disabilities,
without electricity supply for many years. Preamble to the Constitution of India guarantees right of
every person to justice, social, economic and political. When socio and economic justice is the
mandate of the Constitution of India, it is a traversity of justice to deny electricity to the petitioners.
Income is one of the sources for achieving an egalitarian society and it is the fundamental right to
decent living. Providing electricity to the poor, subject to the satisfying conditions, as per the
electricity laws, would
- 40 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 reduce the economic imbalance and help the under privileged. The
authorities should be pragmatic and realistic to the constitutional goals. The weaker sections and
under privileged do not crave, in their heart, for power in hierarchical positions, they only want
electric power to have "lighting" in their house. Hut dwellers cannot expect and afford luxury. But
for them, it is only a basic amenity. Electricity supply should, not only be extended to pattadars or
the owners of lands, but it should also be extended to the poor and the needy, who live in
government poromboke lands, when they substantiate occupation, for a considerable period. 5.10.

STATE OF UP [(1996) 2 SCC 549], more particularly para
- 41 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 8 thereof, which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
8. In any organised society, right to live as a human being is not ensured by meeting
only the animal needs of man. It is secured only when he is assured of all facilities to
develop himself and is freed from restrictions which inhibit his growth. All human
rights are designed to achieve this object.
Right to live guaranteed in any civilised society implies the right to food, water, decent environment,
education, medical care and shelter. These are basic human rights known to any civilised society. All
civil, political, social and cultural rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and Convention or under the Constitution of India cannot be exercised without these basic human
rights. Shelter for a human being, therefore, is not a mere protection of his life and limb. It is home
where he has opportunities to grow physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually. Right to
shelter, therefore, includes adequate living space, safe and decent structure, clean and decent
surroundings, sufficient light, pure air and water, electricity, sanitation and other civic amenities
like roads etc. so as to have easy access to his daily avocation. The right to shelter, therefore, does
not mean a mere right to a roof over one's head but right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable
them to live and develop as a human being. Right to shelter when used as an essential requisite to
the right to live should be deemed to have been guaranteed as a fundamental right. As is enjoined in
the Directive Principles, the State should be deemed to be under at obligation to secure it for its
citizens, of course subject to its economic budgeting. In a democratic society as a member of the
organised civic community one should have permanent shelter so as to physically, mentally and
intellectually equip oneself to improve his excellence as a useful citizen as enjoined in the
- 42 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Fundamental Duties and to be a useful citizen and equal participant in
democracy. The ultimate object of making a man equipped with a right to dignity of person and
equality of status is to enable him to develop himself into a cultured being. Want of decent
residence, therefore, frustrates the very object of the constitutional animation of right to equality,
economic justice, fundamental right to residence, dignity of person and right to live itself. To bring
the Dalits and Tribes into the mainstream of national life, providing these facilities and
opportunities to them is the duty of the State as fundamental to their basic human and
constitutional rights 5.12. He relies upon the decision of Gauhati High Court in Abdul Rehman vs.
Assistant Executive Engineer [CRP No. 211/2009] "Electricity is an essential requirement for any
occupied premises and if a occupier is threatened with disconnection of power, it certainly amounts
to invasion of the right of the complainant to fully enjoy the property occupied legitimately, by the
complainant."

5.13. He submits that disconnection of electricity is governed in terms of Electricity Act, 2003 and
the Association cannot disconnect electricity to his apartment. Disconnection of electricity is a
criminal offence and in this particular matter, disconnection being on account of the
- 43 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 complainant belonging to the schedule caste, the same is an offence in
terms of Section 3(1)(g) of the POA Act, which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
3(1)(g) wrongfully dispossesses a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe
from his land or premises or interferes with the enjoyment of his rights, including
forest rights, over any land or premises or water or irrigation facilities or destroys the

5.14. He relies upon the decision of Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh High Court in Ramesh
Thakur vs Roshini Chauhan reported in 2019 SCC Online HP 1135, more particularly
para 6 and 7 which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
6. Bearing in mind the aforesaid exposition of law, it would be noticed that admittedly the electricity
supply to the premises let out to the tenant had been disconnected by the landlord on the ground of
non-payment of such charges.
7. Even though there appears to be some dispute regarding rate of rent, but that by itself was not
sufficient ground and could not have been made the
- 44 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 basis for the landlord to disconnect the electricity supply to the
premises let out to the tenant. Further ground on the basis of which, electricity was disconnected
was that the tenant had failed to pay the electricity charges. Even this fact by itself would not be a
sufficient ground to disconnect the electricity supply, more particularly, when it has been proved on
record that there is sub-meter installed in the premises. Once that be the admitted position, then
obviously non-payment of the amount due, if any, on account of electricity consumption would be a
matter between electricity department and the tenant and it would be the prerogative of the
aforesaid department to disconnect the electricity supply as per rules in case the electricity charges
are not deposited.
5.15. He relies upon the decision in M/S NEEHARIKA INFRASTRUCTURE PVT. LTD. VS. STATE
OF MAHARASHTRA IN CRL.A NO.330/2021, more particularly para 8.2, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.7 and 23
thereof, which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
8.2 The Privy Council in the case of Khwaja Nazir Ahmad (supra) observed that in

the judicial authorities. It is further observed that it would be an unfortunate result if
it should be held possible to interfere with those statutory rights by an exercise of the
inherent jurisdiction of the court. It is further observed that the functions of the
judiciary and the police are complementary, not overlapping, and the combination of
individual liberty with a

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 due observance of law and order is only to be obtained by leaving each

9.2 In the case of Union of India v. Prakash P. Hinduja, (2003) 6 SCC 195, in paragraph 20, it is
observed and held as under:
"20. Thus the legal position is absolutely clear and also settled by judicial authorities
that the court would not interfere with the investigation or during the course of
investigation which would mean from the time of the lodging of the first information
report till the submission of the report by the officer in charge of the police station in
court under Section 173(2) CrPC, this field being exclusively reserved for the
investigating agency."
9.3 In the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), it is observed and held by this Court that save in exceptional
cases where non interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the court and the judicial
process should not interfere at the stage of the investigation of offence. It is further observed that in
a routine case where information of an offence or offences has been lodged, investigation
commenced, search and seizure followed and suspects arrested, the resort to the unusual procedure
of oral applications and oral appeals and interim stay order thereon would have the effect of
interfering and staying the investigation of offences by the investigating officer performing statutory
duty under Cr.P.C.
9.4 In the case of Ujjal Kumar Burdhan (supra), it is observed and held by this Court that unless
case of gross abuse of power is made out against those in charge of investigation, the High Court
should be loath to interfere at early/premature stage of investigation.

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 9.7 In the case of Prakash P. Hinduja (supra), it is observed and held by

and whether the High Court would be justified in passing the order of not to arrest the accused or
"no coercive steps to be adopted" during the investigation or till the final report/chargesheet is filed
under Section 173 Cr.P.C., while dismissing/disposing of/not entertaining/not quashing the
criminal proceedings/complaint/FIR in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and/or under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India, our final conclusions are as under:
i) Police has the statutory right and duty under the relevant provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure contained in Chapter XIV of the Code to investigate into a
cognizable offence;
ii) Courts would not thwart any investigation into the cognizable offences;
iii) It is only in cases where no cognizable offence or offence of any kind is disclosed
in the first information report that the Court will not permit an investigation to go on;
- 47 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019
iv) The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with circumspection, as it has been
observed, in the 'rarest of rare cases (not to be confused with the formation in the context of death
penalty).
v) While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought, the court cannot embark upon
an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the
FIR/complaint;
vi) Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial stage;
vii) Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception rather than an ordinary rule;
viii) Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of the police, since the two
organs of the State operate in two specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over the
other sphere;
ix) The functions of the judiciary and the police are complementary, not overlapping;
x) Save in exceptional cases where non- interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the Court
and the judicial process should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences;
xi) Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the
Court to act according to its whims or caprice;

Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
xii) The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts and details
relating to the offence reported. Therefore, when the investigation by the police is in progress, the
court should not go into the merits of the allegations in the FIR.
- 48 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Police must be permitted to complete the investigation. It would be
premature to pronounce the conclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint/FIR does not
deserve to be investigated or that it amounts to abuse of process of law. After investigation, if the
investigating officer finds that there is no substance in the application made by the complainant, the
investigating officer may file an appropriate report/summary before the learned Magistrate which
may be considered by the learned Magistrate in accordance with the known procedure;
xiii) The power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is very wide, but conferment of wide power requires the
court to be more cautious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court;
xiv) However, at the same time, the court, if it thinks fit, regard being had to the parameters of
quashing and the self- restraint imposed by law, more particularly the parameters laid down by this
Court in the cases of R.P. Kapur (supra) and Bhajan Lal (supra), has the jurisdiction to quash the
FIR/complaint;
xv) When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the alleged accused and the court when it
exercises the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C., only has to consider whether the allegations in the
FIR disclose commission of a cognizable offence or not. The court is not required to consider on
merits whether or not the merits of the allegations make out a cognizable offence and the court has
to permit the investigating agency/police to investigate the allegations in the FIR;
xvi) The aforesaid parameters would be applicable and/or the aforesaid aspects are
- 49 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 required to be considered by the High Court while passing an interim
order in a quashing petition in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and/or under Article
226 of the Constitution of India. However, an interim order of stay of investigation during the
pendency of the quashing petition can be passed with circumspection. Such an interim order should
not require to be passed routinely, casually and/or mechanically. Normally, when the investigation
is in progress and the facts are hazy and the entire evidence/material is not before the High Court,
the High Court should restrain itself from passing the interim order of not to arrest or "no coercive
steps to be adopted" and the accused should be relegated to apply for anticipatory bail under Section
438 Cr.P.C. before the competent court. The High Court shall not and as such is not justified in
passing the order of not to arrest and/or "no coercive steps" either during the investigation or till the
investigation is completed and/or till the final report/chargesheet is filed under Section 173 Cr.P.C.,
while dismissing/disposing of the quashing petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and/or under Article
226 of the Constitution of India. xvii) Even in a case where the High Court is prima facie of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 24
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
opinion that an exceptional case is made out for grant of interim stay of further investigation, after
considering the broad parameters while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and/or
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India referred to hereinabove, the High Court has to give
brief reasons why such an interim order is warranted and/or is required to be passed so that it can
demonstrate the application of mind by the Court and the higher forum can consider what was
weighed with the High Court while passing such an interim order.
- 50 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 xviii) Whenever an interim order is passed by the High Court of "no
coercive steps to be adopted" within the aforesaid parameters, the High Court must clarify what
does it mean by "no coercive steps to be adopted" as the term "no coercive steps to be adopted" can
be said to be too vague and/or broad which can be misunderstood and/or misapplied.
5.16. Relying on the above decision, he submits that this Court ought not to exercise powers under
Section 482 of Cr.P.C. when the matter is pending for investigation and this Court ought to
encourage investigation to be completed, so that the truth can come out.
5.17. He relies upon the decision of this court in MAHENDRA K C VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA
[CRL.A. No.1238/2021], more particularly para 16, 18, 21, 25, 26 and 30 thereof, which are

16. On reading the judgment of the Single Judge, it would appear that the Single
Judge has failed to notice the distinction between a petition for quashing under
Section 482 (which was being considered) and a criminal trial or an appeal against a
conviction on a charge under Section 306.
The Single Judge has transgressed the limits of the
- 51 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC. The judgment is replete
with hypothesis and surmises on the basis of which the Single Judge has reached an inference on
facts. The Single Judge has tested the veracity of the allegations in the criminal complaint and in the
suicide note left behind by the deceased without having the benefit of an evidentiary record which
would be collected during the trial. At the stage when the High Court considers a petition for
quashing under Section 482 of the CrPC, the test to be applied is whether the allegations in the
complaint as they stand, without adding or detracting from the complaint, prima facie establish the
ingredients of the offence alleged. At this stage, the High Court cannot test the veracity of the
allegations nor for that matter can it proceed in the manner that a judge conducting a trial would, on
the basis of the evidence collected during the course of trial. The High Court in the present case has
virtually proceeded to hold a trial, substituting its own perception for what it believed should or
should not have been the normal course of human behavior. This is clearly impermissible.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 25
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
18. In this backdrop, it is impossible on a judicious purview of the contents of the complaint and the
suicide note for a judicial mind to arrive at a conclusion that a case for quashing the FIR had been
established. In arriving at that conclusion, the Single Judge has transgressed the well settled
limitations on the exercise of the powers under Section 482 CrPC and has encroached into a
territory which is reserved for a criminal trial.
21. Based on the above precedent, the High Court while exercising its power under Section 482 of
the CrPC to quash the FIR instituted against the second respondent-accused should have applied
the following two tests: i) whether the allegations made in the complaint, prima facie constitute an
offence; and ii) whether the allegations are so improbable
- 52 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 that a prudent man would not arrive at the conclusion that there is
sufficient ground to proceed with the complaint. Before proceeding further, it is imperative to briefly
discuss the law on the abetment of suicide to determine if a prima facie case under Section 306 of
the IPC has been made against the respondent-accused.
25. While adjudicating on an application under Section 482 CrPC, the High Court in the present
case travelled far away from the parameters for the exercise of the jurisdiction. Essentially, the task
before the High Court was to determine whether the allegations made in the first information report
or the complaint, even if they are (2010) 1 SCC 707 (2012) 9 SCC 734 (2018) 7 SCC 781 (2019) 3 SCC
315 (2019) 17 SCC 301 (2020) 15 SCC 359 (2020) 10 SCC 200 (2021) 2 SCC 427 taken at their face
value and accepted in their entirety did or did not prima facie constitute an offence or make out a
case against the accused.
26. Instead of applying this settled principle, the High Court has proceeded to analyze from its own
perspective the veracity of the allegations. It must be emphasized that this is not a case where the
High Court has arrived at a conclusion that the allegations in the FIR or the complaint are so absurd
and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person could ever reach a just
conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. Nor is this a case
where the criminal proceeding is manifestly mala fide or has been instituted with an ulterior motive
of taking vengeance on the accused. On the contrary, the specific allegations in the FIR and in the
complaint find due reflection in the suicide note and establish a prima facie case for abetment of
suicide within the meaning of Sections 306 and 107
- 53 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 of the IPC. The entire judgment of the High Court consists of a litany of
surmises and conjectures and such an exercise is beyond the domain of proceeding under section
482 of the CrPC. The High Court has proceeded to scrutinize what has been disclosed during the
investigation, ignoring that the investigation had been stayed by an interim order of the High Court,
during the pendency of the proceedings under section 482.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 26

30. The High Court by its order has prevented the completion of the investigation in the complaint
registered as Crime No.565/2016 pending on the file of the IInd Additional Civil Judge (Junior
Division) and JMFC Court, Maddur, Mandya District. The alleged suicide is of a person who was
working as a driver of a Special Land Acquisition Officer, who is a public servant and against whom
serious and grave allegations of amassing wealth disproportionate to the known sources of income
were made by the deceased. The suicide note contains a detailed account of the role of the accused in
the events which led to the deceased committing suicide. These are matters of investigation and
possibly trial. The High Court stalled the investigation by granting an interim order of stay. If the
investigation had been allowed to proceed, there would have been a revelation of material facts
which would aid in the trial, for the alleged offence against the second respondent. 5.18. He submits
that allegations having been made by him whether they are true or not have to be ascertained only
during investigation. He relies upon the decision of Hon'ble High Court of
- 54 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Judicature at Allahabad in Veena Mittal Vs. State of U.P. and others in
Crl.A. 122/2020, more particularly para 6 thereof which is produced hereunder for easy reference:
6. In this backdrop, the finding of the High Court to the effect that there is no specific allegation
against the second and third respondents or that, as the mother and sister of the bridegroom, they
would not be either beneficiaries or have a direct link with the perpetrators of the crime is not based
on cogent material or a reading of the FIR. It is well-settled that at the stage when the High Court
considers a petition for quashing criminal proceedings under Section 482 of the CrPC, the
allegations in the FIR must be read as they stand and it is only if on the face of the allegations that
no offence, as alleged, has been made out, that the Court may be justified in exercising its
jurisdiction to quash. The parameters of the jurisdiction under Section 482 have been reiterated in a
consistent line of authorities and, at this stage, it may be material to refer to the recent decision of
this Court in Neeharika Infrastructure v. State of Maharashtra4. Accordingly, we allow the appeal
and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 15 April 2019 in Criminal
Miscellaneous Application No 27511 of 2018. Relying on the above, he submits that exercising power
under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., FIR ought not to be quashed.

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 5.19. He relies upon the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in Kaptan
Singh vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh and others in Crl.A. No.787/2021, more particularly para 13
thereof, which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
13. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment
and order passed by the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings in exercise of
powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is unsustainable and the same deserves to be
quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. Now, the trial to be
conducted and proceeded further in accordance with law and on its own merits.

It is made clear that the observations made by this Court in the present proceedings are to be treated
to be confined to the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. only and the trial Court to decide the
case in accordance with law and on its own merits and on the basis of the evidence to be laid and
without being influenced by any of the observations made by us hereinabove. The present appeal is
accordingly allowed.
5.20. As regards the submission of learned Senior counsel that there is no compliance of Section
154(1) and 154(3) of the Cr.P.C, he submits that on each of the occasion when the electricity was
disconnected, he had filed complaint with Kengeri police station who had
- 56 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 not taken any action, more particularly on 15.04.2018, 21.10.2018 and
22.12.2018 and 13.01.2019. In view thereof, he had sent an email to the Commissioner of Police
enclosing the said complaints. When no action was taken, he filed a private complaint on
26.12.2018. Therefore, he submits that though the complaint does not specifically state all these
facts, he has produced documents along with objections which would indicate the same. As such,
there is compliance with the requirement of the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Priyanka
Srivatsva's case (supra). 5.21. As regards the contention of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners
that the matter could not have been referred directly to the Assistant Commissioner of Police, by
relying on Rule 7 of Scheduled Caste and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995
['POA
- 57 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Rules' for short], he submits that investigation requires to be done by
the police officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. Hence, the trial Court
could not have referred the matter to a Station House Officer and ACP being of the rank of Deputy
Superintendent of Police, the trial Court has rightly referred the matter to the ACP for investigation.
The POA Act being a special enactment, would prevail over the general enactment viz., Cr.P.C.
5.22. He submits that trial Court has not taken cognizance of any office, but has only referred the
matter for investigation under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. and in this regard he relies upon the
decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Devarapalli Lakshminarayana -v- V.Naryana Reddy reported
in (1976) 3 SCC 252, more particularly, paras 16, 17 and 18
- 58 -

16. The position under the Code of 1898 with regard to the powers of a Magistrate
having jurisdiction, to send a complaint disclosing a cognizable offence -- whether or
not triable exclusively by the Court of Session -- to the police for investigation under
Section 156(3), remains unchanged under the Code of 1973. The distinction between
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 28
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
a police investigation ordered under Section 156(3) and the one directed under
Section 202, has also been maintained under the new Code; but a rider has been
clamped by the first proviso to Section 202(1) that if it appears to the Magistrate that
an offence triable exclusively by the Court of Session has been committed, he shall
not make any direction for investigation.
17. Section 156(3) occurs in Chapter XII, under the caption : "Information to the
Police and their powers to investigate"; while Section 202 is in Chapter XV which
bears the heading: "Of complaints to Magistrates". The power to order police
investigation under Section 156(3) is different from the power to direct investigation
conferred by Section 202(1). The two operate in distinct spheres at different stages.
The first is exercisable at the pre-cognizance stage, the second at the post-cognizance
stage when the Magistrate is in seisin of the case. That is to say in the case of a
complaint regarding the commission of a cognizable offence, the power under Section
156(3) can be invoked by the Magistrate before he takes cognizance of the offence
under Section 190(1)(a).
But if he once takes such cognizance and embarks upon the procedure embodied in Chapter XV, he
is not competent to switch back to the pre-cognizance stage and avail of Section 156(3). It may be
noted further that an order made under sub-section (3) of Section 156, is in the nature of a
peremptory reminder or intimation to the police to exercise
- 59 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 their plenary powers of investigation under Section 156(1). Such an
investigation embraces the entire continuous process which begins with the collection of evidence
under Section 156 and ends with a report or charge-sheet under Section 173. On the other hand,
Section 202 comes in at a stage when some evidence has been collected by the Magistrate in
proceedings under Chapter XV, but the same is deemed insufficient to take a decision as to the next
step in the prescribed procedure. In such a situation, the Magistrate is empowered under Section
202 to direct, within the limits circumscribed by that section an investigation "for the purpose of
deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding". Thus the object of an
investigation under Section 202 is not to initiate a fresh case on police report but to assist the
Magistrate in completing proceedings already instituted upon a complaint before him.
18. In the instant case the Magistrate did not apply his mind to the complaint for deciding whether
or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding; but only for ordering an investigation under Section
156(3). He did not bring into motion the machinery of Chapter XV. He did not examine the
complainant or his witnesses under Section 200 CrPC, which is the first step in the procedure
prescribed under that chapter. The question of taking the next step of that procedure envisaged in
Section 202 did not arise. Instead of taking cognizance of the offence, he has, in the exercise of his
discretion, sent the complaint for investigation by police under Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 29
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
156. 5.23. Relying on the above, he submits that the trial Court has rightly referred the matter for
investigation pending taking cognizance of the same.
- 60 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 5.24. He also relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in Modh.
Yusuf Vs. Smt.Afaq Jahan and another reported in [JT 2006 SC 10], relevant portion is reproduced
hereunder for easy reference:
This is because he has already taken cognizance of the offence disclosed in the
complaint, and the domain of the case would thereafter vest with him. The clear
position therefore is that any Judicial Magistrate, before taking cognizance of the
offence, can order investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code. If he does so, he is
not to examine the complainant on oath because he was not taking cognizance of any
offence therein. For the purpose of enabling the police to start investigation it is open
to the Magistrate to direct the police to register an FIR. There is nothing illegal in
doing so. After all registration of an FIR involves only the process of entering the
substance of the information relating to the commission of the cognizable offence in a
book kept by the officer in charge of the police station as indicated in Section 154 of
the Code. Even if a Magistrate does not say in so many words while directing
investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code that an FIR should be registered, it is
the duty of the officer in charge of the police station to register the FIR regarding the
cognizable offence disclosed by the complaint because that police officer could take
further steps contemplated in Chapter XII of the Code only thereafter.
5.25. He submits that it is not a fit case for this Court to exercise powers either under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India or Section 482 of
- 61 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Cr.P.C. In this regard, he relies upon the decision in West Bengal Vs.
Narayan K. Patodia reported in [AIR 2000 SC 1405], relevant portion is reproduced hereunder for
easy reference:
That apart, how could the FIR be quashed if the investigating agency should have
been different? By lodging FIR alone no investigation is conducted by the police. It is
the first step towards starting investigation by the police. If High Court was of the
opinion that investigation has to be conducted by the Bureau then also there was no
need to quash the FIR. Any way we take the view that as offences under the Indian
Penal Code are also involved, efficacious investigation can be conducted by
entrusting it to the police investigating agency. Inherent powers of the High Court as
recognised in Section 482 of the Code are reserved to be used "to give effect to any
orders under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to
secure the ends of justice." It is quite unfortunate that learned single judge
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 30
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
overlooked the reality that by quashing the FIR in the case the High Court did not
achieve any one of the above factors. On the contrary, the result of quashing the FIR
had rendered the allegation of offences made against a person to remain consigned in
stupor perennially. Hence, instead of achieving ends of criminal justice, the
impugned order would achieve the reverse of it.
5.26. He states that since prima facie grounds are made out to establish an offence
having been committed by the petitioners, this Court ought
- 62 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 not to quash the complaint at the investigation stage. In this regard he
relies upon the decision of the Apex Court in Sau. Kamal Shivaji Pokarnekar vs. The State of
Maharashtra & other in Crl.A. No.255/2019, more particularly, para 9 which is reproduced
hereunder for easy reference:
9. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel and examined the material on record, we
are of the considered view that the High Court ought not to have set aside the order
passed by the Trial Court issuing summons to the Respondents. A perusal of the
complaint discloses that prima facie, offences that are alleged against the
Respondents. The correctness or otherwise of the said allegations has to be decided
only in the Trial. At the initial stage of issuance of process it is not open to the Courts
to stifle the proceedings by entering into the merits of the contentions made on
behalf of the accused.
Criminal complaints cannot be quashed only on the ground that the allegations made therein appear
to be of a civil nature. If the ingredients of the offence alleged against the accused are prima facie
made out in the complaint, the criminal proceeding shall not be interdicted.
5.27. He relies upon the decision in Dr.Lakshman vs. The State of Karnataka in Crl.A.
No.1573-75/2019, more particularly, para 9
- 63 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
9. It is not seriously disputed by the parties with regard to the entering of the
agreements for procuring the land in favour of the appellant in Ballur Village, Anekal
Taluk, Bangalore Urban District and respondents have received the amount of Rs.9
crores by way of demand drafts and cheques. It is the specific case of the appellant
that there are schedules mentioned to the agreements as per which respondents have
agreed to procure the land covered by Survey Nos.115 and 117 of Ballur Village apart
from other lands. In a petition under Section 482, Cr.P.C. it is fairly well settled that
it is not permissible for the High Court to record any findings, wherever there are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 31
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
factual disputes. Merely on the ground that there is no pagination in the Schedule,
the High Court has disbelieved such Schedule to the Agreements. It is the specific
case of the appellant that the lands covered by Survey Nos.115 and 117 Crl.A.@
SLP(Crl.)Nos.6115-6117/2017 of Ballur Village were sold even prior to the first
agreement, as such respondents have committed an act of cheating. It is also the
specific case of the appellant that two cheques were issued by respondents-accused
by way of security for the amount of Rs.9 crores which is advance but the account of
such cheques was closed even prior to entering into the Agreement itself. The second
complaint filed by the appellant is self-explanatory and he is forcefully made to sign
the sale deed which were executed subsequently of Ballur Village. Mere filing of the
suits for recovery of the money and complaint filed under Section 138 of the N.I. Act
by itself is no ground to quash the proceedings in the complaints filed by the
appellant herein. When cheating and criminal conspiracy are alleged against the
accused, for advancing a huge sum of Rs.9 crores, it is a matter which is to be tried,
but at the same time the High Court has

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 entered into the disputed area, at the stage of considering the petitions
filed under Section 482, Cr.P.C. It is fairly well settled that power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is to be
exercised sparingly when the case is not made out for the Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)Nos.6115-6117/2017
offences alleged on the reading of the complaint itself or in cases where such complaint is filed by
way of abuse of the process. Whether any Schedules were appended to the agreement or not, a
finding is required to be recorded after full fledged trial. Further, as the contract is for the purpose
of procuring the land, as such the same is of civil nature, as held by the High Court, is also no
ground for quashing. Though the contract is of civil nature, if there is an element of cheating and
fraud it is always open for a party in a contract, to prosecute the other side for the offences alleged.
Equally, mere filing of a suit or complaint filed under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881 by itself is no
ground to quash the proceedings. While considering the petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., we
are of the view that the High Court also committed an error that there is a novation of the contract
in view of the subsequent agreement entered into on 08.11.2012. Whether there is novation of
contract or not and the effect of such entering into the contract is a matter which is required to be
considered only after trial but not at the stage of considering the application under Section 482,

an evidentiary record which would be collected during the trial. At the stage when the High Court
considers a petition for quashing under Section 482 of the CrPC, the test to be applied is whether
the allegations in the complaint as they stand, without adding or detracting from the complaint,
prima facie establish the ingredients of the offence alleged. At this stage, the High Court cannot test
the veracity of the allegations nor for that matter can it proceed in the manner that a judge
conducting a trial would, on the basis of the evidence collected during the course of trial. The High
Court in the present case has virtually proceeded to hold a trial, substituting its own perception for
what it believed should or should not have been the normal course of human behavior. This is
clearly impermissible.
27 The High Court observed that a prima facie case for the commission of offence under Section 306
of the IPC is not made out since: i) the suicide note does not describe the specific threats; ii) details
of the alleged demand of Rs. 8 lacs from the deceased by the respondent-accused are not set out in
the suicide note; and iii) no material to corroborate the allegations detailed in the suicide note has
been unearthed by the investigating agency. The High Court observed that since the deceased took
considerable time to write a twelve page suicide note, "it would have been but natural for the author
- 66 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 to set out the details". The High Court has evidently travelled far
beyond the limits of its inherent power under Section 482 CrPC since instead of determining
whether on a perusal of the complaint, a prima facie case is made out, it has analysed the sufficiency
of the evidence with reference to the suicide note and has commented upon and made strong
observations on the suicide note itself. Paras 32,33,34 and 39 of the order of the High Court are
extracted below:
"32. In paragraph no.21, a bald statement is made stating that because he is aware of
all the above transaction, he was given a death threat. In the next sentence, he states
that he has been psychologically/emotionally trouble and hence, he is consuming
poison and that the petitioner and his driver alone are responsible. For a person, who
has detailed 20 transactions, it can be prudently expected of such a person to give
details of the threat.
33. In the next unnumbered paragraph, a totally different story/note is set out as a
reason for the petitioner threatening the deceased. In the unnumbered paragraph, he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 33
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
states that there was shortage in the cash to the tune of Rs.8 lakhs and that the
petitioner suspected him as being responsible for the same and hence, threatened
him that if the deceased did not repay said Rs.8 lakhs, he would have the deceased
killed at the hands of rowdies. Thereafter, in the next sentence he states that in view
of the same, he has decided to consume poison and that the petitioner and his driver
are responsible for the same.
34. In paragraph no.20, the deceased holds the petitioner responsible for withholding
the salary for the last three months. The other paragraphs including paragraph no.20
detail the properties said to have
- 67 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 been amassed by the petitioner and other illegal
transactions. After having perused and scrutinized the death note, a query was put to
the learned High Court Government Pleader and the counsel appearing on behalf of
2nd respondent as to whether the investigation has thrown up any material that
corroborates any of the allegations set-out in the death note. The learned High Court
Government Pleader would fairly submit that they have not been able unearth any
material to corroborate any of the allegations.
39. As discussed above, the death note contains no incriminating statement or
material except for a bald and vague statement but that the accused had threatened
him. Even the complaint does not disclose any details of the alleged threat nor does
the complaint state that the deceased had on multiple occasions complained of
having received threats from accused. Even the allegation of the demand for
repayment of Rs.8 lakhs rings hollow as neither the prosecution nor the de-facto
complainant have been able to place an iota of material that the deceased was or had
in fact been in possession of huge sum of money."
Further, the observation of the High Court that there is no material to corroborate the allegations
made in the suicide note is erroneous since it is not a consideration for the High Court while
exercising its power under Section 482 of the CrPC, particularly in view of the fact that the trial has
not begun and the Single Judge had stayed the investigation in the criminal complaint. 5.29. Based
on the above decisions he submits that the above petition is required to be dismissed
- 68 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 and investigation is required to be carried out into the allegations made
by the complainant.
6. Heard Sri.Sandesh Chouta, learned counsel for the petitioners and Sri.Ravikumar,

7. On the basis of the submission made, the points that would arise for determination of this Court
are as under:
1. When allegations are made as regards offences under the POA Act, whether the
trial Court could refer the matter for investigation to the Asst. Commissioner of
Police instead of Station House Officer?
2. Whether the Association would be entitled to disconnect electricity supply in the
event of non-payment of charges towards common amenities and/or maintenance
charges?
3. Whether merely because the apartments have been developed by BDA, could the
apartments be not subject to the provisions of Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act,
1972?
- 69 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019
4. Whether on the basis of the complaint it could be said that any offences punishable under Section
3(1)(g), 3(1)(p), 3(1)(q), 3(1)(u), 3(1)(z), 3(1)(zc), 3(2)(va), 3(2)(va), 4 and 4(2)(b) of the POA Act
have been made out?
5. Whether the complaint filed is in compliance with the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
Priyanka Srivastava v. State of U.P., [(2015) 6 SCC 287]?
6. Whether the order of the learned Magistrate referring the matter for investigation is required to
be interfered with?
7. Whether this Court ought to exercise powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C and quash the
complaint or investigation is required?
8. What order?
8. I answer the above points as under.
9. ANSWER TO POINT NO.1: When allegations are made as regards offences under the POA Act,
whether the trial Court could refer the matter for investigation to the Asst. Commissioner of Police
instead of Station House Officer? 8.1. Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. reads as under:
156. Police officer' s power to investigate cognizable case.
(1) Any officer in charge of a police station may, without the order of a Magistrate,
investigate any

- 70 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 cognizable case which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area
within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of
Chapter XIII.
(2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the
ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to
investigate. (3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order such an investigation as
above- mentioned.
8.2. When a private complaint is filed under Section 200 of Cr.P.C., if the Magistrate were of the
opinion that investigation is required would refer the same under Section 156(3) OF Cr.P.C. for
investigation to the Station House Officer. Section 156(3) does not make a distinction between the
nature of offence and/or who the investigating officer ought to be. However, the POA Rules make a
specific departure and/or provision for investigation inasmuch as it is a police officer not below the
rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police who can investigate into any offence under POA
- 71 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Act which is as provided under Rule 7 of the POA Rules. The said Rule
7 of POA Rules is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
7. Investigating Officer. (1) An offence committed under the Act shall be investigated
by a police officer not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police. The
investigating officer shall be appointed by the State Government/Director General of
Police/ Superintendent of Police after taking into account his past experience, sense
of ability and justice to perceive the implications of the case and investigate it
alongwith right lines within the shortest possible time.
[(2) The investigating officer so appointed under sub-rule (1) shall complete the investigation on top
priority, submit the report to the Superintendent of Police, who in turn shall immediately forward
the report to the Director-General of Police or Commissioner of Police of the State Government, and
the officer-in charge of the concerned police station shall file the charge-sheet in the Special Court or
the Exclusive Special Court within a period of sixty days (the period is inclusive of investigation and
filing of charge-sheet).
(2A) The delay, if any, in investigation or filing of charge-sheet in accordance with sub-rule (2) shall
be explained in writing by the investigating officer.] [(3) The Secretary, Home Department and the
Secretary, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Development Department (the name of the
Department may vary from State to State) of the State Government or Union territory
Administration, Director of Prosecution, the officer in-charge of Prosecution and the
Director-General of Police or the Commissioner of Police in-charge of the concerned State or Union
territory shall review

- 72 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 by the end of every quarter the position of all investigations done by the
investigating officer.] 8.3. It is relying upon the said Rule 7 that Sri.Ravikumar, the
complainant-party in person would contend that the reference of the matter for investigation to the
Assistant Commissioner of Police is proper and correct and that the contention of Sri.Sandesh
Chouta, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner that the matter ought to be referred only to the
Station House Officer cannot be sustained.
8.4. Rule 5 of the POA Rules relates to filing of the complaint and the same reads as under:
5. Information to Police Officer in-charge of a Police Station. (1) Ever information
relating to the commission of an offence under the Act, if given orally to an officer
incharge of a police station shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction,
and be read over to the informant, and every such information, whether given in
writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the persons giving it,
and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be maintained by that police
station.
- 73 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 (2) A copy of the information as so recorded under sub-rule (1) above
shall be given forthwith, free of cost, to the informant. (3) Any person aggrieved by a refusal on the
part of an officer in-charge of a police station to record the information referred to in-sub- rule (1)
may send the substance of such information, in writing and by post, to the Superintendent of Police
concerned who after investigation either by himself or by a police officer not below the rank of
Deputy Superintendent of Police, shall make an order in writing to the officer in-charge of the
concerned police station to enter the substance of that information to be entered in the book to be
maintained by that police station.
8.5. A perusal of the said Rule would indicate that information relating to commission of any offence
under the POA Act would have to be filed with the jurisdictional police station and the officer
in-charge of police station would have to reduce the same into writing, read over the same to the
informant, signed by the person giving it and substance thereof to be entered into a book
maintained by the police station.
- 74 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 8.6. Thus, in terms of Rule 5, it is the police officer in-charge of the
police station who has to register the complaint. Whenever any matter is referred for investigation
under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C, the jurisdictional police to whom the matter is referred to
investigation, is required to register a complaint and thereafter take up investigation. Needless to
say that without registering a complaint, no investigation can be taken up. It is only thereafter that
Rule 7 of POA Rules would come into effect relating to investigation. 8.7. A perusal of Rule 7 which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182418929/ 37
Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
is extracted hereinabove would indicate that the Investigating Officer shall be appointed by the State
Government/Director General of Police/Superintendent of Police after taking into account his past
experience, sense of ability and justice to perceive the implication
- 75 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 of the case and investigate it along with right lines within shortest
possible time. Merely because of a person being a Asst.
Commissioner of Police would not make him the investigating officer as regards the particular
offence registered under the POA Act, the Investigating Officer would have to be appointed by the
State Government/Director General of Police/Superintendent of Police. Thus, I am of the
considered opinion that when an offence is referred for investigation, the reference is required to be
made in terms of Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. to the jurisdictional police station and in terms of Rule 5
of POA Rules, it is the police officer incharge of police station who has to register the complaint/FIR
and thereafter it is for the State Government/Director General of
- 76 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Police/Superintendent of Police to appoint an investigation officer.
8.8. This is the purport of the decisions relied upon by Sri.Sandesh Chouta, learned Senior counsel
for the petitioner in CBI Vs. State of Rajasthan's case (supra).
8.9. Thus, I answer point No.1 by holding that when allegations are made as regards offences under
the POA Act, the trial Court would have to refer the matter for investigation to the jurisdiction police
station where the officer in-charge would reduce it into writing and register a complaint and
thereafter for the purpose of investigation, investigating officer shall be appointed by the State
Government/Director General of Police/Superintendent of Police. The Magistrate cannot designate
the investigating
- 77 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 officer merely on the post held by such person. The qualification of
such investigating officer not being below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police would not
mean that the Asst. Commissioner of Police of that particular area would automatically become the
investigating officer. Past experience, sense of ability and justice to perceive the implication are also
relevant factors to be considered while appointing a investigating officer.
9. ANSWER TO POINT NO.2:Whether the Association would be entitled to disconnect electricity
supply in the event of non-payment of charges towards common amenities and/or maintenance
charges?

9.1. The apartment complex viz., Kailash Apartment has been subjected to the provisions of the
KAOA. This Court in CRP No.96/2021 in (Shantharam Prabhu Vs. Mr K Dayanand Rai) has held
that once Deed of
- 78 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 declaration and Deed of Apartment has been filed before the concerned
authority and the apartment complex is subjected to KAOA, it is the KAOA which would be
applicable to said apartment complex. This court has also held that all bye-laws and/or Rules and
regulations as contained in the Deed of Declaration or any other document would be binding on all
the apartment owners.
9.2. Sri Ravi Kumar by relying on several decisions which have been extracted hereinabove,
Sri.Ravikumar, party-in-person has sought to contend that electricity is a natural right, human right
and such electricity cannot be disconnected.
9.3. A reading of all decisions relied upon by him do not indicate that the same is an absolute right.
For the electricity board and/or
- 79 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 distribution company to supply electricity, necessary payment would
have to be made. It is not that electricity is available free of cost to everyone. Thus for the
respondent- complainant to claim electricity as a human right, it is of course required for the
respondent-complainant to adhere to the payments schedule and make necessary payments. The
complainant cannot claim electricity as a human right without making due payments of amounts.
9.4. Sri.Ravikumar, party-in-person who is also an advocate by profession has on several occasions
during the course of argument made a submission that he is only liable to make payment of
electricity charges to his apartment and not as regards the common areas and amenities. Such an
assertion being
- 80 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 made by him is contrary to law, apart from being dishonest.
9.5. Admittedly neither he nor his wife has not been making payment of common maintenance
charges which is his duty and obligation to do so. If at all he or his wife have any doubts about the
amounts payable, he can always seek for clarification from the Managing Committee of Association
which is running the maintenance activities. The Management Committee being elected and/or
nominated by the community as a whole, it is for each and every member of the community/owner
of apartment to abide by the rules and regulations framed in relation thereto and any deviation
thereof would incur the penal consequences as envisaged under the Deed of Declaration. The Deed
of Declaration providing for the Association to

- 81 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 disconnect electricity supply in the event of non payment of
maintenance charges towards common amenities and maintenance charges. 9.6. An apartment
complex is a community of people. The said complex contains private areas, viz., apartment
belonging to a particular person or family and also contains several common areas like common lift,
common staircases, footpaths, generator, Water treatment plant, Garden, Landscaping, Club-house,
Community centre, etc., etc. For the apartment complex to be maintained properly, it would be
required for all apartment owners to contribute to the upkeep of the apartment complex which
includes common areas and it is in that back ground that the Deed of Declaration relevant to the
petitioner and respondent-complainant which indicates that the respondent-complainant is
- 82 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 required to make payment of certain amounts towards maintenance of
common areas and amenities.
9.7. The amenities could include Swimming Pool, Club House, Play Area, Water Treatment Plants,
Rain Water Harvesting and the like. For a person to access his or her apartment, such person is
required to essentially go through the common passages, common lifts, common staircase, etc. By a
person using the common lift, electricity would be consuming, if a person were to use common
passage in the night time, the same would have to be well lit, the other amenities like Water
Treatment Plants, Rain Water Harvesting also consume electricity. These are all assets which are
shared by community of owners in the apartment complex.
- 83 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 9.8. Thus not only would an apartment owner be required to make
payment of the electricity charges for the apartment but also would be liable to make payment of all
expenses incurred towards maintenance of common areas and amenities including electricity
charges that may be required to be borne in relation thereto, the salaries to staff engaged to
maintain the common passages, garden, etc, the salaries to staff engaged to operate Water
Treatment Plant, Rain Water Harvesting, etc. 9.9. In the event of said payments not being made, the
community as a whole would suffer, on account of maintenance of these common amenities and/or
areas suffering. Thus, it is for this reason that Deed of Declaration contemplates disconnection of
electricity power or disqualification of a
- 84 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 member of the community in the event of maintenance charges not
being paid. 9.10. I answer Point No.2 by holding that Management Committee of the Association
would be entitled to disconnect electricity supply to an apartment in the event of non- payment of
charges towards common amenities by that Apartment owner i.e., that apartment owner becoming a
defaulter.

10. ANSWER TO POINT NO.3 : Whether merely because the apartments have been developed by
BDA, could the apartments be not subject to the provisions of Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act,
1972?
10.1. As aforesaid in CRP No.96/2021 in (Shantharam Prabhu Vs. Mr K Dayanand) this court has
held that any apartment complex could be subjected to the provisions of the KAOA by executing a
Deed of Declaration and submitting the same to the
- 85 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 concerned/jurisdictional officer. There is no restriction under the
KAOA as claimed by Sri.Ravikumar-complainant as regards an apartment complex being developed
by the BDA, not being capable of being subjected to the provisions of KAOA, the KAOA regulates the
inter-se rights and obligation on part of the apartment owners and has nothing to do with the
developer.
10.2. Once the development is completed, it is for the owners of the apartment who are living in the
apartment complex as a community to regulate their affairs and in this regard they could subject the
apartment complex to KAOA. All the owners including the complainant's wife (who is the actual
owner, the complainant not being the owner) having subjected themselves to the KAOA and
subjected the apartment complex to KAOA,
- 86 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 whether the developer is BDA or otherwise would have no bearing. The
Development being sold it is for the apartment owners to decide as to by what rules they would be
governed. KAOA is an enactment specifically enacted to govern the inter se relation between the
apartment owners. In the present case, the apartment owners have subjected themselves to KAOA.
It is therefore for all apartment owners to abide by the Deed of Declaration and Byelaws once made
applicable to the apartment complex. A lone apartment owner or a group of apartment owners not
contributing the majority cannot contend otherwise without suitable amendment having been made
to the Deed of Declaration and/or Byelaws.
10.3. Sri.Ravikumar, party-in-person has repeatedly submitted that BDA being a government
- 87 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 organization, the apartment is in the nature of government and/or the
State and as such it is the State or the BDA who can take action, if any, against Sri.Ravikumar and
not the Association or the Managing Committee. Such a submission on part of a lay person also
would not be acceptable. In this case Sri.Ravikumar claims to be an advocate by profession but has
chosen to appear in the matter as party-in-person has sought to mislead this Court and to make false
submission, he has also tried to brow-beat the Association. This conduct on part of the complainant
is deprecated.

10.4. I answer point No.3 by holding that even though the apartments may be developed by the
BDA, the apartment owners can subject the apartment and the apartment complex to the KAOA. For
the said purpose, it does not matter
- 88 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 as to who has developed the apartment complex.
11. ANSWER TO POINT NO.4: Whether on the basis of the complaint it could be said that any
offences punishable under Section 3(1)(g), 3(1)(p), 3(1)(q), 3(1)(u), 3(1)(z), 3(1)(zc), 3(2)(va),
3(2)(va), 4 and 4(2)(b) of the POA Act have been made out?
11.1. Initially when a complaint was made, reference was made to Section 3(1)(x) of POA Act which is
reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
"3(1)(x) intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view;"
11.2. Subsequently, a supplementary complaint came to be filed wherein allegations were made that
offences under Section 3(1)(g), 3(1)(p), 3(1)(q), 3(1)(u), 3(1)(z), 3(1)(zc), 3(2)(va), 4 and 4(2)(b) of
POA Act have been committed. 11.2.1. Section 3(1)(g) of POA Act is reproduced hereunder for easy
reference:

Explanation.--For the purposes of clause

(A) against the person's will;
(B) without the person's consent;
(C) with the person's consent, where such consent has been obtained by putting the

11.2.2. The offence under Section 3(1)(g) can only be committed if a member belonging to SC/ST is
wrongfully dispossessed from his land or premises or interference with the enjoyment of his rights.
The contention of Sri.Ravi Kumar is that disconnection of electricity is interference
- 90 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 with the enjoyment of his rights and therefore, offence under Section
3(1)(g) is committed.
11.2.3. The contention of Sri.Ravikumar-
complainant is that it is on account of him being a member of the schedule caste, his enjoyment of
the right over any land, premises or water is interfered with and that he has been insulted and/or
humiliated in public view because of him being a member of scheduled caste. 11.2.4. A reading of the
complaint would indicate that it is on account of maintenance charges not having been paid the
electricity connection has been disconnected. It is this disconnection of electricity which is sought to
be termed as interference with the enjoyment of the
- 91 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 property. Section 3(1)(g) begins with the words "wrongfully", thus for a
person to interfere with the enjoyment of any land, premises or water, such interference has to be
wrongful in order to become an offence under Section 3(1)(g) of the POA Act. In the present case, as
held above, it is on account of non-payment of maintenance charges towards common areas after
giving several opportunities, the Management committee of the Association was required to
disconnect the electricity supply, the same in my considered opinion cannot be said to be wrongful
attracting the offence under Section 3(1)(g) of the POA Act, more so when the complainant himself
has admitted the dues and agreed to make payment of the same if given time.
- 92 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 11.2.5. Having come to a conclusion that the complainant was required
to make payment of the dues towards common amenity charges and that disconnection of electricity
due to non payment is permitted under the Deed of Declaration, I am of the considered opinion that
disconnection of electricity cannot be said to be wrongful interference with the enjoyment of the
rights of the complainant. Hence, no offence under Section 3(1)(g) is made out.
11.2.6. Section 3(1)(p) of POA Act is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
"3(1)(p) institutes false, malicious or vexatious suit or criminal or other legal
proceedings against a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe;
11.2.7. For the offence under Section 3(1)(p) can only said to have been occurred if a

initiated against a member of the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. In the present
case, no suit or criminal proceedings have been initiated let alone false, malicious or
vexatious.
Hence, the question of any offence under Section 3 (1)(p) of POA Act being
committed does not arise.
11.2.8. Section 3(1)(q) of POA Act is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
(q) gives any false or frivolous information to any public servant and thereby causes
such public servant to use his lawful power to the injury or annoyance of a member of
a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe;
11.2.9. Section 3(1)(q) relates to wrongful information being given to any public servant in order to
enable him to use his lawful power to injure or cause annoyance to a member of a Scheduled caste or
- 94 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 scheduled tribe. In the present case, the information which has been
given by the Association or its members to the officers of the electricity department is as regards the
powers and rights vested with the Association on non payment of electricity dues. Therefore, same
cannot be said to be false or frivolous. Hence, no offence under Section 3(1)(q) is made out. 11.2.10.
Section 3(1)(u) of POA Act is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
3(1)(u) by words either written or spoken or by signs or by visible representation or
otherwise promotes or attempts to promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will
against members of the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes;
11.2.11. An offence under Section 3(1)(u) could be made out if a person were to
promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will against members of the Scheduled Caste
or the

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 Scheduled Tribe. The only person involved in this case is the
complainant. There are no other members of Scheduled Caste or the Scheduled Tribe involved in the
present matter. There are no particular allegations in the complaint which would make out such an
offence. There is no usage of the caste of the complainant so as to promote any ill will against him in
the capacity of him being a member of the schedule caste. The only allegation is that he has been
called hooligan, uncivilized, filthy, unruly person, the same is not with reference to his caste,
therefore no offence under Section 3(1)(u) is made out.

(zc) imposes or threatens a social or economic boycott of any person or a family or a

- 97 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 11.2.15. An offence under Section 3(1)(zc) can be made out if social or
economic boycott of a person or family or a group belonging to scheduled caste or scheduled tribe.
There is no such allegation which has been made in the complaint. The complainant has admittedly
participated in the meetings of the association , as such no offence can be made out under the said
provision. 11.2.16. Section 3(2)(va) of POA Act is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
3(2)(va) commits any offence specified in the Schedule, against a person or property,

11.2.18. In the present case, no offence specified in the schedule has..... been committed, let alone
knowing that the complainant belongs to Scheduled Caste. Hence, no offence under Section 3(2)(va)
is made out.
11.3. The provision of POA Act have been brought out to remedy injustice that has been caused to
members belonging to Scheduled Caste and Schedule Tribe Community and to see to it that they are
not further discriminated and that offences as contained in the said Act are not committed against
the members of the Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe Community. This is a beneficial legislation
which has been
- 99 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 brought about for the protection of persons belonging to the Schedule
Caste and Schedule Tribe who may be discriminated, ostracized and/or offences committed against
them. 11.4. The said provision being salutary, the respondent-complainant merely because he
belongs to Scheduled Caste community has sought to abuse and misuse the provisions of the said
Act which is not the purpose of enactment. It would be further required to be observed that when
such beneficial legislations are abused, then the persons who are rightfully entitled to the benefits
thereof, some times also would get deprived of such benefits. The complainant has sought to make
use of beneficial legislation viz., POA Act to not make payment of due amounts required to be made
by him which is deprecated.

C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019
12. Thus exfacie in my considered opinion that no offence under Section 3(1)(g), 3(1)(p), 3(1)(q),
3(1)(u), 3(1)(z), 3(1)(zc), 3(2)(va), 3(2)(va), 4 and 4(2)(b) of the POA Act have been made out.
13. ANSWER TO POINT No.5: Whether the complaint filed is in compliance with the decision of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in Priyanka Srivastava v. State of U.P., [(2015) 6 SCC 287]? 13.1. The contention
of Sri.Ravikumar that there is verifying affidavit enclosed to the complaint, the same is in
compliance with the requirement of Priyanka Srivatsava's case (supra). Relevant portion of the
above decision has been reproduced hereinabove. A perusal of the entire complaint does not
indicate any reference to any complaint made by the petitioner and/or his wife to the jurisdictional
police. It is only after the said issue was pointed out, that the petitioner has produced certain letters
to contend that he had approached the jurisdictional police station for
- 101 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 registration of a complaint and that he had filed complaint with
BESCOM authorities. The complaints to the BESCOM authorities are irrelevant insofar as the
decision of Priyanka Srivatsava's case is concerned. Complaint in PCR No.68/2018 being completely
silent as regards the efforts made by the petitioner to file a complaint, denial of acceptance thereof

Smt Aruna Kannur vs State Of Karnataka By on 12 September, 2022
by the Station House Officer, the escalation by the complainant to superior officers and production
of details thereto, along with affidavit in support thereof would in my considered opinion fall within
the mischief of the decision of Priyanka Srivatsava's case. As such, I am of the considered opinion
that the complaint as filed falls foul of the decision Priyanka Srivatsava's case and on that ground
itself, the order of cognizance is required to be quashed.
- 102 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019
14. ANSWER TO POINT NO.6: Whether the order of the learned Magistrate referring the matter for
investigation is required to be interfered with?
AND ANSWER TO POINT NO.7: Whether this Court ought to exercise powers under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C and quash the complaint or investigation is required?
14.1. The contention of Sri.Ravikumar, party-in-
person by relying on the decision in Neeharika's case (supra) is that this Court ought not to
intercede with the order of investigation and this court ought to permit investigation to go on.
14.2. The decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Neeharika's case (supra) though has stated that
normally this Court should not come in the way of investigation, but has also has observed that in
appropriate cases this Court ought to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash
any complaint which may be an abuse of process of Court.
- 103 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 14.3. The Magistrate in the order of cognizance and direction for
investigation has held as under;
"Complainant present. I head on side of complainant and perused the complaint and
documents and also perused the application filed for restoration of power supply.
Register the case This case is referred under section 156(3) CrPC to ACP Kengeri Sub
Division for investigation. I perused the interlocutory application for restoration of
power supply. Complainant submitted from past________ day he is living in dark
without electricity; drinking water. His wife pursuing Ph.D. could not study due to
disconnection of electricity. Hence it is hereby directed to concerned ACP to see that

14.4. A perusal of the above, the order of reference does not indicate any application of mind made
by the Magistrate as regards the offences alleged against the petitioners. The order passed by the
Magistrate is completely laconic and not in accordance with law of the dicta laid down by this Court
in various matters, as also that by the Hon'ble Apex Court. It is but
- 104 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 required of the Magistrate while ordering investigation to have applied
his mind which application is required to be shown from the order passed by him/her. The order
does not even refer to the provision with which the allegations have been made, there is no reference
to how an offence has been committed, more so when there are allegations made as regards a
provision which did not even exist as on that date. If there is no application of mind in setting the
criminal law in motion, such an order is required to be set-aside. The order passed by the Magistrate
in the present matter qualifies for being set-aside. 14.5. As already I have come to a conclusion that
complaint is an abuse of process of court and filed with sole intention of availing of all benefits and
common amenities etc., without making payment for the same, a reading of the entire complaint as
a whole does not exfacie
- 105 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 indicate any offence requiring investigation. The complaint being an
abuse of process of Court is required to be quashed and the order of cognizance passed by the
Magistrate is required to be set-aside.
14.6. In view of the above finding, the complaint itself being an abuse of process of court, there
would be no purpose served by further investigation and subjecting the petitioners to such
investigation on the basis of false complaint.
15. ANSWER TO POINT NO.8: What Order?
15.1. In view of the answers above, I pass the following;
ORDER i. The order dated 27.12.2018 in PCR No.68/2018 for investigation under Section 156(3) of
Cr.P.C. is hereby quashed.
ii. The order dated 29.12.2018 referring the supplementary complaint for investigation
- 106 -
C/W WP No.27468 OF 2019 under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. is hereby quashed. Consequently, the
FIR in Cr. No.82/2019 registered by the Kengeri Police Station, Bangalore is quashed.
iii. Private complaint and PCR No.68/2018 is hereby quashed.

iv. W.P. Nos.13059/2019 and 27468/2019 are allowed.
v. Considering the nature of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that costs would also have to
be imposed on the respondent- complainant/party-in-person. As such costs is quantified at
Rs.25,000/-, payable to the Association of Apartment Owners within a period of four weeks from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
vi. All pending IA's are consigned to file.
