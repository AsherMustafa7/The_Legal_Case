[2] The present writ petition has been filed by the petitioner under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India praying inter alia for issuance of a writ in the nature of

are that the petitioner was initially appointed as Account Clerk of DRDA, Bishnupur vide order
dated 16.05.2000 on Ad hoc basis for a period of six months or till the post is filled up on regular
basis. Subsequently, a special DPC was held on 15.11.2000 for regularization of the Staffs of DRDA,
Bishnupur and the service of the petitioner was considered. Accordingly, the DC/Executive Director,
DRDA, Bishnupur, issued an order dated 20.11.2000 whereby the Ad-hoc service of the petitioner
was regularized against a regular vacancy w.e.f. 15.11.2000.

[4] While in service, the DC/ Executive Director, DRDA, Bishnupur
issued an order dated 09.09.2016 whereby the petitioner was terminated from service w.e.f. 29.02.
2016 in connection with FIR case No.24(2) 2016 BPR- PS u/s 403/409/468/477-A/34 IPC
submitted by the Superintendent of Police, Bishnupur District, Manipur. In the said order dated
09.09.2016, the petitioner was charged for withdrawal of Rs. 12(twelve) lakh without authorization
from the State Bank of India, Bishnupur Brach. He was also charged for forgoing the signature of
Executive Director DRDA and Executive Engineer, DRDA Bishnupur who were the joint-operators
of the said account, in withdrawing a sum of Rs. 15 Lakhs without authorization. Further, the
petitioner was charged for changing the join-operators of the said account by writing a letter dated
19.10.2015 address to the Manager, SBI, Bishnupur by forging the signature of the Executive
Director, DRDA, Bishnupur.
[5] The petitioner, being aggrieved by his termination order dated 09.09.2016, filed a writ petition
being WP(C)No.74 of 2018 challenging the said termination order and this Court vide its order
dated 10.08.2018 disposed of the writ petition being WP(C)No.74 of 2018 with a direction that the
termination order dated 09.09.2016 be quashed and set aside coupled with WP(C)No. 437 of 2023
Page 3 the direction that the petitioner shall be paid his back wages from the date on which he was
terminated from service, giving liberty to the State to proceed afresh against the petitioner.
[6] It is stated in the petition that despite having knowledge of the Court's order dated 10.08.2018
passed in WP(C)No.74 of 2018, the respondents did not comply and having no alternative, the
petitioner filed a contempt petition being Cont. Cas(C)No.197 of 2018 for non-compliance of the
Court's order dated 10.08.2018 passed in WP(C)No.74 of 2018. During the pendency of the said
contempt case, the respondents issued compliance order dated 02.12.2021 whereby the petitioner

Ningthoujam Marjit Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 10 April, 2024
was reinstated and regularized against the created post of Accountant in DRDA Wing, Directorate of
Rural Development & Panchayati Raj Department.
[7] It is further stated in the petition that the Director, Rural Development & Panchayati Raj,
Manipur issued suspension order dated 24.01.2023, impugned in the present writ petition and
accordingly, the petitioner was kept under suspension from service with immediate effect by
invoking Rule 10 of the C.C.S. (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules, 1965. It is stated the
suspension order dated 24.01.2023 has not been reviewed nor WP(C)No. 437 of 2023 Page 4
extended after the expiry of 90 days in violation of the mandatory provisions of Rule 10(6) & (7) of
CSS(CCA) Rules, 1965. The petitioner submitted a representation dated 02.05.2023 to the Director,
RD&PR, Manipur requesting to revoke/quash the suspension order dated 24.01.2023 in terms of
Rule 10(7) of CSS(CCA) Rules, 1965. Similar prayer is also made in the present writ petition.
[8] Vide order dated 30.05.2023, this Court issued notice and learned GA sought for 10 days' time to
get instruction as to whether the period of suspension was extended or not. However, neither
counter affidavit was filed nor any intimation was given about the status of the suspension order.
The matter was heard on available record and vide order dated 07.12.2023, learned GA was
permitted to submit status report of the FIR within one week and the status report dated 11.12.2023
was duly submitted. [9] Mr. M. Rendy, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that even after
expiry of 90 days from the date of suspension, ie, 24.01.2023, the respondent did not pass any order
reviewing the suspension order and extending the same in violation of statutory provisions. Learned
counsel draws the attention of this Court to the provisions of Rule 10 sub rule 6 of CSS (CCA) Rules,
1965 stipulating for review of the suspension order to modify or revoke WP(C)No. 437 of 2023 Page
5 before the expiry of 90 days. Sub rule 7 invalidates any suspension order after expiry of 90 days
unless the same is extended after review by competent authority. It is submitted that in the present
case, the suspension order has not been extended after the expiry of the mandatory 90 days and
continuation of the suspension order beyond this period is invalid. Reliance is placed on decisions of
this Court in (i) order dated 25.07.2016 in WP(C) No. 966 of 2015, etc., (ii) order dated 06.05.2022
in WP(C) No. 132 of 2020 and (iii) order dated 16.09.2022 in WP(C) No. 149 of 2022, whereas
suspension order beyond 90 days were quashed as the same were not extended after review. It is
also pointed out that the disciplinary proceedings contemplated against the petitioner is also a
non-starter and no document has been supplied to the petitioner till date. It is reiterated that the
petitioner is now on bail in the FIR. It is prayed that similar relief be granted in the present case by
quashing the suspension order dated 24.01.2023 for violation of Rule 10(6) & (7) of CSS(CCA)
Rules, 1965.
[10] Per contra, Mr. Shyam Sharma, learned GA has submitted that mere lapse of 90 days will not
itself be a ground for quashing the suspension order when the petitioner has been charged of serious
allegation of withdrawing large amount of money of the office without any authorization and
WP(C)No. 437 of 2023 Page 6 by tempering. Learned GA relies on a decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Allahabad Bank v. Deepak Kumar Bhola: (1997) 4 SCC 1 @ Para 11
where it was held that mere pendency of criminal case for 10 years would not be a ground for
reinstatement of an employee of bank who was involved in corruption and misappropriation of
money. It is prayed that the writ petition be dismissed being devoid of any merit.

Ningthoujam Marjit Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 10 April, 2024
[11] This Court has considered the materials on record, the submissions made at bar and the
relevant provisions specially Rule 10 of CSS(CCA) Rules, 1965 with regard to suspension of a
government employee. [12] It is an admitted fact that the suspension order is not extended. In the
case in hand the suspension order dated 24.01.20223 was issued in contemplation of a disciplinary
proceeding against the petitioner under Rule 10 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control
& Appeal) Rules, 1965 and also in compliance of order dated 10.08.2018 passed by this Court in
WP(C) No. 74 of 2018 to proceed afresh against the petitioner. However, even after expiry of 90
days, the suspension order has not been reviewed nor extended. This is in clear violation of the
mandatory provisions of Rule 10 sub rules 6 & 7. The proceeding of the disciplinary enquiry has not
been initiated till date. The decision of Allahabad Bank (supra) as cited by learned GA is WP(C)No.
437 of 2023 Page 7 not applicable in the fact of the present case. In that case, the suspension order
was issued in view of pending criminal proceeding, whereas in the case in hand, the suspension
order was issued in contemplation of a disciplinary proceeding. Pendency of criminal case shall not
come as a hindrance against the petitioner in revoking the suspension order.
[13] In the circumstances, the suspension order dated 24.01.2023 is quashed and the petitioner be
reinstated to his post of Accountant in the office of respondent No.2 forthwith. It is also directed
that the disciplinary proceeding against the petitioner, if any, shall be concluded within a period of 6
months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, failing which such proceeding shall be
treated as closed. No cost.
[14] Send a copy of this order to the respondent No.2 [Director, RD&PR, Manipur] for information
and necessary compliance.
