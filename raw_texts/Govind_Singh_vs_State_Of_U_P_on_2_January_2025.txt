counsel for the applicant submits that according to the FIR, on the information received from the
Mukhbir, the Police Patrolling Party recovered 21 cattle (17 live and 4 dead) from a DCM Truck
bearing Registration No. UP 86 AT 4736, which was being driven by the co-accused Gyanendra
Kumar Singh and another vehicle Scorpio bearing Registration No. HR 51 AU 5657 which was being
driven by the another co-accused Sonu Kumar. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that
co-accused Gyanendra Kumar Singh has already been enlarged on bail by co-ordinate Bench of this
Court on 20.12.2024 in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 43170 of 2024. The applicant has no
criminal antecedent to his credit. There is no likelihood of his fleeing from course of justice or
tampering with evidence in case of release on bail. Hence, bail has been prayed for.
Learned AGA has vehemently opposed, but could not dispute the fact that applicant has no criminal
antecedents.
Considering all those facts and circumstances, the nature of accusations, severity of the punishment
in the case of conviction and nature of supporting evidence, reasonable apprehension of tampering
with the witness and prima-facie case, but without commenting on merit of case, a case for bail is
made out.
Accordingly, the bail application is allowed.
Let the accused-applicant, Govind Singh, involved in above mentioned case crime number be
released on bail, on his executing a personal bond and two reliable sureties each, in the like amount
to the satisfaction of the court concerned, subject to the following conditions:
1. The applicant will not tamper with the evidence.
2. The applicant will not indulge in any criminal activity.
3. The applicant will not pressurize/intimidate the prosecution witnesses and
co-operate in the trial.
4. The applicant will appear regularly on each and every date fixed by the trial court,
unless his personal appearance is exempted through counsel by the court concerned.
In the event of breach of any of the aforesaid conditions, the court below will be at liberty to proceed
to cancel his bail.
