ORDER
When the matter came up for hearing, it is represented by learned counsel for both sides that the
matter has been settled in respect of several petitioners except petitioner Nos.13, 20 and 21 and it is
just and necessary that orders be passed with reference to the other petitioners except petitioner
Nos.13, 20 and 21 and this writ petition will be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis continued in
respect of three petitioners namely, petitioner Nos.13, 20 and 21 and let the matter be called on
10.01.2025 for further hearing.
2. With reference to the other petitioners, a joint memo of compromise dated 21.12.2024 is filed.
3. In respect of petitioners except petitioners Nos.13, 20 and 21, this Writ Petition is disposed of by
recording the joint memorandum of compromise dated 21.12.2024 and terms of settlement under
Section 18 of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 [ID Act] entered into between the parties shall form
part of the order.
4. Since the lumpsum payment is also made to the workmen as per the compromise, this Court adds
that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of O.P.Bhandari Vs. Indian Tourism
Development Corporation Limited and others reported in (1986) 4 SCC 377 in paragraph No.10(VI)
held as follows:
"VI - Since the amount is being paid in one lump sum, it is likely that the employer
may take recourse to Section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which provides that any
person responsible for paying any income chargeable under the head 'Salaries', shall,
at the time of payment, deduct income tax on the amount payable at the average rate
of income computed on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the basis of the rates in
force for the financial year in which the payment is made, on the estimated income of
the assessee under this head for that financial year. If, therefore, the employer
proceeds to deduct Income- tax as provided by Section 192, we would like to make it
abundantly clear that the appellant would be entitled to relief under Section 89 of the
Income Tax Act which provides that where by reason of any portion of assessee's
salary being paid in arrears or in advance by reason of his having received in any one
financial year salary for more than 12 months or a payment which under the
provisions of clause (3) of Section 17 is a profit in lieu of salary, his income is assessed
at a higher rate than that it would otherwise have been assessed, the Income Tax
officer shall on an application made to him in this behalf grant such relief as may be
prescribed. The prescribed relief is set out in Rule 21-A of the Income Tax Rules. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64195539/ 3
S/O.P.N.Sundharam vs The Management on 21 December, 2024
appellant is entitled to relief under Section 89 because compensation herein awarded
includes salary which has been in arrears as also the compensation in lieu of
reinstatement and the relief should be given as provided by Section 89 of the Income
Tax Act read with Rule 21-A of the IncomeTax Rules. The appellant is indisputably
entitled to the same. If any application is required to be made, the appellant may
submit the same to the competent authority and the Corporation shall, through its
Tax Consultant, assist the appellant for obtaining the relief. The appeal is allowed.
The order of the High Court is set aside.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Order in the aforesaid terms is passed."
5. Further in Sundaram Motors Private Limited Vs. Ameerjan and another reported in AIR 1985 SC
144, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:
"7. We have made it abundantly clear in our judgment and order dated August 7,
1984 that the compensation awarded is in lieu of back wages, and future wages in lieu
of reinstatement which were and would be payable from year to year. Therefore, we
made it very clear that the entire amount awarded by our judgment shall be spread
over from 1970 to 1989, 1970 being the year of dismissal from service and 1989 being
the year of retirement on superannuation as per the relevant service rules. We are
accordingly clear in our minds that viewed from any angle, respondent- Ameerjan,
the workman is fully entitled to the relief under Section 89 of the Income Tax Act. No
other view on this point is possible. In order to satisfy the requirements of law, the
respondent-Ameerjan shall with the assistance of the appellant and its income-tax
consultants make the necessary application to the Income Tax Officer having
jurisdiction in the matter at Bangalore for relief under Section 89 and the officer
concerned shall, without further enquiry, grant him immediate relief under Section
89 and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis dispose of the proceedings within a period
of three months from the date of the application so that the spirit and purpose of our
judgment and order would be implemented without unnecessary delay and the agony
and torture of unemployment heaped upon the lowly paid respondent Ameerjan from
1970 be relieved."
6. Therefore, in the present case also, the workmen will be entitled to the same benefit in respect of
one lumpsum payment and the authorities shall act accordingly. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petition is closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
