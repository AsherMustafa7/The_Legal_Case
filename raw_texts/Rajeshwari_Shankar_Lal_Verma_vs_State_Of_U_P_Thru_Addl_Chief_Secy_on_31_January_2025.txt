Rajeshwari Shankar Lal Verma vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief Secy. ... on 31 January, 2025
opposite party nos.4 to 9 in Case Crime No.0192/2024, under Sections 191(2), 103
and 238 of Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 at the Police Station Mandhata, District
Pratapgarh, as contained in Annexure No.1 to this writ petition."
4. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has lodged an F.I.R.
and it is a case of murder, but no steps have been taken by the Investigating Officer to conduct the
investigation fairly. Hence this petition has been filed.
5. Learned A.G.A., on the basis of instructions, says that the F.I.R. was lodged only on 25.12.2024,
but till 25.01.2025 seven parchis have been issued and statements of various witnesses have also
been recorded including of one who lives in Mumbai.
6. Learned A.G.A. has also raised a preliminary objection saying that for the relief, as claimed in this
petition, the petitioner has statutory remedy of filing a Complaint/ Application before the Judicial
Magistrate, concerned, under Section 175(3) of B.N.S.S. (corresponding Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.) as
observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sakiri Vasu Vs. State of U.P. and Others
reported in 2008 (2) SCC 409, an application can be filed to the Magistrate concerned, who has very
wide powers to direct and ensure a proper investigation. He can also monitor such investigation that
the investigation is done properly.
7. This petition is finally disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to approach the Magistrate
concerned under Section 175(3) of B.N.S.S. (corresponding Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.), who shall look
into the matter and ensure that justice is done to the Complainant/ Informant.
