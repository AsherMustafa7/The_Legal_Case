ORDER
The petitioner has challenged notice under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short ‘Act’)
dated 21.02.2019, reasons for re-assessment dated 22.03.2018, consequent notice dated 13.06.2019
and order dated 24.06.2019 rejecting the assumption of jurisdiction under Section 147 of the Act.
2. In regard to Assessment Year (AY) 2012-13, a return of income had been filed on 29.11.2012 along
with tax audit report and financials, followed by a revised return. An intimation dated 30.01.2014 in
terms of Section 143(1) was issued. Inter alia, the foreign tax credit claimed by the petitioner was
denied. Thereafter, notice under Section 143(2) was issued and there was exchange of
communications https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ between the petitioner and the department in
regard to the issues that arose from the returns of income. Specifically, a hard copy of the return of
income, financial statements and tax audit report were sought, that were supplied by the petitioner.
The petitioner sought rectification of the intimation on various grounds including the rejection of
the foreign tax credit claimed. This rectification petition is admittedly pending as on date. The
proceedings for assessment did not culminate in an order of assessment under Section 143(3).
3. On 19.12.2018, the petitioner intimated the respondent/assessing authority that Asianet
Communication Private Limited (ACPL) had amalgamated with Vijay Television Private Limited
(VTPL), and by order dated 30.07.2020 passed by the National Company Law Tribunal, the
appointed date will be 01.10.2017. The name of the assessee consequently stood amended to Asianet
Star Communication Private Limited (ASCPL) and its business address was changed to Plot No.SP
22, TS No.25, Block No.5, 7,8,9, 10th Floor, Kochar Jade, Thiru Vi Ka Industrial Estate, Guindy,
Chennai, Tamil Nadu – 600 032 and the aforesaid detail was also intimated to the respondent on
10.01.2019.

4. Notwithstanding the intimation regarding change of name and address, the impugned notice
under Section 148 came to be issued in the name of ACPL to No.15, Jaganathan Road,
Nungambakkam, Chennai – 600 034 on 21.02.2019, on which date, no such entity by that name
existed.
5. In line with the procedure set out by the Supreme Court in the case of GKN Driveshafts (India)
Ltd. V. Income Tax Officer (259 ITR 19), the petitioner enclosed the revised return filed earlier by it
and also sought reasons on the basis of which jurisdiction had been assumed for re-assessment. The
respondent was intimated yet again, about the merger of the erstwhile entity with VTPL and the
change of name to ASCPL.
6. Reasons for reopening dated 22.03.2019 were supplied reading as follows:

eligible @ September, 30%) 7.5%) 2010 i.e. for < 180 Days) Total 74,07,685 33,74,848
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ The nature of Item is ‘Plant and Machinery’ eligible for
depreciation @ 15% which works out to Rs.33,74,848/- as noted in Column No.5 of the above Table.
Thus, there is excess depreciation claimed of Rs.40,32,837/-.
2. It is also seen that there is claim of excess relief u/s 90/91 and also tax credit in ITR is less than
tax credit in 26AS.
3. Therefore, for the reasons discussed in Paras (1) & (2) above, I have reason to believe that there is
escapement of income within the meaning of u/s 147 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, in the instant case
for the A.Y.2012-13 due to the failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all
material facts necessary for its assessment.
........
Asst. Commissioner of Income-tax Non Corporate Circle-20(1), Chennai.
7. The two issues on which jurisdiction has been assumed are i) claim of depreciation on computers,
ii) alleged excess relief of tax credit under Section 90/91 of the Act since the tax credit in the income
tax return was less than the tax credit reflected in Form 26AS. The petitioner filed objections dated
06.05.2019 on the assumption of jurisdiction pointing out that there was no new or tangible
material on the basis of which the proceedings for re-assessment has been initiated. The petitioner
relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in the case of CIT V. Foramer France (264 ITR 566),
Commissioner of Income Tax V. Corporation Bank Ltd. (254 ITR 791) Radhasoami Satsang V.
Commissioner of Income Tax (193 ITR
321) CIT V. Excel Industries Limited (358 ITR 295) and CIT V. Gopala Naicker Bangaru (236 CTR
82) contending that the issues on the basis of which the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
proceedings had been initiated had been reflected in the return of income and annexures called for
in the course of assessment, and hence there was no basis for the re-assessment. The objections
however came to be rejected on 24.06.2019 relying on the decisions of the Supreme Court in
Raymond Woollen Mills Ltd. V. Income Tax Officer (236 ITR 34) and a Division Bench of the Delhi
High Court in the case of AGR Investments Limited V. Additional Commissioner of Income Tax
(333 ITR 146), challenging which the present writ petition has come to be filed.
8. Heard Mr.Porus F.Kaka, learned Senior Counsel for Mr.Srinath Sridevan, learned counsel for the
petitioner and Mrs.Hema Muralikrishnan, learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondent.
9. This is a case where the proceedings for re-assessment have been initiated beyond a period of four
years from the end of the relevant assessment year, i.e., A.Y. 2012-13, at the fag end of six year
period. The proviso to Section 147 states that where an assessment had been completed under
scrutiny at the first instance, the time available to the department to initiate proceedings for
re-assessment would be extended from four to six years, conditional upon the officer establishing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119209907/ 4
M/S.Asianet Star Communications ... vs Assistant Commissioner Of Income Tax on 4 December, 2020
that the escapement of income was attributable to the failure of the assessee to have failed to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ file a return of income or to have made a full and true disclosure
of income in the return of income.
10. In the instant case, the proceedings at the first instance have not resulted in an order of
assessment under Section 143(3). However, in my view, this would not lead to the assumption that
there was no application of mind to the issues arising from the return of income as the Assessing
Officer has issued a notice in terms of Section 143(2) on 02.09.2014, called for the income tax return
and annexures and conducted a personal hearing on 11.09.2014. The petitioner has filed a written
submission on 15.09.2014, received and acknowledgement by the respondent on the same day
enclosing a copy of the return of income, financial statements with all schedules and annexures and
Auditors’ Report under Section 44AB of the Act with all annexures. All material particulars in regard
to the probable issues emanating from the return of income are on record before the Assessing
Authority.
11. Initiation of scrutiny is by issuance of a notice under Section 143(2) and this has been done in
this case. Not only has the Assessing Officer issued a notice, he has conducted a hearing and sought
various particulars and this, in my view, is tantamounts to the process of scrutiny. The passing of an
order or otherwise is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ entirely within the control of the Officer and
in such circumstances the fact that no order of assessment has been passed cannot be held against
the assessee/petitioner. I am conscious of, and hasten to add that this is not of universal proposition
and has to be examined against the facts and circumstances in every case to decide whether the
officer has displayed application of mind to the matter. In this case, a comparison of the details
sought for by the Officer and supplied by the petitioner at the stage of original assessment and of the
reasons for re-assessment that is, depreciation and foreign tax credit reveal total identity of the
issues, identified at the time of original assessment and the reasons on the basis of which
proceedings for re-assessment have been initiated. Moreover, and admittedly, there is no new
material, let alone tangible material, that has come to the notice of the authority to justify the
impugned proceeding for re-assessment.
12. As far as the claim of depreciation is concerned, the Officer proceeds on the ground that
computers constitute plant and machinery, eligible for depreciation at 15% and not 60% as claimed
by the petitioner. Learned Senior Standing Counsel would submit that as the petitioner is in the
business of media and communication and operates a television channel, computers and all
accessories thereof would https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ assume a far more integral role in the
business, as such equipment would support editing, graphics, sound effects and other facilities
intrinsic to the business.
13. Though an attractive argument, such distinction has not been envisaged in Appendix I
(depreciation schedule), and Part A/Tangible Assets, categorises all computers under the head
‘Machinery and Plant’, eligible for depreciation at 60%. Moreover, the depreciation statement
referred to in the reasons recorded, was admittedly on record from the commencement of original
proceedings.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119209907/ 5
M/S.Asianet Star Communications ... vs Assistant Commissioner Of Income Tax on 4 December, 2020
14. The above conclusion would be equally, if not more relevant, to the second issue concerning the
alleged claim of excess tax credit. The reasons state that excess relief under Section 90/91 has been
claimed and the tax credit in the income tax return is less than the tax credit in the 26AS. In such an
event I see no escapement of income to tax, as the petitioner, going as per Form 26AS, has more tax
to its credit as against what was claimed in the return of income.
15. Moreover, the tax credit claimed has been rejected in full in intimation dated 30.01.2014 and the
petitioner has sought rectification of the intimation on 09.05.2017 and restoration of the credit
claimed. There is thus no prejudice that has been caused to the revenue in regard to the claim of
foreign tax credit and the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ initiation of re-assessment proceedings
on this ground is found to be misconceived, in light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax V. Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd. (198 ITR297).
16. As regards the decisions relied on by the revenue, they turn on the sufficiency of reasons
recorded. The Court had rejected the challenge for re- assessment on the ground that they will not,
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, test the sufficiency of reasons recorded. These
decisions are distinguishable, since I have in the present matter, looked to the reasons only for the
limited aspect of comparing the issues raised therein with the issues raised at the time of initial
proceedings for assessment and the material on the basis of which the impugned proceedings were
initiated.
17. There is yet another point. The petitioner has, on 19.12.2018, brought to the notice of the
Assessing Officer the factum of amalgamation. Though initially a tentative argument was put forth
to the effect that this letter was not received by the officer, I find a seal at the bottom of the letter
along with tracking number of the communication making it clear that the communication has been
delivered to the addressee, i..e, ACIT, Non-corporate Circle 20(1), the respondent herein. On
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ 10.01.2019, the change of name of the petitioner from VTPL to
ASCPL has also been communicated to the respondent and this communication has been received
on 14.01.2019. Thus, both the factum of amalgamation and change of name have been duly
intimated to the Officer. Despite this, notice under Section 148 has been issued to ACPL, which, in
my view invalidates the proceedings in full. The fact that the petitioner has responded to the notice
would not bring to life an invalid proceeding. The response of the petitioner has been on the letter
head of ASCPL, the reasons have been communicated to ASCPL and the objections of the petitioner
to the assumption of jurisdiction have been filed on the letter head of ASCPL. Despite the reiteration
of the fact of amalgamation and change of name by the petitioner on 21.03.2019 in response to
notice under Section 148 of the Act, Section 143(2) notice has been issued to ACPL, a non-existing
entity.
18. In the light of the above, impugned notice dated 21.02.2019, reasons for re-assessment dated
22.03.2018, consequent notice dated 13.06.2019 and order dated 24.06.2019 rejecting the
assumption of jurisdiction under Section 147 of the Act are quashed.
