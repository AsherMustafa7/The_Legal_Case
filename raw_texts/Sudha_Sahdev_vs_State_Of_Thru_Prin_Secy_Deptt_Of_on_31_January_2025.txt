4. For the sake of convenience, the order dated 29.01.2025 is reproduced as under:
"1. Heard.
2. Contention of the leaned counsel for the petitioner is that by means of the order
impugned dated 18.01.2025, a copy of which is Annexure-1 to the petition, the
respondent-University has rejected the claim of the petitioner for promotion to the
post of Principal Private Secretary.
3. It is contended that in one part of the order, the respondents have indicated that
confidential records of 5 preceding years are only to be seen while in the operative
portion of the rejection order they have indicated that 8 years confidential records
are to be seen, which indicates that the respondents themselves are unsure of number
of the years the records are to be seen.
4. Other contention is that considering that the respondents themselves in one part of
the order have indicated that only 5 years' confidential records are to be seen
consequently the records for the years 2019 to 2023 were to be seen.
5. It is further contended that as per the benchmark, which has been adopted as
indicated in the order impugned, which is 'good' which as per the preceding 5 years'
confidential records should be good in all 5 years. In case any entry which is below
the bench mark of 'good' the same should have been communicated by the
respondents to the petitioner and upon the same having not communicated, it could
not have been relied upon for the purpose of rejection of claim of the petitioner for
promotion more particularly when the promotion is based on seniority cum fitness.
6. Shri Shubham Tripathi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-University
prays for and is granted 24 Hours' time to seek instructions on the following aspects:-
(a) As to how many years' confidential records are to be seen;
(b) As to the benchmark which has been prescribed for consideration of promotion;
and
(c) As to whether any entry which is below the benchmark for the aforesaid years has
ever been communicated to the petitioner.
7. Considering that the petitioner is said to be retiring on 31.01.2025, list this case day after
tomorrow."
5. Shri Shubham Tripathi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent(s)-University with
regard to the queries as have been raised by this Court in para 6 of the order dated 29.01.2025, on
the basis of instructions sent by Deputy Registrar of the University dated 30.01.2025 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31764339/ 2
Sudha Sahdev vs State Of Thru. Prin. Secy. Deptt Of ... on 31 January, 2025
31.01.2025, states that (i) an information was sought by the University from the SGPGI with which
rules the University is governed as to the benchmark which has to be followed and it has been
informed that five preceding years confidential records are to be seen;
(b) as regards the benchmank, the benchmark prescribed for the said post is "good"; and
(c) as regards the entry which was below the benchmark, it is contended that the entry which was
below the benchmark of "good" was "satisfactory" for the year 2019-20 which was not
communicated to the petitioner as the same was not found to be per se adverse.
6. Shri Tripathi states that five preceding years would be the years from 2019-20 to 2023-24.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the issue in question has been considered
threadbare by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.K. Jibanlata Devi vs. High Court of
Manipur and Others 2023 SCC OnLine SC 178 wherein the Hon'ble after considering its earlier
judgments has held as under:
"20. In the present case the petitioner got "Good" gradings for the year 2016-17 and
received "Very Good" gradings in her ACRS for the years 2017-18 and 2018-2019. It
was the specific case on behalf of the petitioner which has not been denied that the
ACRs grading of "Good" for the year 2016-17 was never communicated to the
petitioner even till the DPC met. Therefore, as per the law laid down by this Court in
catena of decisions more particularly, as observed and held by this Court in Rukhsana
Shaheen Khan (supra); Sukhdev Singh (supra) and Dev Dutt v. Union of India,
(2008) 8 SCC 725 uncommunicated adverse ACRs may be even with "Good" entry
which can be said to be adverse in the context of eligibility for promotion is not to be
relied upon for consideration of promotion.
..................
23. The sum and substance of the aforesaid discussion would be that as the ACR
Grading of "Good" for the year 2016-17 was not communicated till the DPC met, the
same is to be ignored and/or be not relied upon for consideration of promotion.
Similarly, the grading for the year 2019-2020 also is to be excluded and/or be not
relied upon for consideration for promotion as the same was communicated on
08.04.2021 and the petitioner was granted 15 days' time to make representation and
before the representation could be made the DPC met on 09.04.2021 and considered
the case of the petitioner for promotion.
...................
26. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the case of the petitioner
for promotion to the post of Assistant Registrar as on 09.04.2021 is required to be
considered afresh ignoring the uncommunicated ACRs for the years 2016-17 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31764339/ 3
Sudha Sahdev vs State Of Thru. Prin. Secy. Deptt Of ... on 31 January, 2025
2019-20 and her case is required to be considered afresh taking into consideration
the ACRS for the years 2017-18 & 2018-19 for which the petitioner was having "Very
Good" gradings.
27. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present petition is allowed.
The DPC proceedings dated 09.04.2021 denying the promotion to the petitioner for
the post of Assistant Registrar are hereby quashed and set aside. The case of the
petitioner for promotion to the post of Assistant Registrar as on 09.04.2021 i.e., the
date on which the juniors came to be promoted is directed to be considered afresh
ignoring the uncommunicated ACRS for the years 2016-17 and 2019-20 and
thereafter the DPC/competent authority to take a fresh decision in accordance with
law and taking into consideration the ACRS of remaining years, i.e., 2017-18 and
2018-19. Such an exercise be completed within a period of six weeks from today.
28. In case after fresh exercise as above the petitioner is promoted to the post of
Assistant Registrar, it goes without saying that she shall be entitled to all the
consequential benefits including the arrears, seniority etc. w.e.f. 09.04.2021 the day
on which the juniors came to be promoted."
8. From perusal of the aforesaid judgment of R.K. Jibanlata Devi (supra), it emerges that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the ACRs, which are below the benchmark and which have not
been communicated, cannot be relied upon for consideration of promotion. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court has further held that the case of promotion would have to be considered with effect from the
date the juniors were promoted afresh ignoring the uncommunicated ACRs for the relevant years.
9. Learned Standing counsel for the respondent No.1 as well as Shri Shubham Tripathi, learned
counsel for the respondent-University do not dispute the aforesaid position of law laid down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court.
10. From a perusal of the facts as emerge in the instant case, it would be apparent that the entry
which was below the benchmark of "good" for the year 2019-20, which was "satisfactory", was not
communicated to the petitioner and the same has been considered by the DPC. Admittedly, one of
the juniors of the petitioner namely Shri Rachna Malik has been promoted while the claim of the
petitioner for promotion has been rejected.
11. So far as the argument of Shri Shubham Tripathi that the entry for the year 2019-20 having not
been found to be per se adverse was not communicated is concerned, the same may not detain the
Court keeping in view the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.K. Jibanlata
Devi (supra).
12. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the writ petition is allowed. The order impugned dated
18.01.2025, a copy of which is annexure 1 to the petition, is quashed. The respondent-University is
directed to consider the claim of the petitioner for promotion to the post of Principal Private
Secretary of the University ignoring the uncommunicated ACR for the year 2019-20. The DPC /

competent authority shall take a fresh decision in accordance with law within a period of four weeks
from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. In case the petitioner is found fit, she would
be entitled for promotion with effect from the date from which promotion has been granted to the
petitioner's junior with all consequential benefits.
13. As regards the claim of the petitioner for grant of the 2nd upgradation under the NACP is
concerned, it would be open for the petitioner to submit a representation in this regard to the
competent authority within a period of two weeks along with certified copy of this order. In case the
said representation is submitted then the competent authority shall proceed to decide the same in
accordance with law and the relevant rules. Let such a decision be taken within a period of four
weeks from the date of receipt of the said representation.
