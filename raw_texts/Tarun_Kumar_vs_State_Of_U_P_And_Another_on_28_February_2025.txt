proceedings of Case No3 2020 (State Vs. Tarun Kumar Kumar Valmiki), arising out
of Case Crime No.454 2020 under section 376 (2)(n), 323,504 and 506 I.P.C.., P.S.-
Kotwali, District- Bareilly, pending before the Court of Additional Seesion Judge,
Fast Track Court Bareilly pending before the Court of Additional Seesion Judge, Fast
Track Court Bareilly.
The Hon'ble Court further be pleased to stay the further proceeding of Case No. 5853
of 2020 (State Vs. Tarun Kumar Kumar Valmiki), arising out of Case Crime No.454
202 under section 376 (2)(n), 323, 504 and 506 I.P.C.., P.S. Kotwali, District-
Bareilly, as well as cognizance order dated 05.02.2020, during the pendency of the
present criminal application before this Hon'ble Court, and/or pass such other
suitable order or direction which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper under
the facts and circumstances of the case, otherwise the applicant will suffer great
irreparable loss and injury."
4. Learned counsel for applicant submits that though applicant is a named and charge sheeted
accused and facing trial before Court below, however, in view of the peculiar facts and circumstance
of the case as have emerged on record, the criminal prosecution of applicant cannot be sustained
any further. As such, present application is liable to be allowed.
5. In furtherance of aforesaid submission, the learned counsel for applicant submits that present
criminal prosecution of applicant commenced, when the FIR dated 01.09.2020 was lodged by
prosecutrix/first informant opposite party-2 Resham Maurya and was registered as Case Crime
No.454 202 under section 376 (2)(n), 323, 504 and 506 I.P.C.., P.S. Kotwali, District- Bareilly. In
the aforesaid FIR, five persons namely (1) Tarun Kumar Valmiki (2) Ashok Kumar Valmiki (3) Smt.
Manju (4) Ashish Rajoriya and (5) Ankur have been nominated as named accused.
6. However, subsequent to the aforementioned FIR, the applicant solemnized marriage with the
prosecutrix on 14.02.2023. As such, the prosecutrix is now the legally wedded wife of applicant. By
reason of above, she is residing with the applicant as his legally wedded wife. Marriage so
solemnized by the parties has also been registered under the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Marriage
Registration Rules, 2017. Since marriage of the parties is registered therefore, there is a legal
presumption with regard to the validity and legality of marriage of the parties. On the above
premise, the learned counsel for applicant submits that in view of abovenoted subsequent
developments that have taken place, the criminality if any, committed by applicant now stands
washed off. It is further contended by the learned counsel for applicant that the bona fide of the
parties is further explicit from the fact that prosecutrix has joined the applicant in present
proceedings inamuch as the affidavit filed in support of present application has been sworn by the
prosecutrix herself. As such, no useful purpose shall be served in prolonging the criminal
prosecution of applicant. In case the criminal prosecution of applicant is allowed to continue, then a
happy family shall stand broken. To buttress his submission he has referred to the judgments of
Supreme Court in K. Dhandapani Vs. State by the Inspector of Police 2022 SCC Online SC 1056 and
Mafat Lal and Another Vs. State of Rajasthan 2022 SCC Online SC 433, wherein, the Apex Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46978174/ 2
Tarun Kumar vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
quashed the criminal prosecution of applicant on the ground that the accused has solemnized
marriage with the prosecutrix. As such, present application is liable to be allowed.
7. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1 and the learned counsel representing
first informant opposite party-2 have no objection to the submissions urged by the learned counsel
for applicant.
8. Mr. Kinshuk Shukla, the learned counsel representing first informant-opposite party-2 on the
other hand upon instructions received by him submits that he has been instructed not to oppose this
application. He further contends that it is an admitted fact that the prosecutrix has solemnized
marriage with applicant and she is now residing with the applicant as his legally wedded wife. He
therefore, contends that he cannot have any objection in case, the present application is decided by
the Court by taking into consideration the subsequent developments that have taken place.

wherein the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made between
the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences.
However, Apex Court in State of M.P. Vs. Laxmi Narayan (Supra) held that no
compromise can be made in respect of offences against society as they are not private
in nature. Similarly in Ram Pal Vs. State of Haryana (Supra) it has been held that no
compromise can be made in cases relating to rape and sexual assault. Recently, Apex
Court in Daxaben (supra) has held that no compromise can be made in matter under
Section 306 IPC. In state of Kerala Vs. Hafsal Rahman (Supra), Court has held that
no compromise can be entertained in matters under the POCSO Act. Reference may
also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and others Vs. State of
U.P. And another [2013 (83) ACC 278] in which the law expounded by the Apex court
in some of the aforesaid cases has been explained in detail.
10. Recently Apex court in Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur (Supra) has laid
down the guidelines with regard to quashing of criminal proceedings as well compromise in criminal
proceedings. Paragraphs 16 to 16.10 of the report are relevant for the controversy in hand, which
read as under:
"16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be
summarized in the following propositions 16.1. Section 482 preserves the inherent
powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure
the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and
preserves powers which inhere in the High Court;
16.2. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a First Information
Report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at
between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction
for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the
power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if
the offence is non-compoundable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46978174/ 4
Tarun Kumar vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
16.3. In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be
quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must
evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;
16.4. While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it
has to be exercised; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the
process of any court;
16.5. The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information Report should be
quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves
ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration
of principles can be formulated;
16.6. In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea
that the dispute has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature
and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity
or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed
though the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences
are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The
decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element
of public interest in punishing persons for serious offences;
16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have
an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct
footing in so far as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;
16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial,
mercantile, partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may
in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute;
16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of
the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and
the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and
16.10. There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions 16.8 and 16.9
above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of the
state have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between
private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the
offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or
misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or
economic system will weigh in the balance."
11. In Ramgopal and another (supra), Court has again reiterated the guidelines regarding quashing
of criminal proceedings in view of compromise. Following has been observed in paragraphs 18-19 of
the report:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46978174/ 5
Tarun Kumar vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
"18. It is now a well crystalized axiom that plenary jurisdiction of this Court to impart
complete justice under Article 142 cannot ipso facto be limited or restricted by
ordinary statutory provisions. It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of an
express provision akin to Section 482 Cr.P.C. conferring powers on the Supreme
Court to abrogate and set aside criminal proceedings, the jurisdiction exercisable
under Article 142 of the Constitution embraces this Court with scopious powers to
quash criminal proceedings also, so as to secure complete justice. In doing so, due
regard must be given to the overarching objective of sentencing in the criminal justice
system, which is grounded on the sub-lime philosophy of maintenance of peace of the
collective and that the rationale of placing an individual behind bars is aimed at his
reformation.
19. We thus sum-up and hold that as opposed to Section 320 Cr.P.C. where the Court
is squarely guided by the compromise between the parties in respect of offences
'compoundable' within the statutory framework, the extra-ordinary power enjoined
upon a High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. or vested in this Court under Article
142 of the Constitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds of Section 320
Cr.P.C. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude ought to be
exercise carefully in the context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind:
(i) Nature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society; (ii) Seriousness of
the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise between accused and the
victim; & (iv) Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of the
purported offence and/or other relevant considerations."
10. In State of M.P. Vs. Laxmi Narayan (Supra), the Apex Court held that mere mention of Section
307 IPC cannot be sole basis for not quashing the proceedings. Court has to examine whether the
prosecution has collected sufficient evidence for framing of charge under Section 307 IPC. The Court
is further required to examine the weapons used and nature of injury and whether injury has been
inflicted on vital/delicate parts of the body, the previous antecedents of accused and whether they
are absconding and how the compromise was got entered into by the parties are relevant factors,
which must be considered. The above observations can be clearly delineated from the recital
occurring in paragraphs 11 to 18 of the aforementioned report.
11. At this juncture, reference be made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in K. Dhandapani Vs.
State by the Inspector of Police 2022 SCC Online SC 1056, wherein the Court quashed the
proceedings under the POCSO Act proceeding against accused on the ground that he has solemnized
marriage with the prosecutrix. Since the judgment is a short one therefore, the same is reproduced
in it's entirety.
""1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant who is the maternal uncle of the prosecutrix belongs to Valayar
community, which is a most backward community in the State of Tamilnadu. He
worksas a woodcutter on daily wages in a private factory. FIR was registered against
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46978174/ 6
Tarun Kumar vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
him forcommitting rape under Sections 5(j)(ii) read with Section 6, 5(I) read with
Section 6 and 5(n) read with Section 6 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences
(POCSO) Act, 2012. He was convicted after trial for committing the said offences and
sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years by the Sessions
Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Tiruppur on 31.10.2018. The High Court, by an
order dated 13.02.2019, upheld the conviction and sentence. Aggrieved thereby, the
appellant has filed this appeal.
3. Mr. M.P. Parthiban, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, submitted that
allegation against him was that he had physical relations with the prosecutrix on the
promise of marrying her. He stated that, in fact, he married the prosecutrix and they
have two children. 4. The appellant submitted that this Court should exercise its
power under Article 142 of the Constitution and ought to do complete justice and it
could not be in the interest of justice to disturb the family life of the appellant and the
prosecutrix.
5. After hearing the matter for some time on 08th March, 2022, we directed the
District Judge to record the statement of the prosecutrix about her present status.
The statement of the prosecutrix has been placed on record in which she has
categorically stated that she has two children and they are being taken care of by the
appellant and she is leading a happy married life.
6. Dr. Joseph Aristotle S., learned counsel appearing for the State, opposed the grant
of any relief to the appellant on the ground that the prosecutrix was aged 14 years on
the date of the offence and gave birth to the first child when she was 15 years and
second child was born when she was 17 years. He argued that the marriage between
the appellant and the prosecutrix is not legal. He expressed his apprehension that the
said marriage might be only for the purpose of escaping punishment and there is no
guarantee that the appellant will take care of the prosecutrix and the children after
this Court grants relief to him.
7. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the considered view
that the conviction and sentence of the appellant who is maternal uncle of the
prosecutrix deserves to be set aside in view of the subsequent events that have been
brought to the notice of this Court. This Court cannot shut its eyes to the ground
reality and disturb the happy family life of the appellant and the prosecutrix. We have
been informed about the custom in Tamilnadu of the marriage of a girl with maternal
uncle.
8. For the aforesaid mentioned reasons, the conviction and sentence of the appellant
is set aside in the peculiar facts of the case and shall not be treated as a precedent.
The appeal is accordingly, disposed of. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand
disposed of.

9. In case, the appellant does not take proper care of the prosecutrix, she or the State
on behalf of the prosecutrix can move this Court for modification of this Order."
11. Similar view has been expressed by the Apex Court in the case of Mafat Lal and Another Vs. State
of Rajasthan 2022 SCC Online SC 433.
12. In view of the discussion made above, this Court finds that the ratio laid down by the Apex Court
in the cases of K. Dhandapani (Supra) and Mafat Lal (Supra) are squarely attracted in the present
case as the accused herein has solemnized marriage with the prosecutrix.
13. As a result, the present application succeeds and is liable to be allowed.
14. It is, accordingly, allowed.
15. The entire proceedings in Case No. 5853 of 2020 (State Vs. Tarun Kumar Kumar Valmiki),
arising out of Case Crime No.454 202 under section 376 (2)(n), 323, 504 and 506 I.P.C.., P.S.
Kotwali, District- Bareilly, now pending in the court of Additional Seesion Judge, Fast Track Court
Bareilly are, hereby, quashed.
