JUSTICE A.K. MOHAPATRA
ORDER
25.11.2021 Order No.
01. 1. This is the second writ petition by the same Petitioner i.e. M/s B.S. Minerals on the issue of
denial of refund of unutilized input tax credit (ITC) against export of iron ore fines for which the
export duty is nil as a result of an exemption notification.
2. In earlier writ petition of the Petitioner i.e. W.P.(C) No.26685 of 2021, the challenge was to two
instructions dated 8th June and 25th June 2021 issued by the Joint Commissioner of CT and GST
(Law) at Cuttack instructing Circle Heads in Odisha to treat such export as duty paid and refusing
the refund.
3. This Court had in the said writ petition on 8th September 2021, while issuing notice directed that
no further steps would be taken vis-Ã -vis the Petitioner by the Opposite Parties pursuant to those
impugned notices. The Petitioner in the said writ petition had // 2 // also challenged the show cause
notice (SCN) dated 21st July 2021 which was pertaining to the period April 2019 to March. 2020.
This Court had directed that the proceedings pursuant thereto would continue, but the
consequential order would not be given effect to till further orders of this Court.
4. The present writ petition challenges the letters dated 8th June and 25th June 2021 and an SCN
dated 21st July 2021 pertaining to the three months i.e. April, May and June, 2020.
5. A development that has taken place subsequent to the above order passed by this Court is that the

GST Council at its 45th Meeting on 17th September 2021 decided inter alia to issue a clarification in
respect of goods for which the export duty is in fact not paid. It was clarified that "only those goods
which are actually subjected to export duty i.e., on which some export duty has to be paid at the time
of export, will be covered under the restriction imposed under section 54 (3) of the CGST Act, 2017
from availment of refund of accumulated ITC." As a result of the above decision of the GST Council,
a fresh circular dated 20th September 2021 has been issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes
and Customs (CBITC), GST Policy Wing, Ministry of Finance, Government of India in which one of
the questions addressed is, at serial No.3, "whether the first proviso to section 54(3) of the
CGST/SGST Act, prohibiting refund of unutilized ITC is applicable in case of exports of goods which
are having NIL rate of export duty?" The clarification issued reads as under:
// 3 // "1. The term 'subjected to export duty' used in first proviso to section 54(3) of
the CGST Act, 2017 means where the goods are actually leviable to export duty and
suffering export duty at the time of export. Therefore, goods in respect of which
either NIL rate is specified in Second Schedule to the Customs Tarriff Act, 1975 or
which are fully exempted from payment of export duty by virtue of any customs
notification or which are not covered under Second Schedule to the Customs Tariff
Act, 1975, cannot be considered to be subjected to any export duty under Customs
Tarrif Act, 1975.
2. Accordingly, it is clarified that only those goods which are actually subjected to
export duty i.e., on which some export duty has to be paid at the time of export, will
be covered under the restriction imposed under section 54 (3) from availment of
refund of accumulated ITC. Goods, which are not subject to any export duty and in
respect of which either NIL rate is specified in Second Schedule to the Customs Tariff
Act, 1975 or which are fully exempted from payment of export duty by virtue of any
customs notification or which are not covered under Second Schedule to the Customs
Tariff Act, 1975, would not be covered by the restriction imposed under the first
proviso to section 54 (3) of the CGST Act for the purpose of availment of refund of
accumulated ITC."
6. In view of the above development, Mr. Agrawal, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner
submits that a direction should be issued to the Opposite Parties to once again process the refund
application of the Petitioner in light of the fresh circular issued as above.
// 4 //
7. Mr. Mishra, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the Department while producing a copy of
the clarification dated 29th September 2021 whereby the earlier clarification issued on 25th June
2021 stands withdrawn, states that if a direction is given for time bound disposal of the refund
application, it will be complied with.
8. It is seen that since the instruction dated 25th June 2021 stands withdrawn, clearly the earlier
instruction dated 8th June 2021 which is in the same vein also does not survive. Therefore, one of

the prayers of the previous petition as well as the present petition challenging the aforementioned
circulars does not survive.
9. Since the impugned SCN has been issued only as result of the above circulars, it also does not
survive and is accordingly set aside.
10. A direction is now issued to the Opposite Party-authority to reprocess the refund application of
the Petitioner in light of the fresh circular issued on 20th September 2021 (Annexure-14) and
convey the decision to the Petitioner thereon not later than 7th February, 2022. It is made clear that
whatever the technical issues for reprocessing the refund application should be resolved by the
authority as expeditiously as possible and in a manner to ensure compliance with the timeline set by
this Court in this order. Further, it is directed that Opposite Party Nos.6 and 7 will // 5 // extend all
their cooperation with the Officers of the Department to ensure compliance with the time bound
direction issued.
11. In view of the above, the rejection of the refund application does not survive and is hereby set
aside. If there is any difficulty in carrying out the above directions, it will be open to the parties to
apply to this Court.
12. The writ petition is disposed of in the above terms.
13. An urgent certified copy of this order be issued as per rules.
