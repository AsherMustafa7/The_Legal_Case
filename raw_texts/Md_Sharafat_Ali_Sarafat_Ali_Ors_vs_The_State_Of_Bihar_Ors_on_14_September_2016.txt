ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 14-09-2016 Nobody appears on behalf of the petitioners. Learned counsel for the State is
present and submits that he has filed show cause on behalf of opposite party no. 5.
The application has been filed alleging non compliance of the order dated 01.10.2012 passed in
C.W.J.C. No. 18310 of 2012 by which the writ petition was disposed off in terms of direction of a
co-ordinate Bench, in a similar matter, which required the authorities to take a final decision with
regard to the claim of the petitioners. In the show cause, copy of order dated 07.01.2015 has been
brought on record showing compliance of the order of the Court.
Copy of the show cause has been served on learned counsel for the petitioners on 25.02.2015 but no
rejoinder to the same Patna High Court MJC No.3076 of 2014 dt.14-09-2016 has been filed.
Considering the above fact as well as taking into account that nobody appears on behalf of the
petitioners today, the application stands disposed off.
However, the petitioners shall be at liberty to challenge the order dated 07.01.2015 in accordance
with law.
