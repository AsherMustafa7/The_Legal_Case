Kanakaraj vs The State Rep. By on 17 December, 2021
which was investigated by the Karaikudi North Police Station and ended in conviction of one Seeni
@ Murugan for the offences under Sections 457 and 380 IPC r/w 75 IPC.
2. The gist of the said case is that on 24.04.1994 at night, the house of the defacto complainant
Kanagaraj was broke open and jewels around 48 ½ sovereigns kept in the Almirah was stolen,
hence, Seeni @ Murugan was prosecuted for the offences under Sections 457 and 380 IPC. During
the course of investigation, the stolen properties were recovered and produced before the Court
under Form-91 and the same was received by the trial Court under the property Register
No.404/1994. Pending trial, in C.C.No.476/1994 the stolen jewels were returned to the defacto
complainant under Section 451 r/w 457 Cr.P.C. In the course of trial, the accused Seeni @ Murugan
pleaded guilty and he was sentenced to undergo 10 months Rigorous Imprisonment. While so, the
very same accused Seeni @ Murugan has also been prosecuted in another case registered in
Cr.No.549/1994 for similar offence. Since the investigation https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
conducted by the police indicated that the portion of the jewels stolen from the petitioner was
purchased by one Subramanian knowing well that it is a stolen property, a case has been registered
against the said Subramanian under Section 411 IPC in Cr.No.3/1995, which was taken on file for
trial in C.C.No.55/1999 by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Madurai. The said Subramanian
was acquitted in the said case vide order, dated 27.11.2002.
3. In the said order of acquittal, the trial Court has specifically observed that the prosecution has
failed to prove the recovery of any jewels from the accused and the witnesses for the prosecution for
recovery had deposed contrary to each other. Therefore, extending the benefit of doubt, the trial
Court acquitted the accused Subramanian. It is to be noted that in the course of trial, the
prosecution has not marked any material objects and the same is recorded in the trial Court
judgment.
4. In the said circumstances, the said Subramanian has preferred a complaint against the police
officials, who initiated prosecution against him for offence under Section 411 IPC. The said
complaint was taken on file by the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis learned Judicial Magistrate
No.I, Madurai in C.C.No.23 of 1997. The trial Court convicted the police officials for offences under
Sections 120-B, 385, 365, 341 and 347 IPC. The said judgment of conviction and sentence was
challenged by the police officials in C.A.No.131 of 2002 and that was allowed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, FTC No.I, Madurai. Aggrieved by the said acquittal, the Subramanian
has approached this Court by way of revision petition in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.1805 of 2003. In the said
revision, this Court vide order dated 29.01.2010 had remanded back the matter to the trial Court for
re-trial.
5. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondents would submit that out of
two accused, one of the accused by name Balakrishnan died and other accused Kannan retired from
service long back.
6. While the fact being so, when the State preferred an appeal against the order of the learned
Judicial Magistrate No.I, Madurai acquitting the said Subramanian in C.C.No.55 of 1999, this Court
while dismissing the appeal has passed an order directing the State to return back the jewels viz., 6

Kanakaraj vs The State Rep. By on 17 December, 2021
sovereigns chain, 3 sovereign bracelet and one ring and cash of Rs.2,390/- and 216.610 gram
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis gold ingot which were alleged to have been seized from the
Subramanian by the police within a period of three months.
7. This portion of the order passed by this Court in Crl.A.No.1208 of 2003 dated 16.12.2014 has lead
to issuance of impugned proceedings by the Inspector of Police, Karaikudi police station, dated
23.01.2015 addressing the petitioner herein to return back 39 ½ sovereigns of gold jewels which he
received through the Court in C.C.No.476 of 1994 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate,
Karaikudi in Cr.No.172 of 1994 Karaikudi Police Station.
8. The Short point canvassed by the petitioner herein challenging the impugned proceedings of the
respondent is that the said proceedings per se illegal and devoid of merits, it is contrary to the facts
and findings of the trial Court. While the jewels stolen from the petitioner's house were recovered
and produced before the Court and the same has been returned to the petitioner as per law and
guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court, the proceedings of the respondent to return back those
jewels, relying upon the observation of the High Court in different proceedings, is baseless.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that in the criminal case in C.C.No.55 of 1999
where the said Subramanian was prosecuted for offence under Section 411 IPC, no material object
was marked, certainly not the 39 ½ sovereigns of jewels which is the subject matter of
C.C.No.476/1994. While so, there is no reason for the police to direct the petitioner herein to return
his jewels in lieu of the list of jewels mentioned in the order of this Court, dated 16.12.2014 passed in
Crl.A.No.1208 of 2003 arose from C.C.No.23 of 1997. Further more, even if there is any order to
return jewels, direction is to the respondent police and not to the petitioner herein. As far as the
jewels, which the petitioner received through the Court are the jewels stolen from his house by the
accused and on proper identification and satisfaction, the trial Court has returned the jewels to the
petitioner. When there is a categorical finding that no proof for recovery of jewels from the house of
Subramanian as projected by the prosecution in C.C.No.55 of 1999 and that being the reason for
acquitting him for the offence under Section 411 IPC, the list of jewels mentioned in Crl.A.No.1208
of 2003 the High Court order in the appeal preferred by the State cannot be in respect of the
petitioner's jewels.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
10. It is not the case of the said Subramanian that the police has recovered the jewels from his
possession and those belongs to him. When he was prosecuted for possessing stolen property with
knowledge he had pleaded that nothing was recovered from his residence and got acquitted and no
jewels were marked in the case, where, he was prosecuted. While so, the return of non existing
property to Subramanian does not arise factually and if there is anything to be returned, the same
cannot be from the petitioner herein.
