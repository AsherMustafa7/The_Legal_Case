No.1) Mr. P.C. Panda, Advocate (Respondent No.2) CORAM:
MR. JUSTICE D.DASH Date of Hearing : 19.02.2024 : Date of Judgment: 11.03.2024
D.Dash, J. The Appellant-Company, by filing this Appeal under Section 37 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the A&C Act' 1996),
has assailed the {{ 2 }} judgment dated 24.07.2017 passed by the learned District
Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar in Arb(P) No.176 of 2012 in the matter of an
application under section 34 of the Act.
This Appellant had filed the application under section 34 of the A & C Act praying to
set aside the award dated 13.06.2012 passed by the learned Arbitrator. By the said
award, the learned Arbitrator held the Respondent No.1 (Claimant) to be entitled to a
sum of Rs.11,00,000/- from the present Appellant. The learned Arbitrator having so
directed the Appellant to pay the said amount to the Respondent No.1-
Company (Claimant), has further directed that the same be paid with interest @ 9% per annum
from October, 2000 up-till the date of award and thereafter @ 12 % till payment along with the cost
of the proceeding assessed at Rs.1,18,500/-

2. Factual Matrix of the Case:-
On 02.09.1996 the Airport Authority of India Ltd. floated the tender for award of
work of "Runway Extension Site" at Bhubaneswar Airport. On 04.12.1996, the
Appellant was awarded with the work for its execution. In undertaking the said work,
the Appellant entered into an agreement with Respondent No.2-Company for
execution of part work as awarded under the contract. The Respondent No.2 in order
to carry out its obligation which required to procure raw {{ 3 }} materials such as
sand and moorum for the work, floated another tender for Raising and
Transportation of Runway Construction Materials. Finally, on 01.06.2000 agreement
was entered into between the Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.2 for the above
raising and transportation of the raw materials. The agreement between the
Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.2 had been made with the knowledge of the
Appellant whose authorized signatory had also lent his signature thereon. The
Respondent No.1 since did not receive the payment, the dispute having arisen out of
the agreement between the Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.2 which has been
executed with the knowledge of the Appellant and wherein the authorized signatory
of the Appellant had also signed, the Respondent No.1 as per the clause in the
agreement approached this Court for payment of his dues in W.P.(C) No.3785 of
2005. This Court then directed the Appellant to consider and dispose of the
representation of the Respondent No.1. On 27.04.20005 the representation of
Respondent No.1 for payment of his dues was rejected by the Appellant. So, on
29.08.2005, the Respondent No.1 gave notice to the Appellant for adjudication of the
dispute for arbitration as stipulated in Clause-13 of the agreement. Since there was no
response, the Respondent No.1-Company filed an application {{ 4 }} under section
11(6) of the A & C Act before this Court for appointment of the Arbitrator. The
Hon'ble Chief Justice by order dated 25.11.2011 appointed Mr. S.F. Ahmed, a retired
District Judge as the sole arbitrator to decide the dispute within six months of
entering the reference.
The Appellant-Company then filed a Miscellaneous Application which stood
numbered as Misc. Case No.5 of 2012 before this Court for recall of order dated
25.11.2011 appointing the Arbitrator and decide the application afresh.
That application stood rejected by order dated 30.03.2012 and there was also no
interim order in the said Miscellaneous Application.
3. The Arbitrator having received the letter of the court on 17.01.2012 issued notice to the parties by
Registered Post with A.D. as well as through Courier Service calling upon them to appear in person
or through their Advocate on 04.02.2012 at 2 p.m. at the venue fixed by him and so indicated in the
notice. Several dates having been fixed by the learned Arbitrator when finally on 22.05.2012 none
appeared on behalf of the Appellant and Respondent No.2 and an application for further
adjournment was sought for, the learned Arbitrator refusing to accept the said prayer and fixed the
proceeding to 29.05.2012 for hearing. On that day, the Respondent No.1 only appeared {{ 5 }} and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 2
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
the Managing Director of the Respondent No.1-Company (Claimant) filed his evidence on affidavit
as also the document which were admitted in evidence and marked exhibits. The Appellant and the
Respondent No.2 did not appear. So, having accepted the evidence and documents, the learned
Arbitrator then fixed the matter to 02.06.2012 for argument. Having heard the argument from the
side of the Respondent No.1-Claimant on 02.06.2012, the learned Arbitrator posted the matter to
13.06.2012 for passing the award and it was so passed.
4. The above award passed by the learned Arbitrator having been challenged by the Appellant by
carrying an application under section 34 of the A & C Act before the learned District Judge, the same
has been dismissed.
5. The Appellant-Company in the application filed under section 34 of the A & C Act raised the
following grounds:-
(1) learned Arbitrator illegally proceeded with the arbitral proceeding despite an
objection raised that his appointment was under challenge before the Hon'ble Court
and it is stated that the learned Arbitrator proceeded with the matter showing undue
haste and finally passed the award setting the {{ 6 }} Appellant ex parte without
providing adequate opportunity to the Appellant to defend the claim;
(2) the Appellant had an agreement with the Respondent No.2 for execution of some
part of work entrusted to Respondent No.2 by the Appellant and the Respondent
No.1 had the agreement with the Respondent No.2 and as such there was no privity of
contract between the Appellant and Respondent No.1.
6. The learned District Judge in seisin of the proceeding under section 34 of the A & C Act having
perused the day to day orders passed by the learned Arbitrator right from the day of receipt of the
letter of his appointment from this Court till the award and further keeping in view the conduct of
the Appellant during the arbitral proceeding has held that the leaned Arbitrator did not have any
other option except to conduct the arbitral proceeding and dispose of the same in accordance with
law.
7. Then coming to address the other contentions raised by the Appellant as regards the privity of
contract has finally repelled the same in concluding that the learned Arbitrator committed no wrong
or error in holding the Appellant as liable for payment of the awarded amount towards the dues of {{
7 }} the Respondent No.1-Claimant. In saying so, the learned District Judge has taken the cue from
the followings:-
(i) the Respondent No.2 had requested the Appellant not to pay the dues to the
Respondent No.1-
Claimant till the rates are revised in terms of the rates agreed upon by the Appellant. So the
Respondent No.1-Claimant for his work was to receive his dues from the Appellant. However, the
revision having not been done at any point of time and the amount having not been paid to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 3
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
Respondent No.1-Claimant and withheld for considerable period of time, it is held that the same
cannot be approved of when the Respondent No.2 has not disputed the amount or the outstanding
dues on any other ground but requested simply the Appellant to keep the payment in abeyance until
the revised rate are determined or agreed upon between the Respondent No.1-Claimant and the
Respondent No.2;
(ii) the outstanding dues was duly certified by the Respondent No.2 as it reveals from the
correspondence of the Appellant dated 18.02.2002 (Ext.4);
{{ 8 }}
(iii) when the work was completed and executed and fully accomplished and to that effect as the
endorsement was received by the Appellant under Ext.4, the billed amount was required to be paid
by the Respondent No.1-Claimant immediately; and
(iv) since the rates were not revised for all these periods, the same is a pretext to withheld the billed
amount of the Respondent No.1-Claimant and thus there was no scope for denial or disagreement
between the parties, providing any justification for the Appellant not to release the billed amount in
favour of the Respondent No.1.
The learned District Judge further held that the award is not liable to be set aside as no such ground
as finds mention in section 34 of the A & C Act is made out.
8. Hence the present Appeal under section 37 of the A & C Act is at the instance of the Appellant who
has suffered under that award which has been refused to be set aside.
9. Heard Mr. S.K.Das, learned counsel for the Appellant and Mr. P.K. Rath, learned Senior
Advocate, learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 (Claimant) as also Mr. P.C. Panda, learned
counsel for the Respondent No.2 at length.
{{ 9 }} I have perused the record of the arbitral proceeding as well as that of the proceeding under
section 34 of the A&C Act of the Court of the learned District Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar.
10. Mr. S.K. Das, learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned Arbitrator has not
given the intimation by notice to the Appellant about his intention to proceed ex parte and has
abruptly published the ex parte award and, therefore, the award is in gross violation of the provision
of section 18 of the A & C Act which provides that each party shall be given due opportunity to
present his case. He next submitted that it is in violation of the mandate of section 24 (2) of the Act
which speaks that the parties shall be given sufficient advance notice of any hearing. He, therefore,
banking upon the clause-III of Sub-section (2) of section 34 of the A & C Act submitted that the
award is liable to be set aside as the Appellant was not given proper notice of the arbitral proceeding
and was unable to present his case. The learned District Judge has dealt with these objections in
detail and has finally negated the said objections.

11. Mr. P.K. Rath, learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent No.1 (Claimant) submitted that the
learned District Judge has rightly rejected the application under {{ 10 }} section-34 of the A & C Act
as there surfaces no ground for interference as provided in section 34 of the Act.
12. The scope of this Court's power under section 37 of the A & C Act and whether the Arbitral award
is in contravention of the public policy of the State under section 34(2)(b) (ii) of the A & C Act.
1. In the present case, we are only concerned with Section 37(1)(c) which states that an appeal lies
under Section 37 from an order setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section
34 of the A& C Act.
2. It may be noted that the law laid down by the Supreme Court constricts the supervisory role of the
courts while testing the validity of an Arbitration Award. In the case of Mcdermott International Inc.
v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. 1 , the Supreme Court has held as under:--
"The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the
arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few
circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the Ld. Arbitral Tribunals,
violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the Ld. Arbitral
Tribunals. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free (2006) 11SCC 181 {{ 11
}} to begin the arbitration again if it is desired.
So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level
and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's
jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it."
13. It is now a settled position that while exercising a power under Section 34 of the A&C Act, the
arbitral award can only be confirmed or set aside, but not modified. To buttress the said position of
law, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court's recent judgment and order in NHAI v.
M. Hakeem 2, wherein the Supreme Court held that:
"16. What is important to note is that, far from Section 34 being in the nature of an
appellate provision, it provides only for setting aside awards on very limited grounds,
such grounds being contained in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 34. Secondly, as
the marginal note of Section 34 indicates, "recourse" to a court against an arbitral
award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance
with sub-sections (2) and (3). "Recourse" is defined by P. Ramanatha Aiyar's
Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Edn.) as the enforcement or 2021 SCC Online SC 473 {{
12 }} method of enforcing a right. Where the right is itself truncated, enforcement of
such truncated right can also be only limited in nature. What is clear from a reading
of the said provisions is that, given the limited grounds of challenge under
sub-sections (2) and (3), an application can only be made to set aside an award. This
becomes even clearer when we see sub-section (4) under which, on receipt of an
application under sub-section (1) of Section 34, the court may adjourn the Section 34
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 5
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
proceedings and give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral
proceedings or take such action as will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the
arbitral award. Here again, it is important to note that it is the opinion of the Arbitral
Tribunal which counts in order to eliminate the grounds for setting aside the award,
which may be indicated by the court hearing the Section 34 application.
xxx
31. Thus, there can be no doubt that given the law laid down by this Court, Section 34 of the
Arbitration Act, 1996 cannot be held to include within it a power to modify an award. The sheet
anchor of the argument of the respondents is the judgment of the learned Single Judge in Gayatri
Balaswamy [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 :
(2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] . This matter arose out of a claim for damages by an employee on account of
sexual harassment at the workplace. The learned Single Judge referred to the power to modify or {{
13 }} correct an award under Section 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 in para 29 of the judgment.
Thereafter, a number of judgments of this Court were referred to in which awards were modified by
this Court, presumably under the powers of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
In para 34, the learned Single Judge referred to para 52 in McDermott case [McDermott
International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] and then concluded that since the
observations made in the said para were not given in answer to a pointed question as to whether the
court had the power under Section 34 to modify or vary an award, this judgment cannot be said to
have settled the answer to the question raised finally.
xxx
42. It can therefore be said that this question has now been settled finally by at least 3 decisions
[McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , [Kinnari Mullick v.
Ghanshyam Das Damani, (2018) 11 SCC 328 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 106] , [Dakshin Haryana Bijli
Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Navigant Technologies (P) Ltd., (2021) 7 SCC 657] of this Court. Even
otherwise, to state that the judicial trend appears to favour an interpretation that would read into
Section 34 a power to modify, revise or vary the award would be to ignore the previous law
contained in the 1940 Act; as also to ignore the fact that the 1996 Act was enacted based on the
Uncitral Model Law on International {{ 14 }} Commercial Arbitration, 1985 which, as has been
pointed out in Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration, makes it clear that, given the
limited judicial interference on extremely limited grounds not dealing with the merits of an award,
the "limited remedy"
under Section 34 is coterminous with the "limited right", namely, either to set aside
an award or remand the matter under the circumstances mentioned in Section 34 of
the Arbitration Act, 1996.
xxx
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 6
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
48. Quite obviously if one were to include the power to modify an award in Section
34, one would be crossing the Lakshman Rekha and doing what, according to the
justice of a case, ought to be done. In interpreting a statutory provision, a Judge must
put himself in the shoes of Parliament and then ask whether Parliament intended this
result. Parliament very clearly intended that no power of modification of an award
exists in Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is only for Parliament to amend
the aforesaid provision in the light of the experience of the courts in the working of
the Arbitration Act, 1996, and bring it in line with other legislations the world over."
Further, the Supreme Court also re-iterated the above position in National Highway Authority of
India vs. Sri P.Nagaraju @ Cheluvaiah & Anr as under:
"26. Under the scheme of the Act 1996 it would not be permissible to modify the
award {{ 15 }} passed by the learned Arbitrator to enhance or reduce the
compensation based on the material available on record in proceeding emanating
from Section 34 of the Act, 1996..."
14. It is thus amply clear that the extent of judicial scrutiny under Section 34 of the A&C Act is
limited and the scope of interference is narrow. Under Section 37, the extent of judicial scrutiny and
scope of interference is further narrower still. An appeal under Section 37 is akin to a second appeal,
the first appeal being by way of objections under Section 34. Where there are concurrent findings of
facts and law, first by the Learned Arbitral Tribunal which are then confirmed by the court while
dealing with objections under Section 34, in an appeal under Section 37, the Appellate Court should
be very cautious and loathe to interfere in the findings returned in the award by the Arbitral
Tribunal and confirmed by the court under Section
34. As laid down by the Apex Court, the supervisory role of the court in arbitration proceedings has
been kept at a minimal level and this is so because, the parties to the agreement make a conscious
decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as the parties prefer the
expediency and finality offered by it.
{{ 16 }}
15. Further, the Supreme Court in the case of UHL Power Co. Ltd. v. State of H.P.,1 recently held as
follows:
"16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on courts under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is fairly
narrow, when it comes to the scope of an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the
jurisdiction of an appellate court in examining an order, setting aside or refusing to set aside an
award, is all the more circumscribed. In MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd. [MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd.,
(2019) 4 SCC 163 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 293] , the reasons for vesting such a limited jurisdiction on
the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act have been explained in
the following words : (SCC pp. 166-67, para
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 7
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
11) "11. As far as Section 34 is concerned, the position is well-settled by now that the Court does not
sit in appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on the limited ground provided
under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the public policy of India. As per the legal
position clarified through decisions of this Court prior to the amendments to the 1996 Act in 2015, a
violation of Indian public policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian
law, a violation of the interest of India, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of patent
illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the concept of the "fundamental policy of Indian law"
would ______________________________ 2022 SCC Online SC 19 {{ 17 }} cover compliance
with statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial approach, compliance with the principles
of natural justice, and Wednesbury [Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury
Corpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] reasonableness. Furthermore, "patent illegality" itself has been held
to mean contravention of the substantive law of India, contravention of the 1996 Act, and
contravention of the terms of the contract."
16. A similar view, as stated above, has been taken by the Supreme Court in K. Sugumar v.
Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.1, wherein it has been observed as follows:
"2. The contours of the power of the Court under Section 34 of the Act are too well
established to require any reiteration. Even a bare reading of Section 34 of the Act
indicates the highly constricted power of the civil court to interfere with an arbitral
award. The reason for this is obvious. When parties have chosen to avail an alternate
mechanism for dispute resolution, they must be left to reconcile themselves to the
wisdom of the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the court should be restricted
to the bare minimum. Interference will be justified only in cases of commission of
misconduct by the arbitrator which can find manifestation in different forms
including exercise of legal perversity by the arbitrator."
______________________________ (2020) 12 SCC 539 {{ 18 }}
17. In the same vein, the Supreme Court in the case of Haryana Tourism Ltd. v. Kandhari Beverages
Ltd. 1 has held as follows:
"9. As per settled position of law laid down by this Court in a catena of decisions, an
award can be set aside only if the award is against the public policy of India. The
award can be set aside under Sections 34/37 of the Arbitration Act, if the award is
found to be contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest of
India; or (c) justice or morality; or
(d) if it is patently illegal. None of the aforesaid exceptions shall be applicable to the
facts of the case on hand. The High Court has entered into the merits of the claim and
has decided the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act as if the High Court
was deciding the appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial
court. Thus, the High Court has exercised the jurisdiction not vested in it under
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. The impugned judgment and order [Kandhari
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 8
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
Beverages Ltd. v. Haryana Tourism Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine P&H 3233] passed by the
High Court is hence not sustainable."
18. More recently, the Supreme Court affirmed the above legal position in the case of Punjab State
Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd. v. Ramesh Kumar and Company 2.
______________________________ (2020) 3 SCC 237 (2021) SCC Online SC 1056 {{ 19 }}
19. In the light of the parameters, as laid down by the Apex Court, vis-a-vis the scope of judicial
intervention that the present appeal impugning the order dated 19.5.2018 passed by the learned
District Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar in Arbitration Petition No. 41 of 2016 arising out of
arbitration award dated 8.7.2016 passed in Arbitration Case No. 1 of 2014 by the learned Ld.
Arbitral Tribunal has to be dealt with.
20. In the case of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Western Geco International Limited 1, the
Apex Court has observed that the award could be set aside if it is against the public policy of India,
that is to say, if it is contrary to:
a. fundamental policy of Indian law; or b. the interest of India; or c. justice or
morality; or d. if it is patently illegal.
After being subsequently discussed in Associate Builders v. Delhi Development
Authority the position of law was clarified and laid down succinctly by the Supreme
Court in the case of Sangyong Engg. & Construction Co.
Ltd. v. NHAI2, wherein the Apex Court has held that:
"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression "public policy of India", whether
______________________________ (2014) 9 SCC 70 (2019) SCC Online SC
677 {{ 20 }} contained in Section 34 or in Section 48, would now mean the
"fundamental policy of Indian law" as explained in paras 18 and 27 of Associate
Builders [Associate Builders v.
DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] i.e. the fundamental policy of Indian law would be
relegated to "Renusagar"
understanding of this expression. This would necessarily mean that Western Geco [ONGC v.
Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9 SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] expansion has been
done away with. In short, Western Geco [ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9 SCC
263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , as explained in paras 28 and 29 of Associate Builders [Associate
Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , would no longer obtain, as under the
guise of interfering with an award on the ground that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial
approach, the Court's intervention would be on the merits of the award, which cannot be permitted
post amendment.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 9
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
However, insofar as principles of natural justice are concerned, as contained in Sections 18 and
34(2)(a)(iii) of the 1996 Act, these continue to be grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained
in para 30 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ)
204] .
35. It is important to notice that the ground for interference insofar as it concerns "interest of India"
has since been deleted, and therefore, no longer obtains. Equally, the ground for {{ 21 }}
interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be
understood as a conflict with the "most basic notions of morality or justice". This again would be in
line with paras 36 to 39 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49: (2015) 2
SCC (Civ) 204] , as it is only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the court that can be
set aside on this ground.
36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic
award is contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as understood in paras 18 and 27 of
Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , or
secondly, that such award is against basic notions of justice or morality as understood in paras 36 to
39 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204].
Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and Explanation 2 to Section 48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the
Amendment Act only so that Western Geco [ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9
SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , as understood in Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA,
(2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , and paras 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away
with.
37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are concerned, an additional ground is now available
under sub-section (2-A), added by {{ 22 }} the Amendment Act, 2015, to Section 34. Here, there
must be patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such illegality as goes to
the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous application of the law. In short,
what is not subsumed within "the fundamental policy of Indian law", namely, the contravention of a
statute not linked to public policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the backdoor when it
comes to setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality.
38. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation of evidence, which is what an appellate court
is permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of
the award.
39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 :
(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , namely, a mere contravention of the substantive law of India, by itself, is
no longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. Para 42.2 of Associate Builders
[Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , however, would remain, for
if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes Section 31(3) of the 1996 Act, that
would certainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the award.

40. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amendment Act really follows what is stated in paras
42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49:
{{ 23 }} (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , namely, that the construction of the terms of a
contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the
contract in a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would; in short, that
the arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take. Also, if the arbitrator wanders
outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error
of jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground added
under Section 34(2-A).
41. What is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32
of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , while
no longer being a ground for challenge under "public policy of India", would certainly amount to a
patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an
award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set
aside on the ground of patent illegality. Additionally, a finding based on documents taken behind
the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no evidence
inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also
have to be characterised as perverse."
21. Furthermore, the law is no longer res integra and is settled that where the Ld. Arbitral Tribunal
has assessed the {{ 24 }} material and evidence placed before them in detail, the court while
considering the objections under Section 34 of the A&C Act does not sit as a court of appeal and is
not expected to re- appreciate the entire evidence and reassess the case of the parties. The
jurisdiction under Section 34 is not appellate in nature and an award passed by an Arbitral Tribunal
cannot be set aside on the ground that it was erroneous. It is not open to the court to interfere with
the award merely because in the opinion of the court, another view is possible. The duty of the court
in these circumstances is to see whether the view taken by the Learned Arbitral Tribunal is a
plausible view on the facts, pleadings and evidence before the Learned Arbitral Tribunal. Even if on
the assessment of material, the court in seisin of an application under Section 34 is of the view that
there are two views possible and the Learned Arbitral Tribunal has taken one of the possible views,
based on the material before it, the court would be reluctant to interfere. The court is not to
substitute its view with that of the Learned Arbitral Tribunal, if the view taken by it is reasonable.
The same has been previously reiterated by this Court in the case of State of Orissa v. Bhagyadhar

22. The record reveals that on 17.01.2012, the learned Arbitrator received the notice of this Court
intimating his appointment as the Arbitrator to decide the dispute between the parties after entering
into the reference from that date and to decide the dispute within a period of six months. The
learned Arbitrator then issued notice to the parties by Registered Post with A.D. as well as through
Courier Service fixing 04.02.2012 as the next date indicting the Venue. On 04.02.2012, the
Appellant through his counsel appeared and undertook to file the Vakalatnama by the next date. The
Respondent No.1-Claimant's counsel by filing a memo that also undertook to file the Vakalatnama
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 11
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
on the next date. The Respondent No.2 did not appear. As on that date learned counsel for the
Appellant filed another petition to grant two months time so that the Appellant would obtain the
order of this Court on the application filed by it for recall of the order of appointment of the learned
Arbitrator as had been passed on 25.01.2011. The learned Arbitrator on that day granted about a
month's time and fixed the matter to 02.03.2012.
On 02.03.2012, the learned counsel for the Appellant although appeared did not file the
Vakalatnama as undertaken by him on the previous day. Then Respondent No.1-Claimant filed the
claim statement. Learned counsel for the Appellant {{ 26 }} present refused to receive the copy
stating about the pendency of the Misc. Case No.5 of 2012 for recall of the order of appointment of
the Arbitrator thus the proceeding be not progressed further. The matter then being posted to
15.03.2012, the learned Arbitrator has found that the claim statement has been duly served upon the
Appellant through Registered Post. On that date, the learned counsel who was representing
Appellant again filed a memo seeking one month's time on the ground of pendency of Misc. Case
No.5 of 2012. He, however, did not file the Vakalatnama on behalf of the Appellant-Company. The
learned Arbitrator in that situation again adjourned the matter to 05.02.212. On that date, the
learned counsel for the Respondent No.1- Claimant appeared whereas none appeared on behalf of
the Appellant and Respondent No.2. A petition dated 14.03.2012 being sent by the Respondent No.2
and received on 29.03.2012 being put up, no action was taken on that petition as already the
purpose for which the petition was non-existent. On that day, the learned counsel for the Appellant
sent a petition through an Office Boy which was placed before the learned Arbitrator for grant of one
month time to proceed further as Misc. Case No.5 of 2012 having been disposed of; the copy was yet
to be received. The learned Arbitrator however again adjourned the {{ 27 }} matter to 31.04.2012 for
filing the document and draft issues. On 31.04.2012, the learned counsel for the Respondent No.1-
Claimant appeared whereas, none appeared on behalf of the Appellant and Respondent No.2. The
order passed by this Court in Misc. Case No.5 of 2012 arising out of ARBP No.15 of 2006 whereby
this Court refused to recall is earlier order of appointment of Arbitrator was placed before the
learned Arbitrator.
Learned counsel who had appeared for the Appellant again by then did not file the Vakalatnama. So
the learned Arbitrator said that his appearance cannot be taken to be the appearance on behalf of
the Appellant and thus, the learned Arbitrator rightly issued fresh notice to the Appellant fixing the
matter to 28.04.2012. On 28.04.2012, however, the letter was received from the partner of the
Respondent No.2 expressing his inability to contest the proceeding for some personal reason and
that it would appoint another Advocate. The Respondent No.1 then gave the new address of the
Appellant and again notice was issued to the Appellant by Courier Service as well as by the Courier
Post fixing the matter to 15.05.2012. On 15.05.2012, the learned Arbitrator found the notice to have
been duly served and accordingly, held the service to be sufficient. Then it dealt with a letter dated {{
28 }} 10.05.2012 sent by the General Manager of the Appellant requesting for few months time on
the ground that the Appellant was going to file review petition in Supreme Court of India/High
Court of Orissa against the order dated 25.11.2012 and 04.04.2012 without stating any other
reason/s.

Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
23. In such state of affair looking at the conduct of the Appellant, the learned Arbitrator keeping in
view the period fixed for conclusion of the arbitral proceeding, however, again gave an opportunity
to the Appellant and Respondent No.2 by fixing the matter to 22.05.2012 in order to see that they
participate in the arbitral proceeding. On that day, the following order has been passed:-
"Advocate for the claimant is present. None appears for the respondents. Respondent
No.2's letters dated 12.05.2012 seeking two months time was not received on the date
fixed, i.e., 15.05.2012 but it was received on 26.04.2012 was considered on
28.04.2012 and time was allowed till 15.05.2012 to file written statement.
He was also intimated over phone about the posting of this proceeding, instead of
appearing before me on the date fixed, i.e., 15.05.2012, the respondent no.2 has sent
this letter dated 12.05.2012 which was received after the date fixed for filing written
statement.
{{ 29 }} The respondent no.2 has asked for two months time on the ground that they
(Res.No.2) have been advised to file review petition before the Hon'ble High Court of
Odisha against the order dated 25.11.2012 appointing me as the Arbitrator or
challenge the said order before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. There is no
indication in the letter if any review petition/S.L.P. has been filed before the Hon'ble
Courts. None appears today for the respondent no.2. No petition has been filed
seeking adjournment of proceeding. In the premises no action need be taken on the
letter dated 12.05.2012 received on 16.05.2012, i.e., after the date fixed (15.05.2012).
The respondents have failed to communicate their statement of defence even though
the proceeding was adjourned from time to time. In the premises this proceeding is
to be continued in the absence of the respondents who have failed to communicate
the statement of defence.
The learned counsel for the claimant files original job agreement dated 01.06.2000.
He has filed a petition with the prayer to return the said agreement after necessary
verification. Keep the original agreement in the record. Call on 29.05.2012 at 5 p.m.
in this venue for {{ 30 }} hearing. The claimant has paid Rs.25,000/- towards
Arbitrator's fees and Rs.2,000/- as incidental expenses."
Thereafter on 29.05.2012 the hearing was taken up. The Managing Director of the Respondent
No.1-Company filed the evidence on affidavit and documents which were admitted in evidence.
None remained present on behalf of the Appellant. The matter stood adjourned to 02.06.2012 and
then finally after hearing the argument from the side of the Respondent No.1- Claimant on
13.06.2012 the impugned award has been passed.
24. Viewing the progress of the arbitral proceeding right from the beginning till the passing of the
award, it is seen that ample opportunity having been provided to the Appellant to defend and place
its case, the Appellant has not availed the same for the reasons best known to it and the moves made
by it before the learned Arbitrator appear to be frivolous somehow to avoid and went on protracting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 13
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
the proceeding. The Appellant is found to have grossly abused the opportunity given to it during the
proceeding from time to time. Thus, I find every reason and justification to concur with the
conclusion arrived at by the learned District Judge.
25. The fact situation of the case cited by learned Counsel for the Appellant, i.e., M/s. Narinder
Singh & Sons Vrs. Union of India through Divisional Superintendent Engineer-II, {{ 31 }} Northern
Railway, Ferozepur Division, Ferozepur passed in Civil Appeal No.6734 of 2021 disposed of on 18th
November, 2021 are completely different and distinct from the case at hand. There the Hon'ble
Court had found that there was unnecessary haste and hurry by the Arbitrator and the Respondent
therein was deprived of reasonable and fair opportunity to cross-examine the Claimant witness
(P.W.1) and then again it was seen that the evidence of the Respondent therein on record and their
contentions and evidence being not considered, there was debilitation of the Respondent from
setting up their case which amounted to violation of the principles of natural justice and opportunity
as envisaged under section 18 of the A & C Act, which is not at all the situation in the given case.
Similarly the case cited by the learned counsel for the Appellant, i.e., Nadendla Gopala Rao Vrs.
Steel City Securities Ltd., 2011 (1) Civil LJ 23 decided by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh is quite
distinguishable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In that case the Arbitrator was
found to have not followed such procedure or indicated in the notice that failure of the Appellant
therein to substantiate his claim with regard to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator
would proceed with the claim ex parte and pass the award, which is not the situation in the case {{
32 }} at hand. The Appellant has not filed any application or raised any objection before learned
Arbitrator as regards the lack of jurisdiction. The Appellant simply went on praying for time on the
ground that it had moved the High Court for recall of the order of appointment of the Arbitrator and
that too said move has later on been dismissed and attained finality being not further challenged.
Then although the Appellant could have very well participated has, however, not so opted and that is
at its peril.
26. Coming to the challenge to the award on merit that there was no privity between the Appellant
and Respondent No.1, it is seen that the learned District Judge has discussed the same at
paragraph-5 of its judgment.
In the present case, the agreement executed between the Respondent No. and 2 has the
endorsement of the Appellant and the signature of Appellant's authorized signatory is found
thereon. The correspondence (Ext.4) reveals that the work in respect of which payment was to be
made had been completed and the payment was to be made by the Appellant to the Respondent
No.1-Claimant which was asked by the Respondent No.2 to be withheld when the Respondent No.1-
Claimant pressed for its release. Clause-14 of the said agreement clearly speaks that in case of failure
of the {{ 33 }} Respondent No.2 to make the payment, the Appellant would have the obligation to
pay and honour the commitment. Although the agreement was not between the Appellant and
Respondent No.1,a plain reading of Clause-14 of the agreement would reveal that the Appellant
created the faith in the mind of the Respondent No.1-Claimant as regards the payment of his dues in
case of carrying out the work as per the agreement executed with the Respondent No.2. Thus under
the agreement on failure on the part of the Respondent No.2 to pay the legal dues of the Respondent
No.1, the Appellant had undertaken the liability for said payment. The correspondence between the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16497744/ 14
Ircon International Ltd vs Amalgamated Construction on 11 March, 2024
Respondent No.2 and Respondent No.1 makes the position still worse that the Respondent No.2 had
requested the Appellant to withhold the payment citing certain reasons which the learned Arbitrator
has found on fact to be mere pretext and that view has also been endorsed by the learned District
Judge.
27. For all the aforesaid, this Court finds that the learned District Judge has rightly rejected the
contention of the Appellant that it has no liability for payment of the dues under the agreement in
question.
In that view of the matter, the learned District Judge finding no ground under section 34 of the A &
C Act to have {{ 34 }} been made out to set aside the award, in my view, has rightly dismissed the
application under section 34 of the A & C Act, which does not warrant interference in this Appeal.
28. Resultantly, the Appeal stands dismissed. No order as to cost.
(D. Dash), Judge.
