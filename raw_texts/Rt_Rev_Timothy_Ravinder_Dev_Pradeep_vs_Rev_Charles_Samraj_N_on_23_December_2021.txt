COMMON ORDER
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 2
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
These two Revisions are at the instance of the defendants in OS No.938 of 2021 on the file of the
Principal District Munsif, Coimbatore. Challenge is to the order of injunction granted by the learned
District Munsif in IA No.2 of 2021 on 11.11.2021. The petitioner in CRP No.2923 of 2021 is the first
defendant and the petitioner in CRP 2924 of 2021 is the second defendant in the said suit. The suit
came to be filed by the first respondent/plaintiff seeking:
a) a declaration that the resolution of the Administrative Committee of CSI
Coimbatore Diocesan Council of Coimbatore dated 19.07.2021, suspending the first
respondent herein from the post of the Presbyter and Chairman of CSI All Souls'
Church, Coimbatore and Chairman of CSI St. Mark’s Church, Railway Colony,
Podanur, Coimbatore 641 021, as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD)
Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 null and void, invalid
and inoperative under Law;
b) permanent injunction for restraining the Administrative Committee of CSI
Coimbatore Diocesan Council, Coimbatore, to take any policy decisions,
appointments, transfers, change of correspondents apart from day to day affairs until
the conduct of 34th CSI Coimbatore Diocesan Council;
c) permanent injunction for restraining the defendants from interfering with the
plaintiff’s functioning as the Chairman and Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church, Race
Course, Coimbatore and as the Chairman of CSI St.Mark’s Church, Railway Colony,
Podanur, Coimbatore, till disposal of the suit.
d) permanent injunction for restraining the defendants from acting upon the
resolutions passed on 19.07.2021 under the Administrative Committee Meeting and
for costs.
2. According to the plaintiff, the Church of South India comprises of the protestant churches in the
five Southern States namely Kerala, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924
of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 Karnataka, Andhra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. The
said union of all protestant denomination Churches took place on 27.09.1947, as a reformed church
having Synod as a representative body of the CSI. A nonprofit making Company in the name of
Church of South India Trust Association was registered under Section 25 of the Indian Companies
Act 1956, and the said Company was to act as a bare trustee of the properties of Church of South
India which is an unregistered body. The Church of South India has its own constitution and bye
laws which are independent of the Memorandum and Article of Association of the Company.
2.1. For the effective management of the Church, the entire area namely the five States in South
India have been divided into 24 constituent Dioceses. The reliefs sought for in the suit on hand
pertain to the Coimbatore Diocese. The Coimbatore Diocese namely the second defendant in the suit
has its headquarters at Coimbatore and the Churches situate in eight Revenue Districts namely

Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Thiruppur, Erode, Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri. The
Diocese of Coimbatore is administered by an Apex Body called the Diocesan Council.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 2.2. The Bishop of the concerned Diocese is the President and the Members of the
council are elected every three years. The 33rd Session of CSI Coimbatore Diocesan Council was
constituted in November 2016 and its period expired in November 2019. As per the constitution of
the Churches of South India, the Synod, the supreme apex body extended the life of the council for a
grace period of three months with a direction to the first defendant, the Bishop to conduct the 34th
session of CSI Coimbatore Diocesan Council.
2.3. The first defendant has sent a circular on 08.01.2020 stating that the 34th session of CSI
Coimbatore Diocesan Council will be convened on 09.01.2020 at 7.00 p.m. in the CSI Bishop
Appasamy College, Race Course, Coimbatore. On the same day, the first defendant also called the
members of the Diocesan Council to register and file nominations to the various Boards and
Committees in the Industrial Service Centre, CSI Matriculation Higher Secondary School Campus,
Race Course, Coimbatore. The plaintiff https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 &
2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 had filed his nomination to contest for the post
of Diocesan Secretary on 09.01.2020. He also paid the required fee for the nomination. Several
other persons had filed their nominations for various Boards and Committees to be elected in the
34th session of CSI Coimbatore Diocesan Council for the Triennium 2020-2023.
2.4. The first defendant/first respondent, however, did not conduct the meeting of the council on
09.01.2020. He has been tactfully delaying the conduct of free and fair election. Without convening
the meeting and conducting the elections, the first respondent, the Bishop handpicked certain
Members and recommended to the Synod to appoint them as Administrative Committee till such
time the elections were conducted. This according to the first respondent/plaintiff is to make an
illegal gain by having his own men in the position of power. After several request by several
Members, the first defendant sent a communication on 16.07.2021 convening the 34th session of
CSI Coimbatore Diocesan Council at Salem, during the second week of August 2021.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 2.5. The plaintiff, who came to know that the Administrative Committee is scheduled
to meet on 19.07.2021 at CSI Bishop Appasamy College of Arts and Science, Race Course,
Coimbatore, went there to reach out to the Bishop and seek for time to give their representations to
the Committee. The plaintiff also saw several other members from various churches within the
Diocese, who had assembled there to give their representations to the Bishop. It is at that time one
of the Administrative Committee Members by name Nesa Merlin, picked up quarrel with the
Congregation Members from Dharmapuri and at the instigation of the first defendant took the Mic
Stand placed in the Hall and started hitting some of the Members, who picked up the wordily
argument with him.
2.6. Commotion prevailed in the area and an FIR was lodged in Crime No.452 of 2021, by one of the
Congregation Members and Honorary Secretary of CSI Praish Church, Trichy Road, Coimbatore. A
counter FIR was lodged by certain persons at the instigation of the first defendant with ulterior

Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
motive to suspend the plaintiff as the plaintiff, who had the support
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 of majority of the congregations, would win the elections if and when they are held.
The Administrative Committee which met again on the same day i.e.19.07.2021 passed several
resolutions most of which are against the members of the congregation including the plaintiff. On
the basis of the recommendations made by the Administrative Committee, the first defendant
placed the plaintiff under suspension on the next date namely 20.07.2021.
2.7. The entire episode was stage managed by the first defendant and his henchmen to malign and
defame the plaintiff. The action taken by the first defendant, according to the plaintiff is against all
principles of natural justice. The plaintiff would also pick holes with some of the resolutions passed
by the Administrative Committee on 19.07.2021 and contend that the Administrative Committee
which is acting as a puppet in the hands of the first defendant is attempting to remove all persons,
who according to it are acting against the interests of the first defendant.
2.8. The plaintiff would also add that because of the above said https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 actions of the
Administrative Committee, there is a void in the administration and it affects the thousands of
beneficiaries such as students, teaching staff, non teaching staff in colleges and schools attached to
the Church. It is also claimed that one of the members, who was removed, filed a suit challenging
the removal, but he had chosen to withdraw the suit. The plaintiff would claim that all the
resolutions against the plaintiff are with ulterior motive only to enable illegal action against the
plaintiff to keep him at bay and disable him from contesting the elections. On the above pleadings,
the plaintiff sought for the aforesaid reliefs in the suit. Along with the suit, the plaintiff filed an
application in IA No.2 of 2021, wherein the plaintiff had prayed for the following relief.
“To declare the illegal and unconstitutional resolutions taken by the Administrative Committee of
CSI Coimbatore Diocesan on 19.07.2021 at CSI Bishop Appasamy College of Arts and Science,
Coimbatore as null and void that met after the announcement of the 34th Session of CSI Coimbatore
Diocesan Council https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP
Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 scheduled in the 2nd week of April 2021 against the candidates and
congregation members those who filed nominations for the office bearer and various other
committees in the elections to be conducted in the 34th session of CSI Coimbatore Diocesan Council
and to grant an order of Interim injunction restraining the defendants or their men or their agent or
their relatives from in any manner interfere in any policy making decisions, appointments, change
of correspondents or presbyters until the conduct of 34th session of CSI Coimbatore Diocesan
Council but only to do the day today work and pass such further and restraining the
respondents/defendants to act upon the resolution passed on 19.07.2021 under the Administrative
Committee meeting.” The affidavit filed in support of the application for injunction is almost a
replica of the plaint. I therefore do not see the need for restating the same.

Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
3. This application for injunction was resisted by the defendants contending that the suspension of
the plaintiff as a presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church, Coimbatore, was done on the basis of the
recommendations of the Administrative Committee made on 19.07.2021. The suspension was made
because the plaintiff along with his henchmen barged into the meeting of the Administrative
Committee and threatened the members who had gathered there. The plaintiff had also barged into
the Executive Committee meeting of the Synod held at Chennai on 23.03.2021 and grabbed the
Microphone and threw it on the floor in a fit of rage with the intention of intimidating the
moderator, who was present at the meeting.
3.1. In view of the above said misconduct, the Administrative Committee of the CSI Coimbatore
Diocese, met on 13.04.2021 and decided to take action against the petitioner. The Moderator had
sent a letter to the first respondent on 16.04.2021, reporting the actions of the petitioner at the
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Synod at Chennai on 23.03.2021. Based on the said letter
of the Moderator, a show cause notice https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 &
2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 was issued to the petitioner on 18.04.2021. On
02.06.2021, disciplinary proceedings were also taken. The petitioner filed OS No.629 of 2019
against the respondent seeking a declaration that the show cause notice dated 18.04.2021 is null and
void and for a permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their men, agents and servants
from interfering the plaintiff functioning as a Presbyter. The suit was filed against the first
defendant alone and the said suit is pending.
3.2. In view of the subsequent misbehavior again on 19.07.2021 at the Administrative Committee
Meeting of the Diocesan Council the first defendant/Bishop was left without any alternative but, to
suspend the plaintiff/first respondent from functioning as the Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church,
Coimbatore. While the prayer in the main suit is for a declaration that the resolution suspending the
plaintiff is bad, the injunctive reliefs sought for as an interim relief travels beyond the scope of the
suit and seeks an injunction which would bring the entire administration of the Church to a halt. It
was also contended that the CSI Church or the Diocesan council being an unregistered
body/unincorporated body, the plaintiff should have https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD)
Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 taken the permission of the Court
under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to sue the said body. It is also the contention of
the defendants/respondents in IA No.2 of 2021 that the plaintiff cannot seek an injunction
restraining the Administrative Committee from functioning while espousing his own cause namely
the suspension.
3.3. It is the further contention of the defendants/respondents in IA No.2 of 2021 that the plaintiff
was suspended on 20.07.2021 and the fact that the plaintiff was suspended was brought to the
notice of the I Additional District Court, Coimbatore, in OS No.509 of 2019. The learned I
Additional District Judge taking note of the suspension of the plaintiff and appointment of one
Mr.Prince Calvin as the Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church had while dismissing the said suit
directed the election for the Pastorate to be conducted by the said Mr.Prince Calvin.
3.4. Relying upon the said judgment of the District Court, it was contended that the Trial Court
namely the District Munsif‘s Court cannot grant an injunction which would over rule the judgment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 6
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
of the District https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP
Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 Court. According to the respondents in view of the specific directions
given by the learned I Additional District Judge, Coimbatore, dated 14.09.2021, while recognising
the suspension of the plaintiff in OS No.938 of 2021, the plaintiff cannot be favoured with an order
for injunction which would enable him to function as a Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church,
Coimbatore. It is also the contention of the respondents/petitioners herein that the plaintiff has
come to Court with unclean hands having suppressed the fact that the District Court had recorded
his suspension and allowed the new incumbent to conduct elections.
3.5. The learned Principal District Munsif, Coimbatore, who heard the application for injunction
over ruled the defence and granted an order of injunction as prayed for in IA No.2 of 2021. It is
against the said order of injunction, the defendants in the suit and respondents in IA No.2 of 2021
have come up with the above Civil Revision Petitions.
4. Terming the order as an appealable order under the provisions of Order 43 Rule 1 (r) of the Code
of Civil Procedure, the Registry had raised https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923
& 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 an objection to the maintainability of these
Revisions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Upon hearing the counsel for the
petitioners in both these revisions, I had by a separate order held that the Revision is maintainable,
since it is a constitutional remedy and the availability of an alternative remedy is not a complete bar
for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Mr.Siva Shanmugam,
learned counsel took notice for the respondent and with the consent of all the counsel, the Civil
Revision Petitions were heard finally.
5. Heard Mr.R.Viduthalai, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Mrs.R.Revathy, for the petitioner in
CRP.No.2923 of 2021, Mr.V.Selvaraj, learned counsel appearing for Mr.S.Bharathi Rajan, for the
petitioner in CRP.No.2924 of 2021 and Mr.S.Sivashanmugam, learned counsel appearing for the 1st
respondent in both the Revisions. The 2nd respondent in both the Revisions are the petitioners in
the Civil Revision Petitions. Hence, notice to them is deemed unnecessary, as they are already
appearing through counsel.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021
6. Mr.R.Viduthalai, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in CRP.No.2923 of 2021
would vehemently contend that the trial Court exceeded its jurisdiction in granting the injunctive
reliefs in an application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, more so,
when the reliefs prayed for were beyond the scope of the very suit. He would further point out that
though the order made under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure is an
appealable order, when the trial Court dis-regards the scope of the very suit and grants an
injunction, which would bring the entire affairs of the church to stand still, the petitioners can
approach this Court under article 227 of the Constitution of India, invoking its supervisory
jurisdiction and seek this Court's intervention to correct the error that had crept in.

Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
6.1. Drawing my attention to the pleadings as well as the prayer in the suit, Mr.R.Viduthalai, learned
Senior Counsel would submit that the allegations in the suit or allegations in the plaint are really in
the nature of the representative suit. From a reading of the plaint itself, it is clear that the grievance
of the plaintiff is not his suspension alone, but, he wants to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.
(PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 espouse the cause of the entire
community and therefore, the suit without obtaining leave under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil
Procedure to sue in a representative capacity, is not maintainable. While acknowledging the fact that
the permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not mandatory and
non-obtaining of permission may not be fatal to the suit, the learned Senior Counsel would argue
that grant of injunctive reliefs based on the plaint instituted without permission would be a
transgression of the powers of the Court, which would justify interference of this Court under Article
227 of the Constitution of India.
6.2. Arguing further, the learned Senior Counsel would submit that the trial Court had gone into the
merits of the claim and decided on various questions which did not form the subject matter of
prayer in the suit. Therefore, according to Mr.R.Viduthalai, this is a fit case where this Court has to
intervene under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
6.3. Mr.R.Viduthalai, learned Senior Counsel would also rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Surya Dev Rai Vs. Ram https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 &
2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 Cander Rai and others reported in (2003) 8 SCC
329, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has pointed out that the jurisdiction under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India or the power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is wider than
the one conferred on the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the sense, the
power of superintendence is not subject to those technicalities of procedure or traditional fetters
which are to be found in certiorari jurisdiction.
6.4. Tracing the history of supervisory jurisdiction and after referring to the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Waryam Singh and another Vs. Amarnath and another reported in AIR 1954 SC
215, the learned Senior Counsel would submit that the law laid down in Waryam Singh and another,
cited supra, will hold good and as per said the judgment of the High Court in exercise of power
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India can not only set aside the order, but also, substitute
the order that have been passed by the trial Court or an inferior Tribunal with the order that ought
to have been passed. The fact that these observations in Surya Dev Rai cited supra, were affirmed by
the larger bench vis-a-vis https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021
and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 Article 227 jurisdiction in Radhey Shyam and another Vs.
Chhabi Nath and others reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423 is also relied upon by the counsel as a factor
to buttress his submissions.
6.5. Adverting to the more recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shalini Shyam Shetty
and another Vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil reported in (2010) 8 SCC 329, the learned Senior Counsel
would submit that the principles and guidelines in Waryam Singh and another, cited supra, which
had been repeatedly followed would still hold good in matters which relate to exercise of power by
High Courts under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.

Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
6.6. Inviting my attention to the most recent decision in Virudhunagar Hindu Nadargal Dharma
Paribalana Sabai and others Vs. Tuticorin Educational Society and others reported in (2019) 9 SCC
538, Mr.R.Viduthalai, learned Senior Counsel would submit that the Hon'ble Supreme Court had
not said availability of appeal remedy under the Code of Civil Procedure would only be a near total
bar for exercise of jurisdiction https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of
2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
6.7. The learned Senior Counsel would also point out that in a recent decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court upheld the interference made by this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India in K.P.Natrajan and others Vs. Muthalammal in Spl.Leave Petition No.2492 of 2021 dated
04.10.2021, to set aside a decree, inasmuch as the same was obtained against the minors without
proper guardian being appointed for the minors.
7. Mr.V.Selvaraj, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in CRP.No.2924 of 2021 would submit
that the learned District Munsif is actually in contempt, since he has overstepped the directions of
the District Court in granting injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the
functioning of the plaintiff as a Presbyter of All Souls Church, Coimbatore, in effect over ruling the
judgment of the District Court rendered in O.S.No.509 of 2019 on 14th September 2021.
7.1. Mr.V.Selvaraj, in support of his submission would rely upon the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in V.Ramalingam reported in (2006) 1
LW 421, wherein, this Court had held that if the inferior Tribunal oversteps and grants an order
which would militate against the order of the superior Court, the inferior Tribunal will be in
contempt.
7.2. The learned counsel would also rely upon the judgment of the Bombay High Court reported in
1993 CRL.L.J 816, wherein, the Bombay High Court had expressed a similar view as that of the
Division Bench of this Court in V.Ramalingam reported in (2006) 1 CTC 421.
7.3. Mr.V.Selvaraj, would further point out that the very suit as filed in not maintainable, inasmuch
as the permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure has not been taken to sue the
defendants in a representative capacity. In support of his submission Mr.V.Selvaraj, would rely upon
the judgment of this Court in Rev.Noble Gambeeran and others Vs. Peter P. Ponnan for himself and
as representative of members of C.S.I.Christian Community reported in 1999 (1) MLJ 392, wherein,
this Court had held that the Church of South India being an unincorporated
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 body, a suit against it is not maintainable without getting permission under Order I
Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The suit so filed would not be a pending suit, till such time the
provisions of Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure are complied with. Therefore, there is no
question of grant of injunction under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure in
such a suit.

7.4. Support is also drawn from the judgment of the Division Bench in Executive Committee of the
Synod Church of South India, Represented by its General Secretary Vs. Rt. Rev. Dr.V.Devasahayam,
Bishop in Madras Church of South India – Madras Diocese reported in 2009 (5) CTC 398, where the
Division Bench of this Court re-affirmed the proposition of law as stated by the learned single Judge
in Rev.Noble Gambeeran and others cited supra.
7.5. Mr.V.Selvaraj, learned counsel, would also contend that the relief of injunction which runs
counter to the directions of the District Court in its judgment in O.S.No.509 of 2019 cannot be
sustained and the same will have https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of
2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 to be set aside or set at naught forthwith. Reliance is also
placed in the judgment in Baradakanta Mishra, Ex-Commissioner of Endowments Vs. Shri Bhimsen
Dixt reported in 1973 (1) SCC 446, on the question of contempt.
8. To sum up Mr.R.Viduthalai, learned Senior Counsel and Mr.V.Selvaraj, learned counsel, would
contend that the grant of injunction in a non-existent suit, overstepping the orders of District Court
in O.S.No.509 of 2019 and granting interlocutory relief which is larger than the relief prayed for in
the suit are all the ingredients of the orders impugned in this Revision, which would justify
interference of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India as an extreme case.
9. Contending contra Mr.S.Sivashanmugam, learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent in
both the Revisions would submit that the objection that the permission under Order I Rule 8 of the
Code of Civil Procedure has not been obtained will not survive, as the Church of South India is
governed by Church of South India Trust Association a Company https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 registered under
Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, there is no question of the suit being filed against
un-incorporated body or un- registered association of persons.
9.1. In support of his submission, learned counsel would draw my attention to the judgment of this
Court is Church of South India Trust Association, represented by its Honorary Treasurer Vs. Union
of India, represented by the Secretary to the Government reported in 2021 SCC Online Madras 332.
The learned counsel would also point out that the said judgment has been affirmed by the Division
Bench of this Court in W.A.No.1324 of 2021. He would further contend that permission under Order
I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not mandatory and non- obtaining of permission under
Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure is only an error or an irregularity, which can be cured
at any point of time.
9.2. Therefore, the grant of injunction cannot be faulted solely on the ground of non-compliance
with Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He would also rely upon the judgment of this
Court in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP
Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 N.Anandan Vs. Ayyanna Gounder reported in (1993) 2 MLJ 493 and
Royal Villa Residents Association Vs. The Project Management Committee reported in 2013 (4) CTC
205. It is also the further contention of the counsel that mere non-obtaining of permission under
Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure will not enable this Court to interfere with the order of
injunction.

9.3. On the contention of the counsel for the petitioners that the interlocutory prayer sought for is
wider than the main prayer in the suit, Mr.S.Sivashanmugam, learned counsel would acknowledge
the fact that the interlocutory prayer is not happily worded. He would however contend that the
same can be restricted to the plaint prayer alone viz., suspension of the 1st respondent as Presbyter
of All Souls Church, Coimbatore and President of St.Marks Church, Coimbaore.
Mr.S.Sivashanmugam would also point out that an appeal has been filed in A.S.No.491 of 2021
against the decree in O.S.No.509 of 2019 and therefore, there is no question of the trial Court having
exceeded the jurisdiction in granting injunction. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD)
Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021
10. I have considered the rival submissions. The contours of powers of this Court under Article 227
of the Constitution of India are too well recognized as early as in 1954 in Waryam Singh's case cited
supra. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had held that the power under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India is a power available to the High Court to not only quash the orders of the trial Court, but, also
to substitute the same with orders that ought to have been passed. In Waryam Sing cited supra, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has traced the history of Article 227 of the Constitution of India which reads
as follows:-
Re. 2.The material part of Article 227 substantially reproduces the provisions of
section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915, except that the power of
superintendence has been extended by the article also to tribunals. That the Rent
Controller and the District Judge exercising jurisdiction under the Act are tribunals
cannot and has not been controverted. The only question raised is as to the nature of
the power of superintendence conferred by the article. Reference is made to clause
(2) of the article in support of the contention that this article only confers on the High
Court administrative superintendence https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD)
Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 over the subordinate
courts and tribunals. We are unable to accept this contention because clause ( 2) is,
expressed to be without prejudice to the.generality of the provisions in clause (1).
Further, the preponderance of judicial opinion in India was that section 107 which
was similar in terms to section 15 of the High Courts Act, 1861, gave a power of
judicial superintendence to the High Court apart from and independently of the
provisions of other laws conferring revisional jurisdiction on the High Court. In this
connection it has to be remembered that section 107 of the Government of India Act,
1915, was reproduced in the Government of India Act, 1935, as section 224. Section
224 of the 1935 Act, however, introduced sub- section (2), which was new, providing
that nothing in the section should be construed as giving the High Court any
jurisdiction to,question any judgment of any inferior court which was not otherwise
subject to appeal or revision. The idea presumably was to nullify the effect of the
decisions of the different High Courts referred to above. Section 224 of the 1935 Act
has been reproduced with certain modifications in Article 227 of the Constitution. It
is significant to note that sub-section (2) to section 224, of the 1935 Act has been
omitted from Article 227. This https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD)
Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 significant omission
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 11
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
has been regarded by all High Courts in India before whom this question has arisen
As having restored to the High Court the power of judicial superintendence it had
under Section 15 of the High Courts Act, 186 1, and section 107 of the Government of
India Act, 1915. See the cases referred to in -Moti Lal v. The State through Shrimati
Sagrawati(1). Our attention has not been drawn to any case which has taken a
different view and, as at present advised, we see no reason to take a different view.
11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further went on to conclude that the power of superintendence
conferred by Article 227 of the Constitution of India as pointed out by Harries, C.J in Dalmia Jain
Airways Ltd Vs. Sukumar Mukherjee should be exercised sparingly and only in appropriate cases, in
order to keep the sub-Court within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere errors.
This view of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been re-affirmed in Shalini Shyam Shetty and another
Vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil reported in (2010) 8 SCC 329, in the following words:
(d) The parameters of interference by High Courts https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 in
exercise of its power of superintendence have been repeatedly laid down by this
Court. In this regard the High Court must be guided by the principles laid down by
the Constitution Bench of this Court in Waryam Singh (supra) and the principles in
Waryam Singh (supra) have been repeatedly followed by subsequent Constitution
Benches and various other decisions of this Court.
(e) According to the ratio in Waryam Singh (supra), followed in subsequent cases, the
High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction of superintendence can interfere in order
only to keep the tribunals and Courts subordinate to it, `within the bounds of their
authority'.
12. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shalini Shyam Shetty and another cited supra pointed out that
various situations may arise before the Courts and whether to exercise the supervisory jurisdiction
or not is a call that has to be taken by the Court on the facts and circumstances and while laying
down the broad parameters, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as follows:-
(g) Apart from the situations pointed in (e) and (f), https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 High
Court can interfere in exercise of its power of superintendence when there has been a
patent perversity in the orders of tribunals and Courts subordinate to it or where
there has been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic principles of natural
justice have been flouted.
13. The Hon'ble Supreme Court also pointed out that the power is discretionary and can be exercised
on its equitable principles. While deciding the maintainability of this Revision, I had referred to the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in L.Chandrakumar Vs. Union of India reported in AIR
1994 SC 1266, wherein, it was held that the powers vested in High Court under Articles 226 and 227
of the Constitution of India cannot be taken away even by constitutional amendments.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 12
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
14. In Radhey Shyam and another Vs. Chhabi Nath and others reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423, a three
Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court examined the correctness of the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Surya Dev Rai cited supra and affirmed the conclusions of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 Bench insofar as the scope of power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India are
concerned, while it did not agree with the conclusions of the Bench with reference to jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. While doing so, the three Judge Bench pointed out
that the jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India would extend to not only
quashing of order but also substitution of orders.
15. The refusal to exercise the supervisory jurisdiction or constitutional power by the higher Court
when there is a statutory remedy available under the statute viz., the Code of Civil Procedure, in the
case on hand, is more of a matter of discipline or self-imposed restriction than a rule of law. Once it
is held that the power vested in the High Court under the Constitution cannot be taken away even by
constitutional amendment, an appeal provision in an enactment like the Code of Civil Procedure,
cannot denude the power of the High Court from exercising the jurisdiction. All that is to be ensured
is that the interference is kept at the minimum that too only in exceptional cases or extraordinary
cases. The question therefore to be addressed is whether the case on hand is an exceptional or
extraordinary https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP
Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 case to enable interference under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India.
16. Both Mr.R.Viduthalai, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in CRP.No.2923 of
2021 and Mr.V.Selvaraj, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in CRP.No.2924 of 2021 would
vehemently contend that the manner in which the learned District Munsif sought to brush aside the
requirements for permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the binding
nature of the judgment in O.S.No.509 of 2019 are so shocking, that it would be a fit case where the
power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has to be invoked.
17. Their contention that the interim relief sought for is wider than the main relief has to be, to a
certain extent, toned down by Mr.S.Sivashanmugam's concession or stand taken by him that he is
ready to restrict the interim relief to the suspension of the petitioner as Presbyter of All Souls
Church and President of St.Mark Church at Coimbatore.
18. On the first submission of Mr.S.Sivashanmugam regarding the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 requirement of
permission to sue under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in a case against Church of
South India, I find myself unable to agree with the contention of the counsel for the following
reasons:-
The decision relied upon by him in Church of South India Trust Association,
represented by its Honorary Treasurer Vs. Union of India, represented by the
Secretary to the Government reported in 201 SCC Online Madras 332 arose in the
writ jurisdiction, where the challenge was to the investigation by the Serious Frauds
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 13
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
Investigation Organization under the Companies Act. The contention that was raised
was Church of South India is not a Company, therefore, the investigation cannot
happen. While over ruling that objection, Hon'ble Mr.Justice R.Mahadevan observed
that Church of South India Trust Association is a Company registered under Section
25 of the Companies Act, 1956 equivalent to Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013.
Therefore, the investigation of Serious Frauds Investigation Organization cannot be
said to be without jurisdiction.
19. In the case on hand, Church of South India Trust Association is not a party to the suit. The suit is
laid by the plaintiff against the Bishop https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 &
2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Deve Pradeep, CSI
Coimbatore Diocese and CSI Coimbatore Diocese represented by its Administrative Committee.
Therefore, the plaintiff has chosen to sue the Church of South India, CSI Diocese, Coimbatore and
not Church of South India Trust Association, which is Company registered under Section 25 of the
Companies Act, 1956.
20. The Church of South India is a congregation of Churches in five southern states. It is divided
into 25 Dioceses for the purpose of management. Even, in the Articles of the Association of Church
of South India, it is very clearly stated that the Church of South India Trust will be incharge of the
properties of the Church and the constitution of Church of South India makes it very clear that the
Church of South India will be an association of Churches in five Southern states and Church of
South India Trust Association will be incharge of the properties and finances of the Church. The
Churches within the five southern states have been divided into 24 diocese for the purpose
management and are governed by the apex body called a Diocesan Council, while the Church of
South India is governed by apex body called Synod.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021
21. There is a separate constitution for Church of South India and for each of the Diocese. The
Bishop will be the head of the Diocesan Council and he has disciplinary powers over the other
officers like Ministers, Presbyters and others. The Synod, which is the supreme body of Church of
South India has got power to appoint Bishops. The Pastorates are a smaller association of Churches
which come beneath the Diocesan Council.
22. The structure of Church of South India is as follows:
Individual Churches smaller group of churches called Pastorate, a group of Pastorates
called Diocese which is governed by Diocesan Council and the Synod functions as the
supreme body. These four stages form the religious part of Church of South India.
Whereas, the Church of South India Trust Association, which is a Company, deals
with the financial aspects. All the properties of the Church vest in the Company and
the Company was formed for the management of the properties of the Churches and
their finances. The functions of the Trust Association and the Diocese are totally
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 14
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
different and there is no intermingling of the two. Therefore, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP
Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 very fact that the Trust Association has been held to be a
Company cannot be a ground to conclude that a Diocese or the Church of South India
can be sued as a Company.
23. On the second argument of the counsel that the permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of
Civil Procedure is not mandatory and it can be obtained at any point of time, the law is too well
settled. This Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that a suit cannot be thrown out for
non- obtainment of permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But, at the same
time, whether a suit which requires a permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, instituted without such permission could be said to be pending, so as to enable the Court
before which it is pending to grant an interlocutory order under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the
Code of Civil Procedure is another question.
24. It is this question which has been answered by this Court in Rev.Noble Gambeeran and others
cited supra, Hon'ble Mr.Justice S.S.Subramani while considering the question whether in such a suit
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 instituted without permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an
injunction can be granted held as follows:-
24. In this case, Rev. Y. Williams is the name of the Honorary Secretary representing
the Executive Committee. He becomes representative of the Executive Committee
only when he is allowed to represent the Executive Committee by filing an application
and it becomes a representative suit only after issuing a notice on the application. As
on date, there is no representative suit against this second defendant at all. If there is
no suit, naturally, it also follows that no injunction can be granted. Order 39, Rule 1,
C.P.C; provides that an injunction must be against a party to the suit.
25. That was also a Revision filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India
questioning the order granting injunction in a matter relating to the Diocese. This
view of the Hon'ble Mr.Justice S.S.Subramani was re-affirmed by the Division Bench
of this Court in Executive Committee of the Synod of Rev.Noble Gambeeran and
others cited supra, wherein, the Division Bench held that the permission is
mandatory and non-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 obtainment of permission will result in dismissal of the suit.
26. I am therefore of the considered view that the contention of the learned counsel that because the
Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Court have held that permission under Order I Rule 8 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, is not mandatory and it can be obtained at any point of time, grant of injunction
in a suit which requires permission under Order 1 Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, without
such permission having been obtained is justified cannot be accepted.

Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
27. The other question which has to be examined is whether the learned District Munsif in granting
the injunction as prayed for has over stepped the order of the District Court in OS No.509 of 2019.
OS No.509 of 2019 was filed by two individuals representing the disqualified candidates of CSI All
Soul’s Church, Coimbatore, seeking a declaration that the disqualification of about 50 members by
the first respondent herein as the Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church, Coimbatore, is ultra virus, void
and not valid and binding and for a mandatory injunction for conducting elections to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 &
21006 of 2021 the Pastorate and the Committee of the Diocesan Council Members from CSI All
Soul’s Church, Coimbatore afresh. The essential grievance of the plaintiff in that suit was that they
were removed as Members of the Church without following the due process of law by the first
respondent herein and thus their removal is illegal.
28. The first respondent herein as the second defendant in the suit resisted the suit raising various
contentions. It is during the pendency of the said suit, the order of suspension came to be passed on
20.07.2021, suspending the first respondent as the Presbyter of the CSI All Soul’s Church,
Coimbatore. Because of the said suspension and since the essential grievance of the plaintiff in that
suit was the action of the first respondent herein in removing them as Members, the suit came to be
dismissed as having become infructuous as the first defendant in the said suit, namely the Bishop of
Coimbatore Diocese had undertaken to conduct fresh elections for the Pastorate Committee and
Diocesan Council. The learned Additional District Judge recording the submissions of the parties
disposed of the suit with the following directions:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP
Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 “In the result the suit is dismissed without cost but with
observation as follows:
a) To conduct fresh election to the Pastorate Committee and Diocesan council
members from CSI All Soul’s Church, Coimbatore has to be conducted by the new
Cairman/ Presbyter Rev. Prince Kalvin for the remaining period of the Triennium
2019-2022, within four months from the date of this judgment.
b) Fresh election has to be conducted after giving fair opportunity to all the eligible
voters in consonance with the Rules and procedures.
c) The Standard operating procedure of the State Government with regard to
Pandemic situation, for the smooth conduct of election and adhere all safety
precautionary methods for the voters and others.
29. The Court also recorded the submission of the counsel for the second defendant namely the first
respondent herein to the effect that he had https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923
& 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 requested the elections may be conducted
after the pandemic within six months. Therefore, the second defendant who was the party to the
proceedings in OS No.509 of 2019 had accepted the appointment of one Mr.Prince Calvin, as the
Presbyter in the place of the first respondent herein and agreed to the conduct of elections by him.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 16
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
The judgment in OS No.509 of 2019 came to be passed on 14.09.2021 and the present suit was
instituted on 23.09.2021, i.e. within 9 days from the date of the disposal of OS No.509 of 2019,
unfortunately there is no whisper about the suit in OS No.509 of 2019 and the judgment therein in
the present suit. This failure to disclose the suit in OS No.509 of 2019 and the result in the present
suit is also taken as a ground to contend that the plaintiff has not come with clean hands, therefore,
he should not be favoured with an order of injunction.
30. Be that as it may, as of now there is a judgment of the I Additional District Court which is a
superior Court directing elections to be conducted by Mr.Prince Calvin, as the Presbyter of the CSI
All Soul’s Church, Coimbatore and there is an order of injunction by the learned District Munsif an
inferior Tribunal restraining the Bishop, who is the first https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.
(PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 defendant in OS No.509 of
2019 from interfering with the plaintiff’s functioning as a Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church,
Coimbatore. There is a clear conflict between the two orders which are as of today in force. No
doubt, Mr.S.Sivashanmugam, learned counsel would contend that an Appeal filed by the first
respondent against the judgment in OS No.509 of 2019 is pending on the file of this Court. He would
also fairly submit that no interim order has been obtained in the said Appeal. Therefore, as of today
there are two conflicting orders.
31. The learned District Munsif would observe that the judgment in CS No.509 of 2019 cannot be
projected to justify the suspension of the plaintiff. The suspension of the plaintiff is one thing and
the judgment which is a consequence of the suspension is another. But at the same time, the Court
cannot be a party to create a situation where there are orders which run counter to each other. Once
the Higher Court or a Superior Tribunal had taken note of a prevailing factual situation and has
passed a particular order, the inferior Tribunal cannot alter the factual situation, so as to render the
Superior Tribunal’s order a nullity or unenforceable. By https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.
(PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 granting an order of
injunction restraining the first defendant Bishop from interfering with the plaintiff’s functioning as
the Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church, Coimbatore, the learned District Munsif has in effect over
ruled the judgment or prevented the directions in OS No.509 of 2019 issued by the I Additional
District Judge from being enforced.
32. Comity of Courts and discipline among hierarchy of Courts will have to be maintained. The
parties may ask for various reliefs, but the Courts must be cautious and cannot be made a tool in the
hands of unscrupulous parties and render the orders of Superior Tribunals unenforceable by
granting orders of injunction. I am therefore of the clear opinion that the District Munsif in granting
an injunction which would run counter to the directions in OS No.509 of 2019 exceeded its
jurisdiction and over stepped his powers.
33. Even on the requirement of Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the learned District
Munsif had gone astray and held that because Order I Rule 8 is not mandatory hence an injunction
can be granted. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP
Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 While deciding the question whether Order I Rule 8 is mandatory or the
suit to be thrown out for failure to comply with Order I Rule 8, the Courts did not examine the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118853045/ 17
Rt.Rev.Timothy Ravinder Dev Pradeep vs Rev.Charles Samraj.N on 23 December, 2021
question as to whether an injunction could be granted in such suits. In the two decisions which have
been relied upon by Mr.Selvaraj, namely the decision in Rev.Noble Gambeeran and others Vs. Peter
P. Ponnan for himself and as representative of members of C.S.I.Christian Community reported in
1999 (1) MLJ 392, and Executive Committee of the Synod Church of South India, Represented by its
General Secretary Vs. Rt. Rev. Dr.V.Devasahayam, Bishop in Madras Church of South India –
Madras Diocese reported in 2009 (5) CTC 398, this Court had specifically adverted to the grant of
injunction and held that an injunction cannot be granted in a suit which requires permission under
Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
34. I do not think I should venture into whether the reliefs sought for in the injunction application
are wider than the relief sought for in the suit, in view of the submission made by
Mr.Sivashanmugam, that he has got instructions to restrict the interim relief only to the suspension
of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and CMP Nos.21004
& 21006 of 2021 petitioner as a Presbyter of CSI All Soul’s Church, Coimbatore and as a President of
CSI St. Mark’s Church, Coimbatore. For the foregoing reasons, I find that the order of injunction
granted by the Trial Court cannot be sustained and will have to be interfered with. I am convinced
that the action of the learned District Munsif in granting an injunction is patently perverse and
would lead to an unenviable situation where there are two orders of Courts which conflict with each
other. Therefore, the need for exercise of the power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India,
really exist and if the power is not exercised, the results would be really disastrous.
35. Mr.S.Siva Shanmugam would also point out that after the order of injunction, the petitioner has
been reinstated as the Presbyter of the CSI All Soul’s Church, Coimbatore and as the President of
CSI St. Mark’s Church of Coimbatore, by the petitioner in CRP No.2923 of 2021. Such restoration in
compliance with the orders of the Court, in my opinion, will not confer any right on him to defeat
the challenge to the order of injunction. Once it is found that the orders of injunction ought not to
have been granted, a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P. (PD) Nos.2923 & 2924 of 2021 and
CMP Nos.21004 & 21006 of 2021 compliance with the order till the challenge is made cannot be a
ground to sustain the order or sustain the benefits arising out of the order.
36. In view of the above, the Civil Revision Petitions are allowed, the orders of injunction granted by
the Trial Court will stand set aside and the application in IA No.2 of 2021 in OS No.938 of 2021 will
stand dismissed. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. No costs.
