ORDER
This Writ Petition is filed by the petitioner party-in- person under article 226 and 227 of
Constitution of India read with 482 of Cr.P.C for quashing the FIR in Crime No.104/2021 registered
by the Vijayanagar Police Station, Bengaluru for the offences punishable under Sections 354D, 504
and 506 of IPC.
2. Heard the arguments of petitioner/party-in- person and counsel for respondent No.2 and learned
HCGP for respondent No.1/State.
3. The case of the prosecution is that the respondent No.2 filed first information statement before
the police alleging that the respondent No.2 said to be practicing advocate in Bengaluru and guest
teacher faculty in Bangalore Law College at Bengaluru. The petitioner said to be student in the said
law college, studied in final year during the year 2019-20 and he used to contact the respondent
No.2/complainant asking some doubt. Thereafter, he continuously was approaching her and later he
used to chat with her though Watsapp and later she is said to have blocked his mobile number and
he tried to contact respondent No.2/teacher through her sister, asking about the blocking of his
number. Subsequently, the petitioner said to have proposed respondent No.2 to marry her and she
has refused. Inspite of the refusal, again the petitioner continuously was chasing her and
pressurizing her to love him. The same was brought to the notice of the principal of the college and
the management, they also advised the petitioner not to disturb her. Thereafter, once again the
petitioner said to have approached the sister of the complainant in January 2021 and tried to talk
with respondent No.2/complainant. A complaint was also lodged against him at Navanagar police,
Hubballi. Thereafter, again the accused was sending his proposal and sending SMS and Whatsapp
messages to her. Therefore, the respondent gave complaint to the Vijayanagara Police Station on
11.4.2021 and they registered non cognizable offence and NCR was registered. Thereafter on
12.4.2021 the de-facto complainant approached the cyber crime police and filed another complaint
by improving the version from the first complaint by giving date as 18.7.2022 by mentioning fresh
cause of action. Thereafter on 14.4.2021 once again the respondent No.2 filed complaint at
Vijayanagara Police Station and lodged the complaint against the accused and police registered FIR

Anish Jose Antony vs State Of Karnataka on 3 January, 2023
for the above said offences which is under challenge.
4. The petitioner though party-in-person but presently he is practicing as advocate in Courts. He has
contended that the petitioner has filed complaint against respondent No.2 for withholding his
certificates on 10.4.2021. Therefore, she has filed a complaint against him in Vijayanagar Police
Station on 11.4.2021 a NCR was registered No.105/2021 by following the procedure under Section
155 (1) of Cr.P.C and the police have not registered any case which was not challenged by respondent
no.2 but she has filed another complaint before the Cyber crime police on 12.4.2021 and they also
not registered any case. Even otherwise she has stated the offence against the petitioner only
punishable under section 506 of IPC, but later on 14.3.2021 she has filed the 3rd complaint by
improving her version by adding section 354D of IPC and the police registered case against him.
Therefore, there are multiple complaint filed by respondent No.2 and therefore 2nd and 3rd
complaints are not maintainable in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in various
cases.
5. The learned HCGP contended that the police previously registered NCR case but later the
complainant was directed to approach the Cyber crime police as the accused was harassing the
complainant through Watsapp calls and SMS messages. But the cyber crime police did not take any
action against the petitioner therefore, she has approached the Vijayanagara Police and once again
filed the complaint with some more materials. Therefore, police are required to investigate the
matter. There is no FIR registered on the earlier complaint, therefore the police can investigate the
matter. Hence prayed for dismissing the petition.
6. Per contra the counsel for respondent No.2 filed statement of objection along with various
documents and contended that the petitioner was a student of respondent No.2, he was proposing
her to marry him by sending messages through mobile phone. Inspite of her refusal the accused was
continuously harassing her and offence attracts section 354 (D) of IPC, clearly. It will not attract the
principles of multiple investigation against the petitioner. Merely the complainant not challenged
the previous complaint which was registered for non cognizable offence that cannot be a violation of
the article 20 (2) of the Constitution of India. In the FIR there is cognizable offences made out
against the petitioner, therefore matter requires to be investigated by the police, hence prayed for
dismissing the petition.
7. Having heard the arguments of the party-in- person and learned counsel for respondent No.1 and
learned counsel for respondent No.2. The sum and substance of the case of the petitioner is that
though the respondent No.2 filed a complaint for the offence under section 506 of IPC, the NCR was
registered which was not challenged by her. Subsequently, the respondent No.2 also approached
cyber crime police and they have not taken any action. Thereafter, a complaint came to be filed
under section 154 of Cr.P.C where the police registered the FIR and investigated the matter. It is an
admitted fact in the previous complaint, the police have not investigated the matter and not filed
any final reports. Ofcourse, the respondent No.2 has stated, in the earlier complaint the accused is
threatening her. However, she has stated that the accused continuously is harassing her and
proposed to marry her but in the subsequent complaint she has alleged the offence under section
354 D of IPC against the accused. For the convenience, the 354 (D) of IPC is read as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28393960/ 3
Anish Jose Antony vs State Of Karnataka on 3 January, 2023
354D. Stalking.--
(1) Any man who--
(i) follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman to foster
personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such
woman; or
(ii) monitors the use by a woman of the internet, email or any other form of electronic
communication, commits the offence of stalking:
Provided that such conduct shall not amount to stalking if the man who pursued it
proves that--
(i) it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime and the man
accused of stalking had been entrusted with the responsibility of prevention and
detection of crime by the State; or
(ii) it was pursued under any law or to comply with any condition or requirement
imposed by any person under any law; or
(iii) in the particular circumstances such conduct was reasonable and justified.
(2) Whoever commits the offence of stalking shall be punished on first conviction
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years,
and shall also be liable to fine; and be punished on a second or subsequent
conviction, with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
five years, and shall also be liable to fine.
On bear reading of the Section 354(D), it clearly attracts the averments made in the complaint by
the de-facto complainant.
8. The counsel for respondent No.2 relied upon the judgment in "T.T. Antony Vs State of Kerala"
and connected matters reported in (2001) 6 SCC 181 it is held in Para 15, 19, 20, 22, 23, as under;
"15. On these contentions, four points arise for determination:
(i) whether registration of a fresh case, Crime No. 268 of 1997, Kuthuparamba Police
Station on the basis of the letter of the DGP dated 2-7-1997 which is in the nature of
the second FIR under Section 154 Cr.P.C, is valid and it can form the basis of a fresh
investigation;
(ii) whether the appellants in Appeals Nos.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28393960/ 4
Anish Jose Antony vs State Of Karnataka on 3 January, 2023
689 and 4066 of 2001 [arising out of SLPs (Crl.) Nos. 1522 and 8840 of 2000] and the respondent
in Appeals Nos. 690-91 of 2001 [arising out of SLPs (Crl.) Nos. 2724-25 of 2000] have otherwise
made out a case for quashing of proceedings in Crime No. 268 of 1997, Kuthuparamba Police
Station;
(iii) what is the effect of the report of Shri K. Padmanabhan Commission of Inquiry; and
(iv) whether the facts and the circumstances of the case justify a fresh investigation by CBI.
19. The scheme of CrPC is that an officer in charge of a police station has to commence investigation
as provided in Section 156 or 157 Cr.P.C on the basis of entry of the first information report, on
coming to know of the commission of a cognizable offence. On completion of investigation and on
the basis of the evidence collected, he has to form an opinion under Section 169 or 170 CrPC, as the
case may be, and forward his report to the Magistrate concerned under Section 173(2) CrPC.
However, even after filing such a report, if he comes into possession of further information or
material, he need not register a fresh FIR; he is empowered to make further investigation, normally
with the leave of the court, and where during further investigation he collects further evidence, oral
or documentary, he is obliged to forward the same with one or more further reports; this is the
import of sub-section (8) of Section 173 CrPC.
20. From the above discussion it follows that under the scheme of the provisions of Sections 154,
155, 156, 157, 162, 169, 170 and 173 CrPC only the earliest or the first information in regard to the
commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the requirements of Section 154 CrPC. Thus there can
be no second FIR and consequently there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of every
subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or
incident giving rise to one or more cognizable offences. On receipt of information about a cognizable
offence or an incident giving rise to a cognizable offence or offences and on entering the FIR in the
station house diary, the officer in charge of a police station has to investigate not merely the
cognizable offence reported in the FIR but also other connected offences found to have been
committed in the course of the same transaction or the same occurrence and file one or more
reports as provided in Section 173 CrPC.
22. On a perusal of the judgment of this Court in M. Krishna v. State of Karnataka [(1999) 3 SCC 247
: 1999 SCC (Cri) 397] we do not find anything contra to what is stated above. The case is
distinguishable on facts of that case. In the case on hand the second FIR is filed in respect of the
same incident and on the same facts after about three years.
23. The right of the police to investigate into a cognizable offence is a statutory right over which the
court does not possess any supervisory jurisdiction under CrPC. In Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad
[AIR 1945 PC 18 : 46 Cri LJ 413] the Privy Council spelt out the power of the investigation of the
police, as follows : (AIR p. 22) "In India, as has been shown, there is a statutory right on the part of
the police to investigate the circumstances of an alleged cognizable crime without requiring any
authority from the judicial authorities, and it would, as Their Lordships think, be an unfortunate
result if it should be held possible to interfere with those statutory rights by an exercise of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28393960/ 5
Anish Jose Antony vs State Of Karnataka on 3 January, 2023
inherent jurisdiction of the court.""
On perusal of the case on hand, admittedly there is no FIR or multiple FIRs
registered against the petitioner except the present FIR which is under challenge.
Though only previously only 506 of IPC is made out by the complainant in her
complaint but the fact remains the petitioner sent Watsapp messages and
continuously approaching the respondent No.2 for marrying him as he had fallen in
love with her and inspite of she refusing his proposal, again he was continuously
approaching pressurising her and proposing for marriage, which is nothing but
pressurising her either to love him or marry him which attract section 354(D) of IPC.
Whether the offence under section 504 of IPC attracts or not it is a matter of
investigation, but there is direct evidences which is required to be investigated by the
police and police can file Final report after the investigation.
9. The petitioner relied upon variously judgment of the supreme court in (a) State of
Haryana and Others Vs Bhajan Lal and Ors 1992 Suppl. (1) SCC 335,
(b) Kumari Venkataratnam Vs Unknown (1947) 1 MLJ 359 Madras High Court and
(c) Manik Taneja Vs State of Karnataka (2015, 7 SCC 423 in respect of essential
ingredients of the offences regarding criminal intimidation and for the offences
punishable under Sections 504 of IPC but the fact remains the petitioner being a law
student where the respondent No.2 was a guest faculty who is a teacher for this
petitioner and he was pressurizing her for loving him and to marry him and also
sending Watsapp messages and making threatening calls to her. It is unfortunate that
a student pressuring teacher to love him and marry him inspite of her refusal and he
was always chasing her. Such being the case, the matter requires to be investigated by
the police.
Therefore, at this stage it is not a fit stage for quashing FIR on the ground that there was multiple
FIR against him on the same cause of action. Therefore, the petition is devoid of merits liable to be
dismissed.
Accordingly, this petition is dismissed.
