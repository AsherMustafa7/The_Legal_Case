Counsel, P R E S E N T:
THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI Date of hearing and judgment :
30.07.2021 DR. B.R. SARANGI, J. The petitioner, who was working as Additional
Commissioner of Commercial Tax and Goods and Service Tax (Revenue) in the
Commissionerate of the Commercial Tax and Goods and Service Tax, has // 2 // filed
this writ petition seeking to quash the letter dated 14.07.2020 under Annexure-3
rejecting his representations dated 08.01.2020 and 17.03.2020 to treat the next date
of retirement i.e., 01.01.2020 as the date of grant of notional increment for the
purpose of pensionary benefits, in compliance of direction given by this Court, vide
order dated 27.05.2020 in W.P.(C) No. 11642 of 2020, and further seeks for a
direction to grant notional increment for the period from 01.01.2019 to 31.12.2019 by
treating the next date of increment, i.e., 01.01.2020 as the date of grant of notional
increment for the purpose of pensionary benefits.
2. The factual matrix of the case, in hand, is that by following due procedure of
selection, the petitioner was appointed and joined in service under the Government
of Odisha on 17.10.1988 and subsequently promoted from time to time. His date of
birth being 01.01.1960, on attaining the age of superannuation, he retired on
31.12.2019. He was // 3 // allowed previous increment on 01.01.2019 and, as such,
the next increment was due on 01.01.2020, which was the next day of his date of
superannuation, i.e., 31.12.2019. But, he was not extended with the incremental

Afr Arun Kumar Biswal vs State Of Odisha And Another ..... Opp. ... on 30 July, 2021
benefit, which was fallen due on 01.01.2020, for which he submitted a representation
to the authority. The same having not been acceded to, he approached this Court by
filing W.P.(C) No. 11642 of 2020, which was disposed of on 27.05.2020 directing the
authority to take a decision on the representation filed by the petitioner and pass
appropriate order keeping in view the order dated 15.09.2017 of the Madras High
Court in W.P.(C) No. 15732 of 2017 (P. Ayyamperumal v. The Registrar, Central
Administrative Tribunal, Madras Bench), which was confirmed by the apex Court in
Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary No(s). 22283 of 2018. In compliance of the
direction given by this Court, opposite party no.2 passed the impugned order dated
14.07.2020 in Annexure-3 stating therein that the date of birth of the // 4 //
petitioner being 01.01.1960, the date of his superannuation was on 31.12.2019, and
that as he was allowed previous increment on 01.01.2019, his next increment was due
on 01.01.2020, but on that date since the petitioner was no more in service, he was
not entitled to any incremental benefit on the day following the superannuation i.e.,
01.01.2020. Hence this writ petition.
3. Mr. S.K. Dash, learned counsel for the petitioner contended that admittedly, the date of birth of
the petitioner is 01.01.1960 and on attaining the age of superannuation, he was retired from service
on 31.12.2019. As such, his next increment was due on 01.01.2020, as he had received the previous
increment on 01.01.2019. Therefore, for the period he rendered service from 01.01.2019 to
31.12.2019, he is entitled to get the increment, which should be notionally fixed, as the increment
was due on 01.01.2020, so as to entitle him to get pensionary benefits. It is further contended that
the rejection of the claim of the petitioner, in // 5 // compliance of the order dated 27.05.2020
passed by this Court in W.P.(C) No. 11642 of 2020, on the plea that he ceases to draw the pay and
allowance as soon as he ceases to discharge duties from the day following the superannuation as per
Rule-56 of the Odisha Service Code and becomes eligible for pension under Rule 82 of the Odisha
Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1992. It is further contended that as per the clarification obtained
from the Finance Department, the annual increment falls due irrespective of the date of anniversary
of appointment and as per Rule 10 of the Odisha Revised Scales of Pay Rules, 2017, the date of next
increment shall be 12 months from the date of last sanction. Therefore, while rejecting the
representation of the petitioner, the authority has failed to apply the ratio decided in P.
Ayyamperumal (supra), which has been confirmed by the apex Court in SLP (Civil) Diary No(s).
22283 of 2018, and assign any reason as to why the ratio decided in the said order would not be
applicable to the case of the petitioner. Therefore, the // 6 // order impugned rejecting the
representation of the petitioner is cryptic and unreasonable one. It is further contended that the
clarification of the Finance Department has been wrongly read and interpreted, inasmuch as the
annual increment is always continuous and is not dependent or calculated by taking into account
either the entry into or exit from the service.
It is further contended that while disposing of the representation, the opposite party no.2 has
candidly admitted that the increment was last sanctioned on 01.01.2019 and therefore the next date
of sanction would be on 01.01.2020, and that on attaining the age of superannuation the petitioner
having retired from service on 31.12.2019, thereby, Rule 56 of the Service Code laying down the
entitlement of pay and allowance cannot be read as a bar to disburse the accrued dues and it is also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135745531/ 2
Afr Arun Kumar Biswal vs State Of Odisha And Another ..... Opp. ... on 30 July, 2021
equally erroneous to import the language of Rule 82 of the Odisha Civil Services (Pension) Rules,
1992 to justify // 7 // the action taken by opposite party no.2 in rejecting the claim for grant of
annual increment to the petitioner.
To substantiate his contention he has relied upon the order dated 15.09.2017 of the Madras High
Court in W.P.(C) No. 15732 of 2017 (P. Ayyamperumal v. The Registrar, Central Administrative
Tribunal, Madras Bench), which was confirmed by the apex Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil)
Diary No(s). 22283 of 2018 and the review petition bearing R.P.(C) No. 1731 of 2019 filed by the
Union of India; order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Yogendra Singh Bhaduria & Ors. Vs.
State of Madhya Pradesh & Gwalior (W.A. No. 645 of 2020 disposed of on 22.09.2020); and the
order of the Delhi High Court in Gopal Singh v. Union of India and others (W.P.(C) No. 10509 of
2019 disposed of on 23.01.2020).
4. Mr. S.N. Nayak, learned Addl. Standing Counsel appearing for the State argued with vehemence
and contended that the petitioner is not entitled to get // 8 // the next increment which was due on
01.01.2020 notionally, as he was no more in employment and had retired on attaining the age of
superannuation on 31.12.2019. He further contended that the last annual increment was sanctioned
on 01.01.2019 and, as such, the petitioner is entitled to get monthly pension and other pensionary
benefits like, gratuity, unutilized leave salary, etc. on the basis of the last pay arrived at due to
sanction of annual increment with effect from 01.01.2019. When the petitioner filed representation
for grant of notional increment taking the last pay as 01.01.2020 and grant of consequential
pensionary benefits, the Finance Department being the cadre controlling authority and
administrative department, the said representation was transmitted to opposite party no.1 by
opposite party no.2 for consideration. After receipt of the order dated 27.05.2020 of this Court, the
opposite party no.2 requested the opposite party no.1 on 19.06.2020 for necessary clarification in
the aforesaid matter. In response to the same, the // 9 // impugned order has been passed stating
inter alia that as per Rule 10 of the Odisha Revised Scales of Pay Rules, 2017 the date of next
increment shall be from 12 months from the date of last increment sanctioned. As Government
servant ceases to draw the pay and allowances as soon as he ceases to discharge the duties from the
day following the superannuation as per Rule- 56 of the Odisha Service Code and eligible for
pension under Rule-82 of the Odisha Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1992. As the petitioner's next
increment was due on 01.01.2020 and he had already retired from service on 31.12.2019 on
attaining the age of superannuation, he is not entitled to get the next increment, as his last
increment was sanctioned on 01.01.2019, and on that basis he is entitled to get pension and
pensionary benefits as due and admissible to him. Consequently, the rejection order passed by the
authority is well justified, which does not warrant interference of this Court, and the writ petition
should be dismissed.
// 10 // 5 This Court heard Mr. S.K. Dash, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. S.N. Nayak,
learned Addl. Standing Counsel appearing for the State opposite parties by virtual mode. Perused
the records and with the consent of the parties, the matter is being disposed of finally at the stage of
admission.

6. In view of the undisputed factual matrix, as narrated above, and rival contentions raised by
learned counsel for both parties, Rule-56 of the Odisha Service Code, being relevant for just and
proper adjudication of the case, is extracted hereunder:-
"RULE-56: Date of commencement -
Termination of Pay and Allowance: Subject to exceptions specifically provided in these rules, a
Government servant shall begin to draw the pay and allowances attached to his post with effect from
the date on which he assumes the duties of that post, and shall cease to draw them as soon as he
ceases to discharge those duties."
7. In exercise of power conferred by the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, the
Governor of Odisha framed a set of Rules to regulate the grant of pension, gratuity and other
retirement // 11 // benefits to the persons on retirement from service in connection with the affairs
of the State of Odisha, called "The Odisha Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1992". Rule-82 of the
Odisha Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1992, being relevant for the purpose of this case, is quoted
hereunder:-
"82. Date from which pension becomes payable - (1) Except in the case of a
Government servant to whom the provisions of Rules 43 and 44 apply and subject to
the provisons of Rules 7 and 66, a pension other than family pension shall become
payable from due date on which a Government servant ceases to be borne on the
establishment.
(2) Pension including family pension shall be payable for the day on which its
recipient dies."
8. In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Article-309 of the Constitution of India, the
Governor of Odisha had been pleased to make a set of Rules called "The Odisha Revised Scales of
pay Rules, 2017". Rule 10 of the Odisha Revised Scales of pay Rules, 2017, being relevant to for the
purpose of proper adjudication of the case, is extracted below:
"10. Date of Next increment in the revised pay structure.-

structure, shall be twelve months from the date of last increment sanctioned. In case
where the pay is fixed in the revised pay structure at the minimum pay or the first
Cell in the Level, the date of next increment shall be the anniversary of date of
coming over to the revised pay structure."
9. On perusal of the aforementioned provisions, it is made clear that subject to the
explanation specifically provided in the rules, the government servant shall begin to
draw the pay and allowances attached to the post with effect from the date on which
he assumes the duties of the post and shall not be entitled to get the same soon after
he ceases to discharge those duties. Thereby, there is no dispute with regard to
entitlement of the petitioner to receive the pension and other pensionary benefits on
attaining the age of superannuation on 31.12.2019. As // 13 // per Rule-82 of the
Odisha Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1992, the pension other than the family
pension shall become payable to a government servant from due date on which he
ceased to borne on the establishment.
The pension including family pension shall be payable for the day on which the recipient dies. So,
these rules make it clear that on attaining the age of superannuation, the petitioner is entitled to get
pension and pensionary benefits. But the present case rests on the question of grant of notional
increment, which had fallen due to the next date of retirement. Meaning thereby, the petitioner's
date of birth being 01.01.1960 and he having retired on 31.12.2019 on attaining the age of
superannuation, and his increment was due on 01.01.2020, and admittedly he had been granted the
increment benefit till 01.01.2019, the claim for grant of notional increment from 01.01.2019 to
31.12.2019 is the question to be considered in the present case.
10. As per Rule-10 of the Odisha Revised Scales of pay Rules, 2017, the date of next increment in //
14 // the revised pay structure, shall be twelve months from the date of last increment sanctioned.
The last increment here was sanctioned on 01.01.2019. Therefore, the date of next increment, after
the twelve months period, will be 01.01.2020. As the petitioner retired from service on attaining the
age of superannuation on 31.12.2019, whether the benefit of notional fixation of increment for the
purpose of grant of pensionary benefits is admissible to the petitioner or not, is the short question
which is to be adjudicated in the present case.
11. In State of Kerala v. P.N. Neelkandan Nair, (2005) 5 SCC 561 : AIR 2005 SC 3066, the apex Court
held that the increment has a definite concept in service laws. It is conceptually different from
revision of pay scale. It is an increase or addition in a fixed scale. It is a regular increment in salary
on such a scale.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135745531/ 5
Afr Arun Kumar Biswal vs State Of Odisha And Another ..... Opp. ... on 30 July, 2021
12. The claim of the petitioner is totally based on the judgment of the Madras High Court in P.
Ayyamperumal (supra), where similar question had // 15 // come up for consideration, meaning
thereby, in that case direction was sought to treat the retirement date of the petitioner as 01.07.2013
and grant all consequential benefits including pensionary benefits. It is made clear, in the said case
the petitioner was denied the last increment, though he completed a full one year in service, i.e.,
from 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013. But the Central Administrative Tribunal, Madras Bench, in
O.A./310/00917/2015, vide order dated 21.03.2017, rejected the claim of the petitioner taking a
view that the incumbent is only entitled to get increment on 1st July, 2013 if he continued in service.
On that day, since the petitioner was no longer in service, he was denied the relief. The matter was
carried to the Madras High Court in a writ petition bearing W.P. No. 15732 of 2017, which was
disposed of vide order dated 15.09.2017 observing in para-6 and 7 as follows:
"6.In the case on hand, the petitioner got retired on 30.06.2013. As per the Central
Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008, the increment has to be given only on
01.07.2013, but he had been superannuated on 30.06.2013 itself. The judgment
referred to by the petitioner in State of // 16 // Tamil Nadu, rep.by its Secretary to
Government, Finance Department and others v.
M.Balasubramaniam, reported in CDJ 2012 MHC 6525, was passed under similar
circumstances on 20.09.2012, wherein this Court confirmed the order passed in
W.P.No.8440 of 2011 allowing the writ petition filed by the employee, by observing
that the employee had completed one full year of service from 01.04.2002 to
31.03.2003, which entitled him to the benefit of increment which accrued to him
during that period.
7.The petitioner herein had completed one full year service as on 30.06.2013, but the
increment fell due on 01.07.2013, on which date he was not in service. In view of the
above judgment of this Court, naturally he has to be treated as having completed one
full year of service, though the date of increment falls on the next day of his
retirement. Applying the said judgment to the present case, the writ petition is
allowed and the impugned order passed by the first respondent- Tribunal dated
21.03.2017 is quashed. The petitioner shall be given one notional increment for the
period from 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013, as he has completed one full year of service,
though his increment fell on 01.07.2013, for the purpose of pensionary benefits and
not for any other purpose. No costs."
13. In the above order of the Madras High Court, it was held that as the petitioner therein had
completed one full year service as on 30.06.2013, but the increment fell due on 01.07.2013, on
which date he was not in service, though the date of increment fell due on the next date of his
retirement, the petitioner would be given one notional increment for the period from // 17 //
01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013, as he had completed full one year of service, for the purpose of
pensionary benefits and not for any other purpose. The said order of the Madras High Court was
challenged in SLP(C) Diary No(s). 22283 of 2018 and the apex Court dismissed the said SLP
preferred by the Union of India and upheld the order of the Madras High Court in P. Ayyamperumal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135745531/ 6
Afr Arun Kumar Biswal vs State Of Odisha And Another ..... Opp. ... on 30 July, 2021
(supra). Although a review petition was filed by the Union of India bearing R.P.(C) No. 1731 of 2019,
the same was dismissed vide order dated 08.08.2019. Thereby, the order of the Madras High Court
has reached its finality by dismissal of the SLP as well as the review petition preferred by the Union
of India.
14. Similarly, in the case of Yogendra Singh Bhadauria, mentioned supra, Madhya Pradesh High
Court, by applying the ratio decided in P. Ayyamperumal (supra), directed as follows:-
"(i) The official respondents are directed to release the increment due to the
appellants w.e.f. 01.07.2014, 01.07.2010, 01.07.2013, 01.07.2012, 01.07.2015 and
01.07.2015 respectively.
// 18 //
(ii) The pension be refixed after adding the grant of aforesaid increment and the arrears of pension
be paid to the petitioners.
(iii) The petitioners are entitled to interest over the aforesaid arrears of pension @ 10% p.a. from the
date the arrears became due till their payment.
(iv) Despite the rule position having been explained by the Division Bench of Madras High Court on
15.09.2017 against which Supreme Court declined to entertain the SLP of the employer on
23.07.2018, the official respondents ought to have offered the benefit of one increment to the
petitioners without compelling the petitioners to approach the court in the evening of 10 WA
645-2020 their life. Not having done so, the official respondents have failed to adhere to the policy
of the Government of being a welfare State and therefore, respondents are liable to pay cost of this
litigation to the petitioners which are quantified at Rs. 5000/- to each of the petitioners.
(v) The aforesaid direction be complied with within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt copy
of this order."
15. In Gopal Singh (supra), the Delhi High Court in paragraph-10 of the order dated 23.01.2020
directed as follows:
"10. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 3rd May, 2019 is set aside. A direction is
issued to the Respondents to grant notional increment to the petitioner with effect
from 1st July, 2019. The petitioner's pension will consequentially be re- fixed. The
appropriate orders will be issued and arrears of pension will be paid to the petitioner
within a period of 6 weeks, failing which the respondents would be lilable to simple
interest at 6 % per annum on the arrears of period of delay."
// 19 //
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135745531/ 7
Afr Arun Kumar Biswal vs State Of Odisha And Another ..... Opp. ... on 30 July, 2021
16. The cumulative effect of the ratio decided in all the aforementioned judgments is that if a person
continues in service and completes one year, he shall be entitled to get the notional increment to be
fixed, as on the next date he is no more in employment, for the purpose of grant of pensionary
benefits.
17. The stand taken in the present case by the opposite parties is akin to the objection raised in P.
Ayyamperumal (supra) by Union of India contending that the petitioner being no more in
employment on the date the increment fallen due, even though he had completed 12 months of
service and on attaining the age of superannuation he was retired. Having considered such
contention, the Madras High Court passed an order to fix the notional increment for pensionary
benefits and extend the same to the petitioner therein. In such view of the matter, this Court is of the
view that the representations filed by the petitioner have been rejected on 14.07.2020 in Annexure-3
without complying with the provisions of law, as have been // 20 // settled by the different High
Courts as well as the apex Court and, thereby, the same cannot sustain in the eye of law.
18. In view of the facts and law, as discussed above, this Court is of the considered view that the
petitioner, having rendered service from 01.01.2019 to 31.12.2019 for a period of 12 months and his
increment having due on 01.01.2020 and he having stood at par with P. Ayyamperumal (supra), is
entitled to get the notional increment for the year i.e. from 01.01.2019 to 31.12.2019 for the purpose
of pensionary benefits only. Accordingly, it is directed that the benefits admissible to the petitioner
be re-fixed taking into account the notional increment admissible to the petitioner by 01.01.2020
and the same should be paid as early as possible by revising the pension as due, preferably within a
period of 3 (three) months from the date of communication of this judgment. Consequentially, the
order dated 14.07.2020 in Annexure-3, whereby the // 21 // representations of the petitioner have
been rejected, is liable to be quashed and is hereby quashed.
19. In the result, the writ petition is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.

parties may utilize a printout of the judgment available in the High Court's website, at par with
certified copy, subject to attestation by the concerned advocate, in the manner prescribed vide
