2. The case of the petitioners is that the petitioners challenged the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in G.O.Ms.No.31 dated 06.08.1958
issued by the 1st respondent in G.O.R.No.970, P.W.(General) dated 26.07.1958, thereby proposed to
acquire the land ad-measuring to an extent of 8.36 acres in Velachery Village for a public purpose, to

not been acquired and taken possession by the Government till date. The respondents have neither
entered into the land nor effected any modification or construction or put up any sign board or
indication in the subject land.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that in the 4(1) notification, the owners of the
extent of 6.49 acres mentioned as Gopalsamy Iyer, Venkatrama Iyer, Ramachandra Iyer and
Subramania Iyer. None of these persons shown as owners except Ramachandra Iyer was ever in
possession at any point of time subsequent to 1925. Since the partition was effected between the
three sons of P.S.Ganapathy Iyer. The said P.S.Ganapathy Iyer was the original owner of an extent of
63.78 acres in S.No.317/1 in Velachery Village. After his demise on 06.09.1915, his three
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis sons viz., Venkatrama Iyer, Krishnasamy Iyer and Ramachandra

the same. The said Ramachandra Iyer sold his entire share of 21.26 acres to the petitioners' father by
the sale deed dated 29.11.1957 registered vide Document No.3307 of 1957. Till his demise, he was in
absolute possession and enjoyment of the said property and dealt with the same by sold out portion
of the said land to various persons.
4. He further submitted that as per notification dated 06.08.1958, no possession of the subject land
has been taken by the respondents and the subject land is still in the possession and enjoyment of
the petitioners. That apart, no compensation has been paid to any one of the petitioners or their
father, viz., A.S.V.Varadhachariar. Even after the lapse of 60 years, the land notified in the Gazette
publication was not acquired by the Government and there has been no other notification at all in
respect of the land ad-measuring 6.49 acres. The land was sought to be acquired for the purpose of
constructing V.O.R. Station by the Government of India and no V.O.R. Station was constructed in
the said land till today. The land remains https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis vacant and the
petitioners are in possession and enjoyment of the subject land as the legal heirs of the said

notification published under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in respect of the property comprised in

published in the Government Gazette on 09.07.1958. During the process of award, one of the
interested persons, viz., Sri Subramania Iyer appeared for enquiry and has stated that the portions
of the land sub-divided among the owners and he had requested time. In fact, the time was granted
and further enquiry was conducted on 14.10.1959 and the father of the petitioners, viz.,
A.S.V.Varadachariar appeared for enquiry and represented that the portion of the land under
acquisition comprised in S.No.317/1 does not belong to him. Therefore, the then Revenue Divisional
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Officer, Saidapet Division has concluded that there were disputes
between the ownership and the compensation amount of Rs.1198.11/- was deposited in the Court as
contemplated under Section 31(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Further concluded that the
land in the Southern portion of S.No.317/1 was purchased by the petitioners' father from

in the names of legal heirs of Ganapathy Iyer, viz., Gopala Iyer, Venkatrama Iyer, Ramachandra
Iyer, Subramania Iyer and the petitioners' father viz., A.S.V.Varadhachariar and since there were
disputes in the ownership and compensation amount of Rs.1198.11/- was deposited in the Court.

that in the result, there would be an order https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis directing that the
compensation amount in deposit is to be paid to 5th claimant (the petitioner's father viz.,
A.S.V.Varadachariar). The claimants 1 to 4 are entitled to costs from 5th claimant. The 7th claimant
would bear his cost.
9. It is further revealed that as per G.O.Ms.No.478 Revenue LD 4(2) Department dated 27.10.2001,
the Chief Engineer, Metropolitan Transport Project (Railways) has requested for allotment of land
for the establishment of Velachery Railway Station in Velachery Village, Mambalam-Guindy Taluk
under the Mass Rapid Transit System Scheme. The lands comprised in S.No.317/1B are in the name
of 'Government poramboke V.O.R. Station' in the revenue records. These lands were acquired in the
year 1959 and now it is under the control of Airport Authority of India. Pending land transfer

The District Revenue Officer has inspected the land on 06.10.2003. As per his report, the Railways
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49913309/ 4
V.Srinivasan vs State Of Tamilnadu on 17 December, 2021
Department have stored construction materials in the proposed site. There are no valuable trees and
encroachments in the site. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis There is a small building in dilapidated
condition. As the demolition charges will be higher than the building cost, the building value was
not fixed. The Additional General Manager, Airport Authority of India has consented to the transfer
of land to Railways Department on collection of market value.
10. Accordingly, the 3rd respondent has recommended the resumption of land from the Airport
Authority of India and transferring it in favour of the Railways Department for Mass Rapid Transit
System Scheme. The Special Commissioner and Commissioner of Land Administration had
recommended for the proposal of the District Collector for resumption of lands measuring to an
extent of 8.36 acres comprised in S.No.317/1B in Velachery Village from the Airport Authority of
India and transfer to Railway Authorities at the rate of Rs.132.30 per sq.feet under Revenue
Standing Order No.23 with usual conditions. The Government on scrutiny of the proposal have
decided to accept the recommendation of the 3rd respondent, the Special Commissioner and
Commissioner of Land Administration directed subject lands are resumed from the Airport
Authority of India and transferred to Railways Department for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
construction of Velachery Railway Station for MRTS Phase II Scheme under Revenue Standing
Order No.23 with usual conditions. Accordingly, the subject land is in possession of the 5th
respondent.
11. While pending the writ petition, this Court appointed the Advocate Commissioner to inspect the
subject land and the learned Advocate Commissioner filed a report dated 08.10.2018, revealed that
it is lying vacant and there is no sign of any construction or possession of the land by anybody. A
new pucca tar road starting from Velachery Main Road and of a width of 60 feet runs to a distance of
about 300 meters and ends at the western boundary of the surveyed land. It continues as a road
across the subject matter of the property.
12. Therefore, the petitioners are never in possession and enjoyment of the subject property. As
stated supra, the entire land has been taken over and now the 5th respondent is in possession and
enjoyment of the same, after laying tar road across the subject property.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
13. As stated supra, the compensation amount has already deposited in the Court as contemplated
under Section 31 (2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for the subject land. Therefore, the
petitioners failed to prove their case on hand. These issues are already settled by the Constitution
Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the judgment reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129 in the
case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors etc., which held as follows :-
“366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.

V.Srinivasan vs State Of Tamilnadu on 17 December, 2021
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue
as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of 1894 as if it
has not been repealed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be read as nor or
as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013
takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the
said Act, the possession of land has not been taken nor compensation has been paid. In other words,
in case possession has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly,
if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not include a
deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in proviso to Section
24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of land holdings then all
beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the
Act of 1894 shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.
In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled,
interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land
acquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five years
or more, compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the Act
of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to
non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by
tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or
who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had
lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not part of
Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 1894 and as
contemplated under Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has
been passed on taking possession under Section 16 of the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is
no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken
there is no lapse under Section 24(2).
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case
authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49913309/ 6
V.Srinivasan vs State Of Tamilnadu on 17 December, 2021
or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with
concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has
to be excluded in the computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of
concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of
enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and
does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of
taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.” In view of the above, the
writ petition is devoid of merits and it is liable to be dismissed.
14. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions
are closed. No costs.
