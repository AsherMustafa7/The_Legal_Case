the petitioner to sell or distribute the drugs in the name of M/s
Pharmacity.
It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner was
Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019
2/12
running it's medicine shop in the name of M/s Pharmacity vide
license No. PAT 509/2015 & PAT 509A/2015 for sale and
distribution of drugs. The license issued to the petitioner are said
to be valid and operative till 13.10.2020. It appears that on
27.04.2017
, a team of Drug Inspectors conducted an inspection in the medicine shop being run in front of
Patliputra Station in Mohalla Gandhi Nagar by one self-claimed doctor namely Dr. Ajit Kumar. In
course of inspection, they seized some medicines and purchase invoice No. R00347 dated
23.02.2017 issued by M/s Pharmacity (the petitioner). From the invoice, it appeared that the
petitioner had sold the medicine Ceftamycin Dry Syrup Batch No. 17485 manufactured by Venus
having expiry date of 10/17 quantity being 10 bottles to one M/s Captain Pharma C/o
- Rajendra Memorial Hospital, Khemnichak, Patna. Another invoice bearing No. R00385 dated
17.03.2017 for the same item showing a sale of 20 bottles of the medicine to the same firm M/s
Captain Pharma was found.
In order to verify the invoices raised by this petitioner, the inspecting team visited the shop
premises of this petitioner on 28.04.2017. They called for the stock register of Ceftamycin Dry Syrup
30 ml. Which was made available. The register showed the sale of the said medicine/drug under the
two Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019 invoices. The proof of payments were
also made available to the inspecting team. The proprietor of the petitioner's firm informed in
course of inspection that the medicines aforementioned were sold at the instance of the
Representative of Venus Remedies. The name of said Representative was disclosed as Sri Krishna
Kumar with his mobile number and the same was verified by the inspecting team by calling said Sri
Krishna Kumar on his mobile number. Sri Krishna Kumar accepted in course of telephonic talk that
both the invoices were raised by the petitioner at his instance in the name of M/s Captain Pharma
and the medicines were given to a person whose name and address was not known, whether the said
person is connected with M/s Captain Pharma or not was not known. Sri Krishna Kumar accepted
that he had made payment of the medicines to this petitioner. The inspecting team recorded the
aforementioned facts in the inspection report dated 28.04.2017, a copy of which is available on
record as Annexure '1' to the writ application.

M/S Pharmacity Partner Rajesh Kumar ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 17 June, 2019
Thereafter a show cause notice was issued to the petitioner vide Memo No. 598 dated 11.07.2017 and
he was called upon to submit his reply in the light of what were recorded in course of inspection.
Petitioner submitted his reply dated 23.01.2018 vide Annexure '3' to the writ application in Patna
High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019 which he submitted that the two invoices were
issued by the petitioner at the instance of the Representative of the Company. The petitioner also
disclosed that there was no provision for verification of the license of the purchaser at the time of
sale of medicine and that he had sold the medicine being fully satisfied on the photocopy of the
license of M/s Captain Pharma produced by the Representative of the Company. He submitted that
if any unknown person had been given those medicines, the petitioner had nothing to do with the
same. Petitioner had enclosed copy of the license issued in the name of M/s Captain Pharma
showing that the said firm had a valid license up to 21.12.2019 in Form No. 21 relatable to Rule 61(1)
of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules.
The Assistant Drug Controller, thereafter passed the impugned order as contained in Annexure '5'
dated 30.01.2018 by holding that the sale of medicine in the name of M/s Captain Pharma on the
basis of the Xerox copy of the drug license produced by Sri Krishna Kumar, the Representative of
the medicine Company is in violation of condition No. 3(ii) and 4(ii) of the Drug License. He,
therefore, cancelled the license of the petitioner for the alleged violation.
The petitioner thereafter preferred an appeal before Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018
dt.17-06-2019 the appellate authority. He took a plea that invoices were issued only after he was
shown the license of M/s Captain Pharma through Medical Representative of Venus Company
Krishna Kumar and it was totally beyond his imagination that the drugs be sold to the original
licensee only and not to any representative of the licensee showing the license. The petitioner also
submitted that the license was issued to him on 14.10.2015, there was no allegation of violation of
any terms of the license against him prior to the service of the show cause in the present case and in
the given facts of the case it is too harsh a punishment to cancel the license in it's entirety of a shop
which is only 1Â½ years old. It was submitted that save and except the allegation there as no material
against the petitioner to support the allegations of violation of any of the terms and conditions of the
license. In course of inspection nothing inappropriate was found in the shop of the petitioner.
The appellate authority however rejected the appeal preferred by the petitioner by simply recording
in the appellate order that the stand of the petitioner was found dissatisfactory.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted before this court that from a bare perusal of the
appellate order dated 06.08.2018 passed by the appellate authority it would Patna High Court
CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019 appear that he has simply recorded the submissions of the
petitioner and thereafter rejected the appeal without giving any consideration and by holding in one
line that the stand of the petitioner was dissatisfactory. It is submitted that the cancellation of
license of the petitioner shop has got a civil consequence and apparently the allegations made
against the petitioner are not such that it required cancellation of the license itself. Learned counsel
submits that the impugned orders passed by the Assistant Drug Controller as well as appellate
authority are fit to be quashed and cancelled on the ground of non- consideration of the materials
available on the record as also for the reason that the punishment by way of cancellation of license is

M/S Pharmacity Partner Rajesh Kumar ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 17 June, 2019
excessive.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the State respondents has opposed the writ application. It is
submitted that the impugned order do not suffer from any illegality and both the orders have been
passed after considering the materials available on the record. It is also submitted that the order has
been passed giving reasons and therefore no interference is required.
In course of hearing of the writ application it was submitted before this court that a police case had
also been Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019 registered against the petitioner
on the same set of allegations on which the license of the petitioner had been cancelled. This court
was informed that till date police has not submitted any charge-sheet in the police case being Rajiv
Nagar P.S. Case No. 94/2017.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records, this court finds that the
facts of the case are not in dispute. It was the stand of the petitioner that he had sold the medicine in
question which is a dry syrup to M/s Captain Pharma on the request of Sri Krishna Kumar, the
Representative of the Company who had produced the photocopy of the drug license of M/s Captain
Pharma. The stock register produced before the inspecting team certified the position as appearing
from the two invoices. Sri Krishna Kumar who is the Representative of M/s Venus Remedies i.e. the
manufacturing company of the medicine has acknowledged and accepted the fact that he had got the
medicines under the two invoices for M/s Captain Pharma. He however failed to explain as to whom
the medicines were handed over and whether the person to whom the medicines were handed over
had any connection with M/s Captain Pharma or not. The Assistant Drug Controller has accepted
the stand of the petitioner but then he Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019 has
proceeded to pass the impugned order as contained in Annexure '5' alleging violation of Condition
No. 3(ii) and 4(ii) of the Drug License which reads as under : -
3(ii). No sale of any drug shall be made to a person not holding the requisite licence
to sell, stock or exhibit for sale or distribute the drug. Provided that the condition
shall not apply to the sale of any drug to -
a. an office or authority purchasing on behalf of Government, or b. a hospital,
medical, educational or research institution, or a registered medical practitioner for
the purpose of supply to his patients, or c. a manufacturer of beverages, confectionery
biscuits and other non-
medicinal products, where such drugs are required for processing these products.
4(ii). No sale of any drug shall be made for purpose of resale to a person not holding
the requisite licence to sell, stock or exhibit for sale or distribute the drug. Provided
that this condition shall not apply to the sale of any drug to -
a. an officer or authority purchasing on behalf of Government, or b. a hospital,
medical, educational or research institution, or a registered medical practitioner for
the purpose of supply to his Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019

patients, or c. a manufacturer of hydrogenated vegetables oils, beverages,
confectionery and other non-medicinal products, where such drugs are required for
processing these products."
On going through the aforesaid two conditions it would appear that the sale of any
drug to a person not holding the requisite license to sell, stock or exhibit for sale or
distribute the drug is prohibited but then the condition as contained in Clause 3(ii)
and 4(ii) are to be applied in the context those conditions are to be understood with
the object to be achieved. In the present case, the sale of medicine/drug has been
made in favour of M/s Captain Pharma which is a Firm having a valid license. The
medicines are being manufactured by M/s Venus Remedies and Sri Krishna Kumar
being Representative of M/s Venus had produced the copy of the license of M/s
Captain Pharma before the petitioner which the petitioner believed to be true and
sold the medicines to M/s Captain Pharma and handed over the medicine to Sri
Krishna Kumar who was none else but the Representative of the Company. Sri
Krishna Kumar had accepted this position. The Assistant Drug Controller while
considering the stand of the petitioner did not think it just and Patna High Court
CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019 proper to verify these facts from M/s Captain
Pharma in whose name the medicines were sold. M/s Captain Pharma has neither
been called upon nor any stand has been taken on behalf of M/s Captain Pharma
saying that the said Sri Krishna Kumar was not acting bonafidely in the matter of
getting invoices raised in the name of M/s Captain Pharma. In these conditions, no
inquiry has been made by the inspecting team or the Assistant Drug Controller to
know as to how and from where these medicines went sold to the shop of Dr. Ajit
Kumar.
In it's reply to the show cause notice the petitioner had taken a stand that there is no
mechanism to verify the drug license of the customer, this aspect of the matter has
not at all been discussed by the Assistant Drug Controller in his order. The petitioner
has also taken a stand that he had not sold the medicine for any individual benefit
and no fraud was played by selling the medicines to M/s Captain Pharma. The
Assistant Drug Controller has assumed upon himself that the medicines were sold to
an unknown person which is not a correct assumption of fact when it may be easily
concluded from the materials available on the record that Sri Krishna Kumar was not
an unknown person rather he was a Representative of the manufacturing Company.
In the police case, till date, no charge- Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018
dt.17-06-2019 sheet has been filed against the petitioner.
To this court, it appears that the Assistant Drug Controller has passed the impugned
order cancelling the license of the petitioner, in haste without even verifying these
transactions from M/s Captain Pharma and also without taking into consideration
the fact that Sri Krishna Kumar was admittedly a Representative of the
Manufacturing Company who had accepted having taken the medicine on the basis of
the drug license of M/s Captain Pharma in the name of M/s Captain Pharma.

M/S Pharmacity Partner Rajesh Kumar ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 17 June, 2019
Cancellation of license has got a civil consequence and while exercising such drastic
power to cancel the license the Assistant Drug Controller was required to look into all
aspects of the matter and only in case of a categorical finding that the petitioner had
acted in violation of the conditions of license, knowingly and without exercising due
diligence and care, such order could have been passed.
In the opinion of this court, the impugned order as contained in Annexure '5' to the
writ application suffers from non-consideration of the materials available on the
record as also seems to have been passed in haste on half hearted consideration.
Unfortunately, when the petitioner availed his remedy of statutory appeal before the
appellate authority vide Patna High Court CWJC No.17210 of 2018 dt.17-06-2019
Appeal Case No. 08/2018, the appellate authority has not at all considered the
submissions of the petitioner and rejected the appeal. On going through the order
passed by the appellate authority it appears that only a formality has been done
towards disposal of the appeal by simply recording the submissions of the parties and
then in one short paragraph a conclusion has been reached saying that the stand of
the petitioner was found dissastisfactory. None of the grounds of appeal has been
discussed or dealt with.
The order having a civil consequence affecting the petitioner in many ways in life
cannot be allowed to sustain.
In result, the order passed by the Assistant Drug Controller as contained in Memo
No. 56 dated 30.01.2018 (Annexure '5') and the appellate order in Appeal Case No.
08/2018 contained in Annexure '9' to the writ application are hereby quashed.
This writ application stands allowed.
The license of the petitioner is restored forthwith.
