Ram Balak Soni vs State Of U.P. on 9 April, 2025
4. Learned counsel for the first informant states that he has filed his vakalatnama in the office on
behalf of the first informant but the same is not on record.
5. Office is directed to trace out the same and place it on record and make a note in the order sheet
regarding the same.
6. The FIR of the matter was lodged on 12.5.2024 by Prashant Kumar Soni against the applicant,
Avinash Soni, Ashutosh Soni, Dharmraj Soni, Akhilesh Soni, Ashish Soni and Siyaram Soni with the
allegation that an application was given against his father Suresh Soni by Ram Balak Soni at the
police station in which he had taken his father to police chauki Chayal where the accused persons
were also present and assaulted his father inside the chauki after which the police took them and
proceeded for police station Pipari and told them to reach there on which he along with his father
were also going to police station Pipari wherein on the way Akhilesh Soni, Ashish Soni and Siyaram
Soni armed with country-made pistol and iron rod lying in wait for them assaulted them on account
of which they received injuries and his father also received many injuries amongst injury on his head
and became unconscious and fell down. The accused persons considering his father to be dead while
extending threat ran way. He and his father were taken to Government Hospital, Chayal where on
finding the condition of his father to be serious, he was referred to District Hospital, Manjhanpur
from where he was referred to a higher centre.

present case. It is argued that FIR was initially lodged under Section 147, 148, 323, 504, 506, 308
IPC. Subsequently Suresh Kumar Soni died and the matter was converted in the case in which the
present bail application has been filed. In so far as the role of the applicant is concerned, he is not
amongst the three persons i.e. Akhilesh Soni, Ashish Soni and Siyaram Soni who were armed with
country-made pistol and iron rod and lying in wait for them assaulted the informant and the
deceased and ran away. Even the first informant reiterates his version in statement under Section
161 Cr.P.C. but subsequently in his supplementary statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. assigns the
role of conspiracy to the applicant. Initially after lodging of the FIR, the applicant and three other
persons filed a Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.8678 of 2024 (Ram Balak Soni and 3 others Vs.
State of U.P. and 2 others) in which the Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 24.5.2024 had
stayed the arrest of the petitioners therein till filing of police report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C.,
copy of the same is annexed as Annexure No.8 to the affidavit filed in support of bail application, the
said order reads as under:-
"Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, Sri Sobhit Agarwal, Advocate, holding

Pipri, District - Kaushambi, and for a direction to the respondents not to arrest the
petitioner in pursuance of impugned First Information Report.
The allegation of committing offence of culpable homicide in the first information
report has not been assigned to the petitioners but to the co-accused, Akhilesh Soni,
Ashish Soni and Siya Ram.
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that it is case of false implication of the
petitioners.

Soni, Dharmraj Soni, Ashish Soni and Siyaram Soni, are stated to have assaulted the
informant and his father on 11.05.2024 at some unknown time. The father of the
informant is stated to have succumbed to the injuries at hospital.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:
5. The applicant is not named in the FIR and his name has come up in the statement
of the informant recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. It was the informant himself who
had nominated seven accused persons and leaving out the name of the applicant
speaks volume of the fact that he has been subsequently falsely implicated in the case.
6. The FIR is delayed by about one day as no time of offence is mentioned in it, but
the FIR has been instituted the next date at 12:15 p.m.
7. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to
demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances
which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been
touched upon at length.
8. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail
since 01.08.2024 and is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is
released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF STATE/INFORMANT:
9. The bail application has been opposed but the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the
applicant could not be disputed.
CONCLUSION:
10. The well-known principle of "Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty," gives rise to the
concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.
11. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be
taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is
established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life
or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the
procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme
Court in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690.
12. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of
Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that
bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147577873/ 4
Ram Balak Soni vs State Of U.P. on 9 April, 2025
should recognize the principle that "bail is a rule and jail is an exception".

warrant denial of bail to the applicant.
14. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the
trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or
thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or
intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned State Law Officer.
15. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for
the parties, the evidence on record, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case,

allowed.

released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions.

fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement
under Section 313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant
is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to
treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance
with law.
17. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.
Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned
before the bonds are accepted.
18. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way
affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the
witnesses."

Bench of this Court vide order dated 24.1.2025 in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.2702 of 2025,

Ram Balak Soni vs State Of U.P. on 9 April, 2025
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF STATE/OPPOSITE PARTY:
12. The bail application has been opposed on the ground that the informant and his
father both were injured and had sustained grievous injuries. The condition of the
father of the informant was serious and they both were admitted at hospital, as such,
delay in instituting the FIR was but natural.
13. The applicant had assaulted the father and son duo at the police chauki, as such,
he is not entitled for bail.
CONCLUSION:
14. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and
another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has
avoided detailed examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the
merits of the case as no party should have the impression that his case has been
prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an
exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.
15. The well-known principle of "Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty,"
gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.
16. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian
Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because the person is accused of
committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt.
Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may
be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure
must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the
Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and
Ors., 2022 INSC 690.
17. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia
Vs. Directorate of Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very
well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to
be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that ?bail
is a rule and jail is an exception.
18. Learned State Law Officer could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances
which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.
19. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the
accused at the trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the
applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other
troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like

Ram Balak Soni vs State Of U.P. on 9 April, 2025
have been shown by learned State Law Officer.
20. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by
learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, taking into consideration the
fact that the main accused persons who had assaulted the father and son duo are
Akhilesh Soni, Ashish Soni and Siyaram Soni coupled by the fact that applicant was
not present at the time of said offence as he was already apprehended by the police at
the chauki, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is
of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is
allowed.
21. Let the applicant- Avinash Kuamr Soni involved in aforementioned case crime
number be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in
the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following
conditions.

(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates
fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement
under Section 313 Cr.P.C./351 B.N.S.S. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of
the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the
Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in
accordance with law.
22. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.
Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned
before the bonds are accepted.
23. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way
affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the
witnesses."
10. It is further argued that co-accused Dharamraj Soni has been granted bail by a coordinate Bench
of this Court vide order dated 31.1.2025 in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.2956 of 2025, copy of

11. It is argued that case of the applicant is identical to that of co-accused Avinash Kumar Soni. It is
argued that there is no recovery of any discriminating articles as used in the offence either from the
possession of the applicant or pointing out of the applicant. It has also been pointed out that the
applicant is not having any criminal history as stated in para 29 of the affidavit. The applicant is in
jail since 27.1.2025.
12. Per contra learned counsel for the first informant and learned counsel for the State opposed the
prayer for bail and argued that the applicant was the person who had initially assaulted the first
informant and his father at the police station and subsequently had exhorted the accused persons
and had conspired for the present incident in which while on the way the first informant and his
father were assaulted and his father during treatment died later on, as such the prayer for bail be
rejected.
13. After hearing the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it is evident that in so far as the
incident regarding assault is concerned, the same is stated to be by co-accused Akhilesh Soni, Ashish
Soni and Siyaram Soni as per FIR. The applicant was not involved therein. Co-accused persons have
been granted bail by coordinate Bench of this Court.
14. Looking to the facts and circumstances of this case, the nature of evidence and also the absence
of any convincing material to indicate the possibility of tampering with the evidence, this Court is of
the view that the applicant may be enlarged on bail.
15. Let the applicant-Ram Balak Soni, be released on bail in the aforesaid case crime number on
furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court
concerned with the following conditions which are being imposed in the interest of justice:-
i) The applicant will not tamper with prosecution evidence and will not harm or
harass the victim/complainant in any manner whatsoever.
ii) The applicant will abide the orders of court, will attend the court on every date and
will not delay the disposal of trial in any manner whatsoever.
(iii) The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any
adjournment on the date fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in court.
In case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as
abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law.
(iv) The applicant will not misuse the liberty of bail in any manner whatsoever. In
case, the applicant misuses the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his
presence proclamation under section 82 Cr.P.C., may be issued and if applicant fails

Ram Balak Soni vs State Of U.P. on 9 April, 2025
to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court
shall initiate proceedings against him, in accordance with law, under section 174-A
I.P.C.
(v) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on dates fixed
for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement

with law and the trial court may proceed against him under Section 229-A IPC.
