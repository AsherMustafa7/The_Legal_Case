ORDER
In the captioned main writ petition an assessment order dated 22.12.2019 being an assessment
order made under Section 143(3) of the 'Income Tax Act 1961' ('IT Act' for the sake of brevity) has
been assailed and the same shall hereinafter be referred to as 'impugned order' for the sake of
convenience and clarity.
2. Learned counsel for writ petitioner submits that the writ petitioner is a vegetable vendor, he
collects cash from wholesale market and deposits the same in the bank account. Be that as it may,
owing to the narrow compass on which captioned matter turns short facts will suffice to appreciate
this order and those short facts are that a notice dated 21.09.2018 under Section 143(2) of the IT Act
was issued followed by a notice under Section 142(1) dated 28.10.2019. The petitioner responded
vide a reply dated 02.11.2019. To be noted, this reply was sent after a reminder was sent to the writ
petitioner. Thereafter, a show cause notice was issued to the writ petitioner on 29.11.2019 and in
response to the show cause notice, writ petitioner produced various documents such as balance
sheet, P&L Account https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis for financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17, trial
balance, details of bank accounts, details of cash deposited month-wise, sales ledger account,
purchase ledger account, cash book etc., To be noted, impugned order pertains to the 'Assessment
Year 2017-18' (hereinafter 'said AY' for the sake of convenience and clarity).
3. After verifying all the aforementioned documents and after considering the response of the writ
petitioner, the impugned order came to be made. To be noted, writ petitioner assessee had
explained that he deals mainly with wholesale vegetable sale in cash but vide the impugned order it
is seen that the respondent noticed that the assessee has deposited cash in regular intervals and
there has been a sudden spurt. After analysis of all these material, the respondent made the
impugned order. The assessee pointed out that the cash deposits were transferred to the suppliers
by way of any NEFT on the same day but this has been overlooked is learned petitioner counsel's
say. All these turn heavily on facts.
4. Assailing the aforementioned impugned order, writ petitioner has come to this Court.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
5. Learned counsel for writ petitioner very fairly submits that the writ petitioner does have an appeal
remedy under Sections 246/246(A) of the IT Act and the writ petitioner could not avail of the same
owing to COVID-19 situation.
6. Mr.N.Dilipkumar, learned Senior Standing Counsel for Income Tax Department accepted notice
on behalf of respondent and owing to the narrow compass on which the captioned writ petition
turns (as already alluded to supra), main writ petition was taken up with the consent of both sides.

Arunachalam Nadar Muthuraj vs The Income Tax Officer on 25 November, 2021
7. As already delineated supra, the matter turns heavily on facts. Learned Revenue Counsel
highlighted that an appeal remedy is available and no convincing reason has been given for not
availing the appeal remedy. Learned Revenue Counsel also pointed out that there is a provision for
condonation of delay qua appeal remedy which is under Chapter XX of IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
8. I therefore consider the alternate remedy rule. Alternate remedy rule no doubt is not an absolute
rule. In other words, it is a rule of discretion. To put it with greater clarity and specificity, it is not
only a rule of discretion it is a self imposed restraint qua writ jurisdiction. On the teeth of this
jurisprudential principle Hon'ble Supreme Court starting from Dunlop India case [Assistant
Collector of Central Excise, Chandan Nagar, West Bengal Vs. Dunlop India Ltd., and others reported
in (1985) 1 SCC 260] in a long line of case laws has repeatedly held that the alternate remedy rule
has to be very strictly enforced with utmost rigour when it comes to fiscal Statutes. The other
authorities are Satyawati Tandon [United Bank of India Vs. Satyawati Tondon and others reported
in (2010) 8 SCC 110] and K.C.Mathew [Authorized Officer, State Bank of Travancore and another
Vs. Mathew K.C. reported in (2018) 3 SCC 85]. Relevant paragraph in Dunlop case law is paragraph
No.3 and relevant portion of the same reads as follows:
'3. ....... Article 226 is not meant to short-circuit or circumvent statutory procedures.
It is only where statutory remedies are entirely ill-suited to meet the demands of
extraordinary situations, as for instance where the very vires of the statute is in
question or where private or public wrongs are so https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
inextricably mixed up and the prevention of public injury and the vindication of
public justice require it that recourse may be had to Article 226 of the Constitution.
But then the Court must have good and sufficient reason to bypass the alternative
remedy provided by statute. Surely matters involving the revenue where statutory
remedies are available are not such matters. We can also take judicial notice of the
fact that the vast majority of the petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution are
filed solely for the purpose of obtaining interim orders and thereafter prolong the
proceedings by one device or the other. The practice certainly needs to be strongly
discouraged.' (Underlining made by this Court to supply emphasis and highlight)
9. Satyawati Tandon principle was reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in K.C.Mathew case.
Relevant paragraph in K.C.Mathew case law is paragraph 10 and the same reads as follows:
'10. In Satyawati Tondon the High Court had restrained further proceedings under
Section 13(4) of the Act. Upon a detailed consideration of the statutory scheme under
the SARFAESI Act, the availability of remedy to the aggrieved under Section 17
before the Tribunal and the appellate remedy under Section 18 before the Appellate
Tribunal, the object and purpose of the legislation, it was observed that a writ
petition ought not to be entertained in view of the alternate statutory remedy
available holding: (SCC pp.123 & https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 128, Paras 43 &
55) “43. Unfortunately, the High Court overlooked the settled law that the High Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136131220/ 3
Arunachalam Nadar Muthuraj vs The Income Tax Officer on 25 November, 2021
will ordinarily not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution if an
effective remedy is available to the aggrieved person and that this Rule applies with
greater rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes, cess, fees, other types of public
money and the dues of banks and other financial institutions. In our view, while
dealing with the petitions involving challenge to the action taken for recovery of the
public dues, etc., the High Court must keep in mind that the legislations enacted by
Parliament and State Legislatures for recovery of such dues are a code unto
themselves inasmuch as they not only contain comprehensive procedure for recovery
of the dues but also envisage constitution of quasi-judicial bodies for redressal of the
grievance of any aggrieved person. Therefore, in all such cases, the High Court must
insist that before availing remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution, a person
must exhaust the remedies available under the relevant statute.
55.It is a matter of serious concern that despite repeated pronouncement of this
Court, the High Courts continue to ignore the availability of statutory remedies under
the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act and exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 for
passing orders which have serious adverse impact on the right of banks and other
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis financial institutions to recover their dues. We
hope and trust that in future the High Courts will exercise their discretion in such
matters with greater caution, care and circumspection.' (underlining made by this
Court to supply emphasis and highlight)
10. One other case law of significance is a recent judgment of a three member Bench of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Commercial Steel Limited case [Civil Appeal No 5121 of 2021, The Assistant
Commissioner of State Tax and Others Vs. M/s Commercial Steel Limited]. A three member Bench
of the Honble Supreme Court speaking through Hon'ble Justice Dr.Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, set
out the exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy and made it clear that only in exceptional cases
(where the exceptions are attracted), there would be interference in writ jurisdiction. Relevant
paragraphs in Commercial Steel Limited case law are paragraph Nos.11 and 12, which read as
follows:
'11 The respondent had a statutory remedy under section
107. Instead of availing of the remedy, the respondent instituted a petition under
Article 226. The existence of an alternate remedy is not an absolute bar to the
maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. But a writ
petition can be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis entertained in exceptional
circumstances where there is: (i) a breach of fundamental rights; (ii) a violation of the
principles of natural justice; (iii) an excess of jurisdiction; or (iv) a challenge to the
vires of the statute or delegated legislation.
12 In the present case, none of the above exceptions was established. There was, in
fact, no violation of the principles of natural justice since a notice was served on the
person in charge of the conveyance. In this backdrop, it was CA 5121/2021 7 not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136131220/ 4
Arunachalam Nadar Muthuraj vs The Income Tax Officer on 25 November, 2021
appropriate for the High Court to entertain a writ petition. The assessment of facts
would have to be carried out by the appellate authority. As a matter of fact, the High
Court has while doing this exercise proceeded on the basis of surmises. However,
since we are inclined to relegate the respondent to the pursuit of the alternate
statutory remedy under Section 107, this Court makes no observation on the merits
of the case of the respondent.'
11. A careful perusal of the aforementioned exceptions read in juxtaposition with narrative qua case
on hand supra make it clear that none of the exceptions are attracted in the instant case and if at all
and if that be so, on extreme demurer, a point which comes close to one of the exceptions is ground
(b) in the writ affidavit which says that the impugned order has been passed without considering the
reply of the writ petitioner. A bare perusal of the impugned order leaves me with the impression that
this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ground falls flat on its face as the impugned order has
extensively dealt with the reply of the writ petitioner. This is articulated in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the
impugned order which read as follows:
'2.Notice u/s 143(2) under IT Act 1961 was issued on 21.09.2018 and delivered
through e-mail as well as hard copy through post was served on 28.09.2018. Notice
u/s 142(1) of the IT Act, 1961, requesting details was issued on 09.10.2019 and served
on 10.10.2019. Since there was no response, reminder was sent on 28.10.2019. In
response, the assessee has filed through ITBA on 02.11.2019 with remarks that the
assesse is a vegetable vendor and he collects cash from wholesale market and
deposits in bank account. Further the assessee has not furnished any other details as
requested in the 142(1) notice.
3. Meanwhile, copies of bank accounts pertaining to assessee was requested u/s
133(6) of the IT Act 1961 and obtained. It is seen from the Bank accounts, the
assessee has deposited Rs.28,65,000/- in south Indian Bank A/c.No.
0625073000000060 and Rs.2,00,000/- in Tamil Nadu Mercantile bank A/c.
no.093100050128844.
4. Since there was no further response from the assessee show cause notice was
issued on 29.11.2019. In response the assessee has furnished the following details:
1.Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Account for the FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17
2.Trail balance for the FY 2015-16 and 2016-17 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
3.Details of Bank accounts
4.Details of cash deposited month-wise
5.Sales Ledger Account
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136131220/ 5
Arunachalam Nadar Muthuraj vs The Income Tax Officer on 25 November, 2021
6.Purchase Ledger Account
7.Cash Book
5.The above details are verified. The assessee explained that the cash deposit during
demonetization period is out of cash in hand as on 08.11.2016. The details are
verified.
Further the assessee explained that he deals with mainly wholesale vegetablses sales in cash. Also it
is seen from the Bank accounts that the assessee deposits cash in regular intervals and the same day
transfers the amount through NEFT to suppliers.'
12. In the light of the aforementioned contents of the impugned order, I have no hesitation in
coming to the conclusion that none of the exceptions warranting interference in writ jurisdiction in
assessment order under IT Act i.e., impugned order has been made out.
13. The sequitur to the discussion and dispositive reasoning thus far is the campaign of the writ
petitioner against the impugned order in the captioned main writ petition fails. It is well open to the
writ petitioner to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis avail alternate remedy inter alia under Section
246 / 246A of IT Act. It is also open to the writ petitioner to seek 'condonation of delay' [COD] and if
the writ petitioner chooses to take this legal route, the COD prayer of the writ petitioner (if made)
will be considered on its own merits and in accordance with law by the appellate authority
concerned depending on the provision that is invoked.
14. Ergo, captioned writ petition is dismissed making the aforementioned observations regarding
the writ petitioner taking the alternate remedy route and COD therein. Though obvious, it is made
clear that this Court has not expressed any view or opinion on the merits of the matter as it would be
for the appellate authority to consider the same uninfluenced and untrammelled by any views that
may have the trappings of expression of opinion on merits contained in this order. If the writ
petitioner chooses to avail alternate remedy. Consequently, connected captioned writ miscellaneous
petition is also dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
