detention of the petitioner was made out thereby leading to issuance of order No. 54/DMP/PSA/23
dated 15th of December, 2023 in terms whereof the preventive detention of the petitioner was
ordered to take place to be detained and confined in the Central Jail Kot Bhalwal, Jammu in order to

17. In his writ petition, the petitioner has assailed his preventive detention on the grounds as set out
in paragraph No. 7 (a) to (l), besides referring to the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India as also of this Court to assert that the petitioner's preventive detention is against the spirit of
the law as settled in the said cases.
18. In this regard, the petitioner has made reference to the following judgments:
i. Thahira Haris Etc. Etc. v. Government of Karnataka, (AIR 2009 SC 2184); ii.
Dhannajoy Dass v. District Magistrate, (AIR 1982 SC 1315);
iii. Sofia Gulam Mohd. Bham v. State of Maharashtra & Ors., (AIR 1999 SC 3051);
iv. Syed Aasiya Indrabi v. State of J&K and Ors., [2009 (1) SLJ 2019];
v. Abdul Latief Wahab Sheikh v. B. K. Jha, [1987 (2) SCC 22];
vi. Mohammad Rafiq Mir v. UT of J&K and Anr., [WP (Crl) No. 107/2020];
vii. Sajad Ahmad Bhat v. UT of J&K, [WP (Crl) 127/2022]; and viii. Riyaz Ahmad Mir v. UT of J&K
and Ors., [WP (Crl) No. 228/2021].
19. The petitioner, in his writ petition, has alleged that the allegations levelled against him in the
dossier as well as in the grounds of detention are false and that he has been implicated by the Police
on the basis of malafide and ill-will. The petitioner has further alleged that he was not given the
entire record accompanying the detention order, so much so that original copies of detention order
and grounds of detention were not supplied to him. The petitioner has alleged that he is Kashmiri
speaking and understanding person and was clueless about the basis and manner of his detention. It
is also alleged by the petitioner in the writ petition that the preventive detention was slapped upon
him in order to overreach the bail order granted by the trial court in his favour in a pending criminal
case related to FIR No. 58/2019.
20. Counter affidavit to the present writ petition from the end of the respondents came to be filed on
23rd of July, 2024.

the petitioner by stating that all procedural compliances were carried out. The respondents, in their
counter affidavit, refer to judgments in support of their case:
i. Haradhan Saha v. State of West Bengal, [(1975) 3 SCC 198];
ii. Secretary to Government, Public (Law and Order) and Anr. v. Nabila & Anr.,

Ubaid Bashir Wani vs Union Territory Of J&K And Ors on 2 June, 2025
22. Upon going through the pleadings of the parties, the documents therewith and the detention
record produced, this Court is hastened to an irresistible finding of flaw and fault attending the
preventive detention of the petitioner thereby exposing the casual and clerical quality of application
of mind on the part of the respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Pulwama of the time.
23. The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Awantipora, in his dossier, solicited slapping of
Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978 against the petitioner in the interests of security and
sovereignty of the Country.
24. The respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Pulwama, in his detention order, came to observe that
in order to prevent the petitioner "from acting in a manner prejudicial to the Union Territory of
Jammu & Kashmir," it is necessary to detain the petitioner under the provisions of the Jammu &
Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978.
25. The respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Pulwama, thus, omitted and missed out to mention as
to whether the petitioner was to be restrained/ prevented from acting in a manner prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order or to the security of the UT of J&K.
26. This omission is ex-facie self-speaking in the very text of order No. 54/DMP/PSA/23 dated 15th
of December, 2023. It is on the basis of this detention order that the petitioner came to be detained
by the detention warrant executing officer ASI-Fayaz Ahmad on 19th of December, 2023 and it is
this very order which was read to the petitioner and is to be believed that the same was explained to
the petitioner in the language understood by him. If the detention order No. 54/DMP/PSA/23 dated
15th of December, 2023 was so read to the petitioner, then the question which comes rushing to
confront the respondent No.2- District Magistrate, Pulwama is that what was petitioner made to
understand that he was being detained from acting in a manner prejudicial to what; maintenance of
public order or security of the UT of J&K.
27. There is found nothing on the detention record file produced from the end of the respondents to
show that upon being detained and handed over with the detention order along with the grounds of
detention and dossier any subsequent order/ document was ever handed over to the petitioner to
make him understand that what for he was being detained so as to prevent him from acting in a
manner prejudicial otherwise to an un-stated end situation.
28. The farce attending at the end of the respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Pulwama is exposed
from the fact that in issuing the Corrigendum No. DMP/PSA/23/206-10 dated 19th of December,
2023, copy of which was never handed over or provided to the petitioner, the respondent No.2-
District Magistrate, Pulwama was purportedly dealing with two cases simultaneously; one related to
the detention of the petitioner and the other related to the detention of one Sajad Ahmad Bhat. If
left to respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Pulwama's understanding, then in the detention order
of the petitioner as well as of said Sajad Ahmad Bhat expression "prejudicial to the security of the
State"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125871489/ 5
Ubaid Bashir Wani vs Union Territory Of J&K And Ors on 2 June, 2025
was already written which was to be replaced by expression "prejudicial to the
security of the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir."
29. Nothing is farther from the truth than the Corrigendum of the respondent No.2-District
Magistrate, Pulwama in assuming that the detention order No. 54/DMP/PSA/23 dated 15th of
December, 2023 related to the petitioner was bearing the expression "prejudicial to the security of
the State"
which is not correct at all at first instance.
30. Even if the said Corrigendum is taken to have made a course correction to the preventive
detention order against the petitioner, the very fact that a copy thereof was not handed over to the
petitioner is exposed from the fact that the receipt taken from the petitioner by ASI-Fayaz Ahmad on
19th of December, 2023 is not referring to any such Corrigendum having been handed over to the
petitioner. So much so, not even the Superintendent of Central Jail Kot Bhalwal, Jammu has
furnished any document to show that later on petitioner came to be handed over with the copy of
the corrigendum against a receipt meaning thereby that the petitioner was never ever apprised as to
for what he was being detained to refrain from acting in a manner prejudicial to an undefined and
unmentioned pretext.
31. It is a very sorry state of affairs also with respect to the working of the Advisory Board in
examining a file of preventive detention of a detenue that it did not apply its own independent mind
to such a patent anomaly attending the preventive detention of the petitioner to the extent that the
petitioner was rendered clueless as to on which pretext he had come to be detained.
32. It is an indispensable part of the Advisory Board to examine the detention record of a detenue
under the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978 in a very searching and thorough manner and
not as a matter of going through the motion, as has been done in the present case by the Advisory
Board. The Advisory Board is meant to scan a preventive detention case with respect to a detenue
with an independent mind and thorough interest and is not expected to act as if just there to second
the exercise done by the District Magistrate or the Government in subjecting a detenue to preventive
detention under the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978.
33. The respondents cannot be heard to say that the petitioner came to be apprised later with the
fact that his preventive detention was aimed to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to
the security of the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir. This Court says so for the reason that there
is nothing on record of the detention file produced from the end of the respondents to show that the
Government Order approving the preventive detention of the petitioner as well as the Government
Order confirming the preventive detention order of the petitioner passed by respondent
No.2-District Magistrate, Pulwama were ever furnished to the petitioner while he was in state of
detainment in the Central Jail Kot Bhalwal, Jammu. So much so, the petitioner was not even
provided with copy of Government Order No. Home/PB-V/1713 of 2024 dated 2nd of September,
2024 whereby the petitioner came to be shifted from Central Jail Kot Bhalwal, Jammu to Central
Jail, Agra.

34. The cumulative effect of all the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case render the very
preventive detention of the petitioner illegal right from its very inception and, therefore, cannot
sustain to run its full effect against the petitioner. The preventive detention of the petitioner in the
present case is, thus, seriously vitiated and is held to be illegal.
35. Resultantly, the preventive detention order No. 54/DMP/PSA/23 dated 15th of December, 2023
passed by respondent No.2-District Magistrate, Pulwama read with consequent approval/
confirmation/extension order(s) passed by the Home Department, Government of Union Territory
of Jammu & Kashmir with respect to the petitioner are
36. The petitioner is directed to be restored, without loss of any further time, to his personal liberty
by his immediate release from the concerned Jail and to that effect the Superintendent of the
concerned Jail detaining the petitioner to act in compliance of the directions hereby being issued
with respect to the release of the petitioner from preventive detention custody.
37. Disposed of.
38. Record be returned.
