THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS ON 17.4.2023 THIS DAY, THE COURT
MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
This writ petition filed by the petitioner under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India
praying for issue a writ, in the nature of certiorari or any other appropriate writ or order or
direction, quashing the Government Order bearing No.E-HD/40/COD/2019 dated 25.09.2019
issued by the 2nd respondent by according sanction for prosecution to the 3rd respondent-CBI to
investigate the alleged offences committed by the petitioner under the provision of Prevention of
Corruption Act (herein after referred as to 'PC Act').
2. Heard Sri. Udaya Holla, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, learned SPP-II
appearing for respondent Nos.1 and 2 and Sri P. Prasanna Kumar, learned Special Counsel
appearing for respondent No.3.
3. The case of the petitioner is that he is the sitting MLA and the President of the Karnataka Pradesh
Congress Party and he is said to be doing various business including mining and real estate
development. There was raid conducted by the income tax department officials on 02.08.2017 on
the various premises of the petitioner in New Delhi and other places and they collected
Rs.8,59,69,100/-. It is alleged that Rs.41.00 lakhs was recovered form the premises of the petitioner.
Subsequently, the income tax department officials registered a case by filing a complaint against the
petitioner before the Special Court for Economic Offences under the provisions of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. Based upon registering the income tax case, the Directorate of Enforcement (hereinafter
referred to as 'ED') also registered a case in No.ECIR/04/HQ/2018 and subsequently, the petitioner
was arrested on 03.09.2019. Thereafter, the office of the Special Director of ED issued a letter dated
09.09.2019 to the State Government by acting under Section 66(2) of Prevention of Money
Laundering Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'PML Act'). The letter has been sent to the Chief
Secretary of Government of Karnataka and the Government of Karnataka accorded sanction against
the petitioner referring the matter to the CBI for investigating the case for offences punishable
under the provisions of PC Act, 2018 vide its order dated 25.09.2019, which is under challenge.

4. The learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner has contended that the State Government
while passing the impugned order, referring investigation to CBI, has not applied its mind. While
passing the said order, the State Government has simply narrated the contents of the letter issued by
the ED and referred the case to the CBI and in turn, the CBI registered an FIR against the petitioner,
which is not sustainable under law. Previously, one Shashi Kumar Shivanna filed a writ petition
challenging the reference order in W.P. No.8316/2020, which came to be dismissed by the
Co-ordinate Bench, on 22.07.2020, on the ground the said person has no locus standi and he was
not an accused in the offence. Therefore, it is contended that the petitioner, being an accused, has
right to challenge the very same order and, therefore, the question of res-judicata does not apply as
the dispute is between some other persons and not between the petitioner and the respondent.
5. The learned Senor Counsel has also contended that out of five cases registered against the
petitioner by the income tax department officials, the petitioner was discharged in three cases and
the same was upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In one case, the discharge application came to
be dismissed, which is stayed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This fact has not been considered by
the State Government while according sanction. It is also contended that even if it is an
administrative order. The State is required to apply its mind while granting any sanction. Except
culling out the letter of the ED, there is no application of mind while referring the matter to the CBI.
Therefore, the order under challenge, dated 25.09.2019, is not sustainable under law. Hence, prayed
for quashing the same.
6. In support of his arguments, the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner, has relied upon the
various judgments, which are as follows:

Sri D K Shivakumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 April, 2023
7. Per contra, learned SPP-II Mr. Hegde appearing for respondent No.1 has vehemently objected the
petition mainly on two grounds, firstly, that the order passed by the State Government under
Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (hereinafter referred to as 'DSPE Act') does
not require an order of sanction and it is only a consent given to the CBI to investigate into the
matter. Therefore, it is contended that the order is a simple executive order and it does not require a
detailed reason for according consent.
The second ground on which the learned SPP-II for respondent State, urged that, the Co-ordinate
Bench of this Court has already considered the reference order dated 25.09.2019 which was
challenged by one Shashi Kumar Shivanna in the writ petition referred supra. The Co-ordinate
Bench in the aforesaid writ petition has dealt with the matter in detail and passed an order by
rejecting the writ petition filed by the said Shashi Kumar Shivanna. Subsequently, the said person
filed a writ appeal before the Division Bench, where the writ appeal was also dismissed and the same
was not challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and it has attained the finality. The judgment
passed by the Co-ordinate Bench by upheld the order passed by the State Government and not
against any person. Therefore, the judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench is 'Judgment In Rem' and it is
binding on all the persons. Therefore, it cannot be questioned since the principles of res judicata
applies.
8. The learned SPP-II has also contended that even if any error occurs while passing the order of
sanction or consent, that cannot be a ground for setting aside the order since there is no prejudice
would cause to the petitioner's case and that can be cured under Section 465 of Cr.P.C. It is further
contended that unless, it is established that there is failure of justice, the same Cannot be
questioned.
9. The learned SPP-II has further contended that provisions of Section 6 of the DSPE Act says about
two consents, one is general consent and the other is special consent, and it is specifically expressed
therein that the case should be referred to the CBI. Though it is mentioned in the order as sanction,
but it is only a consent under Section 6 of DSPE Act. Therefore, the learned SPP-II prayed for
dismissing the petition.
10. In support of his contentions, the learned SPP-II for the respondent State has relied upon the
various judgments:
1. SRI SHASHIKUMAR SHIVANNA VS.
GOVERNMENT OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS
- W.P.NO.8316/2020;
2. SRI SHASHIKUMAR SHIVANNA VS.

9. PRADEEP S. WODEYAR VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA - 2021 SCC ONLINE SC 1140.
11. Learned Counsel appearing for respondent No.3 has also objected the petition contending that
for the purpose of referring the case for investigation under section 6 of DSPE Act does not require
any application of mind and the Coordinate Bench has already dismissed the petition filed by one of
the accused which was upheld by the Division Bench of he High Court and therefore, there is no
reason to distinguish the said order. The petitioner has no locus standi to question as to who should
be his investigating agency, he can only challenge the FIR, but not the notification for referring the
case for investigation. The learned counsel for respondent No.3 further contended that 90% of
investigation has already been completed, lot of materials have been collected against the petitioner.
Therefore, at this stage, this Court cannot quash the notification.
12. In support of his case, the learned counsel for respondent No.3 - CBI has relied upon the various
judgments, which are as under:
1. DELHI SPECIAL POLICE ESTABLISHMENT ACT, 1946 (ACT NO.25 OF
1946)(BARE ACT);
2. KANWAL TANUJ V. STATE OF BIHAR - (2020) 20 SCC 531;

SCC 335.
13. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, by way of reply, has contended that the very order
passed by the State itself shows that it is an order of sanction, but not the consent. The sanction and
consent are synonymous as per Section 470(3) of Cr.P.C. The reasons is the soul of any order either
administrative order or other orders. Therefore, without application of mind and without
mentioning the reasons, sanction has been accorded, which is not a speaking order and therefore it
is not sustainable under law. It is further contended that the State has obtained opinion of the
learned Advocate General and, learned Advocate General has not stated anything about the consent
and even the State has not obtained any consent of the Speaker while granting permission. Hence,
prayed for allowing the petition. It is further contended that the res-judicata does not attract as this
petitioner was not a party in the earlier case. Hence it is contended that the order of the co-ordinate
bench is 'Judgment In Personem' and not binding on the petitioner. Therefore, it is contended that
the petitioner is opposite leader and FIR has been registered based upon the impugned order.
Therefore, great prejudice would cause to the petitioner. Hence, prayed for allowing the petition.
14. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, perused the records which
reveals it is an admitted fact that the petitioner is sitting MLA and the opposite political party
leader. There was raid conducted by the income tax authorities and they seized cash from the house
of the petitioner and other places. It is also an admitted fact that the IT department filed five cases
before the Special Court, out of which three cases were ended in discharge and other cases are
pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is also an admitted fact that the ED written letter the
Chief Secretary to the Government of Karnataka by invoking Section 66(2) of PML Act and the
Under Secretary to the Government, Home Department (Crimes), issued the impugned order on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125359841/ 7
Sri D K Shivakumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 April, 2023
25.09.2019, according sanction to CBI for investigation by invoking power under Section 6 of DSPE
Act. It is also an admitted fact that one Shashi Kumar Shivanna filed Writ Petition No.8316/2020
challenging the very impugned order dated 25.09.2019, which came to be dismissed on 22.07.2020.
It is also an admitted fact that the said Shashi Kumar Shivanna filed an appeal before the Division
Bench in W.A. No.444/2020, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench dismissed the appeal on
05.02.2021 by granting liberty to approach the appropriate Forum, in case the petitioner is named
as an accused in FIR. It is also an admitted fact that after passing of the impugned order by the State
Government, the CBI registered an FIR against the petitioner in No.ECIR/04/HQ/2018 which is
already challenged before this Court and it is pending for consideration.
15. With these admitted facts, now the contention taken by the respondents, in this case, is mainly
on the ground that the Co-ordinate Bench has already dismissed the writ petition referred supra,
which was filed challenging the very impugned order and the said order passed in the writ petition
was upheld by the Division Bench. Therefore, the judgment has attained finality and the present
petition is not maintainable on the ground of principles of res- judicata. This is contended by
respondent's counsel that the judgment passed by the Co-ordinate Bench in the aforesaid writ
petition is Judgment In Rem binding on all the persons. It is also contended that the order passed
by the State Government under Section 6 of DSPE Act is only a consent but not sanction, whereas
the petitioner disputed the same on the ground that the said order is sanction, which required
application of mind, and no principles of res judicata applies in this case.
16. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records, the
points that arise for consideration are:
(i) Whether the impugned order passed by the State dated 25.09.2019 under Section
6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 was sanction or a consent ?
(ii) Whether the order passed by the Co-
ordinate Bench in W.P.No.8316/2020(S-RES) applies the principles of res judicata ?"
17. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court while arguing the matter that the order under challenge was a sanction order
without application of mind. The learned counsel relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Mansukhlal Vithaldas Chauhan vs. State of Gujarat reported in (1997) 7 SCC
622, where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held at paragraph No.19 that the sanctioning authority
was unable to apply its independent mind for any reasons or what so ever or pass an obligation or
compulsion or constraint to grant sanction, the order will be bad for the reason that the discretion of
the authority not to sanction was taken away and it was compelled to act mechanically to sanction
the prosecution. The another judgment in the case of M.P.Special Police Establishment vs. State of
M.P. and Others reported in (2004) 8 SCC 788, it has held though the power to grant sanction is
administrative power, the same will stand vitiated if there is manifest error or excise of power are
arbitratory or non application of mind. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has also held in the case of
Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax Department, Works Contract and Leasing, Kota vs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125359841/ 8
Sri D K Shivakumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 April, 2023
Shukla and Brothers reported in (2010) 4 SCC 785, even in the administrative order, the authorities
shall record reasons by speaking order. The same view was taken in the case of Kranti Associates
Private Limited and Another vs. Masood Ahmed Khan and Others reported in (2010) 9 SCC 496. On
perusal of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is well settled that while granting sanction,
the authority should apply its mind by giving reason and a speaking order is a must and non
application of mind without looking to the document if any sanction is accorded that will not be
sustainable under the law. Even for an administrative order, a speaking order or reason is required.
18. On the other hand, the learned SPP-II has contended that the impugned order of the State was
only a simple executive order for giving consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act. In support of his
contention, he has relied upon the judgment of the Madras High Court in the case of Dr.C.Indernath
and Others vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Others reported in (2022) 2 WritLR 614, where the Madras
High Court while dealing with the similar situation where the matter was referred to the CBI for
investigation was held at paragraph No.49 of the judgment as under:
"49. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Fertico Marketing and Investment
Private Limited and others vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and another [2021 (2)
SCC 525], held that though the Central Government to extend the powers and
jurisdiction of Members of the DSPE beyond the Union Territories to a State, the
same is not permissible unless a State grants its consent for such an extension within
the area of the State concerned under Section 6 of DSPE Act. Obviously, the
provisions are in tune with the federal character of the Constitution, which has been
held to be one of the basic structures of the Constitution. As could be seen from
Article 226 of the Constitution of India, Schedule VII, List II - State List (1) public
order and (2) police are listed, which are within the powers of the State. In this case,
admittedly, the first respondent or the sixth respondent have no objection for
conducting investigation by the CBI. The petitioners are named accused in RC
0322020A0023, have no say who should investigate the offences against them. The
decision to investigate or the decision on the agency does not violate principles of
natural justice. Nor is there any provision in law under which, while granting consent
or extending the powers or jurisdiction of the Delhi Special Police Establishment to
the specified State and to any specified case any reasons are required to be recorded
on the face of the notification. It is only a consent. It is seen that, in this case, if at all
there is any objection with regard to conduct of investigation, the same has to be
raised by the State Government of Tamil Nadu and not the petitioners."
19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M.Balakrishna Reddy vs. Director, CBI, New Delhi
reported in (2008) 4 SCC 409 at head note A, paragraph Nos.44 and 71 has held as under:
"Head Note A: Police - CBI - Exercise of powers and jurisdiction by CBI in a State -
Consent of State Government under S. 6, Delhi Special Police Establishment Act,
1946 (Central Act 25 of 1946) - Manner of giving - Particular form, if any - Such
consent, held, need not be given in any particular form - Whether the consent was or
was not given, depends on the facts of each case and no rule of universal application
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125359841/ 9
Sri D K Shivakumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 April, 2023
can be laid down in that regard - Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946
(Central Act 25 of 1946) - Ss. 6, 5 and 3 - Public Accountability and Vigilance -
Vigilance authorities - CBI"
"44. Though the Court was not directly deciding the question whether a letter could
be treated as valid consent, but whether separate consent was required for every
individual member of the Delhi Police Establishment or general consent was enough.
The Court nonetheless held the consent valid as general consent was all that was
required by law. Though it did not remark on the form in which such consent should
be given i.e. the letter, was correct or not, the fact that it could find nothing wrong
with the consent raises a strong presumption in favour of the argument that a letter
can be a means of granting consent by the State Government under Section 6."
"71. A closer scrutiny of the relevant provisions of the Delhi Act also add credence to
the view which we are inclined to take. Section 3 refers to "notification" and requires
the Central Government to issue notification specifying offences or class of offences
to be investigated by Special Police Establishment. Section 5 uses the term "order"
and enables the Central Government to extend powers and jurisdiction of Special
Police Establishment to other areas not covered by the Act. Section 6 which speaks of
consent of the State Government for the exercise of powers and jurisdiction of the
Special Establishment neither refers to "notification" nor "order". It merely requires
consent of the State Government for the application of the Delhi Act. Parliament, in
our considered opinion, advisedly and deliberately did not specify the mode, method
or manner for granting consent though in two preceding sections such mode was
provided. If it intended that such consent should be in a particular form, it would
certainly have provided the form as it was aware of different forms of exercise of
power. It, therefore, depends on the facts of each case whether the consent required
by Section 6 of the Delhi Act has or has not been given by the State Government and
no rule of universal application can be laid down."
20. The learned SPP - II has also relied upon the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Sri.Basavaraj Shivappa Muttagi vs. State of Karnataka, through Additional Chief Secretary,
Home Department reported in 2021 0 Supreme(Kar) 387 and has held at paragraph No.29 of the
judgment which is as under:
"129. The parameters for exercise of both the distinct powers of Government and
Courts are naturally different and it is always possible and permissible, that even
after the constitutional court declines to exercise its extraordinary judicial power
holding that the case does not involve circumstances which are rare or exceptional,
the State Government can exercise its ordinary executive powers under section 6 of
the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 in granting consent and the Central
Government can, thereafter exercise its power by accepting the investigation
entrusted to it by the State Government. The said process is uninhibited by the high
prerogative judicial powers of entrustment of inquiry to CBI. The same is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125359841/ 10
Sri D K Shivakumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 April, 2023
independent and does not have any fetters with regard to whether extraordinary
judicial powers are not exercised as the constitutional court did not find the matter to
be extraordinary and containing such facts which justify exercise of jurisdiction
which is to be exercised "cautiously, sparingly and under certain circumstances only".
The power of the State Government therefore is not curtailed by such high
standards."
The said judgment of the Division Bench of this Court has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in SLP 9649/2021.
21. In view of the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, Division Bench of the High Court and
order passed by the Madras High Court, I am of the view, the impugned order dated 25.09.2019
passed by the State was nothing but a consent given by the State under Section 6 of the DSPE Act
and it is not a sanction as required under either Sections 19 or 17 of the Prevention of Corruption
Act.
22. Though in the impugned order it was mentioned as sanction was accorded but literally it is only
a consent and it is not a sanction and it is only a simple executive order by giving consent to the CBI
for investigating the matter as against the petitioner. It is also revealed by the opinion given by the
Advocate General that the Advocate General has categorically stated that no sanction is required
under Section 17(A) or 19 of the P.C. Act. It is also brought to the notice of the Court by the learned
Senior counsel for the petitioner that the Co- ordinate Bench while passing the order in the Writ
Petition, though it was stated that it was an administrative order in its order, but it is not an
administrative order but it is only a simple executive order and it need not require any detailed
order for application of mind and even otherwise, the authority i.e., Under Secretary has considered
the letter sent by the Directorate of Enforcement Department and passed the order. Even Section 6
of the DSPE Act says that it is only a consent of the State Government for investigation by the
Central Police. Such being the case, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot
be acceptable that there is no application of mind while passing the impugned order. Therefore, on
that ground, the impugned order cannot be quashed.
23. Re. point No.2: The order passed by the Co- ordinate Bench is the 'Judgment in Rem' which is
binding on all the persons including this Court and principles of res judicata applies.
24. In this regard, the learned SPP - II and the CBI counsel brought to the notice of this Court that
the Co- ordinate Bench dealt with the matter in detail by raising three points for consideration and
finally dismissed the petition filed by the one Shashikumar Shivanna in W.P.No.8316/2020.
25. For the convenience, the point raised by the Co-ordinate Bench at paragraph No.13 of the order
is read as under:
"13. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel representing the petitioner and the
learned Advocate General and the learned counsel for the respondent No.3, the

Sri D K Shivakumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 April, 2023
a) Whether the petitioner has the locus standi to challenge the consent granted by the
respondent No.1 under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, 1946 ?
b) Whether consent granted under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, 1946 is akin to a
sanction contemplated under Section 17A or Section 19 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 or under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 ?
c) Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, whether the respondent No.1
was required to apply its mind ? If yes then whether the respondent No.1 has applied
its mind before granting consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, 1946?"
26. The Co-ordinate Bench finally while considering point No.(c) has taken the view that there is no
requirement of application of mind while granting the consent. Ultimately, the petition was
dismissed. The same was challenged before the Division Bench in W.A.444/2020 which came to be
dismissed on 05.02.2021. Admittedly, the said order of the Co-ordinate Bench attained finality and
no appeal was filed by the said Shashi Kumar Shivanna. Of course, the present petitioner was not a
party to the said proceedings in W.P.8316/2020 and the Co-ordinate Bench also stated that the said
Shashi Kumar Shivanna has no locus standi to challenge the order. However, the Co-ordinate Bench
while dealing with the matter where the said Shashi Kumar Shivanna challenged the very order
dated 25.09.2019 for referring the matter to the CBI, but the Co-ordinate Bench has categorically
held and given finding on the reference to the CBI in the impugned order where the application of
mind is not required while giving consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act. Therefore, it cannot be
said that the finding of the Co- ordinate Bench is only on the petition filed by the Shashi Kumar
Shivanna, but it was on the issue of reference of the case to the CBI for investigation against this
petitioner for the provisions of P.C. Act. Therefore, I am of the view that the judgment of the
Co-ordinate Bench was 'Judgment In Rem', it was binding on this petitioner and also other persons
as the issue of reference under the impugned order has been upheld by the Co-ordinate Bench.
Therefore, the contention of the petitioner counsel cannot be acceptable that the judgment should
be between the same parties, but it was an identical dispute on the same subject matter which was
dealt with by the Co-ordinate Bench. Therefore, the doctrine of the res judicata applies to this case
and also the order of the Co-ordinate Bench is binding on this petitioner. Therefore, the judgments
relied by the counsel for the petitioner is not applicable to the case on hand in view of my findings at
point No.1.
27. That apart, the CBI after registering the case, they said to be collected huge evidence and 90% of
the investigation is said to be completed and as argued by the learned SPP-II, if any flaw in the order
of sanction or consent, the investigation cannot be vitiated that it is curable defect under Section
465 of Cr.P.C.
28. Though the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has contended that the consent and
sanction is one ad the same as per Section 470(3) of Cr.P.C., but the said provision is to attract only
limitation point for taking cognizance and a final report. Therefore, it cannot be said that the
consent and sanction are one and the same. It is all together different.

Sri D K Shivakumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 April, 2023
29. In view of the above findings especially in point No.1, the impugned order passed by the State
under Section 6 of the DSPE Act is only a formal consent and it is not a sanction which requires a
detailed order and as stated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, there is no prescribed form to accord
consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act and the Co-ordinate Bench has already decided the issue of
referring the case to CBI which was upheld by the Division Bench. Such being the case, I am of the
view, there is no reason for this Court to distinguish or take divergent opinion in respect of the order
passed by the Co- ordinate Bench in W.P.8316/2020(S-RES). Hence, the petition is devoid of merits
and liable to be dismissed.
30. Accordingly, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is hereby dismissed.
