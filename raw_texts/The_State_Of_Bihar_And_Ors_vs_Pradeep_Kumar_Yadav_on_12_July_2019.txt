The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and
HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA
MISHRA
CAV JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Date : 12-07-2019
We have heard learned counsel for the State of
Bihar-appellant supported by argument of Sri M.N. Parbat,
learned senior counsel for the intervenor-Gayatri Kumari @
Gayatri Devi. For the respondent-petitioners, we have heard Sri
Bindhyachal Singh, Sri Tej Bahadur Singh, Sri P.K. Shahi, Sri
S.K. Dwivedi, Sri K.N. Singh, learned senior counsel, Sri
S.B.K. Mangalam and Sri Jeetendra Narayan, learned counsel.
02. These appeals have been filed by the State of
Bihar assailing the impugned judgment dated 13.04.2017,
whereby the learned Single Judge has allowed the writ petitions
filed by the 28 respondent-petitioners in all the appeals setting
aside their termination orders on the post of Teachers of
Government run Middle Schools in the district of Siwan. The
respondent-petitioners were applicants for appointment as
Teachers against an advertisement that was published on
09.08.1988
pursuant whereto selections were held between Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018
dt.12-07-2019 1989-90 and appointments were made in the year 1991. The selections, therefore,
relate to an almost three decade old matter, the dispute whereof came to be raised in the year 2001
when certain non-selected teachers staked their claim before this Court.
03. There is no dispute between the parties that the selections and appointments were to be made in
accordance with the State Basic Schools (Classification, Appointment, Promotion and Transfer of
Assistant Teachers) Rules, 1975 which are extracted hereinunder:-

The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
04. Clause 5 of the said Rules provides for the preparation of a panel on the basis of merit according
to which selections are to be made. There does not appear to be any further provision as to the
manner in which the panel shall be displayed or made known to the candidates. The appointments
have to be offered on the basis of the said panel to the selected candidates.
05. Two writ petitions were filed CWJC No. 8942 of 2001 (Sri Bhagwan Singh vs. The State of Bihar
& Ors.) and CWJC No. 10212 of 2001 (Kashinath Singh vs. The State of Patna High Court L.P.A
No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 Bihar & Ors.) wherein allegations had been made of irregularities and
manipulation in the selections and appointments presently involved. A learned Single Judge on
24.08.2011 passed the following order for conducting a vigilance inquiry:-
"In a nutshell, dispute is with regard to alleged large scale illegalities committed in
the appointment of teachers of basic schools in the Division of Saran in 1991
onwards.
The allegation of the petitioners is that out of 108 persons, who were appointed,
names of many of them were not in the panel or within the cut-off marks and they
were appointed by committing forgery and manipulation in the panel. The grievance
of the petitioners is that persons from below the panel and below the cut-off marks
were also appointed ignoring claims of petitioners.
In the circumstances, this Court earlier directed the respondents to hold an enquiry
and identify persons, who were illegally appointed, and take appropriate action in the
matter. The State Government 2 has initiated some enquiry due to which
appointment of interveners has come under cloud.
Now the interveners claim that if a thorough enquiry is held in respect of persons,
who were appointed earlier showing them above Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of
2018 dt.12-07-2019 in the panel, it will be found that many of them were not eligible
at all for appointment although surreptitiously they were included in the panel and
were appointed.
The broad outline of the case has been noticed only for the purpose that this Court
feels that a thorough enquiry is required in the matter by a competent authority.
In the circumstances, this Court feels it appropriate that the matter should be got
enquired into by the Cabinet (Vigilance) Department through a senior officer not
below the rank of Dy. Superintendent of Police. As such, Additional Director General
of Vigilance as well as Principal Secretary of the Cabinet (Vigilance) Department are
directed to take steps for a thorough enquiry in the matter. 3 This Court directs that
enquiry should be held by the Department and a preliminary report should be
submitted to this Court to be placed in these cases within four months from today.

The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
Leaned counsel for the petitioners submits that he has served two sets of entire brief
upon learned counsel for the Vigilance Department, receipt of which is being filed in
Court by learned counsel for the petitioners. Let it be kept on record. If any party is in
possession of some relevant documents which may be useful for enquiry, the Enquiry
Officer shall accept it for consideration.
Put up after four
months."
Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019
06. It appears that a third writ petition of the same nature was filed vide CWJC No.
20639 of 2010 (Rajendra Kumar Singh vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.).
07. The said writ petitions came to be heard and disposed of on 25.07.2012 by the
following judgment:-
"Superintendent of Police (Vigilance) of Siwan Zone is present in Court and a final
report along with its enclosures has been submitted by learned senior counsel
appearing on his behalf which is kept on record.
Now, after specific orders and indulgence granted by this Court, Vigilance
Department has completed the investigation and submitted its final report along with
its enclosures. It has recommended for institution of the first information report
against persons guilty for illegal appointments. Along with recommendation for
institution of F.I.R. a large number of documents have been annexed including a
comparative chart of marks of the candidates appointed.
Learned senior counsel for the Vigilance submits that among the appointed
candidates, many have been found to be illegally appointed which has been pointed
out by the Vigilance. Vigilance Department has also found that there was large scale
connivance of the officials of the Department in the said appointments. Hence, Patna
High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 prosecution has been recommended
against them.
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that now Vigilance Department has
found that from the panel of 150 candidates, many candidates, out of 115 appointed,
have now been found by the Vigilance as illegally appointed. Hence the Department
should revise the panel, strike off names of such candidates from panel and remove
them from services. As a consequence of revision of the panel, now many candidates
who ranked above or below the 150, like petitioners, may get higher position in the
panel and within the cut-off point fixed for appointment. Hence if such candidates
come under the consideration zone, they should be appointed and/or be allowed to
continue.

The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
Learned Government Advocate No.1 submits that it is not clear from the report of the
Vigilance Department as to whether a copy of the same has been sent to the
Department of Primary Education or not. Besides, fixing criminal liability on the
officials involved in large scale illegal appointments, departmental action is also
required to be taken against them as well as against illegally appointed teachers.
Hence, the Department will require a copy of the report along with its enclosures to
decide future course of action in the matter.
In the circumstances, Superintendent of Police (Vigilance) Patna High Court L.P.A
No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 of Siwan Zone is directed to send a copy of the final
report with all its enclosures to Department of Primary Education, Government of
Bihar, positively within a fortnight from today. On receipt of the report, the Principal
Secretary, Human Resources Development Department, Government of Bihar, Patna
shall take up the matter himself personally, examine the report and shall decide
future course of action as the Department may be required to take in the matter
particularly in respect of the officials of the Department as well as teachers who got
employment on account of this illegal appointment. He will also revise the panel and
check up as to how many other candidates ranking below, like the petitioners are
shifted to higher position in the panel, so that on the basis of the record and other
records of the Department, their entitlement for appointment or being retained may
be considered. Since the matter is old one, Principal Secretary shall see to it that
actions are taken in the matter as quickly as possible.
The writ applications are disposed of with the aforesaid observations and directions."
08. According to the directions contained in the above-quoted order the Principal Secretary of the
Department concerned was to take notice of the report of the vigilance bearing Report No. BS
13/2011, a copy whereof has been filed Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 as
Annexure-A to the counter affidavit of respondent no. 5 in the writ petition and appears to have
been dispatched in 2012 itself.
09. The Principal Secretary of the Department concerned constituted a Three Member Committee to
look into the findings of the vigilance report and to proceed in accordance with law. The Three
Member Committee submitted a report dated 21.02.2014 which ultimately came to it's own findings
in tune with the vigilance report that the respondent-
petitioners had succeeded in getting themselves selected from amongst the panel of the teachers on
the strength of inflated marks that were depicted against their candidature for which different
methods were adopted, thereby pushing down the meritorious candidates who were eliminated and
in their place the respondent-petitioners who had lesser marks got themselves selected.
10. On the strength of the said reports that was accepted, disciplinary proceedings were initiated by
issuing show-cause notices and calling for a reply from the petitioners and thereafter an inquiry was
held. Upon the submission of the Inquiry Report, a second show-cause notice was issued to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 22
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
respondent-petitioners, whereafter their services were Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018
dt.12-07-2019 terminated.
11. The appellant-State and its authorities came to the conclusion that on account of the inflation of
marks candidates who were better in merit were eliminated and the respondent-petitioners with the
aid of wrong marks being reflected against their names succeeded in getting themselves appointed.
It was also found that had this manipulation not been carried out in the reflection of marks of the
respondent-
petitioners, they would have not been placed amongst the 150 candidates who were selected and
appointed.
12. We may mention here that a panel of 903 candidates had been prepared, but appointments had
to be made only against 150 available posts. Thus, the merit as against150 posts had to be prepared
and appointments were to be made accordingly.
13. Learned counsel for the appellant-State of Bihar contends that the fact that incorrect marks were
reflected is admitted to the respondent-petitioners and, therefore, the conclusion drawn by the
inquiring agency is correct. Since there was no other conclusion possible, the Disciplinary Authority
rightly formed the opinion that the services of the respondent-petitioners deserve to be terminated.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019
14. The termination orders came to be challenged in the writ petitions giving rise to these appeals on
the ground that the impugned orders are in violation of principles of natural justice, inasmuch as,
copies of the documents including the Inquiry Report were not supplied to the
respondent-petitioners so as to give them a fair opportunity to defend themselves. It was, therefore,
held by the learned Single Judge that since the procedure meant for departmental proceedings
including Rule 17 and 18 of the Bihar CCA Rules was not followed, hence the Inquiry was vitiated. It
is also evident that the learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that no reasons have been given
as to why the objections raised by the respondent-petitioners about non-supply of documents was
not tenable. The learned Single Judge found several procedural flaws in the inquiry and also held
that there was no supporting evidence so as to attribute any fraud or misrepresentation on the part
of the respondent-petitioners and consequently, all the termination orders were invalidated by
observing as under:-
"Summarizing the matter in contest, in my opinion the proceedings held in the case of the
petitioners in this batch of writ petitions suffers from a number of procedural infirmities, which are
dehors the provisions underlying 'the Disciplinary Rules' and Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of
2018 dt.12-07-2019 against the principles of natural justice. Apart from the statutory violations the
orders impugned in this batch of writ petitions is also not sustainable on grounds of absence of
reasons accompanying termination as well as the failure on the part of the Regional Deputy Director
of Education to take notice of the enquiry report as well as the defence set up by each of the
petitioners. The Regional Deputy Director of Education has failed to apply his mind as to whether
the irregularity complained of, is of such nature which would render the very appointment void from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 23
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
its inception or the irregularity so pointed out is of a condonable nature.
In my opinion, all these writ petitions are fit to be allowed for the following reasons:
(i) The Vigilance report which is the foundation for the exercise should have been
individually examined and not applied blindly.
(ii) The order of the Principal Secretary, Education Department, as contained in his
letter dated 19.12.2014 addressed to the Regional Deputy Director of Education when
it directs him to initiate action for termination of the services of the teachers by
following the procedure provided under 'the Disciplinary Rules', leaves no discretion
at the hands of the Regional Deputy Director of Education to examine the merits of
the claim. The direction is in the teeth of the judicial pronouncement of the Supreme
Court rendered in Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 the case of
Purtappur Sugar Comp. Ltd. v. Cane Commissioner of Bihar & ors., since reported in
AIR 1970 SC 1896.
(iii) The order of termination impugned in the writ petitions is in violation of the
procedure underlying Rules 17 and
18 of 'the Disciplinary Rules' which, inter alia, casts certain obligation on the disciplinary authority
which are mandatorily required to be followed after receipt of an enquiry report and before
imposing a major penalty.
The Regional Deputy Director of Education has failed to follow the procedure provided under 'the
Disciplinary Rules'. The orders passed are thus in utter disregard of the lawful procedure.
(iv) The orders are unsustainable because even when in most of the cases the enquiry report is in
favour of the petitioners, yet no disagreement note has been issued by the disciplinary authority i.e.
the Regional Deputy Director of Education which invalidates the termination order. In few of the
cases even the copy of the enquiry report has not been supplied as already indicated above and
despite attention being drawn of the Regional Deputy Director of Education, he has not bothered to
correct the mistake.
(v) All these petitioners are working since 1991 when the selection was carried out and there was no
challenge to their Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 appointment by any of the
contesting applicants except two namely Bhagwan Singh and Kashinath Singh and whose claim for
appointment has not been upheld by this Court. The report of the vigilance in so far as these
petitioners are concerned, prima facie does not reflect any invalidity in their appointment.
(vi) There is no evidence on record to confront the stand of the petitioners that they had no role in
preparation of the panel.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 24
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
(vii) The order of termination impugned in this batch of writ petitions neither discusses the defence
set up by the respective petitioners, the explanation given by them nor discusses the evidence
allegedly connecting these petitioners to the charge. In other words, the order of termination is
without reasons, rather is passed in mechanical obedience of the directions of the Principal
Secretary.
(viii) It is rather unfortunate that even though the Supreme Court has been repeatedly reminding
the executive authorities of their duty to assign reasons while adjudicating on inter-party rights but
the wisdom does not reflect in the actions that follow. Reference in this regard is made to the
judgment of the Supreme Court rendered in the case of Kranti Associates Private Limited & anor. v.
Masood Ahmed Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 Khan & ors., since reported
in (2010)9 SCC 496, wherein the Supreme Court while discussing on the obligation of an authority
discharging quasi judicial functions in paragraphs 14 to 46 has summarized the position in
paragraph 47, which reads as follows:
"47. Summarizing the above discussion, this Court holds:
(a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in
administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
(b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions.
(c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of justice
that justice must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.
(d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible arbitrary
exercise of judicial and quasi-
judicial or even administrative power.
(e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision- maker on relevant grounds
and by disregarding extraneous consideration.
(f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018
dt.12-07-2019 a component of a decision making process as observing principles of natural justice
by judicial, quasi- judicial and even by administrative bodies.
(g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior courts.
(h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and constitutional
governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts. This is virtually the lifeblood
of judicial decision- making justifying the principle that reason is the soul of justice.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 25
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
(i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as different as the judges and
authorities who deliver them.
All these decisions serve one common purpose which is to demonstrate by reason that the relevant
factors have been objectively considered. This is important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the
justice delivery system.
(j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and transparency.
(k) If a judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about his/her decision making
process then it is impossible to know whether the person deciding is faithful to the doctrine of
precedent or to Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 principles of incrementalism.
(l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct. A pretence of reasons or
"rubber-stamp reasons" is not to be equated with a valid decision-
making process.
(m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the since qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial
powers. Transparency in decision-making not only makes the judges and decision-makers less
prone to errors but also makes them subject to broader scrutiny.
(See: David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Condor, 32(1987)100 Harvard Law Review 731-37)
(n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the broad doctrine of fairness in
decision-making, the said requirement is now virtually a component of human rights and was
considered part of Strashourg Jurisprudence. See Ruiz Torija v.
Spain EHRR, at 562 para 29 and Anya v. University of Oxford, wherein the Court referred to Article
6 of the European Convention of Human Rights which required, "adequate and intelligent reasons
must be given for judicial decision".
(o) In all common law jurisdiction judgments play a vital role in setting up precedents for the future.
Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the Patna
High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 essence and is virtually a part of "due process"."
(ix) The report of the three-Member Committee dated 24.2.2014 constituted by the Director,
Primary Education under the orders of this Court is on record at Annexure 9 to C.W.J.C.No.
11069/2016 and the three-Member Committee which includes the Regional Deputy Director of
Education, Saran Division, Chapra acknowledges the fact that the issue raised dates back more than
two decades and neither the application of any applicant is available nor the educational certificates
of the candidates is available, rather the Vigilance has enquired into the matter on the basis of
certificates produced by the teachers themselves. The only irregularity which has been mentioned by
the three-Member Committee is that the preparation of the merit list suffered from several
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 26
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
irregularities.
(x) Considering that these petitioners have continued on their respective post for more than 35 years
with nothing substantive on record to render their appointment void, any irregularity pointed out by
the vigilance bordering on inter party merit, required an examination by the authority concerned
with a pragmatic approach Patna High and not in the mechanical and arbitrary manner as reflecting
from the proceedings Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 accompanying the
present batch of cases.
(xi) The orders are simply resting on the allegations as found in the vigilance report or in the charge
memo issued without any supporting evidence. In other words, except for the allegation there is no
supporting evidence to support the charge and thus, the conclusion is based on no evidence."
15. Learned counsel for the appellant-State of Bihar contends that when the primary fact relating to
an erroneous description of marks has been established, then the observation made by the learned
Single Judge that the primary case was one of inter se merit is not correct. This was a case where the
respondent-petitioners had entered into service on the basis of a manipulated merit chart with the
aid of which they achieved their ends. This, therefore, is a case of fraud and misrepresentation and
not a case of mistake which could have been regularised or can be corrected even now. It is in this
background that the State of Bihar contends that the learned Single Judge has committed an error
in allowing the writ petitions that too even without remanding the matter back for filling up the gaps
in the inquiry proceedings.
16. Replying to the aforesaid submissions all the Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018
dt.12-07-2019 learned counsel for the respondent-petitioners have virtually adopted the same line of
arguments contending that the appellant-State had not followed the procedure prescribed in law
and there was no material to support the conclusion so as to form any adverse opinion against the
respondent-petitioners on the basis of material found. Thus, since there was no evidence to establish
the involvement of the respondent-petitioners, the learned Single Judge was justified in quashing
the termination orders. It is also submitted on behalf of the respondent-
petitioners that almost 30 years have passed by and some of the teachers are now about to complete
their career, in such circumstances, this Court should not interfere with the orders of the learned
Single Judge and they should be allowed to continue in the service. It is their contention that the
proceedings were not in accordance with the directions contained in the judgment dated 25.07.2012.
Learned counsel for the respondent-petitioners have relied on Rule 17 (23)(ii) and Rule 18(2) of the
CCA Rule, 2005 to contend that no reason for disagreement with the findings arrived at by the
Vigilance Department and the Three Member Committee has been recorded. To support the
submission, reliance has been placed on Paragraphs 10, 13 and 14 of the judgment in the case Patna
High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 of Lav Nigam vs. Chairman & MD, ITI Ltd. and Anr.
reported in (2006) 9 SCC 440. The non-supply of relevant documents and also the inquiry report
has also been asserted for which reliance is placed on the judgments in the case of State Bank of
India and Ors. vs. D.C. Aggarwal and Anr. reported in (1993) 1 SCC 13, Syed Rahimuddin vs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 27
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
Director General, CSIR and Ors. reported in (2001) 9 SCC 575 Paragraph 3 and Govt. of A.P. And
Ors. vs. A. Venkata Raidu reported in (2007) 1 SCC 338 Paragraph 9. It has also been urged that the
orders reflect non-application of mind which violates to Rule 18(4) of the CCA Rules, 2005 and in
support thereof the case of Chandradip Sinha vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2000 (3)
PLJR 64 has been cited.
17. We have considered the submissions raised and we find that this dispute arose on account of a
direction issued by the High Court on 24.08. 2011 and the judgment dated 25.07.2012. The said
orders have become final and have not been challenged by anybody. Thus, any passage of time after
the appointment of the respondent-petitioners cannot be a ground to construe that the exercise
undertaken was belated or cannot be scrutinized due to a long lapse of time. Apart from this, two
inquiries were held, one by the Vigilance Department Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018
dt.12-07-2019 and the other by the Three Member Inquiry Committee where the
respondent-petitioners did submit their reply.
18. One thing is certain that the respondent-
petitioners have also not been able to successfully deny the fact that their marks were wrongly
depicted in the panel prepared by the office. The stand of the respondent-petitioners is that such
mistake was either a clerical or a typographical or a mistake which was only attributable to the office
of the employers and which nowhere reflects any manipulation or fraud on the part of the
respondent-petitioners.
19. The Inquiry Reports reflect the manipulation of marks only in the panel-list and there is no
evidence of the respondent-petitioners having furnished fake mark-sheets or any wrong information
about their actual marks but the fact remains that all the respondent-petitioners are beneficiaries of
the said manipulated transaction.
20. It is here that we would like to comment upon the nature of the mistakes that have been
reflected in the inquiry reports. A mistake is an error or a wrong estimate or fault in thought or
inaction on account of any misunderstanding or misconception. What would amount to an
inadvertent mistake is another aspect. A typographical mistake can be inadvertent Patna High Court
L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 and this what the respondent-petitioners assert but the manner
in which the marks have been varied in the panel-list are in great contrast to the actual marks of the
respondent-petitioners.
The mistakes are therefore not inadvertent or typographical.
They are calculative mistakes that have been inserted with a view to alter the position of merit and
are not typing mistakes.
The mistakes in the panel are evident as the respondent-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 28
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
petitioners themselves have taken a stand that they are not responsible for the mistakes as reflected
in the panel-list. The respondent-petitioners have tried to shift the entire burden on the officials
who may have prepared the panel-list and on whom the allegation is of having committed that
mistake. The respondent-petitioners therefore have attempted to absolve themselves of any act of
guilt on their part.
21. We find that the respondent-petitioners are the beneficiaries feigning ignorance about the
depiction of such marks in the panel-list. They all contend that they have no knowledge as to how
and when such mistakes occurred and they were not even brought to the notice of respondent-
petitioners at any stage. It is therefore submitted on their behalf that if there was no knowledge to
the respondent-petitioners about the said alleged mistakes then in that event no guilt can Patna
High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 be attributed to them.
22. The question can be answered on the basis of the surrounding circumstances where the
respondent-petitioners are beneficiaries. The respondent-petitioners had knowledge about their
selection and, therefore, an inference can be reasonably drawn and gathered from surrounding
circumstances that the respondent-petitioners were at least having constructive knowledge of the
selections on the basis of a panel that upon inquiry has been established to have been wrongly
drawn up.
To contend that they had no knowledge about the reflection of wrong marks would amount to infer a
conduct against the ordinary course of things. However, inference on the basis of such evidence
must be carefully distinguished from conjectures or mere speculation. An inference should not be
drawn on the basis of strenuous exercise in order to prove something which otherwise may not exist
but the objective facts of this case particularly the wrong reflection of marks is a strong circumstance
which does not appear to be disputed by the respondent-petitioners. To the contrary, the
respondent-
petitioners are confident of even getting selected if the marks are correctly revised and placed in the
panel.
23. The argument of the respondent-petitioners is Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018
dt.12-07-2019 that if the entire merit list is re-looked into as directed in the judgment dated
25.07.2012 it is quite possible that even with the correct marks the respondent-petitioners would
succeed in getting selected. This exercise according to them has not been undertaken and which we
find is not in accordance with the directions issued by this Court or the rules of inquiry. The
procedure appears to have been violated, inasmuch as, the respondent-petitioners were admittedly
not given a complete copy of the Inquiry Report and the second show-cause notice only mentioned a
gist of the charges that were found to be proved. In a couple of cases notices were not properly
served.
The appellants should have been provided the complete copy of the Inquiry Report relating to each
of the candidates in order to enable them to set up their defence. The final authority that has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196509550/ 29
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Pradeep Kumar Yadav on 12 July, 2019
proceeded to terminate the services of the respondent-
petitioners ought to have been more specific about the involvement of the respondent-petitioners
when the charge was one of alleged manipulation. The reason also, to establish the nexus of the
respondent-petitioners with the Officers of the Department, has to be recorded on the basis of
evidence by passing a speaking order. This was necessary in order to find out the involvement of the
respondent-petitioners. Patna High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 Consequently, the
procedure having been violated, the findings arrived at with regard to the correctness or otherwise
of the merit position of the respondent-petitioners cannot be said to be wrong in its entirety unless it
can be shown that all the respondent-petitioners would fall outside the limit of 150 posts against
which employment had been sought.
24. Accordingly to our mind, once the learned Single Judge was of the opinion that there was a
procedural violation, then in that event, the matter ought to have been remitted back to the same
authority to examine the facts as alleged by the respondent-petitioners after providing the
documents that were relevant namely the Inquiry Report and the letters of appointment etc. before
proceeding to terminate the services of the respondent-petitioners.
25. In the light of above, we agree with the findings of the learned Single Judge that there were
procedural violations, but in view of the fact that the respondent-petitioners were beneficiaries of a
selection on account of incorrect depiction of marks, the authorities ought to have put the
respondent-petitioners to notice about such facts including the Inquiry Report before having
proceeded to terminate their services. The appeals are, therefore, disposed of by modifying Patna
High Court L.P.A No.109 of 2018 dt.12-07-2019 the order of the learned Single Judge to the effect
that the appellants shall now afford a fresh opportunity to the respondent-petitioners to give a reply
to all the allegations after supplying them a copy of the Inquiry Report by giving a fresh show cause
notice and any other available relevant document and then pass appropriate orders after
considering the reply of the respondent-petitioners in accordance with law within a reasonable time.
26. All the appeals stand disposed of accordingly.
