Appearance :
For the Petitioner : Mr.Anil Kumar, Advocate
For the Respondents : Mr.
======================================================
CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 04-04-2019 Heard learned counsel for the petitioners.
2. This application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been filed by the petitioners
challenging the order dated 16.11.2018 passed by the learned Sub-Judge-VIII, Aurangabad in Title
Suit No. 409 of 2016 whereby the application dated 21.04.2018 filed by petitioners-plaintiffs with a
prayer to pass order for simultaneous hearing of Title Suit No. 48 of 2017 has been rejected.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that Title Suit No. 409 of 2016 has been filed by the
petitioners and Title Suit No. 48 of 2017 has been filed by respondents-defendants no. 6 and 7,
namely, Asha Devi and Poonam Kumari respectively. Both the suits were transferred to the court of
Sub-Judge-VIII, Aurangabad by the learned District and Sessions Judge, Aurangabad with a view to
adjudicate them simultaneously. In Patna High Court C.Misc. No.197 of 2019 dt.04-04-2019 both
the suits, material issue is the same, which warrants common oral and documentary evidences in
order to avoid conflicting judgments. The court below ought to have allowed the application filed by
the petitioners on 21.04.2018 under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short 'CPC') for
simultaneous hearing of Title Suit No. 48 of 2017.
4. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the materials on record, I find that
the petitioner had filed Title Suit No. 409 of 2016 for declaration that sale deed nos. 488 and 489
executed on 11.01.2016 and registered on 14.01.2016 for the lands mentioned in Schedule-C of the
plaint are illegal, wrong, fraudulent, sham and void document and respondents- defendants 1st set,
namely, Babli Kumari, Annu Singh and Sanjeeti Devi did not acquire right, title or interest for the
disputed lands mentioned in Schedule-C of the plaint. Title Suit No.48 of 2017 was filed by the
respondent no. 6 Asha Devi and respondent no. 7 Poonam Kumari for declaration of sale deed nos.
9278 and 9288 dated 11.07.2016, which were registered on 13.07.2016 in favour of Meena Devi and
others, as wrong and illegal. In the said suit, cause of action had arisen on 10.11.2016 when the
cheque given by the respondents no. 1 to 3, namely, Babli Kumari, Annu Singh and Sanjeeti Devi got
dishonoured. It is true that the land in Patna High Court C.Misc. No.197 of 2019 dt.04-04-2019
question in both the cases are more or less identical, but in both the cases the reliefs sought for and
the cause of action are separate and distinct.
5. Section 10 of the CPC provides that no court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the

Smt. Meena Devi And Ors vs Smt. Babli Kumari on 4 April, 2019
matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the
same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same
title where such suit is pending in the same or any other court.
6. As far as the instant case is concerned, as stated above, the matter in issue in the aforesaid two
suits is neither directly nor substantially the same.
7. In that view of the matter, finding no illegality in the impugned order dated 16.11.2018 passed by
the learned Sub-Judge-VIII, Aurangabad in Title Suit No. 409 of 2016, I see no reason to interfere
with the same.
8. Accordingly, the application is dismissed.
