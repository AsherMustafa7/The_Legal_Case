THIS WRIT PETITION, COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The petitioner is before this Court on a peculiar circumstance challenging the notices dated
01.10.2022 and 11.10.2022, issued by respondent No.2 - police directing production of gold that is
pledged with the petitioner.
2. Heard Sri Venkataramana K.S., learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Vinod Kumar M.,
learned Additional Government Advocate for respondent Nos.1 and
2.
3. Brief facts of the case leading to the filing of the petition as borne out from the pleadings are as
follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119063664/ 2
M/S. Muthoot Finance Ltd vs State Of Karnataka on 14 October, 2022
A crime comes to be registered against the husband of the complainant for the
offences punishable under Sections 498A, 504 r/w. 34 of the IPC and Section 4 of the
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. On registration of the crime, the police issue a notice to
the petitioner herein directing that the gold that was pledged by the husband should
be handed over to the complainant, the wife. The notice is ostensibly issued at the
behest of the complainant for securing the gold that allegedly belongs to the
complainant wife, which is pledged by the husband with the petitioner's.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the husband secures finance
from the hands of the petitioner by pledging gold and from that date, he has not paid a single pai to
the petitioner. The learned counsel would point at the similar order being passed in similar
circumstances by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.17347/2022 disposed on
26.09.2022.
5. The order of the co-ordinate Bench of this Court rendered in Writ Petition No.17347/2022
disposed on 26.09.2022, reads as follows:
"The subject matter of this Writ Petition is similar to the one in W.P.No.8354/2022
(GM- POLICE) between MUTHOOT FINANCE LTD vs. STATE AND ANOTHER,
disposed off on 17.8.2022, is arguably true, some reprieve having been granted to a
litigant subject to certain conditions.
2. However, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that his client being a
businessman would fully cooperate with the investigation process by producing the
subject gold articles whenever instructed by the police and that the said articles be
returned to him for retention. He also undertakes to preserve the same till after the
disposal of criminal case in question or acceptance of 'B' Report if filed, whichever
way it may turn out to be.
3. The apprehension of the learned AGA and the respondent-complainant that if
petitioner takes back the gold articles, he may dispose them off or convert into other
articles, cannot be taken care of inasmuch as the petitioner has undertaken before
this court to preserve the same as they are, as mentioned above. Counsel for the
petitioner is justified in arguing that if the police were to misplace or lose the gold
articles, his client arguably cannot have any grievance against the same in view of
doctrine of "sovereign function" vide KASTURI LAL vs. STATE OF UP AIR 1965 SC
1039.
In view of these special circumstances, the Writ Petition is disposed off, reserving
liberty to the respondent-police to summon the gold articles in question at any time
from the side of petitioner and to take photographs or videographs of the subject
articles along with their producer and the complainant, if need be, as well.

If petitioner does not cooperate in producing the gold articles whenever required, it is
open to the police to seize the same and keep them in safe custody.
Costs made easy."
(Emphasis supplied) In the light of the afore-extracted order of the co- ordinate Bench of this Court,
which concerns seizure and custody of gold, would cover the issue that is brought before this Court,
on all its fours. Therefore, following the afore-quoted order of the co-ordinate Bench, I deem it
appropriate to dispose the writ petition.
6. For the aforesaid reasons, the following:
ORDER i. The writ petition is disposed.
ii. Liberty is reserved to the respondents - police to summon the gold articles in
question any time from the petitioner.
iii. In the event the petitioner would not co-operate by replying to the notices or in
production of the gold articles whenever required, it is open for the Investigating
Officer to seize the same and place in safe custody.
iv. This order is passed only to the peculiar circumstances obtaining in the case at
hand and not would not be applicable to the cases were the police issue notice on the
purchasers of stolen gold.
Ordered accordingly.
