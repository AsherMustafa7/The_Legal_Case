CORAM: HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. G. ANUPAMA CHAKRAVARTHY
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 16-10-2025
1. The writ petition is filed for the following reliefs:-
"(i) For issuance of writ of certiorari for quashing the order of selection and the license of Public
Distribution System in name of Md. Guljar Alam respondent No. 7 after calling the same from the
respondent authority before this Hon'ble High Court because authority is not supplying the Patna
High Court CWJC No.17129 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 copy of license and its order to the petitioner and
hence petitioner is unable to file the same before the Hon'ble High Court.
(ii) For issuance of writ of Mandamus commanding the respondent authority to grant the license of
Public Distribution Shop, under Gram Panchayat Chalana Anchal-Dhoraiya, Dist-Banka.
(iii) For issuance of such other writ or order or direction which may deem fit and proper for ends of
justice."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016

Madan Gopal vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
provides for the provision of revision.
Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
Patna High Court CWJC No.17129 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 issue or renewal of the
license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the license may appeal to the
District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of the order and the District
Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal within a period of sixty
days.
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the
order under appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider
necessary for giving a reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4)
or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has
Patna High Court CWJC No.17129 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 an alternative remedy under the
provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within two months from the Patna High Court CWJC No.17129 of 2019
dt.16-10-2025 date of receipt of this order before the concerned authority. The delay in filing the
complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority concerned, and the authority shall dispose
of the same within three months from the date of filing of the same.
7. With the above said observations, the Writ petition shall stand disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
