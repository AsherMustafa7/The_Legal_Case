"64 (1) (i) : In the event of any dispute or difference between the parties hereto as to
the construction or operation of this contract, or the respective rights and liabilities
of the parties on any matter in question, dispute or difference on any account or as to
the withholding by the Railway of any certificate to which the Contractor may claim
to be entitled to, or if the Railway fails to make a decision within 120 days, then and
in any such case, but except in any of the "excepted matters" referred to in Clause
63.1 of these Conditions, the Contractor, after 120 days but within 180 days of his
presenting his final claim on disputed matters shall demand in writing that the
dispute or difference be referred to arbitration. "
3. Dispute arises among the parties in respect of partnership. The petitioner vide its letter dated
01.05.2024, invoked the dispute resolution mechanism and formally requested that the matter be
referred for adjudication through arbitration proceedings, the respondents have failed to act in
terms of the arbitration Clause. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the arbitration
agreement exists and is valid, but the respondents have failed to co-operate in appointment of
Arbitrator. Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.21 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
4. Considering the fact that whether valid arbitration agreement among the parties and whether
disputes have arisen thereon warranting reference to arbitration, it is admitted that there is
agreement and so also valid Clause 64(1)(i) and it relates to arbitration and it is binding among the
respective parties. Disputes have admittedly arisen among the parties. The respondents have failed
to act as required for constitution of arbitral tribunal. In view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Duro Felguera, S.A. vs. Gangavaram Port Limited reported in (2017) 9
SCC 729 and Mayavati Trading Private Limited vs. Praduyat Deb Burman reported in (2019) 8 SCC

and nothing beyond.
5. Perusal of the agreement, it is evident that Clause 64(1)(i) is crystal clear that there is Arbitration
Clause existing. Accordingly, this court is satisfied with the requirement of Section 11 of the Act,
1996 and petitioner has made out a case, therefore, this Court appoints Hon'ble Mr. Justice Raj
Mohan Singh, Resident of House No. 283, Section 21-A, Chandigarh, Mobile No. 8558809931,
former Judge of the Chandigarh High Court and Madhya Pradesh High Court as the sole arbitrator
