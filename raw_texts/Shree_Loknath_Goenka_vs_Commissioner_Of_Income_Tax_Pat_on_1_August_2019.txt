Shree Loknath Goenka vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Pat on 1 August, 2019
Date : 01-08-2019
These two cases arise from a reference made by the
Income Tax Tribunal, Patna Bench, Patna under Section 256(i) of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred as as 'the Act').
Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019
2/13
2. The point for consideration in the reference is whether
the Appellate Tribunal was correct in law in holding that the share
income of minor sons of the assessees, including the share in
interest on capital credited to the minor sons out of the partnership
firm was to be computed in the hands of their father under Section
64(1)(iii) in the Assessment year 1976-77. The said provision was
introduced in the Income Tax Act by the Taxation Law
(Amendment) Act 1975 with effect from 1.4.1976, whereas the
accounting year of the assessee(s) in the instant case(s) came to an
end on 10.8.1975 and on 31.12.1975 in Taxation Case No. 126 of
1983 and Taxation Case No. 28 of 1986 respectively.
3. The authorities were of the opinion that the question
was answered by a Division Bench decision rendered in the case
of Badri Prasad & ors. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax (1990)
Volume 185 ITR 307, which concluded the issue in the following
terms:-
"It is a cardinal principle of tax laws that the
law to be applied is that which is in force at the
commencement of the assessment year. (See
Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd. v. State of Kerala
[1966] 60 ITR 262 (SC) and Maneklal
Vallabhdas Parikh and Sons v. CIT [1969] 72

Shree Loknath Goenka vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Pat on 1 August, 2019
ITR 637 (Guj).
In the instant case, the assessment year is 1976-
77. Therefore, the law in force on April 1, 1976,
would govern the assessment for the assessment
year in question.
Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019
3/13
The Tribunal, in our opinion, was right in
holding that the share income of the minor sons
from the firm to which they were admitted as
partners was assessable in the hands of their
fathers by virtue of the provisions of Section
64(1)(iii) of the Act as amended from April 1,
1976 by the Taxation Law (Amendment) Act,
1975
Our answer to the question referred to this
Court is, therefore, in the affirmative and
against the assessees."
4. It is when the issue arose for consideration in these
two cases before the Division Bench that the decision of the Apex
Court in the case of Kesoram Industries and Cotton Mills Ltd, vs.
Wealth Tax Commissioner (Central), Calcutta, reported in AIR
1966 SC 1370 was relied upon by Counsel for the assessee to
contend that the liability to pay income tax hinges on accrual of
income and has no concern with the time when computation is
made by the taxing authority. It was the submission of learned
Counsel that the decision in the case of Kesoram Industries
(supra) was not considered by the Division Bench which decided
the case of Badri Prasad (supra).
5. It is bearing note of such circumstances the Division
Bench, which was considering Tax Case No. 28 of 1986, referred
the issue for consideration to a larger Bench by an order dated
8.5.1996

Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019
6. It is under Section 256(i) of the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Tribunal Patna Bench had earlier
in the year 1982, referred the same question for opinion of this Court, which remained pending
consideration in the proceedings arising out of Tax Case No. 126 of 1982 and it is bearing note of the
earlier order in Tax Case No. 28 of 1986 that the Division Bench which was considering Tax Case
No. 126 of 1982, also referred the same question to a larger Bench.
7. Accordingly both matters are before us for answering the reference.
8. The entire issue arises on the scope and applicability of Section 64(1)(iii) of the Act. This Court
would therefore consider it useful to quote relevant provisions which reads as under :-
"64. Income of individual to include income of spouse, minor child, etc. (1) In
computing the total income of any individual, there shall be included all such income
as arises directly or indirectly.
..... ......... ............ ..............
(iii) to a minor child of such individual from the admission of the minor to the
benefits of partnership in a firm...."
9. The admitted facts are that in both the instant cases, the accounting year of the firm had closed
much prior to coming Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019 into force of Section
64(1)(iii). In spite of the accounting year having closed prior to coming into force of Section
64(1)(iii) with effect from 1.4.1976, the Income Tax Tribunal added the share income of the minor
sons from the partnership firm at the hands of the income of the assessee father under Section
64(1)(iii) of the Act.
10. Mr. D. V. Pathy has assisted the Court on behalf of the assessee in Tax Case No. 126 of 1982. In
spite of valid service of notice upon the assessee in Tax Case No. 28 of 1986 none appeared on behalf
of the assessee. In the circumstances, this Court has requested Mr. Pathy to appear as Amicus
Curiae in Tax Case No. 28 of 1986 also. We have also heard Mr. Rishi Raj Sinha, learned Senior
Standing Counsel on behalf of the department.
11. The issues in both the cases are one and the same.
12. Mr. Pathy appearing on behalf of the assessee in both the matters has submitted that the
provisions of the Amending Act have come into force with effect from the date specified in the
notification issued under Section 2 of the Amendment Act i.e. with effect from 1.4.1976. It is his
submission that even if the share income of the minor accrued prior thereto, the same was liable to
be added in the income of the parent, for the purpose of computing Patna High Court TAX No.126 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20038097/ 4
Shree Loknath Goenka vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Pat on 1 August, 2019
1982 dt.01-08-2019 taxable income of the father in compliance with the provisions contained in
Section 64(i)(iii) of the Amendment Act.
13. Learned Counsel have placed reliance on the judgment rendered in the case of Badri Prasad
(supra), the relevant extract of which has been extracted hereinabove at paragraph 3. It is their
submission that in view of the consideration and opinion expressed by the Division Bench in the
case of Badri Prasad (supra), the issue now stands settled. It is canvassed that irrespective of the fact
that the Taxation Law Amendment Act has come into force with effect from 1.4.1976 and
irrespective of the fact that the accounting year of both the assessees had closed prior thereto, the
income of the minor children of the assesses was liable to be added at the hands of their father while
computing his total income.
14. As per submissions of Mr. Pathy, the law applicable on the date of assessment is relevant for
ascertaining the tax liability. He submits that the time of accrual of income is irrelevant for the
purpose of applicability of the Amending Act. Irrespective of the fact that income has accrued and
accounting year of the assessee has come to an end prior to 1.4.1976, the Amending Act which came
into force with effect from 1.4.1976 will apply to arrive at the taxable income of the assessee in the
accounting year Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019 1976-77 corresponding to
accounting year 1975-76. According to him, para 8 of the Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex
Court in Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd Versus State of Kerala, reported in AIR 1966 SC 1385 which
has been relied upon in the case of Badri Prasad (supra) supports his contention.
Para 8 of the judgment in the case of Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd (supra) reads as follows:-
"Now, it is well settled that the Income Tax Act, as it stands amended on the first day
of April of any financial year must apply to the assessment of that year. Any
amendments in the Act which come into force after the first day of April of a financial
year, would not apply to the assessment for that year, even if the assessment is
actually made after the amendments came into force."
15. In the opinion of this court, the legal position settled by the Constitution Bench, is neither as
appreciated by the Division Bench in the case of Badri Prasad (supra) nor as canvassed by Mr.
Pathy. In fact what the Constitution Bench has settled is that if an amendment takes place on lst of
April of any financial year, it would apply to the assessment held for that financial year but not if the
amendment comes into force after the start of the financial year on lst of April in which case it would
take effect on the next assessment year. By applying the said law to the facts of the two cases under
reference, it is seen that the Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019 provisions of the
Amending Act came into force on the first day of April of the financial year 1976-77. As per the legal
position settled in para 8 of the judgment in the case of Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd. (supra), the
amendment would apply to the assessment to be held for the financial year 1976-77 i.e. the
assessment year 1977-78. This is the irresistible conclusion reached by applying the law laid down by
the Apex Court in para 8 of the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Karimtharuvi Tea Estate
Ltd (supra).

16. The earlier judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Kesoram Industries (supra) decided on
24.11.1965 is in line with the Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in Karimtharuvi
Tea Estate Ltd (supra) decided on 15.12.1965. The relevant extract of the judgment of the Apex Court
in Kesoram Industries (supra) is as follows:-
26. Uninfluenced by judicial decisions let us at the out-set look at the relevant
provisions of the two Acts. Under Section 3 of the Income Tax Act, where any Central
Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates, tax at
that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with, and subject
to the provisions of, the said Act. The expression "charged" is used both in the case of
the Central Act i.e. the Finance Act, and the Income Tax Act.
It could not have been the intention of the Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019
Legislature to charge the income to income tax under two Acts. Necessarily, therefore, they are used
in two different senses. The tax is to be charged for that year in accordance with, and subject to, the
provisions of the Income Tax Act; but the said charge will be in accordance with the rates prescribed
under the Finance Act. This construction will harmonize the apparent conflict between the two Acts.
When you look at Section 2 of the Finance Act, it shows that income tax shall be charged at the rates
specified in Part I of the First Schedule, and super tax, for purpose of Section 55 of the Income Tax
Act, 1922, shall be charged at the rates specified in Part II of the First Schedule. The primary object
of the Finance Act is only to prescribe the rates so that the tax can be charged under the Income Tax
Act. The Income Tax Act is a permanent Act whereas the Finance Act is passed every year and its
main purpose is to fix the rates to be charged under the Income Tax Act for that year. That should be
the construction is also made clear by Section 55 of the Income Tax Act, whereunder super tax shall
be charged for any year in respect of the total income of the previous year of any individual, Hindu
undivided family, company etc. at the rate or rates laid down for that year by a Central Act. This
section brings out the distinction between a tax charged and the rate at which it is charged. This
construction is also emphasized by Section 67-B of the Income Tax Act, whereunder if on the 1st day
of April in any year provision has not yet been made by a Central Act for the charging of income tax
for that year, the Income Tax Act shall nevertheless have effect until such provision is so made as if
the provision in force in the preceding year or the Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982
dt.01-08-2019 provision proposed in the Bill then before Parliament, whichever is more favourable
to the assessee, was actually in force. This shows that the charging section is only Section 3 of the
Income Tax Act; and that Section 2 of the Finance Act only gives the rate for quantifying the tax; for,
this section gives an alternative for quantification in the contingency the of the Finance Act not
having been made on the 1st day of April of that year. Even if such an Act was made, the charge
under the Income Tax Act could be imposed and worked out only in terms of the provisions of the
Income Tax Act. If that be the construction, the conclusion will flow that the tax liability at the latest
will arise on the last day of the accounting year.
33. To summarize: A debt is a present obligation to pay an ascertainable sum of money, whether the
amount is payable in praesenti or in futuro:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20038097/ 6
Shree Loknath Goenka vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Pat on 1 August, 2019
debitum in praesenti, solvendum in futuro. But a sum payable upon a contingency
does not become a debt until the said contingency has happened. A liability to pay
income tax is a present liability though it becomes payable after it is quantified in
accordance with ascertainable data. There is a perfected debt at any rate on the last
day of the accounting year and not a contingent liability. The rate is always easily
ascertainable. If the Finance Act is passed, it is the rate fixed by that Act; if the
Finance Act has not yet been passed, it is the rate proposed in the Finance Bill
pending before Parliament or the rate in force in the preceding year, whichever is
more favourable to the assessee. All the ingredients of a "debt" are present. It is a
present liability of an ascertainable amount.
Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019
36. For the reasons we have stated earlier, we agree with the conclusion arrived at by
the Gujarat High Court. We, therefore, hold that the liability to pay income tax is a
debt within the meaning of Section 2(m) of the Wealth Tax Act and it arises on the
valuation date during the accounting year.
17. Reading the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Kesoram Industries and
Cotton Mills Ltd. harmoniously with the Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd (supra), this Court would observe
that the argument advanced by Counsel for the assessees (Amicus Curriae) as well as
the Department can be made only in respect of a rate prescribed under a Finance Act
or an Act providing a surcharge if the same is brought into force on the lst of April of
the assessment year in which assessment for the previous year is being done as the
same would only provide for ascertaining the rate, for existing liability under the
Income Tax Act. But that is not the case here. Under the new provision, i.e. Section
64(1)(iii) a new liability has been prescribed and not the rate for ascertaining the
liability. Such new liability under the Income Tax Act cnnot be given a retrospective
effect. Such liability can only be fastened on an individual if the same was existing at
the time of accrual and not at the time of assessment. The observations of the Apex
Court Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019 in paragraph 33 of the
judgment in the case of Keshoram Industries and Cotton Mills (supra), clarifies this
position.
18. In view of the judgments of the Apex Court in the case of Keshoram Industries
(supra) as well as Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd (supra) this Court would have no
hesitation in holding that for deciding the liability of a particular provision of the
Income Tax Act, the date of accrual of income would be relevant. If the provision
comes into force in a particular financial year, it would apply to the assessment for
that year but cannot be made applicable in respect of assessment for a previous year.
19. The Amending Act introduced a new Section 64(1)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20038097/ 7
Shree Loknath Goenka vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Pat on 1 August, 2019
(iii) in the Income Tax Act with effect from 1.4.1976. The tax liability under the said
provision could therefore be charged on the assessee, in the assessment which was to
be made for that accounting year i.e. 1976-77, which would be done in the assessment
year 1977-78. The Amending Act introducing a new tax liability which came into force
with effect from 1.4.1976 could not be given a retrospectivity and be made applicable
to the previous accounting year i.e. 1975-76 corresponding to the assessment year i.e.
1976-77.
Patna High Court TAX No.126 of 1982 dt.01-08-2019
20. In view of the foregoing discussions and conclusions arrived at by us, I am of the considered
opinion that the judgment rendered in the case of Badri Prasad (supra) does not lay down the
correct law.
21. The issue of law having been clarified as aforesaid the reference stands answered. The matter is
remanded to the Division Bench for disposing of the matter in terms of the law as considered by the
Full Bench in the instant proceeding.
