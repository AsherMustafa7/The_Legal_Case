(iv) Pass any appropriate order as the Hon'ble High Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the case."
[3] The grounds praying for releasing the petitioners/accused are as follows:
(i) For that, there is no prima facie case has been made out by the I.O. of the case
against the present petitioner.
(ii) For that, the accused drivers were into police custody w.e.f.
04.08.2023 to 10.08.2023 and from 11.08.2023 to 25.08.2023 they wee remanded to judicial
custody. In the interrogation of the accused, during the police custody as well as judicial custody
nothing has been shown and proved that the drivers are involved in the crime.
(iii) For that, as per report of the I.O. it is stated that the drivers denied the involvement of the
crime. Moreover, from CDR/SDR of phone numbers seized by the I.O., it can be easily detected in
order to find out concrete evidence in the presence case. On further investigation on the accused
during judicial custody no subsequent materials and concrete evidence has been found till date for
accusation of the two present petitioners/accused.
(iv) For that, charges levelled against the two drivers are not attracted against the drivers since they
never committed any crime nor attempted to commit any crime punishable under Section
21(c)/29/60/(3) ND&Ps Act & 34 IPC at any point of time. Hence, the drivers are falsely implicated
in the present case.
(v) For that, the wo drivers have never been arrested earlier or convicted by the Court in respect of
congnizable offences. The petitioner is honest citizen and as such he has never indulged in any
illegal activities nor likely to involve the future.
(vi) For that, the mandatory provision of Section 42 and of the ND & PS Act has not been complied
with the personnel of Assam Rifles at the time of arrest and seizure of the contraband Brown Sugar."
