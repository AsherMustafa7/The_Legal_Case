JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(CAV)
These petitions have been filed by the petitioners under Section 438 Cr.P.C. seeking to enlarge them
on bail in the event of their arrest in connection with FIR No.29(05)2022 on the file of Lilong Police
Station under Sections 21(c)/29 of the ND&PS Act.
AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 Page |3
2. Heard Mr. M. Devananda, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Lenin Hijam, the learned
Advocate General for the respondents.
3. The case of the prosecution is that on 20.4.2022 at about 2.00 a.m., one Md. Ajmir Hussain of
Lilong Leijaokhong MathakLeikai came to Md. Aslam Khan and informed that Md. Ershad Khan
was arrested by a team of Narcotic Cell, Imphal East led by ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman (petitioner in
A.B.No.27 of 2022). Thereafter, Aslam Khan and the father of Ershad Khan went for Canchipur and
on reaching Palahanbi, Canchipur area, they met ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman of Narcotic Cell and
had a talk with him. At that time, ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman demanded Rs. 5 lakh for releasing
accused Ershad Khan and the seized drugs (brown sugar). But, after a long discussion, the amount
demanded was settled at Rs.1.5 lakh for releasing of Ershad Khan and the drugs. Thereafter, the
father of Ershad Khan called Md. Ajmir Hussain for delivering the said amount of Rs.1.5 lakh to him
for releasing his son.
4. Further case of the prosecution is that Md. Ajmir Hussain went to the house of Ajmir Huissain @
Ethem asking him to deliver the amount of Rs.1 lakh to Yahaya Khan at Palahanbi. Accordingly, Md.
Ajmir Huissain @ Ethem went to deliver the AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 Page |4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54215409/ 2
Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
amount of Rs.1 lakh to Md. Yahaya Khan at Lilong Bazaar. The said amount was delivered as part of
Rs.1.5 lakh demanded by the ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman for releasing Ershad Khan and the drugs.
The father of Ershad Khan borrowed a sum of Rs.50,000/- from one of his friends Md. Hibjur
Rahaman, who lent him Rs.50,000/-. Thereafter, he along with the father of Ershad Khan went to
Palahanbi and met ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman and given the amount to him.
5. According to the prosecution, after receiving Rs.1.5 lakh, ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman of Narcotic
Cell, Imphal East released Ershad Khan, however, the seized drugs were not delivered back to them.
ASI Tamijur Rahaman told them that if they want to get the drugs back, they have to deliver a sum
of Rs.50,000/- more and for that they have been directed to met ASI Md. Rizwan (petitioner in
A.B.No.28 of 2022). As per the direction of ASI Tamijur Rahaman, they paid Rs.50,000/- to ASI
Md. Rizwan (petitioner in A.B.No.28 of 2022).
6. The case of the petitioners is that they are discharging their duty with the instruction of their
higher officers and even arrested many drug users and drug sellers in the State of Manipur by
registering many FIRs and in fact many accused are in judicial custody now. According to the
petitioners, appreciating AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 Page |5 the duty performed by the
petitioners, they were given incentive award by the State Government. Further case of the
petitioners is that they are innocent and have been falsely implicated in this case with the collusion
of the original accused involved. The investigating authority has falsely levelled allegation against
the petitioners that they are acting as transporter of the drug suppliers. Thus, the petitioners are
apprehending arrest in the hands of the respondent police and hence, they have filed the
anticipatory bail applications.
7. Mr. Devananda, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that a team of Narcotic Cell,
Imphal East led by the petitioner in A.B.No.27 of 2022 never arrested Md. Ershad Khan on
22.4.2022 as alleged and that the petitioner Md. Tamijur Rahaman never met the father of Ershad
Khan on 22.4.2022 at 1.30 a.m. for releasing Md. Ershad Khan and had also never asked money for
his releasing.
8. The learned counsel further submitted that on 24.4.2022, the petitioner Md. Rizwan (petitioner
in A.B.No.28 of 2022) left Imphal to Delhi for his father's heart operation and came back only on
12.5.2022. Thus, he has been falsely implicated in this case. He would submit that it is also clear that
the investigating officer has made a concocted story to make the petitioners as AB Nos. 27 of 2022 &
AB No. 28 of 2022 Page |6 accused in conspiracy with the two arrested accused, who are now in
judicial custody in order to take a revenge against the petitioners for discharging their duties in
combating the drug users and drug sellers in the State of Manipur.
9. The learned counsel next submitted that the allegation made by the investigating officer against
the petitioners is not correct meaning thereby that the concerned police station has not arrested Md.
Islauddin and Md. Ershad Khan till now, which would show that Md. Islauddin and Md. Ershad
Khan are innocent and there was no such incident as alleged on 22.4.2022 in the area of Lilong
Turel Ahanbi Khongnang Makhong Bridge for exchanging money with the petitioners.

Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
10. The learned counsel for the petitioners then submitted that earlier, the petitioners have filed
anticipatory bail applications before the learned Sessions Judge, Thoubal and the same were
rejected holding that there is very highly possible that the petitioners would hamper/tamper the
investigation of the case. According to the learned counsel, such a conclusion arrived at by the
learned Sessions Judge is erroneous and without basis.
11. The learned counsel for the petitioners urged that the investigating officer of Lilong Police
Station has nothing to do with AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 Page |7 the present
petitioners, as the registration of FIR No.29(05)2022 is for the arrest of two accused, namely Md.
Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem and Md. Ajmir Hussain with drugs of brown sugar from the custody of Md.
Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem and not with the arrest of Md. Ershad Khan. In fact, the petitioners or by a
team of Narcotic Cell never arrested Md. Ershad Khan While so, the Lilong Police are trying to
arrest the petitioners in the FIR No.29(05)2022 pending on its file. Thus, a prayer is made to grant
anticipatory bail to the petitioners.
12. Per contra, Mr. Lenin Hijam, the learned Advocate General assisted by Mr. H. Samarjit, learned
Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondents submitted that FIR No.29(05)2022 of Lilong Police
Station is under active investigation and the role of the petitioners abusing their official position is
well established not only from the statements of the arrested accused, but also supported by the
independent witnesses. He would submit that there is a concrete evidence of involvement of the
petitioners in receiving money for release of Ershad Khan. In fact, their official position has been
misused by the petitioners for their personal gain and to destroy the society through drugs.
13. The learned Advocate General further submitted that detailed interrogation of the petitioners is
highly required, as the AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 Page |8 offences charged against the
accused are serious and grave offences and that the petitioners are not ordinary citizens but police
officers entrusted with powers to curve the drug menace which is presently destroying the youth and
the future of the State of Manipur. Thus, a prayer is made to dismiss the anticipatory bail
applications.
14. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
15. The sum and substance of the allegation levelled against the petitioners is that they acted as
transporters of the drug suppliers by receiving amount from them. Furthermore, they received
amount for the release of one Ershad Khan, who is also stated to be involved in the
transportation/selling of brown sugar.
16. As could be seen from the records, FIR No.29(05)2022 of Lilong Police Station was registered
under Sections 21(c)/29 of the ND&PS Act based on the written report submitted by the
complainant SI M.Badal Singh of CDO-IW on 16.5.2022. Pursuant to the said report, teams of CDO,
Imphal West led by the complainant under the supervision of M.Amit Singh MPS, ASP (Ops) rushed
to the area in question after giving prior information to Thoubal District Police Control Room and
AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 Page |9 conducted cordon and search operation. In the
course of search, when they searched the house of Md. Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem, they found one
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54215409/ 4
Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
suspected black plastic polythene bag inside his bed room and on further questioning, he stated that
it is brown sugar weighing approximately 1 kg. and also stated that the same was given to him by his
neighbour Md. Ajmir Hussain. Immediately, the respondent police arrested the aforesaid two
persons.
17. During investigation, the accused Md. Ajmir Hussain implicated Md.Islauddin, who in turn
implicated Md. Ershad Khan. On 22.5.2022, when the investigating officer was with Md. Zahaya
Khan, Ershad Khan contacted over phone to his father Md. Zahaya Khan and informed that he was
arrested by Narcotic Cell personnel led by ASI Tamijur Rahaman (petitioner in A.B.No.27 of 2022).
When the father of Ershad Khan approached the petitioner in A.B.No.27 of 2022 for release of
Ershad Khan, he demanded Rs.5 lakh and after negotiation, a sum of Rs.1.5 lakh was agreed and
accordingly the said sum was given to ASI Tamijur Rahaman. Though after receipt of the amount,
ASI Tamijur Rahaman released Ershad Khan, the seized drug was not returned back and the
petitioner ASI Tamijur Rahaman directed to contact the petitioner in A.B.No.28 of 2022 (ASI Md.
Rizwan) for release of AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 10 drugs and in the course
of discussion, Md. Rizwan demanded Rs.50,000/- for release of drugs.
18. The grievance of the petitioners is that they are innocent and they have not committed any
offence as alleged by the prosecution. The petitioners have also stated that they have discharged
their duties with the instruction of their superior officers. It is also stated that the petitioners
arrested many drug users and drug sellers, for which they have been given many incentive awards.
In support, the learned counsel for the petitioners has produced a letter dated 10.12.2021 addressed
by the Inspector General of Police (Admn) to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur
recommending cash reward along with commendation certificates of Hon'ble Chief Minister of
Manipur for busting brown sugar making factory with large quantity of suspected brown sugar and
its raw materials. On a perusal of the said letter along with its annexure, this Court finds that only
the rank wise break-up for the proposed distribution has been stated and no specific name of the
officers has been mentioned. In view of the above, the petitioners cannot contend that they have
been recommended by the Police Department for cash reward appreciating their duties and the
letter dated 10.12.2021 is not helpful to the case of the petitioners.
AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 11
19. The fact remains that on 16.5.2022 based on the reliable information from the complainant's
own source about the presence of smugglers dealing with arms and ammunition at Lilong
Leihaokhong area, teams of CDO Imphal West led by the complainant SI M.Badal Singh of CDO-IW
under the supervision of the then ASP (Ops) rushed to Lilong Leihaokhong area and conducted a
search. While searching the house of accused Md. Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem, the team recovered
black plastic polythene bag containing brown sugar weighing approximately 1 kg. On enquiry, the
accused Md. Ajmir Hussain admitted that it was given to him by Md. Ajmir Hussain, son of Md.
Siraj Ahmed. Immediately, the team rushed to the house of Md. Ajmir Hussain and arrested him.
On questioning, he admitted the statement as disclosed by Md. Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem and he
further stated that the brown sugar has been handed over to him by one Md. Islauddin to sell to
willing customers. The arrested two accused namely Md. Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem and Md. Ajmir
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54215409/ 5
Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
Hussain were interrogated and recorded their statements one after another by the investigating
officer.
20. That apart, accused Md. Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem disclosed that accused Md. Ajmir Hussain
came to his residence and informed that his son-in-law Md. Ershad Khan was arrested AB Nos. 27 of
2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 12 by a team of Narcotic Cell led by ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman
from Rurel Ahanbi Khongnang Makhong Bridge and Md. Ajmir Hussain requested Md. Ajmir
Hussain @ Ethem to deliver a sum of Rs.1 lakh at Lilong Bazar to handover it to his younger brother
Md. Aslam Khan who was with Md. Zahaya Khan (father of Ershad Khan) for release of Ershad
Khan who was arrested along with brown sugar by a team led by ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman
(petitioner in A.B.No.27 of 2022).
21. The statements of Md. Ajmir Hussain @ Ethem and Md. Ajmir Hussain are prima facie disclose
that the petitioner ASI Md. Tamijur Rahaman demanded money for releasing Ershad Khan and the
brown sugar. Md. Ajmir Hussain and the father of Ershad Khan have given Rs.1.5 lakh to ASI Md.
Tamijur Rahaman and upon receipt of the said sum, Ershad Khan was released, however, the drugs
were not released. But the petitioner in A.B.No.27 of 2022 directed to contact ASI Rizwan
(petitioner in A.B.No.28 of 2022) to get the drugs. When the father of Ershad Khan contacted the
petitioner in A.B.No.28 of 2022, he demanded Rs.50,000/- for giving back the drugs.
22. The aforesaid version of the prosecution prima facie reveals that the petitioner in A.B.No.27 of
2022 who was posted at Narcotic Cell, Imphal East and the petitioner in A.B.No.28 of 2022 AB Nos.
27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 13 who was posted at Moreh Police Station are involved in
the commission oftransporting and delivering of the narcotic drug and psychotropic substances
which has been seized in connection with FIR No.29(05)2022. Both the petitioners have demanded
money for release of the apprehended accused and the drugs. Since the involvement of the
petitioners have been prima facie established by the prosecution, they are required to be arrested in
the present case to find out the truth and also to arrest all the accused persons involved in the
possession and smuggling of the drugs.
23. It is also the case of the prosecution that the petitioners are evading arrest despite diligent
search including the house search by the investigating authority. It is also the case of the
prosecution that despite message sent to the concerned officers-in-charge directing the petitioners
who were serving as ASI in Manipur Police Department to appear before the investigating officer,
they were not responded to the message nor produced by the concerned officers-in-charge till date.
The attempt to effect arrest of the petitioners, who were under suspension has also failed and the
petitioners have been absconding to evade police arrest.
AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 14
24. The materials produced by the prosecution prima facie disclose that the petitioners herein were
actively involved in this heinous crime of drug transportation/smuggling and otherwise supporting
the arrested accused involved in the drug smuggling by receiving amount for their release. A
detailed interrogation statement of the petitioners could not be recorded completely in connection
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54215409/ 6
Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
with the present case and in fact the petitioners are concealing the facts of the crime to escape from
the liability of the offence by saying false story.
25. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that in the case of Nathu Singh V. State of Uttar Pradesh,
reported in 2021 CRI. L.J. 2593 : AIR Online 2021 SC 260, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the
discretionary power of the Court under Section 438 Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised in an untrammelled
manner. In paragraph 25, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
"25. However, such discretionary power cannot be exercised in an untrammelled
manner. The Court must take into account the statutory scheme under section 438
Cr.P.C. particularly, the proviso to section 438(1) Cr.P.C., and balance the concerns of
the investigating agency, complainant and the society at large with the
concerns/interest of the applicant. Therefore, AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of
2022 P a g e | 15 such an order must necessarily be narrowly tailored to protect the
interests of the applicant while taking into consideration the concerns of the
investigating authority. Such an order must be a reasoned one"
26. In the instant case, even though the petitioners could not be spotted, the arrest of the two
accused and their statements and also collection of materials, particularly, against the petitioners, a
prima facie case has been made out against them. It would not be appropriate to discuss all those
materials in great detail at this stage.
27. Earlier, the petitioners approached the learned Sessions Judge, Thoubal by filing Cril. Misc. (AB)
Case Nos.47 and 48 of 2022 for anticipatory bail. Initially, by the order dated 21.05.2022, the
learned Sessions Judge granted interim pre- arrest bail, however, by the order dated 23.05.2022,
the learned Sessions Judge dismissed both the petitions holding that the petitioners are police
officers and therefore, it is highly possible that they would hamper/tamper the investigation of the
case. The learned Sessions Judge, while rejecting the anticipatory bail applications has considered
the case and has rightly rejected the same. This Court finds no error in the order of the learned AB
Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 16 Sessions Judge. This Court is also the firm view
that the learned Sessions Judge was right in holding that it is highly possible that the petitioners
would hamper/tamper the investigation of the case influencing their official capacity.
28. The statement of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners are always ready to
cooperate with the investigation as and when necessary and question of arresting them does not
arise at this juncture cannot be countenanced for the reason that in the facts and circumstances and
the position they held, the petitioners will not co-operate with the investigation and there is every
chance to hamper/tamper the investigation.
29. Though there is no direct proof to show that the petitioners have received Rs.1.5 lakh for the
release of Ershad Khan, the phone call summaries of the petitioners with the arrested accused
produced by the learned Advocate General during the course of arguments prima facie prove that
the petitioners had contacted the accused person, particularly Ershad Khan, his father Md. Zahaya
Khan and Md. Islauddin. Thus, the prosecution has prima facie established the involvement of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54215409/ 7
Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
petitioners with the crime.
AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 17
30. The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the gravity of the charge alone cannot be a
decisive ground to deny anticipatory bail when there is no good reason to apprehend the arrest of
the petitioners. As stated supra, the involvement of the petitioners in releasing Ershad Khan by
receiving the amount has been established by the prosecution. Therefore, the argument of the
learned counsel for the petitioners that there is no good reason to apprehend the arrest of the
petitioners in the crime does not merit acceptance.
31. In so far as the grant or refusal of the anticipatory bail is concerned, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetrevs State of Maharashtra & Ors. (2011) 1 SCC 694 has
laid down the parameters asunder:
"112. The following factors and parameters can betaken into consideration while
dealing with the anticipatory bail:
(i) The nature and gravity of the accusation and the exact role of the accused must be
properly comprehended before arrest is made;
(ii) The antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether the accused has
AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 18 previously undergone
imprisonment on conviction by a Court in respect of any cognizable offence;
(iii) The possibility of the applicant to flee from justice;
(iv) The possibility of the accused's likelihood to repeat similar or the other offences.
(v) Where the accusations have been made only with the object of injuring or
humiliating the applicant by arresting him or her.
(vi) Impact of grant of anticipatory bail particularly incases of large magnitude
affecting a very large number of people.
(vii) The courts must evaluate the entire available material against the accused very
carefully.
The court must also clearly comprehend the exact role of the accused in the case. The cases in which
accused is implicated with the help of sections 34 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code, the court should
consider with even greater care and caution because over AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P
a g e | 19 implication in the cases is a matter of common knowledge and concern;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54215409/ 8
Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
(viii) While considering the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail, a balance has to be struck between
two factors namely, no prejudice should be caused to the free, fair and full investigation and there
should be prevention of harassment, humiliation and unjustified detention of the accused;
(ix) The court to consider reasonable apprehension of tampering of the witness or apprehension of
threat to the complainant;
(x) Frivolity in prosecution should always be considered and it is only the element of genuineness
that shall have to be considered in the matter of grant of bail and in the event of there being some
doubt as to the genuineness of the prosecution, in the normal course of events, the accused is
entitled to an order of bail."
32. Further in the case of Jai Prakash Singh vs. State of Bihar,(2012) 4 SCC 379, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 20 elucidated the principles for
consideration of anticipatory bail which are as under:
"19. Parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in a serious offence are required to be
satisfied and further while granting such relief, the court must record the reasons
therefor. Anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where
the court is prima facie of the view that the applicant has falsely been enroped in the
crime and would not misuse his liberty. (See D.K.Ganesh Babu v. P.T. Manokaran &
Ors., (2007) 4 SCC 434,State of Maharashtra v. Mohd.
Sajid Husain Mohd. S.Husain, (2008) 1 SCC 213, and Union of India v. Padam Narain Aggarwal,
(2008) 13 SCC 305)."
33. Having considered the given facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in mind the
parameters laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgments cited above and also the
gravity of the offence, this Court is of the view that the petitioners cannot be granted anticipatory
bail in this case.
34. Section 8(c) of the NDPS Act lays down that no person shall produce, manufacture, possess, sell,
purchase, transport, warehouse, use, consume, import inter-State, export inter-State, import into
India, export from India or transit any AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 21 narcotic
drug or psychotropic substance, except for medical or scientific purpose and in the manner and to
the extend provided by the provisions of the Act. Section 22 of the Act is the penal provision which
provides that whoever, in contravention of any provision of the Act or any rule or order made or
condition of license granted thereunder, manufactures, possesses, sells, purchases, transports,
imports inter-State, exports inter-State or uses any psychotropic substance, shall be punishable with
imprisonment.
35. At the end, it would also be appropriate to mention that in a recent decision in the case of
Gurudev Singh v. State of Punjab, reported in 2021 SCC OnLine SC 285, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that "persons dealing with narcotic drugs are hazard to the society and therefore, while
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54215409/ 9
Lilong vs The Officer-In-Charge on 5 August, 2022
awarding the sentence/punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is
required to be taken in consideration". In the said decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court also
observed that "in a murder case, the accused commits murder of one or two persons, while those
persons who are dealing in narcotic drugs are instruments in causing death or in inflicting death
blow to number of innocent young victims AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 22 who
are vulnerable; it cause deleterious effects and deadly impact on the society; they are hazard to the
society".
36. In the instant case, as stated supra, being police officer who was holding the post of ASI in the
Narcotic Cell, the petitioner in A.B.No.27 of 2022 and the petitioner in A.B.No.28 of 2022 who was
attached with Moreh Police Station as ASI themselves helped the accused persons for illegal
possession and transportation of drugs and even for their release by receiving amount from them.
The act of the petitioners correlates to the old adage which says "as if the fence itself grazed the
crop". Such type of police officers cannot be extended any relief and they will have to face the
criminal case and its consequence.
37. An anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where the Court is prima
facie of the view that the applicant has falsely been implicated in the crime and would not misuse his
liberty. Here, it is a case where taking the advantage of the positions held as Assistant Sub
Inspectors of Police in the Narcotic Cell and in the Police Station respectively, the petitioners have
helped in possession and transportation/smuggling of the narcotic drugs by the accused persons.
Evaluating the entire materials produced by the parties, this Court is of the view that this is not a
case falling under the AB Nos. 27 of 2022 & AB No. 28 of 2022 P a g e | 23 exceptional
circumstances. Therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to seek the relief prayed for by them and,
accordingly, the anticipatory bail applications of the petitioners are liable to be dismissed.
38. In the result, the anticipatory bail applications are dismissed. The interim order granted by this
Court is vacated. The petitioners are directed to surrender before the concerned investigating officer
within a week from today.
39. At the end, it is to be mentioned that in the State of Manipur drugs smuggling is alarming. The
Hon'ble Chief Minister of this State has announced in the recent meeting a complete eradication of
