ORDER
02. 06.04.2021 This matter is taken up by video conferencing mode.
The petitioners in this case apprehending their arrest in Barang P.S. Case No.58 of 2021
corresponding to G.R. Case No.593 of 2021 on the file of learned S.D.J.M., Cuttack, registered for
alleged commission of offences punishable under Sections 341/323/354/506/34 of the I.P.C., have
filed this petition for their release on pre-arrest bail.
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for the State.
Perused the allegations made in the F.I.R. On consideration of the allegations made in the F.I.R. and
also the submissions made, especially the nature and character of allegations, circumstances in
which the offences stated to have been committed and also it being not disputed that the petitioners'
release on pre-arrest bail shall not be a hindrance to the free and fair investigation, this Court is of
the view that the petitioners have made out a case for their release on pre- arrest bail, more
particularly when they are ready and willing to cooperate with the investigation and they have no
chance of absconding and/or tampering with the prosecution evidence, if released on pre-arrest bail.
Hence, this Court directs that in the event of arrest of the petitioners in connection with the
aforesaid case, they be released on bail by the Officer effecting arrest on such terms and conditions
as deemed just and proper.
However, the aforesaid order is subject to the condition that the petitioners shall cooperate with the

The ABLAPL is, accordingly, disposed of being allowed.
