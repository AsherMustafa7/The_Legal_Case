State Of U.P. Thru Addl. Chief Secy. ... vs Kanhaiya Singh on 30 April, 2025
5. The present intra-court appeal filed by the appellant-State under Chapter VIII Rule 5 of the High
Court Rules is directed against the judgment/order rendered by the writ court in Writ A No. 6226 of
2023 on 16.1.2025, whereby, the writ petition was allowed and the punishment order dated
12.07.2022 was set aside.
6. While the respondent-employee was working as Van Daroga, a plantation drive was carried out
during the period 2010 to 2013 and allegedly, several trees planted during the plantation drive were
found dead. Consequently, on initiation of disciplinary proceedings, a charge-sheet dated
20.12.2013 was served on the petitioner. In order to give proper reply, the respondent-employee
moved representation on 24.01.2014 demanding copies of certain documents but the same were not
provided to him. In absence of the relevant documents, respondent chose not to file a reply to the
charge-sheet. The enquiry officer submitted inquiry report on 26.3.2015 holding respondent guilty
of the charges. When the enquiry report was submitted to the Disciplinary Authority, he issued a
show cause notice to the respondent on 31.3.2015 along-with a copy of the enquiry report to which
respondent submitted his reply on 9.4.2015. After considering the relevant material available with
the Disciplinary Authority, he passed the order of punishment on 28.11.2015 whereby three
increments were withheld in addition to recovery of Rs. 1,99,333.00 together with a censure entry.
When the departmental appeal was filed against the punishment order dated 28.11.2015, it was
dismissed by the Appellate Authority on 4.5.2016.
7. Being aggrieved, the respondent employee preferred a claim petition being Claim Petition no. 953
of 2017 against the punishment order imposing major penalty as also the order of the Appellate
Authority dated 04.05.2015 before the U.P. Public Services Tribunal. The Tribunal quashed the
orders impugned in the Claim Petition with all consequential benefits. However, it was left open for
the Disciplinary Authority to initiate departmental enquiry afresh against the appellant from the
stage of oral enquiry within a period of two months. Further, it was directed that in case the
Disciplinary Authority decides to imitate enquiry afresh,it should be completed within a period of
next three months.
8. Since the inquiry proceedings could not be concluded within the period as stipulated by the
tribunal, the same were concluded with the fresh punishment order dated 12.7.2023 which was not
different than the earlier order of punishment passed on 31.3.2015. In the meantime, the
respondent-employee is stated to have retired from service on 31.7.2022.
9. The respondent-employee challenged the punishment order dated 12.7.2022 before this Court by
filing a writ petition i.e. Writ A No. 6226 of 2023 which was allowed and the punishment order
dated 12.7.2022 was set aside. The State-appellant feeling aggrieved against the order passed by the
writ court had filed Special Appeal Defective No. 457 of 2024 which was allowed by restoring the
writ petition to its original number observing that while allowing the writ petition, the Writ Court
has not considered the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in the case of Union of India
and others versus Sharvan Kumar reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 2032. So the Writ Court was
directed to be decided afresh keeping in view the above judgment as also the provisions of Rule 7 of
the U.P. Government Servant(discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1999.

10. On restoring the writ petition, the writ court reconsidered the matter in the light of judgment
passed by a Division Bench of this Court in Special Appeal Defective No. 457 of 2024 and allowed
the writ petition vide impugned judgment and order dated 16.01.2025 observing that there was
gross violation of principles of natural justice as the procedure prescribed under Rule 7 of the U.P.
Government Servant(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1999 had not been followed. The Court also
opined that the punishment order itself was erroneous inasmuch as the same was an amalgamation
of minor and major penalties.
11. Learned counsel for the appellant-State has stated that the writ court has committed an error in
holding that the inquiry against the respondent was conducted in gross violation of principle of
natural justice.
12. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the report of the
inquiry officer, as has been noticed in the order passed by the tribunal shows that that neither any
date, time and place was fixed by the inquiry officer nor any oral evidence was led to prove the
charges. It is also recorded that only on the basis of the certain documentary evidence, the employee
was held guilty of the charges and therefore it was a clear case of denial of reasonable opportunity to
the respondent to place his defence. The tribunal has referred to Rule 7 of the Rules, 1999 and also
the legal position that even in a situation where the delinquent employee does not submit any reply
to the charge-sheet, the inquiry officer is not absolved of his duty to record oral evidence and to
provide an opportunity to the delinquent employee to adduce evidence in his defence.
13. Considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties. In the present case, the
enquiry officer failed to fix any date, place or time in the conduct of inquiry and no witness having
been examined to support the charges levelled against the respondent employee makes it amply
clear that the respondent has been condemned unheard. The entire proceedings, carried out in
violation of principles of natural justice and total disregard of procedural fairness have rightly been
held by the writ court to be vitiated.
14. Since the punishment order had been passed in contravention of the relevant rules and the
procedure prescribed, the questions as to whether the disciplinary proceedings as directed by the
tribunal have been concluded within the stipulated period or not becomes irrelevant. It is a basic
requirement that an employee should be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in any
proceeding which may culminate into a minor or major punishment. The object of rules of natural
justice is to ensure that an employee is given a reasonable opportunity to put his defence in the
disciplinary proceedings which may entail imposition of major punishment.
15. It has been consistently held that a departmental inquiry against government servant is not to be
treated as a casual exercise and the principles of natural justice are required to be served so as to
ensure not only that justice is done but is manifestly seen to have been done. The object being to
ensure that the delinquent is treated fairly in the proceedings which may culminate in imposition of
a major penalty against him.

16. It is well settled that reasonable opportunity to a delinquent employee to putforth his defence is
an essential concomitant of principles of natural justice as well as due procedure of law. Since the
departmental proceedings were culminated in gross violation of procedure prescribed under the
Rules, 1999 and, therefore, the order of punishment has rightly been held to be legally unsustainable
by the writ court.
17. For all these reasons, we do not find any good ground to entertain this intra-court appeal.
18. The Special Appeal lacks merit and is accordingly rejected.
