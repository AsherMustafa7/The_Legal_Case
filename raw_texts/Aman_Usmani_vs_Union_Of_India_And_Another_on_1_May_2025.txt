4. Co-ordinate Bench in paragraph 21 of Pawan Kumar Rajbhar (supra) recorded fair statement
made by learned Additional Solicitor General of India (A.S.G.I.) that there is no reason to withhold
issuance, renewal or reissue of a passport. Furthermore, in paragraph 27 of the co-ordinate Bench
discussed pendency of criminal case or cases or FIR registered, in which applicant, inter alia, for
reissuance of passport has been mentioned as accused. There again fair statement made by learned
A.S.G.I. was recorded, regarding cases where any NCR may be registered, the necessary passport
may be issued, reissued, renewed, as the case may be, without any delay. No permission may be
sought or required from the competent Court of criminal jurisdiction, in those cases.
5. The view as was taken by co-ordinate Bench covers petitioner's claim in the writ petition.
Concerned respondent as may be respondent no.2 or any other is directed to forthwith deal with the
application of petitioner, for issuance of passport in terms of Pawan Kumar Rajbhar (supra). In
event the application is to be rejected, petitioner must be informed of the reasons within four weeks
of communication of certified copy of this order. It also goes without saying, otherwise the passport
must be issued within aforesaid period.
