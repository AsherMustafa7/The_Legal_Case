Hon'ble Mrs. Sangeeta Chandra, J.
1. This writ petition has been filed by the petitioners Sunita Nishad and her husband Om Prakash,
challenging the order dated 22.10.2019 passed by the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Allahabad,
(DRAT) in Appeal No.18 of 2018, filed by the Bank of Baroda through which the order dated
20.08.2018 passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Lucknow (hereinafter referred to as "DRT") has
been set aside and auction sale dated 11.12.2017 and possession notice dated 05.10.2016 has been
affirmed and physical possession of House No. 13/88, Sector-13, Indira Nagar Vistar Yojna,

Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
petition. The petitioners had earlier filed Writ Petition No. 31115 (MB) of 2017 before this Court
challenging the auction notice dated 11.12.2017, which petition was disposed off by this Court
directing the petitioners to approach the DRT as the proceedings were under the SARFAESI Act.
2. The brief facts necessary for deciding the case, as mentioned in the Writ Petition No. 35050 of
2019 are that the State Government launched a scheme called "Kamdhenu Dairy Scheme" with
intention to promote dairy farming in the State of U.P. to maintain its status as the highest milk
producing state in the country. One Jai Prakash, the brother of petitioner no.2 and the
brother-in-law of the petitioner no.1, applied for a term loan of five years and was sanctioned Rs.90
lakhs by the Bank of Baroda under the State Sponsored Scheme. The petitioner no.1 and the
petitioner no.2 being relatives of the borrower Jai Prakash and already being customers of Bank of
Baroda, Gomti Nagar Branch, were shown as guarantors of the loan fraudulently by the bank, which
used the original papers relating to petitioner's jointly owned property at Indira Nagar, which was
already mortgaged to the bank in a housing loan, as surety for the agricultural loan of the borrower.
It has been stated in paragraph 10 to 13 that the petitioner no.1 was never consulted by the bank, nor
did she sign any papers for extension of mortgage and she never stood as guarantor or surety for the
loan taken by Jai Prakash. Petitioner no.1 and petitioner no.2 had taken a housing loan from HDFC
Bank on 30.07.2011 of Rs.32 lakhs for buying the house situated at Indira Nagar and the loan had to
be repaid with interest to HDFC initially, but due to lower rate of interest being offered by Bank of
Baroda, the petitioners got their loan transferred on 23.01.2015 to the respondent no.3, Bank of
Baroda, which granted them a loan of Rs.29,50,000 and the papers relating to the house situated at
Indira Nagar were submitted by the petitioners to the said bank in January, 2015 itself. In March
2015, when Jai Prakash applied for loan of Rs.90,00,000 under Kamdhenu Dairy Scheme, the
papers relating to Indira Nagar House property had already been deposited in the bank as the house
was mortgaged for repayment of housing loan, which had to be done in 217 monthly installments.
The loan account of the borrower Jai Prakash Yadav was declared NPA by the bank on 30.06.2016
and a Demand Notice was issued under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act on 21.07.2016.
3. It has been stated that the petitioner no.1 never received such Demand Notice under Section 13(2)
of the SARFAESI Act. On 05.10.2016, possession notice was issued by the bank under Section 13(4)
of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 and it took symbolic possession of the property, but no such notice was
ever served upon petitioner no.1, and the petitioner had no knowledge of taking over of the property
by the bank. On 27.01.2017, a letter of redemption was sent by the bank to the petitioners through
speed post. Thereafter summons were issued by the District Magistrate, Lucknow under Section 14
of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, on 21.03.2017.
4. It has been stated that the petitioners filed their objections, but they were not considered and the
house property at Indira Nagar was put up for auction. The bank failed to comply with Rule 8(6)(a)
of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules of 2002),
which specifically provides that publication of auction sale notice shall include details of
encumbrances on the property known to the secured creditor. The bank was well aware that there
was a housing loan of Rs.29 lakhs pending against the said property, which was the primary charge
and details of such encumbrance was not published.

5. The petitioners filed Writ Petition No. 31115 (MB) of 2017 at Lucknow challenging the Auction
Sale Notice dated 11.12.2017, which was disposed of by this court, directing the petitioners to
approach the DRT. The petitioners filed an application under Section 17 (1) of the Act of 2002 before
the DRT Lucknow and after pleadings were exchanged, the Securitisation Application No.19 of 2018
was allowed by the DRT by its order dated 20.08.2018, a copy of which has been filed as
annexure-12 to the petition.
6. It has been submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the Securitisation Application No. 19 of
2018 was allowed by the DRT after recording a specific finding that the Demand Notice issued under
Section 13(2) of the Act of 2002 was not served upon petitioner no.1. The postal receipt submitted
by the bank was issued in the name of one 'Savita' and not Sunita. The DRT observed that the bank
should have gathered more proof of service, instead of placing reliance upon postal receipt dated
25.07.2016, which was in the name of 'Savita' and not Smt. Sunita Nishad. The DRT while placing
reliance upon the Rule 3(4) of the Rules of 2002, which required that the Demand Notice should be
served upon each borrower individually where there were more than one borrowers; was of the
opinion that the Demand Notice was served only upon the husband of the petitioner no.1 Om
Prakash, and not on Sunita Nishad although the property was jointly owned by husband and wife.
The DRT also observed that mere producing of postal receipt in support of having dispatched the
notice under Section 13(2) is not sufficient to have established that the communication was actually
delivered to the addressee. Due to non-compliance of of Rule 3(4) of the Rules of 2002, the entire
action initiated by the respondent bank was void ab initio, and therefore, the possession notice
dated 05.10.2016 and the E-auction sale notice published by the bank were also vitiated on the
ground that the possession notice was dispatched to the petitioners through registered post on
05.10.2016 and symbolic possession was taken by the bank on 05.10.2016 itself. Such action was
against the law settled by the High Court of Karnataka in the case of K.R. Krishna Gowda and
Another Vs. Chief Manager/Authorised Officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank reported in
Manu/KA/0689/2012, where the Karnataka High Court observed that in order to enable the
borrower to know the date on which possession would be taken by the secured creditor Rules(1) and
(2) of Rule 8 would have to be complied with by issuance of notices indicating the date on which
possession would be taken. The DRT observed further that Special Leave Petition preferred by
Kotak Mahindra Bank was dismissed by the Supreme Court hence the judgement rendered by
Karnataka High Court stood affirmed about service of possession notice prior to actual taking of
symbolic possession.
7. It was also observed by the DRT that auction sale notice published by the respondent bank did not
mention the encumbrances already existing on the secured asset proposed to be sold in terms Rule
8(6) of the Rules of 2002, Sunita Nishad being a joint owner of the secured asset along with her
husband Om Prakash, had taken a housing loan on the property earlier from the bank, which was
not mentioned in the sale notice. Consequently, since the bank had failed to prove service of demand
notice dated 21.07.2016, on Sunita Nishad hence, the entire consequential action taken by the
respondent bank under the SARFAESI Act of 2002 was vitiated and void ab initio.
8. It has further been stated that the bank being aggrieved filed an appeal before the DRAT, which
was allowed mainly on three grounds. It was observed that even though notice was sent indicating a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 3
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
wrong name of 'Savita' instead of Sunita Nishad it can be considered to be a typographical error of
the postal department and notice shall be treated to have been duly sent as it was not returned
undelivered. Such notice will be deemed to have been served upon petitioner no.1 as it was
addressed, not only to petitioner no.1, but also to her husband Om Prakash, who was living at the
same address. The Securitisation Application was filed by both husband and wife. The pleading in
the Securitisation Application was only for non-receipt of notice by the the applicant no.1, Smt.
Sunita Nishad. It is sufficient to infer that the notices were served to both husband and wife as they
were dispatched to one and the same address and her husband, Om Prakash did not allege that such
notice was never served upon him, and even the notice sent to Sunita Nishad did not return
unserved.
9. It has also been observed by the DRAT that non-service of prior notice of taking symbolic
possession under Section 13(4) is also of no consequence once summons were issued under the
provisions of Section 14 of the Act by the District Magistrate. The DRAT also observed that in view
of the judgment rendered by the Supreme Court in Standard Chartered Bank Vs. V. Noble Kumar,
2013 (9) SCC 620; there was no necessity to serve any notice before taking over symbolic possession
of the property. The DRAT placed reliance upon a judgement rendered by this court at Allahabad in
Writ-C No. 9731 of 2019, 'M/s Mahesh Industries Private Limited and Others Vs. Karur Vyasa Bank
Limited', on 08.08.2019, where relying upon Noble Kumar (supra), this Court had observed that
there is no requirement for issuance of any notice to the borrower for the proposed date of taking
possession. The secured creditor is under no obligation to intimate to the borrower/guarantor
before taking symbolic possession of the property.
10. The DRAT has allowed the appeal of the bank also on the ground that the applicants had created
an extended mortgage of property for securing the loan granted to their relative Jai Prakash, who
was the Borrower. The extended mortgage letter dated 07.05.2015 was signed by both Sunita Nishad
and her husband Om Prakash, and therefore, Sunita Nishad could not be permitted to say that she
had not given any guarantee for securing the loan taken by Jai Prakash. As per Rule 8(6), the
secured creditor is required to mention encumbrances in the sale notice, but in this case the
properties were primarily mortgaged against the housing loan granted to Sunita Nishad and her
husband by Bank of Baroda itself and since no mention regarding such housing loan was made in
the demand notice, it was apparent that such housing loan was regular. Also, even if the
encumbrance was in existence, the property was mortgaged with the self same bank and
encumbrance was not of any third party (institution), hence if at all it caused any prejudice to the
rights of any party it was that of the bank alone. Non-mentioning of such encumbrance on the
properties in the sale notice was of no consequence and it could not be said that the bank had
committed such a grave irregularity as to vitiate the sale proceedings altogether.
11. Initially, when this petition was filed and taken up as fresh, the counsel for the petitioner had
argued that the requirement of Rule 13 of the Rules of 2002 had not been met and the Appellate
Tribunal had given a wrong finding regarding sufficiency of service of notice under Section 13. The
Court issue notice to the respondent and directed that till the next date of listing, the parties shall
maintain status quo. Such time interim order continued to be extended and counter affidavit was
filed by the respondent bank on 26.03.2021, along with an application for vacation of interim order.

Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
12. In the counter affidavit, the bank denied the claim of the petitioners in the writ petition and
stated that the petitioners have resorted to material concealment and misrepresentation in stating
on oath that they have not taken any guarantee in the term loan facility extended to Jai Prakash of
Rs.90 lakhs under the Kamdhenu Scheme. It was stated that earlier Writ-C No.16546 of 2021 was
filed by the borrower Jai Prakash before this court, praying for early disposal of his application for
recall dismissing Securitisation Application No. 15 of 2017 for want of prosecution. The High Court
disposed off Writ-C No. 16546 of 2021 on 07.04.2022 with direction to the DRT to decide the recall
as well as delay condonation application filed by Jai Prakash expeditiously, but before such order
was passed, the DRT had already disposed off both the applications by its order dated 04.04.2022
and Securitisation Application No. 15 of 2017 filed by Jai Prakash stood revived.
13. It was also stated in the counter affidavit of the bank that the Demand Notice dated 21.07.2016,
issued under Rule 13 (2) of the Act of 2002 was sent to the borrower and also to the guarantor
through registered speed post on 25.07.2017, which notice has not returned undelivered, and
therefore, service was deemed upon them. The bank took symbolic possession of the secured asset
on 05.10.2016 and summons were issued by the District Magistrate under Section 14 of the Act
which were affixed on a conspicuous place on the house property/secured asset as the
borrower/guarantor had refused to accept personal service of the same.
14. It has also been stated that the petitioners have admitted in paragraphs 3 and 15 of writ petition
that they had stood as guarantors for the loan facility extended to Jai Prakash. Kamdhenu Dairy
Loan is a commercial loan, which is granted to the borrower against some security. The borrower Jai
Prakash and the guarantors have executed the necessary documents in this regard by securing the
said term loan by extending guarantee of house property no. 13/88, Indira Nagar Vistar Yojna and a
plot situated at Sharda Nagar Raebareli Road Scheme, therefore, the bank could initiate recovery
proceedings under SARFAESI Act which relates to recovery of NPAs from secured assets held by the
creditor. Moreover, the Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Act, 1973 prohibits sale of agricultural
property, whereas the house property situated at Indira Nagar Vistar Yojna and the plot situated at
Sharda Nagar Raebareli Road Housing Scheme were not agricultural properties.
15. It has also been stated that after summons were issued under Section 14 of the Act of 2002 by the
District Magistrate, Lucknow. The petitioners did not file objections when orders were passed under
section 14 of the Act by the designated officer, the Bank had published auction notice on 18.11.2017,
in two leading newspapers, namely, Times of India and Amar Ujala as is required under the Act and
the Rules. The DRT had allowed the Securitisation Application of the petitioners on technical
grounds stating the Demand Notice remained unserved due to wrong mention of the name of the
petitioner no.1, the name of the petitioner no.1 was Sunita, but it was typed as 'Savita'. It has been
stated that the postal receipt issued in the name of 'Savita' had been issued for the notice which
showed the correct name and address of the guarantors. Both petitioner no.1 and petitioner no.2
were joint owners of the property. The Demand Notice sent through registered post has never been
received back undelivered, and therefore, service is deemed upon the petitioners. With regards to
taking over of symbolic possession, the bank has relied upon Standard Chartered Bank Vs. Noble
Kumar (supra), where the Supreme Court has observed that application under Section 14 of the Act
can be moved straight away after Demand Notice under Section 13(2) of the Act is issued.

16. The bank has also stated in its counter affidavit that there is no provision which requires the
bank to cancel the sale proceedings in case only one bid is received. Since the reserved price set by
the bank had been met by the bidder, the house property could be sold to such bidder. It was an
open bidding process and the petitioners were free to place a better offer in the auction.
17. In the rejoinder affidavit filed by the petitioners to the counter affidavit of the bank, it has been
stated that Writ-C No. 16546 of 2021 was filed by the borrower Jai Prakash without knowledge of
the petitioners. When the petitioners derived knowledge of the contents of the petition, they
objected to the same. Since Jai Prakash, the borrower was petitioner no.1's brother-in-law, he
admitted his mistake, but requested the petitioner no.1 not to deny the contents of the Writ Petition
No. 16546 of 2021. To protect him, she had stated in her Writ Petition No. 31115 (MB) of 2017 that
she was the guarantor in the loan extended to Jai Prakash. In fact, Writ Petition No. 31115 (MB) of
2017 was disposed of by this court by making no observations on merit, but with a direction to the
petitioners to approach the DRT under the SARFAESI Act. In such writ petition the petitioners had
made no admission of being guarantors for the term loan facility extended to Jai Prakash. The
petitioners had taken a housing loan of Rs. 29 lakhs from the Bank of Baroda to buy a house
property situated in Sector-13, Indira Nagar and mortgaged the said house to secure the loan. They
had not signed any document extending the guarantee in favour of Jai Prakash for securing his term
loan taken under Kamdhenu Dairy Scheme. However, the bank in collusion with the borrower Jai
Prakash had extended the guarantee which was never executed by the petitioners. As a result of such
fraudulent behaviour, the bank manager, who had processed the loan given to Jai Prakash had been
suspended and later demoted.
18. It was also stated in such rejoinder affidavit that the alleged letter issued on 27.11.2017 admitting
the mortgage of house property situated at Indira Nagar for securing the loan given to the principal
borrower was not signed by the petitioners and Jai Prakash may have forged the same. The house
property at Indira Nagar was never mortgaged, and therefore, there could not have been an
extension of the mortgage deed.
19. It was reiterated that the bank had failed to comply with Rule 8(1) and 8(2) by not issuing
notices, specifying the possession date. The alleged notice of symbolic possession dated 05.10.2016
was published only on 07.10.2016 proceedings initiated thereafter ex parte.
20. After affidavits were exchanged and the petition was ripe for hearing an Impleadment
Application no.9 of 2022 was filed by the petitioners on 25.04.2022 for impleading the principal
borrower Jai Prakash as respondent no.5 in the writ alleging that Securitisation Application No.150
of 2017 was pending before the DRT and its outcome would impact the petitioners, and therefore, it
was necessary to include Jai Prakash as respondent no.5 in the petition.
21. Objections were filed by the bank on 18.07.2022, against such application for impleadment by
the bank saying that such impleadment application was collusive in nature and filed only to delay
the decision in the writ petition where pleadings had been exchanged and the matter was ripe for
final hearing. It was stated that initially one Securitisation Application No. 150 of 2017 was filed by
Jai Prakash, the petitioners were not impleaded therein as respondents. When Securitisation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 6
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
Application No.19 of 2018 was filed by petitioners Sunita Nishad and Om Prakash, they did not
implead Jai Prakash as a respondent, although the same advocate was engaged by them and they
had made pleadings on behalf of each other. Also, when Securitisation Application No.19 of 2018,
was allowed by the DRT, the bank filed appeal before the DRAT Allahabad. Jai Prakash, the
borrower was not a party to such proceedings and no objections regarding the non-joinder of the
borrower was ever raised by the petitioners.
22. This court passed a detailed order on 14.03.2023, rejecting the impleadment application by
noticing the objections as stated by the bank and finding that the securitisation application of Jai
Prakash the borrower is pending before the DRT, where the guarantors have not been impleaded as
parties. The securitisation application of the guarantors Sunita Nishad and Om Prakash having been
allowed, the bank had filed appeal before the DRAT Allahabad, and during the pendency of the
appeal, the petitioners did not raise any issue regarding non-impleadment of the principal borrower.
Since Writ-C No. 35050 of 2019 had arisen out of proceedings in the Securitisation Application No.
19 of 2018 and challenged the order passed in appeal by the DRAT, Allahabad where Jai Prakash
was not a party, there was no necessity of impleading the Jai Prakash in the instant petition.
23. An application for amendment in the petition was moved on 20.09.2023 by the petitioners
stating that Writ Petition No. 31115 (MB) of 2017 had been disposed off on 20.12.2017 and there
were certain incorrect pleadings made therein and the petitioners had filed an amendment
application which was pending in the finally disposed off petition.
24. This Court partly allowed such Amendment Application on 01.03.2024, the relevant extract of
which is being quoted here in below:-
1. ***
2. Learned counsel for the applicant has prayed, on the basis of the affidavit filed in
support of such amendment application for permission to add paragraph 1A after
paragraph 1 in Writ-C No.35050 of 2019, that initially a Writ Petition No.31115 (M/B)
of 2017 was filed by the petitioners, which was disposed of by this court by an order
dated 20.12.2017. In the said Writ Petition No.31115 (M/B) of 2017, certain incorrect
statements were made in paragraphs-3 and 15, to substantiate the claim of the
petitioners that loan ought to be recovered from the principal borrowers first and
only if it is not feasible to recover from the principal borrowers, proceedings of
recovery could be initiated against the guarantors that is the petitioners. Such
pleadings was made in Writ Petition No.31115 (M/B) of 2017 by the petitioners only
to convince this Court that the petitioners being guarantors cannot be fixed with
liability of repayment of loan of the principal borrower before the bank proceeds
against principal borrower. But from such pleadings, an inference has been drawn
that the petitioners admitted the Bank's claim that they are guarantors of the loan
taken by the principal borrower. In fact, the petitioners had wanted to assert that the
bank was arbitrarily proceeding against the petitioners as guarantors.

Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
The petitioners pleading in the said Writ Petition No.31115 (M/B) of 2017 was made only because
they could not understand the nuances of the english language used by the learned counsel
appearing for them in Writ Petition No.31115 (M/B) of 2017 and even the document that has been
relied upon by the petitioners showed that the petitioner no.1 Sunita Nishad never signed the terms
and conditions of the loan document and the extension of equitable mortgage, nor did she extended
her own house as security against the loan of Jai Prakash, who is the principal borrower. The
petitioners were under tremendous pressure as their residential house, which was fraudulently
shown by the Bank officials to have been extended as security for repayment of loan in time by the
principal borrower, was under auction sale and they were being threatened to be dispossessed.
Therefore, inadvertently mistake was committed in the said pleading in Writ Petition No.31115
(M/B) of 2017.
3. Learned counsel for the applicant has also stated before this Court that Writ Petition No.31115
(M/B) of 2017 having already disposed off by this Court by its order dated 20.12.2017, an
application for amendment in the pleadings in the said Writ Petition No.31115 (M/B) of 2017 has
also been filed, which is pending disposal before the Division Bench.
4. Additionally, learned counsel for the applicant has prayed for liberty to add paragraph-70 A in
Writ-C No.35050 of 2019, raising the plea with regard to the bank proceeding under the
Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act
(SARFAESI Act) illegally, as a loan that had been given to the Principal borrower was under
"Kamdhenu Dairy Interest Subsidy Scheme" floated under the U.P. Agriculture Credit Act, 1973. In
the said loan, subsidy was given by the State Government. As such recovery, if any, could be done
only under the provisions Section 11, 12, 12A, 12B and 12C of the U.P. Agriculture Credit Act, 1973.
The Bank could not be allowed to pursue the remedy under the SARFAESI Act before the Debt
Recovery Tribunal.
5. Further, the learned counsel for the applicant prays for permission to be granted to the applicants
to add paragraph 70-B to the pleadings in Writ-C No.35050 of 2019, wherein it has been stated that
loan in question being under the Kamdhenu Dairy Interest Subsidy Scheme, under the U.P.
Agricuture Credit Act, 1973, is an agricultural loan extended for agricultural purposes and,
therefore, no proceedings under the SARFAESI Act could be initiated to effectuate recovery of
agricultural loan.
6.,7.,8.***
9. A strong objection has been taken to the pleadings proposed to be added as paragraph-1A saying
that the petitioners knowingly signed all documents and they cannot resile from signatures made by
them on such documents as guarantors and the annexure that have been filed along with Writ
Petition No.31115 (M/B) of 2017 by the petitioners themselves belie their claim that they were not
guarantors to the loan taken by the principal borrower and they did not offer their residential house
as surety for the loan taken by the principal borrower.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 8
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
10. It has been argued by Sri Prashant Kumar Srivastava, learned counsel for the respondent, that
the petitioners deliberately moved an amendment application with a prayer to add the pleadings as
proposed in paragraph-1A only to detract from the inference made from the pleadings in the writ
petition subsequently filed i.e. Writ-C No.35050 (M/S) of 2019, where they had stated that they had
not signed as guarantors and have not offered the house as surety for the loan taken by the principal
borrower. Through the application for amendment, the petitioners are trying to raise new grounds
and are trying to change nature and character of the petition.
11. It has also been argued that application for amendment filed by the applicants is collusive for the
reason that at the initial stage when securitization application No.150 of 2017 was filed by the
principal borrower Jai Prakash, and securitization application no.19 of 2018 was filed by Mrs. Sunita
Nishad and her husband, they had engaged the same Advocate and they had made pleadings on
behalf of each other in the said Securitization Applications.
12., 13., ***
14. This Court has gone through the counter affidavit that has been filed to the original writ petition
Writ-C No.35050 of 2019 and also the writ petition no.31115 of 2017, a copy of which has been
annexed to the counter affidavit filed in the instant petition. From the same, it is evident that
documents have been filed by the Bank to show that the petitioners had signed the documents as
guarantors for the principal borrower, annexed as annexure-5 to the counter affidavit. Therefore,
the amendment as proposed by addition of paragraph 1A cannot be allowed. It would only permit
the petitioners to resile from their pleadings and set up a new case altogether before this Court.
15. In so far as the proposed amendments and addition of paragraphs- 70A and 70B are concerned,
such addition to the pleadings raise legal grounds, which can be taken at any stage.
16. Such pleadings are proposed to be made the basis of the legal grounds which could be raised at
any stage even at the stage of final hearing as they do not require additional evidence to be led. Such
proposed amendments by addition of pragraph-70A and 70B, the grounds (hh) and (ii) as well as
the relief clause (v) are permissible in law to be added and are therefore allowed.
17. Consequently, the amendment application C.M. Application No. I.A.12/ 2023 is partly allowed."
25. In effect, this Court had allowed amendments relating to UP Agricultural Credit Act, 1973, by
addition of paragraphs 70A and 70B and grounds relating to the same. It however, did not allow
paragraph 1A to be added where the petitioners had stated that, although in Writ Petition No. 31115
(MB) of 2017, they had stated that recovery should first be sought to be made from the principal
borrower before proceeding against the guarantor and had inadvertently suggested their acceptance
as guarantors to the loan taken by Jai Prakash, the petitioners only meant that even if they are
treated as guarantors, the recovery should first follow the proper legal procedure. It was also stated
that they had unknowingly signed the pleadings under pressure as their residential house was under
auction.

Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
26. After amendment of the petition by addition of paragraph 70A and 70B, the respondent bank
filed another application for dismissal of the petition on 03.04.2024, along with a supplementary
counter affidavit, saying that the petitioners have acknowledged their role as guarantors for the term
loan of Rs.90 lakhs extended to Jai Prakash under Kamdhenu Dairy Scheme additionally through
letter dated 27.11.2017, they admitted to providing the guarantee and requested the bank to auction
the borrowers property first. They had further sought a deferment of auction of their house property
situated in Sharda Nagar Yojna and Indira Nagar Vistar. Also, after rejection of interim relief
application in Securitisation Application, the petitioners had filed Writ Petition No. 31115 (MB) of
2017 and had made various averments on behalf of the borrower and they had also engaged the
same counsel and through this petition as well as repeated applications moved by the petitioners,
they have indirectly benefited the borrower.
27. Moreover, the petitioners have filed false affidavits before this Court and the Supreme Court in
the case of State of Orissa and Others Vs. Laxmi Narayan Das (2023) 15 SCC 273, has observed that
if a petitioner does not disclose all material facts fairly and truly before the Court but stated them in
a distorted manner and tried to mislead the Court, the Court has inherent power to protect itself and
to prevent an abuse of its process and dismiss the petition. The respondent bank has also placed
reliance upon Hari Narayan Vs Badari AIR 1963 Supreme Court 1558, G. Narayana Swamy Reddy
Vs. Govt. of Karnataka 1991 (3) SCC 261 and several other cases where the High Court denied relief
to the litigant on the ground that he had not approached the court with clean hands and writ
jurisdiction was equitable jurisdiction, which could not be allowed to be abused. With regard to
contents of paragraphs 70A and 70B, it has been submitted that securitisation proceedings can be
initiated by a secured creditor for realisation of debt through transfer of security interest created on
the secured asset by way of sale/lease, etc. under the Act of 2002. There is no provision in the Act of
2002, which bars the bank from initiating securitisation proceedings under the Kamdhenu Scheme.
28. A short counter affidavit has been filed by the respondent no.4 Mamta Yadav on 19.04.2024,
stating that she had bought the property in question in auction sale held by the bank and completed
all formalities and deposited the money by taking a home loan of Rs.75 lakhs from Indian bank
sanctioned on 14.12.2017. The auction purchaser was paying the monthly installments for
repayment of such loan to Indian bank, but had not been given actual physical possession of the
property, sale certificate in regard to which had been issued by the respondent bank.
Sri Shailendra Singh Rajawat, Advocate appearing for the auction purchaser respondent no.4 has
argued that the encumbrance or charge, if any, in respect of the property in question can only be
challenged by the auction purchaser, and therefore, the petitioner as such being the guarantors and
mortgagors, in the instant case have no locus to raise any objection against the alleged
encumbrances or charge. For establishing a charge or encumbrance, the petitioner has to show three
parties, one who created the encumbrance, two, who has a superior or first charge under any statute
and three, who has inferior or second charge.
It has been argued by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent no.4 that since a Sale
Certificate has been issued by the bank, which held the first charge on the property in question,
mentioning there in that such sale has been conducted in a public auction in proceedings under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 10
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
SARFAESI Act, and transferred title, free from all encumbrances on the auction purchaser, such
Sale Certificate gives absolute title and interest to the auction purchaser on the property in question.
29. It has been argued by Shri Amrendra Nath Tripathi, learned counsel for the petitioners that the
Tribunal has failed to correctly appreciate the facts and law. The DRT had allowed the Securitisation
Application on three grounds, namely, that the Demand Notice was not served on the Sunita
Nishad; prior notice before taking symbolic possession was not issued to the guarantor; the
encumbrance on the secured asset was not mentioned in the sale notice. The DRAT while allowing
the appeal gave an erroneous finding that the mentioning of the name 'Savita' on the postal receipt
was a typographical error and since Securitisation Application had been filed by both Sunita Nishad
and her husband, Om Prakash and there was no pleading on record that Om Prakash, who lived in
the same property on the same address as Sunita had not been served a copy of the demand notice,
it could not be said that notice was not served upon Sunita Nishad. Notice having not returned
undelivered, would be deemed to have been served.
30. It has been argued that the Appellate Tribunal also erroneously observed that non-service of
notice of possession would be of no consequence as the bank had resorted to Section 14 of the
SARFAESI Act proceedings and summons was issued by the District Magistrate which was served
on the guarantor. It has been submitted that the Appellate Tribunal erred in interpreting the
judgement of the Supreme Court in Standard Chartered Bank Vs. Noble Kumar(supra).
31. It has further been argued that the Tribunal committed a gross error of law in holding that the
petitioners have created extended mortgage of the property when the original mortgage was not
made and signed, extended mortgage could not have been made at all.
32. It has also been argued on behalf of the petitioners that the Tribunal has wrongly held that
non-mentioning of encumbrances on the property proposed to be sold is of no consequence as prior
mortgage had been created by the petitioners in favour of the self same bank.
33. It has been further argued by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners that
Kamdhenu Dairy Scheme had been launched by the Government of U.P. as an Agricultural Credit
Scheme under the U.P. Agricultural Credit Act, 1973. If the loan had been extended under an
Agricultural Credit Scheme to Jai Prakash, which could not be repaid by the borrower, then
proceedings should have been initiated under Sections 11, 12, 12 A, 12B and 12C of the Uttar Pradesh
Agricultural Credit Act of 1973. No proceedings could have been initiated under the Act of 2002 to
effectuate recovery of agricultural loan. Also, the properties which were allegedly mortgaged to the
bank for securing the agricultural loan for a project to be set up by Jai Prakash were agricultural and
situated at Barabanki and Principal Borrower was at Lucknow and the Bank of Baroda Branch at
Gomti Nagar had no jurisdiction to sanction loan in District Barabanki. This irregularity when
revealed to the higher management of the bank had prompted them to take disciplinary action
against the staff involved in sanctioning of loan to Jai Prakash, the principal borrower.
34. On the basis of pleadings on record, the counsel for the petitioner has argued that firstly the
petitioners did not create any mortgage and also never took any guarantee in the matter of loan
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 11
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
availed by Jai Prakash under the Kamdhenu Dairy Scheme. Even if such mortgage is shown by the
bank to have been created, the same is defective. Secondly, the bank did not follow the procedure
prescribed under the SARFAESI Act and Rules to auction the property of the petitioner in so far as
no demand notice under Section 13(2) was received by the petitioner no.1, no possession notice
under Section 13(4) was given in time prior to taking over of symbolic possession, and the Auction
Notice did not disclose the encumbrances on the property. Even the Sale Certificate which was
issued to the respondent no. 4 was defective.
35. To substantiate such arguments, counsel for the petitioners has stated that service of demand
notice on petitioner no.2, who is the husband of petitioner no.1, cannot be said to be sufficient
service on petitioner no.1. The Appellate Tribunal findings are contrary to the mandatory
requirement under Rule 3(1) and Rule 3(4) of the Rules of 2002 which require that demand notice
shall be served either by hand or by registered post acknowledgment due, or by speed post or by
courier, or by any other means of transmission of documents like through fax or electronic mail
service upon the borrower or his agent and the demand notice shall be served on each borrower. In
case of the petitioners, the only mode of service of demand notice as shown by the bank is through
registered post and a perusal of demand notice filed at page-413 of the counter affidavit of the bank
shows that it mentions the same having been issued in pursuance of some 'General Form of
Guarantee' dated 02.03.2015. No such form or guarantee dated 02.03.2015 has been brought on
record by the bank either before the Tribunal or before this court. It is the case of the petitioners
that Loan Sanction Letter dated 01.03.2015 of Jai Prakash had only one 'General Form of
Guarantee' of Om Prakash petitioner no.2, and not petitioner no.1, as is evident from serial no.4 of
the sureties mentioned at page-292 of the counter affidavit of the respondent no.3 Bank.
36. I have gone through page no.292, as pointed out by the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners, which is part of enclosures to Supplementary Affidavit SA 19 OF 2018 filed by Chief
Manager of Bank of Baroda in Securitisation Application No.19 of 2018. S.A.-1 is the Loan Sanction
Letter and it shows that Jai Prakash had taken a term loan of rupees 90 lakhs under Kamdhenu
Dairy Scheme and offered as securities several properties, some of which also belonged to Om
Prakash and Sunita Nishad. Prior to loan sanction to Jai Prakash on 01.03.2015, the petitioners had
taken a housing loan of rupees 29.50 lakhs on 28.01.2015. Copies of Loan Sanction Letter dated
28.01.2015 to Om Prakash and Sunita Nishad and Loan Sanction Letter dated 01.03.2015 in favour
of Jai Prakash have been filed along with the said supplementary affidavit in Securitization
Application No. 19 of 2018. The security documents mentioned in the Loan Sanction Letter dated
28.01.2015 in favour of the petitioners mentions primary mortgage of House No.13/88 situated at
Indira Nagar, Lucknow belonging to Om Prakash and Sunita Nishad his wife, and plot no. 3/334
situated at Rajni Khand Sharda Nagar, Raebareli Road, Lucknow as collateral. Attendance Sheet for
Creation of Mortgage, Declaration in the Matter of Mortgage by deposit of Title Deed of property,
Stamped Undertaking for Creation of Equitable Mortgage soon after execution of Sale Deed, letter of
Confirmation of Mortgage Creation/Extension; have all been mentioned as enclosures to the
sanction letter. All such documents have signatures of Sunita Nishad as also of Om Prakash, her
husband.

Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
37. The Loan Sanction Letter dated 01.03.2015 in favour of Jai Prakash mentions sanction of term
loan of rupees 90 lakhs under Kamdhenu Dairy Interest Subsidy Scheme and mentions as securities
at serial no. 4 General Form of Guarantee signed by Om Prakash and at serial nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8
declaration under Section 6(1) of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1973 of Khasara plot nos. 71, 73, 72, 81
and parts thereof, situated at Gram Athri Pargana Bhetauli, Tehsil Ramnagar, District Barabanki.
These four properties mention of which finds place as securities at serial numbers 5 to 8, have not
been proceeded against under the SARFAESI Act and Rules, being agricultural properties. At serial
no.9 of the same document, mention has been made of Extension of property of Jai Prakash house
no. 645B on plot no. 223, Abhishek Puram Mandiyaon, Jankipuram Vistar, Lucknow. At serial no.
10 mention has been made of Extension of property of House No. 13/88, Sector 13, Indira Nagar
Vistar Yojna owned by Om Prakash and his wife, Sunita Nishad. At serial no.11, Extension of
property of plot no. 3/334, Type-C Rajni Khand Sharda Nagar Yojna, Raebareli Road, Lucknow by
Om Prakash and Sunita Nishad have been mentioned. Such document has also been signed by
Sunita and her husband, Om Prakash along with Jaiprakash, the principal borrower.
38. In the same supplementary affidavit, copies of LDOC 90 (P), relating to letter of Confirmation of
Creation/Extension of Mortgage dated 07.05.2015; LDOC 90 (C) Declaration in the matter of
Mortgage by Deposit of Title Deeds in respect of immovables dated 06.05.2015, and Composite
Memorandum for Extension of Title Deeds by two or more mortgagors, dated 06.05.2015; and
Attendance Note of the Mortgagor dated 06.05.2015 has been filed as Exhibit-S.A.2.
39. This Court has carefully gone through S.A.-2 and finds both petitioner no.1 and petitioner no.2
had signed such document 90(P) for Creation/Extension of Mortgage and had undertaken to create
charge in favour of the bank for due repayment of or redemption of credit facilities of
Rs.90,00,000/- with interest and costs and charges payable thereon. Similarly, the Declaration
Document 90(C) and the Schedule of Properties mentions Extension of Equitable Mortgage of plot
no.3/33 4C Type situated in Rajini Khand Sharda Nagar, Yojna and also extension of equitable
mortgage of house no.13/88 situated at Indira Nagar Vistar Yojna, Lucknow. All such documents
filed as exhibits in the Supplementary Affidavit filed by the Chief Manager of the bank before the
D.R.T. in Securitization Application No.- 19 of 2018 have been signed by Sunita Nishad and her
husband, and specific mention has been made at page-300 of the counter affidavit of the properties
mentioned in Schedule 2A and 2B being mortgaged in housing loan of Rs.29.50 lakhs of Om
Prakash and Sunita Nishad; papers for which had already been deposited in the bank, being
extended as guarantee/security for loan of Rs.90 lakhs to Jai Prakash.
40. This Court has also gone through the Attendance Note of the mortgage which mentions the
names and signatures of Om Prakash and Sunita Nishad as also of Jai Prakash and two officers of
the bank.
It is these documents that have been relied upon by the D.R.T. Lucknow in giving a specific finding
that both Sunita Nishad and her husband Om Prakash had signed documents relating to extension
of equitable mortgage of house, property situated at Sector 13 Indira Nagar, Lucknow, as security for
repayment of loan of Rs. 90 lakhs by Jai Prakash. Such specific finding given in the judgement of
D.R.T. dated 20.08.2018 has not been challenged by the petitioners and being a finding of fact
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 13
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
which has been corroborated by documents filed along with the counter affidavit of the bank and
perused carefully by this Court, indicates that the petitioners have resorted to misrepresentation
and deliberate falsehood before this Court which is sitting in equitable and extraordinary writ
jurisdiction.
41. In so far as the argument relating to non-service of demand notice under Section 13, Sub Clause
2 of the Act is concerned and reference to Rule 3 (4) having been made by the counsel for the
petitioners, this court has carefully gone through documents enclosed with the counter affidavit of
the respondent bank referred to the arguments of the counsel for the bank. The counter affidavit
filed in Writ Petition No.35050/2019 has copy of entire Petition No.31115/2017 enclosed to it. In
paragraph-3 and in subsequent paragraphs, the petitioners have clearly admitted to being
guarantors to the loan taken by Jai Prakash and they have challenged the sale notice dated
18.10.2017 on the ground that the bank should have proceeded first against the principal borrower.
A copy of letter dated 27.10.2017, written by Sunita Nishad and her husband, Om Prakash, has been
filed Annexure 5 to the said Writ Petition No. 31115/2017, wherein it has been clearly stated by the
petitioners that they are guarantors of loan taken by Jai Prakash and had offered House No. 88
situated at Sector 13, Indira Nagar, Lucknow as security to the loan taken by Jai Prakash and that
notice has been sent by the bank, not only to the borrower but also to the petitioners who are
guarantors for sale of property in question, whereas the property of the borrower should have been
proceeded against first and then only auction of properties offered by the petitioners as securities
should be proceeded against. In this petition, there is no mention of non-service of notice under
Section 13(2) and Section 13(4) on the petitioners.
42. This Court has noticed that in paragraph 3 of the affidavit filed in support of Writ Petition No.
35050 of 2019, Sunita Nishad has solemnly affirmed on oath that Annexure no.4 of the petition,
including other Annexures is a true copy of its original. The demand notice dated 21.07.2016 has
been filed as an Annexure no.4 to the writ petition and it shows that it was properly served upon
petitioner no.1 also. Along with the demand notice dated 21.07.2016, the bank had also sent a
demand notice to the borrower and the house property situated at Indira Nagar was mentioned in
paragraph-2 of the said demand notice as belonging to the petitioners. All details of secured asset
were clearly mentioned in the demand notice dated 21.07.2016 issued under Section 13 (2) of the
Act which was sent through registered post acknowledgment due, to the petitioner no.1 and also
petitioner no.2 at their correct address that is House No.88, Sector-13, Indira Nagar, Lucknow. Such
letter was never returned unserved. The demand notice/letter dated 21.07.2016, clearly mentions
the name and address of the petitioner no.1 correctly. The postal receipt issued in the name of
'Savita' by the Post Office instead of showing the name, Sunita has no relevance in view of Section 27
of the General Clauses Act 1897, which defines service by post and service shall be deemed to be
effected by properly, addressing, pre-paying and posting by registered post, a letter containing the
document (demand notice), and unless the contrary is proved, it shall be treated to have been
effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.
43. In Krishna Kumar Gupta Vs. Manoj K Sahu reported in (2022) SCC OnLine All. 528, this court
considered Section 27 of the General Clauses Act and judgment rendered by the Supreme Court in
the case of C.C. Alavi Haji Vs. Palapetty Muhammed & Anr reported in (2007) 6 SCC 555, where the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 14
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
Supreme Court considered Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, and observed that if a
registered letter addressed to a person at his residential address does not get served in normal
course, and is returned, it can only be attributed to addressee's own conduct. The dispatch of notice
by registered post is sufficient compliance of service of notice by the landlord on the tenant. The
Supreme Court had also observed that the presumption under Section 114 of the Act of 1872 would
be that notice was served on the defendant unless he rebuts the said presumption by adducing
evidence in rebuttal. Where a registered envelope with correct address is posted. The presumption is
regarding its delivery unless the same is returned unclaimed. This Court also placed reliance upon
judgment rendered by the Supreme Court in M/s Ajeet Seeds Ltd Vs. K. Gopala Krishnaiah reported
in (2014) 12 SCC 685. The Supreme Court had observed that under Section 114 of the Evidence Act
when it appears to the Court that the common course of business renders it probable that a thing
would happen, the Court may draw a presumption that the thing would have happened, unless there
are circumstances in a particular case to show that the common course of business was not followed.
Thus, Section 114 enables the Court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks, likely to
have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and
public and private business in their relation to the facts of the particular case. Consequently, the
Court can presume that the common course of business has been followed in particular case. When
applied to communications sent by post, Section 114, enables the Court to presume that in the
common course of natural events, the communication would have been delivered at the address of
the addressee. But the presumption that is raised under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act is a
far stronger presumption. Further, Section 114 of the Evidence Act refers to a general presumption,
Section 27 of the General Clauses Act refers to a specific presumption. Section 27 gives rise to a
presumption that service of notice has been effected when it is sent to the correct address by
registered post. In view of the said presumption, when stating that a notice has been sent by
registered post to the address of the drawer, it is unnecessary to further aver that in spite of return
of the notice unserved, it is deemed to have been served or that the addressee is deemed to have
knowledge of the notice. Unless and until the contrary is proved by the addressee, service of notice is
deemed to have been affected at the time at which the letter would have been delivered in the
ordinary course of business.
44. This court is of the considered opinion that the argument regarding non-disclosure of
encumbrances in the sale notice is unacceptable as the petitioner being the guarantor and the
mortgager cannot raise such objection. For establishing a charge as an encumbrance, the petitioners
have to show three parties. One, who created the encumbrance, two, who has a superior or first
charge under any Statute, and three, who has the inferior or second charge. It was also necessary
that due to such encumbrance, the value of the property should diminish. In the case at hand
however, there are only two parties. The bank which has the first charge also has the second charge.
The second party in this case being Respondent No.4, Mamta Yadav. The Sale Certificate has
therefore been correctly issued free from all encumbrances. It is also registered in the office of the
Sub-Registrar, Lucknow on 21.12.2017, as is evident from page-265 of the counter affidavit filed on
27.03.2021 by the bank. The Supreme Court has also held that after issuance of sale certificate on
completion of SARFAESI proceedings, there is no provision for registration of sale certificate in the
case of B. Arvind Kumar Vs. Government of India and Others reported in (2007) 5 SCC 745;
Shakeena and Others Vs. Bank of India and Others reported in (2021) 12 SCC 761; Indian Overseas
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 15
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
Bank Vs. RCM Infrastructure Limited and Others reported in (2022) 8 SCC 516.
45. In B. Arvind Kumar (supra), the Supreme Court observed in paragraph-10 that the Sales
Certificate is merely the evidence of title having been transferred in favour of the auction purchaser.
It is well settled that when an auction purchaser derived title and confirmation of sale in his favour,
and a Sale Certificate when issued, is evidence of such sale and title. No further deed of transfer
from the Court is contemplated or required. Sale Certificate issued by an officer authorized by the
Court does not need to be registered Section 17 (2) (xii) of the Registration Act, 1908 specifically
provides that a certificate of sale granted to any purchaser of any property sold by a public auction
by a Civil or Revenue Officer does not fall under the category of non-testamentary documents which
required registration under Sub-Section (b) and (c) of Section 17 (1) of the said Act.
46. In Shakina Vs. Bank of India (Supra), the Supreme Court placed reliance upon observations
made by it in Mardia Chemicals Limited Vs. Union of India reported in (2004) 4 SCC 311. It was
observed that the registration of Sale Certificate as per Section 17 (2) (xii) of the Registration Act is
not mandatory for the completion of the sale, pursuant to the public auction and issuance of Sale
Certificate under the scheme of SARFAESI Act. The Supreme Court held as follows:-
"Assuming, the right of redemption conferred under the Transfer of Property Act is
protected under Section 37 of the SARFAESI Act, and independently available
without reference to the registration of the Sale Certificate under Section 17 (2) (xiii)
of the Registration Act, the sale already effected satisfying the conditions
contemplated under Section 13 (8) of the SARFAESI Act, shall by virtue of Section 37
of the SARFAESI Act, prevail over such other rights, much less the right of
redemption conferred under the Transfer of Property Act, which is protected under
Section 37 of the SARFAESI Act, in view of the non obstante clause provided under
Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act, because a non obstante clause provided under
Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act, makes it clear that even though there are
inconsistencies to such other rights conferred under any other law for the time being
in force that are protected under Section 37 of the SARFAESI Act, the action initiated
under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act shall have the overriding effect as per
Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act, because SARFAESI Act is a special Act, which aims
to accelerate the growth of the economy of our country empowering the lenders,
namely nationalised banks, private sector banks and other financial institutions to
realise the dues from the defaulting borrowers who are very lethargic in repayment of
the loans, borrowed by them, by exercising the right of expeditious attachment and
foreclosure for the enforcement of security, and therefore, Section 35 and Section 37
of the SARFAESI Act have to be read conjointly to achieve the object of the
SARFAESI Act, but not to defeat the same, and therefore, we do not see any conflict
between them."
47. In Indian Overseas Bank Vs. R.C.M. Infrastructure Limited (Supra), the Supreme Court has
observed that in Shakina, the Supreme Court had already held that Sale Certificate issued in favour
of the respondent did not require registration and that the sale process was complete on issuance of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 16
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
Sale Certificate. Such observations were followed by the Supreme Court again in the case of S.
Karthik and Others Vs. N. Subhash Chand Jain and Others reported in (2022) 10 SCC 641.
48. This Court after careful perusal of all affidavits and documents filed along with them is of the
considered opinion that the Petitioners have not approached this Court with clean hands and the
litigation has been protracted unnecessarily by them only to enjoy the interim order granted to them
initially by this Court.
49. In State of Orissa Vs. Laxmi Narayan Das (2023) 15 SCC 273, the Supreme Court has made
observations that on misrepresentation and concealment on the part of the litigant should be
discouraged and viewed seriously. It has observed in Paragraphs 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47 and 49 as
follows :-
40. As to how a litigant who conceals material facts from the court has to be dealt
with, has been gone into by this Court, time and again in plethora of cases and the
consistent opinion is that, he is not entitled even to be heard on merits.
41. In Abhyudya Sanstha v. Union of India [Abhyudya Sanstha v. Union of India,
(2011) 6 SCC 145 : (2011) 3 SCC (Civ) 241 : 4 SCEC 185] , this Court, while declining
relief to the petitioners therein, who did not approach the court with clean hands,
opined as under :
"18. ... In our view, the appellants deserve to be non-suited because they have not
approached the court with clean hands. The plea of inadvertent mistake put forward
by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants and their submission that the court
may take lenient view and order regularisation of the admissions already made
sounds attractive but does not merit acceptance. Each of the appellants consciously
made a statement that it had been granted recognition by NCTE, which necessarily
implies that recognition was granted in terms of Section 14 of the Act read with
Regulations 7 and 8 of the 2007 Regulations. Those managing the affairs of the
appellants do not belong to the category of innocent, illiterate/uneducated persons,
who are not conversant with the relevant statutory provisions and the court process.
The very fact that each of the appellants had submitted application in terms of
Regulation 7 and made itself available for inspection by the team constituted by
WRC, Bhopal shows that they were fully aware of the fact that they can get
recognition only after fulfilling the conditions specified in the Act and the
Regulations and that WRC, Bhopal had not granted recognition to them.
Notwithstanding this, they made a bold statement that they had been granted
recognition by the competent authority and thereby succeeded in persuading this
Court to entertain the special leave petitions and pass interim orders. The minimum
which can be said about the appellants is that they have not approached the court
with clean hands and succeeded in polluting the stream of justice by making a
patently false statement. Therefore, they are not entitled to relief under Article 136 of
the Constitution. This view finds support from a plethora of precedents."

43. In G. Narayanaswamy Reddy v. State of Karnataka case [G. Narayanaswamy Reddy v. State of
Karnataka, (1991) 3 SCC 261] , this Court while noticing the fact regarding the stay order passed by
the High Court which prevented passing of the award by the Land Acquisition Officer within the
prescribed time period was concealed and in the aforesaid context, it observed that:
"2........It is well settled in law that the relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is
discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come
with frank and full disclosure of facts. If he fails to do so and suppresses material
facts, his application is liable to be dismissed. We accordingly dismiss the special
leave petitions."
44. In Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. [Dalip Singh v. State of U.P., (2010) 2 SCC 114 : (2010) 1 SCC
(Civ) 324] , this Court noticed the progressive decline in the values of life and observed :
"1. For many centuries Indian society cherished two basic values of life i.e. "satya"
(truth) and "ahinsa" (non-violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi
guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an
integral part of the justice-delivery system which was in vogue in the
pre-Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts
irrespective of the consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen
drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has overshadowed the old ethos
and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in
litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and
suppression of facts in the court proceedings.
2. In the last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to
this creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and
unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet the challenge posed by
this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new rules and
it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice
or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any
relief, interim or final."

45. In Moti Lal Songara v. Prem Prakash [Moti Lal Songara v. Prem Prakash, (2013) 9 SCC 199 :
(2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 872] , this Court, considering the issue regarding concealment of facts before the
Court, observed that "court is not a laboratory where children come to play", and opined as under :
"........Anyone who takes recourse to method of suppression in a court of law, is, in
actuality, playing fraud upon the court, and the maxim suppressio veri, expressio falsi
i.e. suppression of the truth is equivalent to the expression of falsehood, gets

attracted. We are compelled to say so as there has been a calculated concealment of
the fact before the Revisional Court. It can be stated with certitude that the
respondent-accused tried to gain advantage by such factual suppression. The
fraudulent intention is writ large. In fact, he has shown his courage of ignorance and
tried to play possum.
20. The High Court, as we have seen, applied the principle 'when infrastructure
collapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse'. However, as the order has been
obtained by practising fraud and suppressing material fact before a court of law to
gain advantage, the said order cannot be allowed to stand."
(emphasis supplied)
47. It has also been laid down by this Court in Chandra Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma [Chandra
Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma, (1995) 1 SCC 421 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 239] that a person who makes an
attempt to deceive the court, interferes with the administration of justice and can be held guilty of
contempt of court. In this case, a husband who had filed a fabricated document to oppose the prayer
of his wife seeking transfer of matrimonial proceedings was found guilty of contempt of court and
was sentenced to two weeks' imprisonment. It was observed as under :
*** "1. The stream of administration of justice has to remain unpolluted so that purity
of court's atmosphere may give vitality to all the organs of the State. Polluters of
judicial firmament are, therefore, required to be well taken care of to maintain the
sublimity of court's environment; so also to enable it to administer justice fairly and
to the satisfaction of all concerned.
2. Anyone who takes recourse to fraud, deflects the course of judicial proceedings; or
if anything is done with oblique motive, the same interferes with the administration
of justice. Such persons are required to be properly dealt with, not only to punish
them for the wrong done, but also to deter others from indulging in similar acts
which shake the faith of people in the system of administration of justice."

49. In Dhananjay Sharma vs. State of Haryana [Dhananjay Sharma v. State of Haryana, (1995) 3
SCC 757 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 608], the filing of a false affidavit was the basis for initiation of action in
contempt jurisdiction and the persons concerned were punished for the same.
50. In K. Jayaram Vs. BDA, (2022) 12 SCC 815, the Supreme Court observed:-
10. It is well-settled that the jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution of India is extraordinary, equitable and discretionary and it is
imperative that the petitioner approaching the writ court must come with clean
hands and put forward all facts before the court without concealing or suppressing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 19
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
anything. A litigant is bound to state all facts which are relevant to the litigation. If he
withholds some vital or relevant material in order to gain advantage over the other
side then he would be guilty of playing fraud with the court as well as with the
opposite parties which cannot be countenanced.
11. This Court in Prestige Lights Ltd. v. SBI [Prestige Lights Ltd. v. SBI, (2007) 8 SCC
449] has held that a prerogative remedy is not available as a matter of course. In
exercising extraordinary power, a writ court would indeed bear in mind the conduct
of the party which is invoking such jurisdiction. If the applicant does not disclose full
facts or suppresses relevant materials or is otherwise guilty of misleading the court,
the court may dismiss the action without adjudicating the matter. It was held thus:
"33. It is thus clear that though the appellant Company had approached the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, it had not candidly stated all the facts to
the Court. The High Court is exercising discretionary and extraordinary jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution. Over and above, a court of law is also a court of
equity. It is, therefore, of utmost necessity that when a party approaches a High
Court, he must place all the facts before the Court without any reservation. If there is
suppression of material facts on the part of the applicant or twisted facts have been
placed before the Court, the writ court may refuse to entertain the petition and
dismiss it without entering into merits of the matter."
(emphasis supplied)
13. In K.D. Sharma v. SAIL [K.D. Sharma v. SAIL, (2008) 12 SCC 481], it was held in para 36 & 38 :-
36. A prerogative remedy is not a matter of course. While exercising extraordinary
power a writ court would certainly bear in mind the conduct of the party who invokes
the jurisdiction of the court. If the applicant makes a false statement or suppresses
material fact or attempts to mislead the court, the court may dismiss the action on
that ground alone and may refuse to enter into the merits of the case by stating, 'We
will not listen to your application because of what you have done.' The rule has been
evolved in the larger public interest to deter unscrupulous litigants from abusing the
process of court by deceiving it.
38. The very basis of the writ jurisdiction rests in disclosure of true and complete
(correct) facts. If material facts are suppressed or distorted, the very functioning of
writ courts and exercise would become impossible. The petitioner must disclose all
the facts having a bearing on the relief sought without any qualification. This is
because "the court knows law but not facts".
51. In Udyami Evam Khadi Gramodyog Welfare Sanstha v. State of U.P. [Udyami
Evam Khadi Gramodyog Welfare Sanstha v. State of U.P., (2008) 1 SCC 560 : (2008)
1 SCC (Civ) 359] , the Supreme Court has reiterated that the writ remedy is an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125994835/ 20
Sunita Nishad And Anr. vs Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal Thru ... on 1 April, 2025
equitable one and a person approaching a superior court must come with a pair of
clean hands. Such person should not suppress any material fact but also should not
take recourse to legal proceedings over and over again which amounts to abuse of the
process of law.
52. In A. Shanmugam Vs. Ariya Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya Nandhavana
Paripalani Sangam, (2012) 6 SCC 430 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 735 : 2012 SCC OnLine SC
384 the Supreme Court has observed as under:-
"43.4. Once the court discovers falsehood, concealment, distortion, obstruction or
confusion in pleadings and documents, the court should in addition to full restitution
impose appropriate costs. The court must ensure that there is no incentive for
wrongdoer in the temple of justice. Truth is the foundation of justice and it has to be
the common endeavour of all to uphold the truth and no one should be permitted to
pollute the stream of justice."
(emphasis supplied)
53. The learned counsel for the respondent no.4 has argued that although the entire payment has
been made by the auction purchaser and Sale Certificate has been issued in her favour, the actual
physical possession of the property has not been given to her due to pending litigation filed by the
petitioners on the basis of frivolous grounds.
54. The counsel for the respondent no. 4 in his written submissions has placed on record the fact
that the respondent no. 4 has been living in rented premises and has not been able to enjoy the
benefits of the property purchased by her, which makes her entitled to mesne profits as well. It has
been stated that the auction purchaser has been paying continuous EMI to Indian Bank for loan
taken to purchase the property for the last seven years and has incurred enormous monetary loss
and deserves to be compensated for the actual damages so caused. The monetary loss has been
mentioned in the form of a tabulation chart given in the written submissions, wherein mesne
profits, mental agony and harassment, legal expenses, rent paid by Respondent No.4 since January
2018 with 10% annual increments, interest paid for the Bank loan and House tax, water tax and
electricity charges etc. have all been described in detail besides other expenses for depreciation of
property. The total loss has been calculated of more than Rs. One Crore.
55. This Court having gone through the judicial precedents as aforesaid relating to writ jurisdiction
being an equitable jurisdiction and the responsibility of the litigant to approach this Court with
frank and full disclosure of facts, avoiding any active misrepresentation and suppression of material
facts, finds that the petitioners have filed this writ petition in an attempt to deliberately pollute the
stream of justice. Not only this Court has found misrepresentation from the pleadings on record and
documentary evidence filed by the Bank in its affidavits, this Court has also found deliberate
attempt at protracting of litigation to enable the petitioners to continue to occupy House No.88,
Sector-13, Indira Nagar Vistar Yojana, Lucknow, despite the property having been auctioned way
back on 21.12.2017.

56. Not only has the Court's precious time which may have been utilized for genuinely suffering
litigants has been wasted; the Respondent no.4 has also suffered grievously.
57. This Court even on merits has not found the arguments raised by the counsel for the petitioners
to be sustainable. Hence, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed and it is hereby dismissed with
costs of Rs.25 lacs [Rupees Twenty Five Lacs only] which shall be payable within three months
before this Court by way of Demand Draft made out in favour of the Senior Registrar High Court
Lucknow Bench.
58. In case of failure to do so, the Senior Registrar of this Court shall issue a Recovery Certificate to
the District Magistrate, Lucknow, who shall recover such costs as arrears of land revenue from the
petitioners' movable and immovable properties and deposit the same in the High Court sitting at
Lucknow.
59. Such costs when deposited shall be released in favour of the Respondent no.4, namely, Smt.
Mamta Yadav by the Senior Registrar on an appropriate application being moved in this regard by
the Respondent no.4.
60. Since this writ petition has been dismissed and order of the DRAT stands affirmed, the
petitioners are bound to vacate the property in question within one month from today.
