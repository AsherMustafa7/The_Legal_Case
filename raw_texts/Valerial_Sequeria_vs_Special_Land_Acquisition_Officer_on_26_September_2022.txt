IN THESE WRIT PETITIONS, ARGUMENTS BEING HEARD,
JUDGMENT RESERVED, COMING ON "PRONOUNCEMENT OF
ORDERS", THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The grievance of the petitioners in these writ petitions are that the respondent-authorities have
issued two awards with regard to the acquisition made in respect of the subject land and same is
impermissible. Hence, petitioners have presented these writ petitions.
2. Since the order impugned in these petitions are one and the same and the question raised in these
writ petitions are identical, they are clubbed together and are disposed of by this common order.
3. In writ petition No.10525 of 2021, it is the contention of the petitioners that the petitioners are
the owners in possession of the subject land and the respondent-authorities have issued Preliminary
and Final notifications dated 09th January, 2020 and 10th July, 2020 under Section 3-A and 3-D of
National Highways Act, 1956 respectively (for short hereinafter referred to as the "the Act") and as
such, acquired the land belonging to the petitioners for the purpose of widening of four-
lane road in Dakshina Kannada District. The Union Govt has issued Notification dated 27th June,
2014 under Section 3(a) of the Act authorising the competent authority to perform the functions
with regard to the National Highway No.13 between Shivamogga and Mangaluru (Annexure-C).
Pursuant to the same, the competent authority-respondent No.1, has passed General Award dated
17th December, 2020 under Section 3-G of the Act read with Section 29 of the Right to Fair.
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013
(for short hereinafter referred to as "2013 Act") , awarding Rs.19,49,25,561/- in respect of Puttige
village Annexure-D. The case of the petitioners is that the first respondent, without giving effect to
the first award, has passed the second award dated 22nd January, 2021 and being aggrieved by the
same, the petitioners have alleged that the officers of the National Highways have influenced
respondent No.1 to pass second award by reducing the compensation from Rs.19,49,25,561/- to
Rs.7,39,16,505/- and being aggrieved by the same, the present writ petition is filed. The respondent
entered appearance and filed detailed statement of objection denying the averments made in the
writ petition. It is the case of the respondent that the petitioners having alternative and efficacious
remedy to challenge the impugned award passed by the respondent No.1 before the Arbitrator under
Section 3-G(5) of the Act and hence sought for dismissal of the petition on the ground of alternative
remedy. It is the specific defence of the respondent-authorities that there are two awards as alleged
by the petitioners is not correct and the award dated 17th December, 2020 is only a draft award and
the General Award was passed under Section 3-G of the Act on 22nd January, 2021 and accordingly,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 12
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
sought for dismissal of the writ petition.
4. In Writ petition No.10780 of 2021, the petitioners are owners in possession of the subject land
and have raised the similar contention, challenging the impugned award dated 27th January, 2021
(Annexure-A) passed by the respondents. The respondent entered appearance and filed detailed
statement of objection contending that petitioners have an alternative and efficacious remedy under
the Act and accordingly, sought for dismissal of the writ petition.
5. In writ petition No.13547 of 2021, the petitioners claim to be the owners in possession of subject
land and have challenged the award dated 22nd January, 2021 (Annexure-A) passed by respondent
No.1 under Section 3-G of the Act. The respondents have raised identical objections with regard to
the maintainability of the writ petition in their statement of objections and sought to dismiss the
writ petition.
6. In Writ petition No.8458 of 2021 the petitioners have challenged the impugned award dated 22nd
January, 2021 have pleaded that they are owners in possession of the subject land referred to in the
petition and have taken a plea that the first respondent has no authority to issue two awards for
same acquisition proceedings and accordingly, sought for quashing of the impugned order. The
respondents have taken the contention that the petitioners have alternative and efficacious remedy
under the Act, and hence sought for dismissal of the writ petition.
7. Heard Shri G.S. Kannur, learned Senior Counsel for Sri Sachin B.S., and Sri Udaya Holla, learned
Senior Counsel Sri Shobith Shetty, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-
Highway Authority.
8. Sri G.S. Kannur, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Sachin B.S., for the petitioners
contended that pursuant to the acquisition proceedings initiated by the respondent authorities, the
first respondent has passed the award dated 17th December, 2020 determining the compensation as
per Annexure-D to the writ petition No.10525 of 2021. He further contended that the said award has
been signed by the competent authority respondent-No.1 and thereafter, issued another award
dated 22nd January, 2021, drastically reducing the compensation and the said second award is
non-est and cannot be accepted. He further contended that, this Court in the case of NATIONAL
HIGHWAYS v. ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AND COMPETENT AUTHORITY in Writ petition
No.25050 of 2010 and connected petitions dated 18th April, 2011, held that the respondent
authorities have no authority under law to pass two awards and therefore, he sought for interference
of this Court.
He also contended that, reducing the compensation is on the behest of the officials of the
respondent with ulterior motive to cause injustice to the petitioners.
9. Per contra, Sri Udaya Holla, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Shobith Shetty, learned
counsel for of the respondent-National Highway, contended that the relief sought for by the
petitioners is not maintainable in view of the availability of alternative and efficacious remedy under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 13
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
National Highways Act. It is his specific defence that award dated 22nd January, 2021 (Annexure-A)
is the only award made by the respondent-authorities and therefore, countered the submission
made by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners. In this regard, Sri Udaya Holla, learned
Senior Counsel refers to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of NATIONAL
HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA v. SAYEDABAD TEA COMPANY LIMITED AND OTHERS
reported in (2020)15 SCC 161.
10. In the light of the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, questions
that arise for consideration in these writ petitions are as follows:
(1) Whether the respondent-authorities are justified in issuing award dated
22.01.2021 (Annexure-A)?
(2) Whether the writ petitions deserve to be dismissed on the ground of alternative
and efficacious remedy available under National Highways Act?
11. On careful examination of the writ papers, it is not in dispute that the land belonging to the
petitioners have been proposed for acquisition for the purpose of widening of National Highway
NH-169 (earlier NH-13) between Shivamoga and Mangaluru under NHDP Phase-III Programme. It
is also not in dispute that the respondent-authorities have issued preliminary notification on 09th
January, 2020 under Section 3-A of the Act followed by the final Notification dated 10th July, 2020
under Section 3-D of the Act. Competent authority has been authorised to effectuate the acquisition
proceedings as per Notification dated 27th June, 2014. The respondent-authorities issued
Notification dated 17th December, 2020 (Annexure-D), determining the compensation under
Section 3-G of the Act, read with Section 29 of the 2013 Act. In the light of the submission made by
Sri Udaya Holla, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent-authority, I have carefully examined the
Notification dated 17th December, 2020 produced at Annexure-D in Writ Petition No.10525 of
2020. I have taken note of the fact that the said Notification dated 17th December, 2020 do not
mention that the said Notification is a draft award issued by the respondent-authorities and
therefore, I do not agree with the arguments of learned Senior Counsel, Sri Udaya Holla and same
has to be considered as an award under Section 3-G of the Act.
In this aspect, I find force in the submission made by Sri G.S. Kannur, learned Senior counsel
appearing for the petitioners, referring to paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Order passed by this Court in
Writ Petition No.25050 of 2010 and connected writ petitions referred to above, which read as
under:
"16. In the instant case, what is sought to be done is to pass another award in the
place of the earlier award by enhancing the compensation adopting a different
method by conducting spot inspection and by taking note of other documents made
available. If this is permitted, then a question could be asked as to why not a third or
fourth or fifth award be passed by the competent authority at the instance of either of
the parties. Such a situation, if permitted, will introduce total uncertainty and chaos.
In any event, the competent authority cannot usurb such powers when no such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 14
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
provision is made in the Act. Hence, the impugned supplementary awards cannot be
sustained in law as respondent No.1 has acted without jurisdiction and without any
authority under the provisions of the Act while passing the impugned awards.
17. While this Court is alive to the concern of the land owners that they have to get
just and legal compensation payable to their acquired lands and that if any mistake is
committed by the competent authority in ignoring the relevant factors while
determining the market value, the same deserves to be corrected in accordance with
law to enable them to get proper compensation, but such correction has to be made
in accordance with law, for which provision is made under the Act as referred to
above.
12. That apart, the letter dated 22nd January, 2021 (Annexure-S) issued by the first respondent to
the Project Director, National Highways Authority of India, whereby the first respondent has revised
the award under Section 3-G of the Act in respect of the land situate in Puttige village of Mudabidri
taluk which would clearly substantiate the arguments advanced by the learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the petitioners that the award dated 22nd January, 2021 (Annexure-A) is a second
award made by the respondent-authorities in the absence of specific provision under the National
Highways Act, providing for making second award with respect to the land acquired pursuant to
Notifications under 3-A and 3-D of the Act. It is also pertinent to take note of the similar contents in
Annexure-R dated 21st January, 2021 whereby the Regional Officer of NHAI addressed letter to
Project Director of NHAI, referring to the award dated 22nd January, 2021 as Review 3-G Award
and in that view of the matter, I am of the view that the writ petitions deserve to be allowed by
setting aside the award dated 22nd January, 2021 passed by the respondent-authority as one
without jurisdiction and contrary to law.
13. Though the learned senior counsel Sri Udaya Holla, argued on the premise that the petitioners
have to exhaust the alternative remedy provided under the Act, and judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of SAYEDABAD TEA COMPANY LIMITED (supra), the said submission cannot be
accepted for the reason the impugned award dated 22nd January, 2021 said to have been issued by
the respondent-authorities under section 3- G of the Act upon issuing the earlier award dated 17th
December, 2020 (Annexure-D), which creates rights in favour of the petitioners claiming
compensation under the Act, and in that view of the matter, reviewing the very same award by way
of impugned award dated 22nd January, 2021 (Annexure-A) does not arise at all and the same is
without jurisdiction and therefore, this Court is having jurisdiction to exercise powers under Article
226 of the Constitution of India to set right the jurisdictional error on the part of the
respondent-authority while issuing second award. Therefore, I am of the view that the impugned
award dated 22nd January, 2021 (Annexure-A) is liable to be quashed in these writ petitions. If the
instrumentality of the State, acted in contravention of the statutory provisions which affect the
rights of the parties concerned, such illegal and arbitrary action, on the part of authorities, has to be
nipped in the bud and cannot be perpetuated since the very action of such authorities is not only an
irregularity in nature but also amounts to illegality which cannot be accepted under Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. In that view of the matter, even if the alternative remedy is available for the
petitioners to approach the competent authority under the provisions of the Act, however, the same
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 15
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
cannot be said to be an efficacious remedy to nullify such erroneous decision on the part of the
respondent-
authorities.
14. Though the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents urged about the existence of
alternative remedy, I do not find acceptable ground to disallow these petitions as it is trite law that
this Court is having jurisdiction to entertain writ petition, if the impugned orders are passed in
derogation of principles of natural justice and the action taken by the respondent-Authority is
contrary to the law declared by the Hon'ble Apex Court. In the case of L K VERMA v. HMT AND
ANOTHER, reported in (2006)2 SCC 269, at paragraph 20 of the judgment, it is held as follows:
"20. The High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution, in a given case although may not entertain a writ petition inter alia on
the ground of availability of an alternative remedy, but the said rule cannot be said to
be of universal application. Despite existence of an alternative remedy, a writ court
may exercise its discretionary jurisdiction of judicial review inter alia in cases where
the court or the tribunal lacks inherent jurisdiction or for enforcement of a
fundamental right or if there has been a violation of a principle of natural justice or
where vires of the Act is in question. In the aforementioned circumstances, the
alternative remedy has been held not to operate as a bar.
[See Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others, (1998)
1 SCC 1, Sanjana M. Wig (Ms.) v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC
242, State of H.P. and Others v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. and Another."
15. It is well settled principle in law that administrative or judicial orders must be supported by
reasons. It is the duty of the respondent- Revenue being an instrumentality of state under Article 12
of the Constitution of India to give reasons for its conclusion. Recording of reason is the hallmark of
a valid Order, while exercising administrative action or judicial review to disclose reasons and
recording reasons, has always been insisted upon as one of the fundamentals of sound
administration of justice delivery system, to make known that there have been proper and due
application of mind by the authorities, which is an essential requisite of principles of natural justice.
Reasons introduces clarity in Order and absence of such reasons would render the decision making
process null and void.
16. In the case of THE COLLECTOR (DISTRICT MAGISTRATE) ALLAHABAD v. RAJARAM,
reported in AIR 1985 SC 1622, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that where power is conferred to
achieve a certain purpose, the power can be exercised only for achieving that purpose. It is useful to
refer to paragraph 26 of the said judgment, which reads thus:
"26. Where power is conferred to achieve a purpose it has been repeatedly reiterated
that the power must be exercised reasonably and in good faith to effectuate the
purpose. And in this context 'in good faith' means 'for legitimate reasons'. Where
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 16
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
power is exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations or reasons, it is
unquestionably a colourable exercise of power or fraud on power and the exercise of
power is vitiated. If the power to acquire land is to be exercised, it must be exercised
bona fide for the statutory purpose and for none other. If it is exercised for an
extraneous, irrelevant or non-germane consideration, the acquiring authority can be
charged with legal mala fides In such a situation there is no question of any personal
ill- will or motive. In Municipal Council of Sydney v. Compbell(1) it was observed that
irrelevant considerations on which power to acquire land is exercised, would vitiate
compulsory purchase orders or scheme depending on them. In State of Punjab v.
Gurdial Singh and Ors. acquisition of land for constructing a grain market was
challenged on the ground of legal malafides Upholding the challenge this Court
speaking through Krishna Iyer, J. explained the concept of legal malafides in his
hitherto inimitable language, diction and style and observed as under:
"Pithily put, bad faith which invalidates the exercise of power-sometimes called
colourable exercise or fraud on power and oftentimes overlaps motives, passions and
satisfactions-is the attainment of ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power by
simulation or pretension of gaining a legitimate goal. If the use of the power is for the
fulfilment of a legimate object the actuation or catalysation by malice is not legicidal.
The action is bad where the true object is to reach an end different from the one for
which the power is entrusted, goaded by extraneous considerations, good or bad, but
irrelevant to the entrustment. When the custodian of power is influenced in its
exercise by considerations outside those for promotion of which the power is vested
the court calls it a colourable exercise and is undeceived by illusion. In a broad,
blurred sense, Benjamin Disraeli was not off the mark even in Law when he stated: "I
repeat-that all power is a trust-that we are accountable for its exercise-that, from the
people, and for the people. all springs, and all must exist." After analysing the factual
matrix, it was concluded that the land was not needed for a Mandi which was the
ostensible purpose for which the land was sought to be acquired but in truth and
reality, the Mandi need was hijacked to reach the private destination of depriving an
enemy of his land through back-seat driving of the statutory engine. The notification
was declared invalid on the ground that it suffers from legal mala fides. The case
before us is much stronger, far more disturbing and unparalelled in influencing
official decision by sheer weight of personal clout. The District Magistrate was
chagrined to swallow the bitter pill that he was forced to acquire land even though he
was personally convinced there was no need but a pretence- Therefore, disagreeing
with the High Court, we are of the opinion that the power to acquire land was
exercised for an extraneous and irrelevent purpose and it was colourable exercise of
power, namely, to satisfy the chagrin and anguish of the Sammelan at the coming up
of a cinema theatre in the vicinity of its campus, which it vowed to destroy. Therefore,
the impugned notification has to be declared illegal and invalid for this additional
ground."
17. In the case of SRI BUDHIA SWAIN AND OTHERS v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 17
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
GOPINATH DEB AND OTHERS, reported in AIR 1999 SC 2089, Hon'ble Supreme Court, at
paragraphs 8 and 9 of the judgment, held as follows:
"8. In our opinion a tribunal or a court may recall an order earlier made by it if (i) the
proceedings culminating into an order suffer from the inherent lack of jurisdiction
and such lack of jurisdiction is patent, (ii) there exists fraud or collusion in obtaining
the judgment,
(iii) there has been a mistake of the court prejudicing a party or (iv) a judgment was
rendered in ignorance of the fact that a necessary party had not been served at all or
had died and the estate was not represented. The power to recall a judgment will not
be exercised when the ground for re-opening the proceedings or vacating the
judgment was available to be pleaded in the original action but was not done or
where a proper remedy in some other proceeding such as by way of appeal or revision
was available but was not availed. The right to seek vacation of a judgment may be
lost by waiver, estoppel or acquiescence.
9. A distinction has to be drawn between lack of jurisdiction and a mere error in
exercise of jurisdiction.
The former strikes at the very root of the exercise and want of jurisdiction may vitiate the
proceedings rendering them and the orders passed therein a nullity. A mere error in exercise of
jurisdiction does not vitiate the legality and validity of the proceedings and the order passed thereon
unless set aside in the manner known to law by laying a challenge subject to the law of limitation. In
Hira Lal Patni Vs. Sri Kali Nath AIR 1962 SC 199, it was held :-
".......The validity of a decree can be challenged in execution proceedings only on the
ground that the court which passed the decree was lacking in inherent jurisdiction in
the sense that it could not have seisin of the case because the subject matter was
wholly foreign to its jurisdiction or that the defendant was dead at the time the suit
had been instituted or decree passed, or some such other ground which could have
the effect of rendering the court entirely lacking in jurisdiction in respect of the
subject matter of the suit or over the parties to it."
18. It is to be mentioned here that the acceptance of writ petitions, despite having alternative
remedy, is a rule of practice and not of jurisdiction and in this regard, the Division Bench of this
Court in the case of U.M. RAMESH RAO AND OTHERS v.
UNION OF INDIA reported in 2021(3) AKR 345 at paragraphs 40 and 41 of the judgment has
observed thus:
"40. The following judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the aspect of
maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in the face of
an alternative remedy are referred to as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 18
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
(a) In Veerappa Pillai vs. Raman and Raman Ltd.., [AIR 1952 SC 192], it was
observed that where a particular statute provides a self-
contained machinery for determination of questions arising under the Act, the remedy that is
provided under the Act should be followed except in cases of acts, which are wholly without
jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or in violation of principles of natural justice or refusal to
exercise jurisdiction vested in them or there is an error on the face of the record and such act,
omission, error or excess has resulted in manifest injustice.
(b) Further, alternative remedy is no bar where a party comes to the Court with an allegation that
his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of
the legislature which enacted it and as such void, vide Bengal Immunity Co. vs. State of Bihar [AIR
1955 SC 661].
(c) Similarly, when a fundamental right is infringed, the bar for entertaining the writ petition and
granting relief on the ground of alternative remedy would not apply, vide State of Bombay vs. United
Motors Ltd. [AIR 1953 SC 252] and Himmat Lal vs. State of M.P. [AIR 1954 SC 403].
(d) The rule of alternate remedy being a bar to entertain a writ petition is a rule of practice and not
of jurisdiction. In appropriate cases, High Court may entertain a petition even if the aggrieved party
has not exhausted the remedies available under a statute before the departmental authorities, vide
State of West Bengal vs. North Adjai Cool Company [1971 (1) SCC 309].
(e) Further, alternative remedy must be effective. An appeal in all cases cannot be said to have
provided in all situations, where an appeal would be ineffective and writ petition in such a case is
maintainable, vide Ram and Shyam Company vs. State of Harayana [AIR 1985 SC 1147].
(f) Where an authority has acted without jurisdiction, High Court should not refuse to exercise its
jurisdiction under Article 226 on the ground of existence of alternative remedy vide Dr. Smt.
Kuntesh Gupta vs. Management H.K. Mahavidyaya [AIR 1987 SC 2186]. Thus, an alternative
remedy is not an absolute bar to the maintainability of a writ petition.
41. On the issue of maintainability of the writ petition, learned counsel for the appellants relied upon
the following decisions:
(a) In Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others,
[(1998) 8 SCC 1], (Whirlpool Corporation), at paragraph 15, it was observed that
under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of
the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But, the High
Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions, one of which is, if an effective and
efficacious remedy is available, the High Court would not normally exercise its
jurisdiction. But, the availability of an alternative remedy has been consistently held
not to operate as a bar in at least four contingencies, namely, where the writ petition
has been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where there
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 19
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or where the order or
proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.
In the said decision, reliance was also placed on Rashid Ahmad vs. Municipal Board, Kairana, [AIR
1950 SC 163], (Rashid Ahmad), to observe that where alternative remedy existed, it would be a
sound exercise of discretion to refuse to interfere in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution.
This proposition was, however, qualified by the significant words, "unless there are good grounds
therefor", which indicated that alternative remedy would not operate as an absolute bar and that
writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution could still be entertained in exceptional
circumstances.
Reference was also made to State of U.P. vs. Mohd. Nooh, , [AIR 1958 SC 86], (Mohd. Nooh),
wherein it was observed that the rule requiring the exhaustion of statutory remedies before the writ
will be granted, is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law and instances
are numerous where a writ of certiorari has been issued in spite of the fact that the aggrieved party
had other adequate legal remedies.
Ultimately, in paragraph 20 of Whirlpool Corporation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as
under: "Much water has since flown under the bridge, but there has been no corrosive effect on
these decisions which, though old, continue to hold the field with the result that law as to the
jurisdiction of the High Court in entertaining a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, in
spite of the alternative statutory remedies, is not affected, specially in a case where the authority
against whom the writ is filed is shown to have had no jurisdiction or had purported to usurp
jurisdiction without any legal foundation."
In the said case (Whirlpool Corporation), it was also observed that the High Court was not justified
in dismissing the writ petition at the initial stage without examining the contention that the show
cause notice issued to the appellant was wholly without jurisdiction.
In the said case, the Registrar of Trade Marks issued to the appellant therein a notice under Section
56(4) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 to show cause against the proposed
cancellation of appellants' Certificate of renewal. It was held that the issuance of such a notice by the
Registrar was without authority and it was quashed by the High Court.
(b) In State of H.P. and others vs. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Limited and Another, [(2005) 6SCC
499], (Gujarat Ambuja Cement Limited), a detailed discussion on the plea regarding alternative
remedy was made. It was held that the principle of alternative remedy is essentially a rule of policy,
convenience and discretion and never a rule of law. Despite the existence of an alternative remedy, it
is within the jurisdiction of discretion of the High Court to grant relief under Article 226 of the
Constitution. At the same time, it cannot be lost sight of the fact that though the matter relating to
an alternative remedy has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the case, normally the High Court
should not interfere if there is an adequate, efficacious, alternative remedy. If somebody approaches
the High Court without availing the alternative remedy, the High Court should ensure that he has
made out a strong case or that there exist good grounds to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 20
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
Court, in extraordinary circumstances, may exercise the power if it comes to the conclusion that
there has been a breach of principles of natural justice or procedure required for decision has not
been adopted. The rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of alternative remedy is a rule
of discretion and not one of compulsion and the Court must consider the pros and cons of the case
and then may interfere.
However, there are well recognized exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of statutory remedies.
First is, when the proceedings are taken before the forum under a provision of law which is ultra
vires, it is open to a party aggrieved thereby to move the High Court for quashing the proceedings on
the ground that they are incompetent without a party being obliged to wait until those proceedings
run their full course. Secondly, the doctrine has no application when the impugned order has been
made in violation of the principles of natural justice. Also, that where the proceedings itself are an
abuse of process of law the High Court in an appropriate case can entertain a writ petition. Where
under a statute there is an allegation of infringement of fundamental rights or when on the
undisputed facts the taxing authorities are shown to have assumed jurisdiction which they do not
possess can be the grounds on which the writ petitions can be entertained.
But, normally, the High Court should not entertain writ petitions unless it is shown that there is
something more in a case, something going to the root of the jurisdiction of the officer, something
which would show that it would be a case of palpable injustice to the writ petitioner to force him to
adopt the remedies provided by the statute. But, if the High Court had entertained a petition despite
availability of an alternative remedy, it would not be justifiable for the High Court to dismiss the
same on the ground of non-exhaustion of statutory remedies, unless the High Court finds that
factual disputes are involved and it would not be desirable to deal with them in a writ petition.
In the said case, the question was liability to pay purchase tax on the royalty paid by the
respondents, i.e., the holder of mining lease, where there was a price for removal of minerals and
thus, attracted liability to pay purchase tax. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said decision rejected
the plea that the High Court should not have entertained the writ petition. Thereafter, the question
relating to liability to pay purchase tax on royalty paid was taken up for consideration by discussing
on the meaning of the words "royalty", "dead rent", "mining lease". It was observed that royalty paid
by the holder of a mining lease under Section 9 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and
Development) Act, 1957 was not the price for removal of minerals and hence, did not attract liability
to pay purchase tax.
(c) In Embassy Property Developments Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka, [2019 SCC Online SC
1542], (Embassy Property), one of the preliminary questions that arose was whether the High Court
ought to interfere under Article 226/227 of the Constitution, with an Order passed by the National
Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in a proceeding under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016
(IBC), ignoring the availability of a statutory remedy of appeal to the National Company Law
Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and if so, under what circumstances.
In the said case, there is an exposition on the well recognised exceptions to the self-imposed
restraint of the High Courts, namely, in cases where a statutory alternative remedy of appeal is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 21
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
available, or there is lack of jurisdiction on the part of the statutory/quasi-judicial authority against
whose order judicial review is sought. It was observed that an "error of jurisdiction" was always
distinguished from "in excess of jurisdiction", till the judgment of the House of Lords in Anisminic
Ltd. Vs. Foreign Compensation Commission [(1969) 2 WLR 163] (Anisminic). In Anisminic, the real
question was not, whether, an authority made a wrong decision but whether they enquired into and
decided a matter on which they had no right to consider. It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court that just four days before the House of Lords delivered the judgment in Anisminic, an
identical view was taken by a three judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in West Bengal &
Others vs. Sachindra Nath Chatterjee & Another, [(1969) 3 SCR 92], (Sachindra Nath Chatterjee)
wherein the view taken by the Full Bench of Calcutta High Court in Hirday Nath Roy vs.
Ramachandra Barna Sarma, [ILR LXVIII Calcutta 138], (Hirday Nath Roy) was approved. It was
held therein that "before a Court can be held to have jurisdiction to decide a particular matter, it
must not only have jurisdiction to try the suit brought, but must also have the authority to pass the
orders sought for." This would mean that the jurisdiction must include
(i) the power to hear and decide the questions at issue and (ii) the power to grant the relief asked
for. Ultimately, in paragraph 24, it was observed as follows: "Therefore, insofar as the question of
exercise of the power conferred by Article 226 of the Constitution, despite the availability of a
statutory alternative remedy, is concerned, Anisminic cannot be relied upon." The distinction
between the lack of jurisdiction and the wrongful exercise of the available jurisdiction should
certainly be taken into account by High Courts, when Article 226 of the Constitution is sought to be
invoked bypassing a statutory, alternative remedy provided by a special statute.
In the said case, the question was, as to, whether, the NCLT lacked the jurisdiction to issue a
direction in relation to a matter covered by Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,
1957 (MMDR Act) and the Statutory Rules issued thereunder; or, there was mere wrongful exercise
of a recognised jurisdiction, for instance, asking a wrong question or applying a wrong test or
granting a wrong relief. On a detailed discussion, it was held that the NCLT did not have jurisdiction
to entertain an application against the Government of Karnataka for a direction to execute
Supplemental Lease Deeds for the extension of the mining lease. Since, NCLT chose to exercise
jurisdiction not vested in it in law, the High Court of Karnataka was justified in entertaining the writ
petition, on the basis that NCLT was coram non judice. In the instant case, the State of Karnataka
had invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution without taking
recourse to the appellate remedy under NCLAT. It was held that the judicial review was permissible
and the High Court was justified in entertaining the writ petition assailing the order of the NCLT,
directing execution of a supplemental lease deed for the extension of the mining lease.
(d) Learned Senior counsel appearing for the respondent in Writ Appeal No.538 of 2020 placed
reliance on Authorised Officer, State Bank of Travancore and another vs. Mathew K.C. [(2018) 3
SCC 85], (Mathew K.C.) wherein it was observed that SARFAESI Act is a complete Code by itself,
providing for expeditious recovery of dues arising out of loans granted by financial institutions. The
remedy of appeal by the aggrieved under Section 17 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, followed by
a right to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 18 was adequately provided under the
Act. Therefore, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition in view of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 22
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
adequate alternative statutory remedies available. In that case, an interim order granted by the High
Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, staying further proceedings at
the stage of Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act, on certain deposit to be made was questioned. It
was observed that the writ petition ought not have been entertained and interim order granted for
the mere asking without assigning special reasons, that too, without even granting opportunity to
the other side to contest the maintainability of the writ petition and failure to notice the subsequent
developments in the interregnum. In the said case, it was also observed that the discretionary
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution is not absolute but had to be exercised judiciously
in the given facts of a case and in accordance with law.
The normal rule is that a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution ought not to be
entertained if alternate statutory remedies are available, except in cases falling within the well
defined exceptions as observed in Commissioner of Income Tax and Others vs. Chhabil Dass
Agarwal, [(2014) 1 SCC 603], (Chhabil Dass Agarwal). In the latter decision, it has been held that the
exceptions to the rule of non-interference when efficacious, alternative remedy is available are as
under which are illustrative and non-exhaustive:
(i) where remedy available under statute is not effective but only mere formality with
no substantial relief;
(ii) where statutory authority not acted in accordance with provisions of enactment in
question, or;
(iii) where statutory authority acted in defiance of fundamental principles of judicial
procedure, or;
(iv) where statutory authority resorted to invoke provisions which are repealed, or;
(v) where statutory authority passed an order in total violation of principles of
natural justice.
(e) In United Bank of India vs. Satyawati Tondon and others, [(2010) 8 SCC 110],
(Satyawati Tondon) it was observed that it is true that the rule of exhaustion of
alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of compulsion, but it is difficult
to fathom any reason why the High Court should entertain a petition filed under
Article 226 of the Constitution and pass interim order ignoring the fact that the
petitioner can avail effective, alternative remedy by filing an application, appeal,
revision, etc. and the particular legislation contains a detailed mechanism for
redressal of his grievance.
(f) Of course in ICICI Bank Limited vs Umakanta Mohapatra and others, [(2019) 13
SCC 497], (Umakanta Mohapatra), it was held, the writ petition was not maintainable
and therefore, allowed the appeals.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37847902/ 23
Valerial Sequeria vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 26 September, 2022
(g) In Authorised Officer, State Bank of India vs. Allwyn Alloys Private Limited and
others, [(2018) 8 SCC 120], the Hon'ble Supreme Court opined that Section 34 of the
SARFAESI Act clearly bars filing of a civil suit. No civil court can exercise jurisdiction
to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which a DRT or DRAT is
empowered by or under the Act to determine and no injunction can be granted by any
court or authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any
power conferred by or under the Act."
19. Following the aforementioned law declared by this Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court
referred to above, I am of the view that the impugned awards dated 22nd January, 2021
(Annexure-A) impugned in Writ Petitions No.10525, 13547 and 8458 of 2021 and Order dated 27th
January, 2021 (Annexure-A) passed in Writ Petition No.10780 of 2021 are liable to be quashed,
accordingly quashed. In the result, writ petitions are allowed.
