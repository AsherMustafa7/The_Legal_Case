3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner was the informant of Rivilganj
P.S. Case No. 195 of 2019 in which private respondents were made accused. The trial proceeded in
the matter vide Case No./R.No.5269/2019. However, the accused persons made an imposter appear
before the learned trial court and a compromise petition was filed. The evidence of the imposter was
recorded and the accused persons were acquitted. When the petitioner came to know about all these
facts, she made enquiry and, thereafter, she came to know about the mischief committed by the
accused persons. The learned trial court did not look into the fact that the vakalatnama filed on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184317837/ 2
Kiran Devi vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 15 October, 2025
behalf of imposter was unsigned and the signature and thumb impression of the petitioner were
different on compromise petition. When the petitioner filed an application for making enquiry
under Section 379 of BNSS. The learned trial court did not pass any orders. The learned counsel
further submits that the CCTV footage of the court concerned and premise also needs to be
preserved for 05.07.2025, 16.07.2025 and 19.07.2025 when the person impersonating the petitioner
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.2617 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 appeared and certain documents had
been brought on record at the instance of such imposter.
4. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State-respondents submits that appropriate
orders may be passed in this case.
5. At this stage, this Court is not concerned with the other prayers of the petitioner. The concern of
the Court is only with regard to the fact that when the application has been filed on 01.08.2025
under Section 379 of BNSS, the learned Judicial Magistrte, 1st Class, Saran at Chapra failed to pass
any orders.
6. Since there is specific submission of learned counsel for the petitioner that no orders have been
passed on the application dated 01.08.2025 of the petitioner filed under Section 379 of BNSS, I
think it appropriate that the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Saran at Chapra be directed to
pass orders on the application of the petitioner. At the same time, the learned Principal District &
Sessions Judge, Saran at Chapra is also required to preserve the CCTV footage from 05.07.2025 to
19.07.2025 for the court concerned and the premises, if not already deleted, considering the serious
nature of allegation.
7. Therefore, the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 st Class, Patna High Court CR. WJC No.2617 of 2025
dt.15-10-2025 Sarana at Chapra is directed to dispose of the application dated 01.08.2025 filed by
the petitioner under Section 379 of BNSS at the earliest preferably within a period of four weeks
from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order in accordance with law.
8. At the same time, learned Principal District & Sessions Judge, Saran at Chapra is requested to
preserve the CCTV footage of 05.07.2025 till 19.07.2025 for the court concerned and the premises, if
not already deleted.
9. With the aforementioned observations/directions, the instant writ petition stands disposed of.
