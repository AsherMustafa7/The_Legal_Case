Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 324, 307 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25/27 of Arms

No.35524/2018 and second application was also dismissed vide order dated 04.12.2018, passed in
M.Cr.C. No.41535/2018.
As per the prosecution case, on 18.06.2018 at about 11:00- 11:30 pm, the complainant Akash along
with Karan Thakur, Mujeeb, Faraz and Aasu were coming back from Raisen towards Bhopal after
taking dinner from Mana Dhaba. The applicants along with other co- accused persons with intention
to kill the complainant dashed their motorcycle by Scorpio Jeep on account of which the
complainant Akash and Karan Singh fell in to the trench situated by the side of the road. They also
dashed the motorcycle of Mujeeb, Faraz and Aasu, on account of which they also fell into the trench.
The accused Noshe, armed with gun fired on Karan Thakur. Karan Thakur received gunshot injury
on his back. The accused Sheru and Laik armed with knives, caused injuries on the hands of Karan
Thakur. The applicants Shannu and Juber, armed with knives, caused injuries on the legs of Karan
Thakur.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicants have been falsely implicated in this
case. They have not committed any offence. It is also submitted that most of the important witnesses
have been examined before the trial Court and they have not The High Court Of Madhya Pradesh
MCRC-2228-2019 (SHANNU @ IKBAL AND ANOTHER Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)
supported the prosecution case. It is also submitted that the injured Karan Thakur had not yet been
examined because he himself is a person of vast criminal record and is reluctant to come forward for
examination before the trial Court. In this regard, the applicant has submitted order-sheets of the
trial Court. It is also submitted that the injuries which are found on the body of the complainant and

Karan Thakur are not the injuries inflicted by the applicants or by the co- accused persons, but those
injuries have been sustained by them in some accident, which is clear from the Medico Legal Report
dated 19.06.2018 in which it is specifically mentioned that Karan Thakur was admitted in the
hospital with the history of road traffic accident by unknown four wheeler at Raisen Road, although
the incidence said to have taken place on 18.06.2018 at about 11:00-11:30 pm. It is further
submitted that the applicants are permanent resident of the address shown in the application. It is
further submitted that the applicants have been in custody since 02.07.2018. In view of the
aforesaid, prayer is made to enlarge the applicants on regular bail.
Learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State on the other hand has opposed the application and
submitted that the injured Karan Thakur was severely attacked by the applicants and other
co-accused persons. It is also submitted that there is no need to scrutinize the statements of
prosecution witnesses as the same is required during the judgment. In view of the aforesaid, it has
been prayed that this third application for bail under Section 439 filed on behalf of the applicants be
dismissed.
On perusal of the case diary and documents produced on record it seems that after rejection of
second application, the statements of Dr. Dinesh Khatri (PW-7) and Monu Malviya (PW-8) have
been recorded. On going through the order-sheets, dated 08.01.2019 and 19.01.2019, it shows that
the main witness Karan Thakur is reluctant to appear in the trial Court for his examination. On
30.11.2018 summons have also been issued in which it is specifically mentioned The High Court Of
Madhya Pradesh MCRC-2228-2019 (SHANNU @ IKBAL AND ANOTHER Vs THE STATE OF
MADHYA PRADESH) that Karan Thakur is vagrant and drug addict. There is no fixed time to his
remaining present at his home. It also appears from the list of criminal antecedents of Karan Thakur
that only in Police Station- Station Bajariya, Bhopal, 23 criminal cases of different nature i.e under
the Indian Penal Code, the Gambling Act, the Excise Act, etc. have been registered. Some
proceedings under National Security Act has also been registered against the said witness in Police
Station- Station Bajariya, Bhopal. Most of the important witnesses have been examined before the
trial Court but they have not supported the prosecution case in regard to applicants participation in
the said crime. As far as the evidence of injured Karan Singh is concerned, looking to his conduct, it
seems that in near future his examination is not possible.
However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case in their entirety, particularly the
fact as pointed out by the learned counsel for the applicants, in the opinion of this Court, it would
not be proper to keep the applicants in custody for the remainder of the trial.
Consequently, this third application for bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
filed on behalf of applicants- Shannu @ Ikbal Khan and Juber @ Shamsher, stands allowed.
It is directed that the applicants shall be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum
of Rs.30,000/- with one solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court
for their appearance before that Court on all dates fixed in the case and for complying with the
conditions enumerated under Section 437 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
