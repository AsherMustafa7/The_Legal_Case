Md. Wahidur Rahman vs The Union Of India Through The Secretary on 18 April, 2023
directing the respondents to re-instate/take back the petitioner in service with all consequential
benefits.
[2] The brief facts of the present case is that, the petitioner was enlisted in the CRPF on 28-11-2005
as Constable, General Duty (CT/GD) and after completion of his basic training at Lidhra Camp,
Jalandhar (Punjab), he was taken on the strength of 183 Bn., CRPF and he performed his duties as a
CRPF personnel till his removal from service w.e.f, 25-10- 2012.
[3] While the petitioner was serving as CRPF personnel, the competent authorities of the CRPF
carried out a verification process of the educational certificates in respect of all forces recruited
during the last 5 (five) years including the case of the petitioner. During the process of verification of
the educational certificates in respect of the petitioner, the Deputy WP(C) No. 799 of 2016 Page 2
Director (Evaluation), National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) wrote a letter dated 27-04-2010
to the Deputy Commandant (ADM), Office of the DIGP, Group Centre, CRPF, Srinagar (J & K)
stating, inter alia, that the photo copy of the petitioner's certificate sent for verification was not
genuine and appeared to be tampered/fake, inasmuch as, the date of birth recorded in the certificate
of the petitioner which was sent for verification did not match with the date of birth of the petitioner
recorded in the record maintained by the NIOS. In the said letter, the authorities of the CRPF were
also requested to send the original documents for any additional comments. Subsequently, after
verification of the original mark statement of the petitioner, the Deputy Director (Evaluation), NIOS
sent another letter dated 18-10-2011 to the Commandant, 183 Bn. CRPF, stating that the earlier
verification report dated 27-04- 2010 in respect of the petitioner was correct as per the record
maintained by the NIOS and that the original document sent for verification was tampered with.
[4] On the basis of the verification report sent by the authorities of the NIOS, a departmental
enquiry was initiated against the petitioner by issuing a memorandum dated 13-02- 2012 framing
the following two charges against the petitioner :-
"Article -1 That force No. 055154391 Sepoy/G.D Mohammad Wahidur Rehmand
working on the post of Sepoy/GD in 183 Battalion and being member of Central
reserve Police force, committed misconduct/misbehavior under section 11 (1) of
Central reserve police force Act, 1949, wherein, the personnel filed fake certificate at
the time of recruitment in C.R.P.F and was recruited. The said certificate was got
verified by the education board in connection with education No. A/04 023913
affiliated with National MuktaVidyalayShikshaSansthan District TautamBudh Nagar
(U.P) and the certificate filed by the personnel was found fake.

Md. Wahidur Rahman vs The Union Of India Through The Secretary on 18 April, 2023
That at the time of recruitment in the force, your date of birth is 07-02-1985
according to the educational certificate produced by you and your age was 20 years
09 months 21 days but according to the verification report obtained by this office
your date of birth is marked 04-05-1988 and accordingly at the time of recruitment
your age comes to 17 years 5 months 24 days. It appears from it that for the purpose
of recruitment in the force, you depended on false educational certificate which is
punishable offence under Section 11 (1) of C.R.P.F Act, 1949"
[5] After completion of the departmental enquiry held against the petitioner and on the basis of the
report submitted by the Enquiry Officer, the Commandant, 183 Bn, CRPF, Pulwama issued an order
dated 25-10-2010 imposing punishment of removal from service upon the petitioner w.e.f.,
25-10-2012. Having been aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal to the DIGP, Group Centre,
CRPF, Srinagar (J&K) on 12-11-2012, however, the said appeal was rejected by the appellate
authority by issuing an order dated 28-03-2014. Having been not satisfied, the petitioner again
preferred a revision petition to the IGP, CRPF, Srinagar Sector, J&K on 27- 01-2016. The said
revision was also dismissed by an order dated - May, 2016 issued by the IGP, CRPF, Srinagar Sector
(J&K). Having been aggrieved, the petitioner approached this Court by filing the present writ
petition for redressing his grievance.
[6] Mr. K. Roshan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the correct date of
birth of the petitioner is 07-02-1985 and not 04-05-1988. The correct date of birth of the petitioner
is recorded in his birth certificate, all his educational certificates/documents and other official
documents. The learned counsel also submitted that in the identity card issued to the petitioner by
the Regional Director, NIOS, while WP(C) No. 799 of 2016 Page 4 studying Secondary course, his
date of birth is recorded as 07- 02-1985. It has also been submitted that at the time of declaration of
the secondary examination results of NIOS in 2004, the date of birth of the petitioner is recorded as
07-02- 1985. In the original mark statement issued in favor of the petitioner for passing Secondary
School Examination, the provisional certificate for passing Secondary School Examination and
Migration certificate - cum- transfer certificate issued in favor of the petitioner on 28-07-2004, the
correct date of birth of the petitioner i.e., 07-02-1985 is recorded. [7] The learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner submitted that at the time of submitting application forms for the post of
Constable (GD) in CRPF, the petitioner gave his date of birth as 07-02-1985 and also enclosed a
copy of the migration certificate issued by the NIOS after passing the Secondary School
Examination, the mark statement of passing Secondary School Examination and his birth
certificate, wherein, his date of birth is recorded as 07-02-1985 and that the petitioner never make
any alteration or tampered with his date of birth. It has also been submitted that the petitioner
simply submitted his educational certificates/documents issued by the NIOS in testimony of his
educational qualifications and date of birth and there is no question of making any alteration or
tampering with his date of birth. The learned counsel further submitted that in the relevant records
maintained by the NIOS, the concerned authorities have wrongly recorded the petitioner's date of
birth as 04-05-1988 instead of the correct date of birth i.e., 07-02- 1985 and accordingly, at the time
of verification process, the authorities of NIOS gave the report that the mark statement of WP(C)
No. 799 of 2016 Page 5 the petitioner was not original and appeared to be tampered/fake. The
learned counsel vehemently submitted that when the petitioner approached the concerned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9948297/ 3
Md. Wahidur Rahman vs The Union Of India Through The Secretary on 18 April, 2023
authorities of the NIOS for correction of his date of birth recorded in the official records maintained
by the NIOS by submitting an application along with all supporting documents, such as his identity
card, migration certificate, provisional certificate, result of the secondary examination, birth
certificate etc., wherein, the petitioner's date of birth is recorded as 07-02-1985, the authorities of
the NIOS corrected the date of birth of the petitioner wrongly entered in the records maintained by
the NIOS and thereafter, issued a fresh certificate for having pass the secondary examination held in
the month of June, 2004 in favor of the petitioner on 28-06-2012. The learned counsel accordingly
submitted that the reports given by the Deputy Director (Evaluation), NIOS on 27-04-2010 and
18-10-2011 at the time of verification process to the effect that the mark statement in respect of the
petitioner was not genuine and appeared to be tampered/fake was given on the basis of the wrong
entry of the date of birth of the petitioner in the record maintained by the institute and not on the
basis of any tampering or alteration made by the petitioner in his mark statement and as such, the
petitioner cannot be penalized for the mistake committed by the authorities of the NIOS and he is
entitled to re-instatement in his service along with all consequential benefits.
[8] Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI appearing for the respondents submitted that keeping in view
instances of large number of enlistment in the CRPF on the basis of fake WP(C) No. 799 of 2016
Page 6 educational certificates and as per existing instructions issued by the higher authorities, the
Group Centre, CRPF, Srinagar (J&K) carried out verification of educational certificates in respect of
all force personnel recruited during the last five years including the case of the petitioner. In the said
verification process of his secondary mark statement, the Deputy Director (Evaluation), NIOS wrote
a letter dated 27-04-2010 stating that the date of birth recorded in the mark statement submitted by
the petitioner and his date of birth recorded in the records maintained by the institute does not tally
and that the said mark statement of the petitioner appeared to be tampered/fake and also
requesting for sending the original documents for any additional comments. On the basis of the said
letter, the authorities of the CRPF send the original mark statement of the petitioner for verification
and after carrying out verification process, the Deputy Direction (Evaluation), NIOS again wrote a
letter dated 18-10-2011 stating that the earlier report sent by him was correct as per their record and
that the original document sent for verification was tampered with. [9] The learned DSGI submitted

Officer, the competent authority of the CRPF issued the impugned orders imposing upon the

WP(C) No. 799 of 2016 Page 8
[11] The learned DSGI submitted that taking into
consideration the above quoted letter of the Deputy Director, NIOS, the authorities of the CRPF
rejected the statutory appeal as well as the revision petition filed by the petitioner and that there is
no ground whatsoever for interfering with the impugned orders and for granting relief sought for by
the petitioner. The learned DSGI accordingly prays for dismissing the present writ petition as being
devoid of merit.
[12] I have heard the rival arguments advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties at
length and also carefully examined the materials available on record.
The core issue which needs to be considered by this Court in the present writ petition is whether
there was actually any alteration or tampering made in the secondary mark statement of the
petitioner especially in respect of the date of birth of the petitioner or whether the reports of the
Deputy Director (Evaluation), NIOS under his letter dated 27-04-2010 and 18-10-2011 to the effect
that the said secondary mark statement of the petitioner appeared to be tampered/fake was given
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9948297/ 5
Md. Wahidur Rahman vs The Union Of India Through The Secretary on 18 April, 2023
only on the basis of the wrong entry of the date of birth of the petitioner in the records maintained
by the authorities of the NIOS.
[13] I have carefully examined the identity card of the petitioner issued by the Regional Director,
NIOS while studying secondary course and in the said identity card, the date of birth of the
petitioner is recorded as 07-02-1985. In the secondary examination result of the NIOS in respect of
the petitioner, his date of birth is also recorded as 07-02-1985. So also in the migration certificate
and provisional certificate issued on 28-07-
WP(C) No. 799 of 2016 Page 9 2004 in favor of the petitioner after passing the secondary school
examination held in the month of June, 2004, the petitioner's date of birth is recorded as
07-02-1985. In the petitioner's original mark statement of passing the secondary school
examination and in the birth certificate issued in favor of the petitioner, his date of birth is recorded
as 07-02-1985. It is not the case of the respondents that the petitioner alter or tamper his date of
birth recorded in his original secondary mark statement or that the said mark statement is not
found to be original. In fact, the case of the respondents is that in the process of verification of his
original mark statement, the competent authorities had given the report that the date of birth of the
petitioner as recorded in his mark statement does not tally with the date of birth recorded in the
records maintained by the NIOS and that the authorities of the NIOS has given a report that the said
secondary mark statement of the petitioner was not genuine and appeared to be tampered/fake.
Only on the basis of such report, the service of the petitioner was terminated. [14] On careful
examination of the materials available on record, this Court is of the considered view that at the time
of verification of the secondary mark statement of the petitioner, the concerned authorities of the
NIOS did not take into consideration the result of the secondary examination held in the month of
June, 2004 wherein, the date of birth of the petitioner is recorded as 07-02-1985. The authorities
also did not take into consideration the identity card of the petitioner issued by the Regional
Director, NIOS while studying secondary course, the migration certificate issued on 28-07-2004
after passing the secondary school examination, the provisional WP(C) No. 799 of 2016 Page 10
certificate of the petitioner issued on 28-07-2004 after passing the secondary school examination as
well as the birth certificate of the petitioner wherein, the date of birth of the petitioner is recorded as
07-02-1985. In my considered view, the Deputy Director (Evaluation),NIOS gave the report under
his letters dated 27-04-2010 and 18-10-2011 that the said secondary mark statement of the
petitioner was not genuine and appeared to be tampered/fake only on the basis of wrong entry of
the date of birth of the petitioner in the records maintained by the NIOS. There is also no finding
from the authorities to the effect that the aforesaid identity card of the petitioner, the result sheet of
the secondary school examination of the NIOS held in the month of June, 2004, the migration
certificate issued in favor of the petitioner on 28-07-2004, the provisional certificate issued in favor
of the petitioner on 28-07-2004, the birth certificate of the petitioner, wherein the date of birth of
the petitioner is recorded as 07-02-1985, are not genuine and that all these documents are fake
documents.
[15] In view of the above, this Court came to the conclusion that the report of the Deputy Director
(Evaluation), NIOS under his letters dated 27-04-2010 and 18-10-2011 was given only on the basis
of the wrong entry of the date of birth of the petitioner in the records maintained by the NIOS.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9948297/ 6
Md. Wahidur Rahman vs The Union Of India Through The Secretary on 18 April, 2023
It is also on record that the wrong entry of the date of birth of the petitioner in the records
maintained by the NIOS had also been subsequently corrected by recording the petitioner's correct
date of birth as 07-02-1985 instead of 04-05- 1988 as reflected in the letter dated 20-05-2013 of the
Deputy Director, NIOS and thereafter, a new mark statement/certificate WP(C) No. 799 of 2016
Page 11 of passing the secondary examination held in the month of June, 2004 had been issued in
favor of the petitioner. After such correction of the record maintained by the NIOS, especially the
wrong entry of the date of birth of the petitioner, there is actually no ground to support the claim
that the Secondary mark statement of the petitioner is not genuine and appeared to be
tampered/fake.
[16] In view of the above, this Court is of the considered view that the petitioner has been wrongly
penalized for no fault on his part and for the mistake committed by the authorities of the NIOS.
Accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that the penalty imposed upon the petitioner under
the impugned orders is not sustainable in the eyes of law.
[17] In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case and for the findings and reasons given
herein above, the present writ petition is disposed of with the following directions :-
(i) The respondents or the concerned authorities of the CRPF are directed to re-verify
the genuineness of the secondary mark statement of the petitioner with the
concerned authorities of the NIOS or any such authorities more particularly with
reference to the date of birth of the petitioner by taking into consideration all the
relevant documents of the petitioner and to complete the process of re-verification
within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
(ii) After completion of the re-verification process within the stipulated period, if it is
found that there is no variance or doubt about the genuineness of the WP(C) No. 799
of 2016 Page 12 secondary mark statement of the petitioner more particularly, the
date of birth of the petitioner, the impugned orders dated 25-10-2012, 28-03-2014
and -
05, 2016 shall be cancelled and the petitioner shall be re- instated in service immediately w.e.f., the
date of his termination i.e., 25-10-2012 with all consequential service benefits except back wages.
With the aforesaid directions, the present writ petition is disposed of. Parties are to bear their own
cost.
