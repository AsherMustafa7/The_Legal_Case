with 401 of Criminal Procedure Code to set aside the conviction imposed
in the judgment dated 28.01.2016 made in C.A.No.30 of 2015 on the file
of the Principal Sessions Court, Namakkal, confirming the judgment dated
19.06.2015 made in S.T.C.No.62 of 2014 on the file of the learned Judicial

ORDER
This Criminal Revision Case has been preferred challenging the judgment of the Principal Sessions
Court, Namakkal dated 19.06.2015 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis made in C.A.No.30 of 2015,
confirming the judgment dated 19.06.2015 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Fast Track
Court made in S.T.C.No.66 of 2014.
2. This case has arisen out of an alleged cheque transaction between the petitioner and the
respondent. The respondent has filed a private complaint under Section 138 of N.I.Act against the
respondent on the allegations that on 16.11.2013 the petitioner had availed a loan of Rs.7,00,000/-
from him and assured to repay the same within one month. On the same day itself he gave a post
dated cheque dated 16.12.2013 drawn on HDFC bank, Tiruchengode. The respondent put the cheque

A.Sabarinathan vs G.Balakrishnan on 24 November, 2021
for collection through his Canara bank, Tiruchengode branch and the cheque was returned on
13.01.2014 for the reason that there was no sufficient funds on the account of the petitioner. After
issuing the statutory notice and after complying the legal mandates, the respondent has filed a
private complaint against the accused under Section 138 of N.I.Act. During the course of trial on the
side of the complaint, 2 witnesses were examined as PW.1 and PW.2 and Exhibits P1 to P14 were
marked. On the side of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis accused, the accused himself got
examined as DW.1 and Ex.D1 is marked.
3. After considering the materials on records, the learned trial Judge has found the accused guilty
under Section 138 N.I.Act and convicted and sentenced him to undergo S.I for 18 months and
imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- ; in default to undergo 4 months S.I. Aggrieved over that the accused
has preferred an appeal before the Principal Sessions Court, Namakkal in C.A.No.30 of 2014. The
said appeal was also dismissed by confirming the judgment of the trial Court. Now this Criminal
Revision case has been filed by the petitioner/accused challenging the judgment passed in
C.A.No.30 of 2014.
4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondent
5. Points for Cosideration:-
The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the respondent/complainant
did not have any financial wherewithals to give a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
loan of Rs.7,00,000/- to the accused and hence the cheque was not issued for legally
enforceable debt. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the
connected case filed on the same day against the respondent on the basis of the
cheque given for a value of Rs.8,00,000/-
by the accused was dismissed on the ground that the respondent/complainant did
not prove his means successfully before the Court and hence this case should have
also been dismissed.
6. The relationship between the accused and the complainant is not in dispute. The complainant is
said to be the maternal uncle of the petitioner. The petitioner did not deny the execution of the
impugned cheque. His only contention is that the cheque was not given to the respondent for
discharge of any legally enforceable debt. But he had given the cheque by way of security to one
Prema and the same cheque was misused by the respondent for the purpose of filing the case against
him. The next submission of the petitioner/accused is that the respondent did not have means to
lend a heavy amount of Rs.7,00,000/- as loan to him. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7. The respondent has alleged that the said amount of Rs.7,00,000/- was generated by him by
selling his property, from and out of his retirement benefits, by pledging jewels in the name of the
accused and his wife. The attention of this Court was drawn to the evidence of PW.1 wherin he has
stated that he had got retirement benefit on 31.08.2011 and it was to the tune of Rs.7,00,000/-. The
respondent/complainant was working as a staff in TNSTC and he retired from service on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185869716/ 2
A.Sabarinathan vs G.Balakrishnan on 24 November, 2021
31.08.2011. According to his evidence he got the retirement amount within 10 months of his
retirement. If so, he ought to have got the amount during June 2012, but the transaction in question
relates to the year 2013 only.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioner produced the account statement of the respondent to show
that he did not have an outstanding of Rs.7,00,000/- between the period from 31.08.2011 to
07.1.2014. From the statement of accounts, it is seen that the respondent had held only a paltry sum
of Rs.473/- as the outstanding. The receipts for pledging the receipts
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis have been produced as Ex.P.8, Ex.P9, Ex.P.11 and Ex.P12 and they
would show that the total amount involved in those receipts are Rs.3,00,000/- only. Out of these
Ex.P8 and Ex.P10 stand in the names of the wife of the accused Sumathi and they are dated
03.01.2013 and 06.12.2013. Another receipt dated 15.01.2013 stands in the name of the accused and
it is for Rs.67,000/-. The dates of these receipts have got no relevance to the date of the transaction
between the petitioner and the respondent and the impugned cheques. Even if it is presumed that
the respondent had arranged finance through some other sources and later raised the money by
pledging it through Ex.P.11 and Ex.P.12, the total sum comes to Rs1,54,000/- only. Further, it is
difficult to believe that the wife of the accused and accused themselves have consented to pledge the
jewels to raise money and then give it to the respondent for the purpose of getting it as loan from
him. If the respondent claims that the jewels which were pledged in the name of the accused and his
wife were belonging to him, then also it is difficult to understand why he had chosen to pledge them
in the names of the accused and his wife. Apart from PW.1 no other independent witness has been
examined to substantiate the manner in which the respondent had raised
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the sum of Rs.7,00,000/-.
9. The respondent was working as a driver in TNSTC and he did not have any other source of
income. He has not received 7,00,000/- as retirement benefits and no such entries are found to be
made in his bank account during the relevant period.
10. The Courts below have chosen to give the benefit of sec.139 of N.I.Act in favour of the
respondent. The petitioner/accused did not deny the execution of cheque. Hence as per Section 139
of N.I.Act, it has to be presumed that the cheque was issued only towards discharging a legally
enforceable debt and the holder of the cheque has got the right to recover it from the executor.
However, the said presumption is subject to rebuttal evidence that might be given by the accused in
order to prove the contrary. The accused had examined as DW.1 and he reiterated in his evidence
that he had given the cheques to one Prema by way of security for the chit amount and that has been
misused by the respondent/complainant. It has been already observed that the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis respondent/complainant has not proved his source for
Rs.7,00,000/-.
11. The improbabilities and unrealistic circumstances existing in the evidence of the
respondent/complainant can also serve as the preponderance of probabilities of the defence
statement for the purpose of rebuttal proof. The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in Basalingappa -vs- Mudibasappa reported in
2019 (5) SCC 418 in support of the above legal point. In the said judgement it is held as under:-

A.Sabarinathan vs G.Balakrishnan on 24 November, 2021
“13. This Court in Bharat Barrel & Drum Mfg. Co. v.
Amin Chand Payrelal [Bharat Barrel & Drum Mfg. Co. v. Amin Chand Payrelal,
(1999) 3 SCC 35] had occasion to consider Section 118(a) of the Act. This Court held
that once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under
Section 118(a) would arise that it is supported by a consideration. Such a
presumption is rebuttable and defendant can prove the non-existence of a
consideration by raising a probable defence. In para 12, the following has been laid
down : (SCC pp. 50-51) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis “12. Upon consideration of
various judgments as noted hereinabove, the position of law which emerges is that
once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under Section
118(a) would arise that it is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is
rebuttable. The defendant can prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a
probable defence. If the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial onus of
proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the
same was illegal, the onus would shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove it
as a matter of fact and upon his failure to prove would disentitle him to the grant of
relief on the basis of the negotiable instrument. The burden upon the defendant of
proving the non-existence of the consideration can be either direct or by bringing on
record the preponderance of probabilities by reference to the circumstances upon
which he relies. In such an event, the plaintiff is entitled under law to rely upon all
the evidence led in the case including that of the plaintiff as well. In case, where the
defendant fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non-existence of
the consideration, the plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of
presumption arising under Section 118(a) in his favour. The court may not insist
upon the defendant to disprove the existence of consideration by leading direct
evidence as the existence of negative evidence is neither possible nor
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis contemplated and even if led, is to be seen with a
doubt. The bare denial of the passing of the consideration apparently does not appear
to be any defence.
Something which is probable has to be brought on record for getting the benefit of
shifting the onus of proving to the plaintiff. To disprove the presumption, the
defendant has to bring on record such facts and circumstances upon consideration of
which the court may either believe that the consideration did not exist or its
non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would, under the circumstances of
the case, shall act upon the plea that it did not exist.”
14. S.B. Sinha, J. in M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala [M.S. Narayana Menon
v. State of Kerala, (2006) 6 SCC 39 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 30] had considered Sections
118(a), 138 and 139 of the Act, 1881. It was held that presumptions both under
Sections 118(a) and 139 are rebuttable in nature.

Explaining the expressions “may presume” and “shall presume” referring to an earlier judgment, the
following was held in para 28 : (SCC p. 49) “28. What would be the effect of the expressions “may
presume”, “shall presume” and “conclusive proof” has been considered by this Court in Union of
India v. Pramod Gupta [Union of India v. Pramod Gupta, (2005) 12 SCC 1] , in the following terms :
(SCC pp.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 30-31, para 52) ‘52.…It is true that the legislature used two
different phraseologies “shall be presumed” and “may be presumed” in Section 42 of the Punjab
Land Revenue Act and furthermore although provided for the mode and manner of rebuttal of such
presumption as regards the right to mines and minerals said to be vested in the Government vis-à-
vis the absence thereof in relation to the lands presumed to be retained by the landowners but the
same would not mean that the words “shall presume” would be conclusive. The meaning of the
expressions “may presume” and “shall presume” have been explained in Section 4 of the Evidence
Act, 1872, from a perusal whereof it would be evident that whenever it is directed that the court shall
presume a fact it shall regard such fact as proved unless disproved. In terms of the said provision,
thus, the expression “shall presume” cannot be held to be synonymous with “conclusive proof”.’ ”
15. It was noted in M.S. Narayana Menon case [M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala, (2006) 6
SCC 39 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 30] , that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis expression “shall
presume” cannot be held to be synonymous with conclusive proof. Referring to definition of words
“proved” and “disproved” under Section 3 of the Evidence Act, 1872 the following was laid down in
para 30 : (SCC p. 50) “30. Applying the said definitions of “proved” or “disproved” to the principle
behind Section 118(a) of the Act, the court shall presume a negotiable instrument to be for
consideration unless and until after considering the matter before it, it either believes that the
consideration does not exist or considers the non-existence of the consideration so probable that a
prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that
the consideration does not exist. For rebutting such presumption, what is needed is to raise a
probable defence.
Even for the said purpose, the evidence adduced on behalf of the complainant could be relied upon.”

20. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa v. Sri Mohan [Rangappa v. Sri Mohan, (2010) 11
SCC 441 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 477 :
(2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 184] had occasion to elaborately consider the provisions of
Sections 138 and 139. In the above case, the trial court had
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis acquitted the accused in a case relating to
dishonour of cheque under Section 138. The High Court had reversed [Mohan v.
Rangappa, 2005 SCC OnLine Kar 783] the judgment of the trial court convicting the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185869716/ 5
A.Sabarinathan vs G.Balakrishnan on 24 November, 2021
accused. In the above case, the accused had admitted signatures on the cheque. This
Court held that where the fact of signature on the cheque is acknowledged, a
presumption has to be raised that the cheque pertained to a legally enforceable debt
or liability, however, this presumption is of a rebuttal nature and the onus is then on
the accused to raise a probable defence. In para 13, the following has been laid down :
(SCC p. 446) “13. The High Court in its order [Mohan v. Rangappa, 2005 SCC OnLine
Kar 783] noted that in the course of the trial proceedings, the accused had admitted
that the signature on the impugned cheque (No. 0886322 dated 8-2-2001) was
indeed his own. Once this fact has been acknowledged, Section 139 of the Act
mandates a presumption that the cheque pertained to a legally enforceable debt or
liability. This presumption is of a rebuttal nature and the onus is then on the accused
to raise a probable defence. With regard to the present facts, the High Court found
that the defence raised by the accused was not probable.”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
12. Hence the omission on the part of the respondent/complainant to prove the
source for Rs.7,00,000/- can also serve as a probable circumstance in favour of the
petitioner/accused and shift the preponderance in his favour. The Courts below
omitted to appreciate the above position of law in a proper perspective and concluded
the case by convicting the accused and hence it warrants interference.
13. In the result, the criminal revision case is allowed. The judgment of the Courts
below is set aside.
