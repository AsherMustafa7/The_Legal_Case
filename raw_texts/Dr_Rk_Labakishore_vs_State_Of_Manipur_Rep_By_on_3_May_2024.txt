[13] During the course of hearing, the learned counsels for the respondents submitted that the
applications being MC(WP(C))No.215 of 2024 and MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 may be treated as
counter affidavits of the respondents to the writ petition filed by the petitioner and the writ petition
may be disposed of at this stage, as only a short question of law regarding applicability of the Office
Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 is involved. In the circumstances, this court heard the present

submits that the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 is issued for regulating appointment on

under the control of the Government of Manipur. Para 4 of the O.M.is very relevant and 4(i)
stipulates that appointment on in- charge basis has to be made only when eligible persons, as per
recruitment rules are not available and para 4(ii) provides that in absence of eligible officials, the
senior most person amongst the feeder cadre has to be appointed to hold the said post on in-charge
basis at no extra remuneration and in addition to his/her substantive post held to the lower post.
[15] Mr. D. Julius Riamei, learned counsel for the petitioner further draws the attention of this
Court to the contents of para 5 of the O.M. dated 03.10.2020 that for appointments on in-charge
basis to all posts shall be applicable to all posts of the State Government, Agencies, Societies, Bodies,
Offices, Companies, PSUs, Autonomous Bodies etc. Learned counsel further submits that while
making in-charge appointment in absence of eligible officials, the senior most officers in the feeder
cadre has to be preferred. It is also submitted that in absence of any rules prescribing in-charge
appointment in the Bye-Laws or in the statue, the O.M dated 03.10.2020 shall be applicable in
appointment to any post on in-charge basis of any Society under active control of the Government.
[16] Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the decision of this Court reported as 2015 SCC
online Mani 55 : Maimom Lukhoi v. State of Manipur wherein it was held that the State Government
must act fairly and WP(C)No. 236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of
2024 Page 9 reasonably while making transfer, posting and appointment on in-charge basis in

[17] It is stated that in the present case, the Manipur Milk Producers' Co-operative Union being a
society under the control by the State Government as mentioned in para 5, the O.M. dated
03.10.2020 will be applicable while making in-charge appointment of its Managing Directors. It is
stated that the petitioner is class-I officer being a Deputy Director(Dairy) and he possessed
Post-Graduate degree as per Bye-Laws 23.3 whereas respondent No.6 is only a class-II officer
without any post-Graduate degree. Besides this, the respondent No.6 has no experience of three
years in procurement/production/marketing in Dairy as provided in the Bye-Laws as he was
promoted to the post of Procurement Officer in the year 2023 only. Accordingly, it is submitted that
respondent No.6 is not eligible to be appointed as Managing Director on regular basis and hence on
in-charge basis also and the petitioner having the higher desirable qualifications and two grades
higher than the respondent No.6, has to be preferred and appointed on in-charge basis.
[18] It is also stated that if the impugned order dated 13.03.2024 is set aside by this Court, the
resolution No.2 of the Board of Administrator meeting dated 26.03.2024 and the approval of the
Registrar, Co-operative Society dated 01.04.2024 will lose all their relevancy and as such the
petitioner is not bound WP(C)No. 236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 &
MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 10 to challenge these irrelevant orders. It is prayed that the
impugned order dated 13.03.2024 issued by the Government of Manipur nominating respondent
No.6 as in-charge Managing Director of Manipur Milk Producers' Co-operative Union Limited be set
aside and official respondents be directed to consider the case of the petitioner for appointment as

Memorandum dated 03.10.2020. [19] Mr. M. Devananda, learned Addl.AG submits that writ

[20] On merit, learned Addl. AG submits that the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 will be
applicable to the Government employees and not to the members of the Society Union where
appointment of the office bearers is to be as per Bye-Laws and the Act. It is also stated that post of
Managing Director of the Union is not a promotional post in terms of the Bye-Laws from WP(C)No.
236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 11 the cadre officers
of the Veterinary & Animal Husbandry department. Hence, there is no question of supersession by
junior.
[21] Mr. M. Devananda, learned Addl.AG has also stated that after considering the requirement as
prescribed by Bye-Laws and the statue, the name of the respondent No.6 was nominated by the
State Government in terms of Section 74(2) of the Manipur Co-operative Societies, Act 1976 as an
interim measure till the appointment of the regular Managing Director and hence, there is no
illegality in the nomination of respondent No.6. It is clarified that respondent No.6 is a class-II
officer and has requisite qualification and experience of more than 16(eighteen) years in the
procurement and marketing of the Dairy products.
[22] Learned Addl.AG draws the attention of this Court to a letter dated 01.04.2024 issued by

Dairying, Government of India to the Managing Director of State Milk Federations/Milk Unions
wherein it was directed to utilize the pending fund of Rs. 357.51 crore by 26(twenty six) States. It is

Dr. Rk Labakishore vs State Of Manipur Rep. By ... on 3 May, 2024
[24] Mr. H. S. Paonam, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.6 submitted that the O.M
dated 03.10.2020 is not applicable while making appointment of Managing Director of Co-operative
Union on in-charge basis. [25] Learned senior counsel for the respondent No.6 draws the attention
of this Court to the object behind the O.M. specifying norms for appointment on in-charge basis. It
is pointed out that the O.M. will be applicable in the case of appointment by direct recruitment or
promotion from a cadre post. It is stated that the post of Managing Director is not a cadre post from
the officers of the Veterinary and Animal Husbandry Department. The appointment of a Managing
Director of Manipur Milk Producers' Co-operative Union Limited is in terms of WP(C)No. 236 of
2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 13 Clause 23.3 of
Bye-Laws and the provision of Section 74(2) of Manipur Co- operative Society Act, 1976. Bye-Laws
says that a person to be made for appointment as Managing Director of the Union, should possess a
minimum qualification of diploma or degree in Dairy with 10(ten) years experience, out which
3(three) years is under Procurement/Production/Marketing of a Dairy unit and Post Graduate is a
desirable qualification.
[26] The appointment is from class-I or class-II officers. Learned senior counsel for respondent
No.6 has pointed out that respondent No.6 is a degree in Dairy and class -II and has more than
16(sixteen) years' experience in marketing and procurement in Dairy unit and as such he is eligible
for appointment as managing Director as per the Bye-Laws and the statue. [27] On the other hand,
it is stated that the petitioner was promoted to the post of Deputy Director(Dairy) vide order dated
27.12.2023 and as such he has less than one years' experience in marketing/procurement or
production in a Dairy unit. Prior to this, he was posted as Veterinary Officer in the department of
Veterinary and Animal Husbandry and has no experience in Dairy. [28] It is stated that as per
Section 72(3) of the Act of 1976, the nomination of a Managing Director is an appointment on
deputation and hence the OM dated 03.10.2020 is not applicable in case of appointment as
Managing Director of a Society, even if it is assumed that the OM will be applicable for WP(C)No.
236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 14 other officers of
the Union as submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
[29] Mr. H. S. Paonam, learned senior counsel, for the respondent No.6 has relied on the judgement
in Nazir Ahmed V. Emperor AIR 1936 PC 253, (2015) 8 SCC 722 para 14 and Civil appeal No.4807 of
2022 judgement dated 25.07.2022 in the case of Union of India Vs. Mahendra Singh passed by
Hon'ble Supreme Court wherein it says that things to be done as prescribed by the law and not in
any other form. It is submitted that in the present case, the appointment of respondent No.6 is done
as per rules.
[30] It is pointed out that in terms of Section 78(2), the Board of Administrators has the same power
as the Board Directors during the period of supersession of the Board. Finally, it is stated that the
impugned order does not suffer from any illegality and writ petition deserves to be rejected being
devoid of any merit.
[31] This Court has considered the submissions made at the bar, the materials on record and the
relevant case laws in this regard. Before proceeding further, it will be useful to reproduce the
relevant provisions of law and notifications in this regard.

23/20/2019-Misc(PHED)/DP: A large number of references has been made by various departments
under the Government of Manipur Seeking clarity from Department of Personnel in regards to
appointments on in-charge basis to various posts and conditions for making such appointments etc.
2. At present, there is no laid down norm for making appointments on in-charge basis to posts
under the State Government. In the absence of laid down norms, various departments have been
resorting to such appointment usually by considering seniority of officials, place of posting, etc. In
other cases, there is want of better logic apparent on the fact of such appointment leading to
discontent in the cadre concerned and ultimately affecting efficiency of public administration.
3. In this context, the need to issue detail norms for appointment of officials to a post on in-charge
basis has been under consideration of the State Government from some time.
4. Thus, with a view to bring uniformly, clarity and enforceable norms in making such in- charge
appointments, the following norms are hereby issued for compliance by all concerned:
i. Appointment on in-charge basis shall be made against a post only when there is no
official eligible as per RR to fill up the said post, either by direct recruitment or by
promotion through duly constituted DPC.
ii. In the absence of any official eligible as per RR to fill up a particular post, the
senior most person amongst cadre/official belonging to the feeder post of the said
particular post shall be appointed to hold the said post on in-charge basis, at no extra
remuneration and in addition to the substantial post held by the appointee in the
lower post. Needless to say, the appointee shall draw pay against the lower post
substantiality held by him.
iii. Where no arrangement can be made as in para (ii) above, an in-charge
appointment shall be made to a vacant post from a person holding a similar post(at
same rank and/or designation), at no extra remuneration.
vi. An official appointed on in-charge basis against any post shall have the same
financial power as a person appointed on substantial basis against the said post
would enjoy.
5. These instruction shall be applicable while making appointments on in-charge basis to all posts
under the State Government existing in all Government departments, agencies, societies, bodies,
offices, companies, PSUs, autonomous bodies, etc. Special Secretary(DP) Government of Manipur

(k) To delegate all or any of the said powers to an employee or employees of the

exercise all or any of the functions of the Board or any officer of the society, and take

[32] From the above, it is clear that for appointment as Managing Director of the Manipur Milk
Producers' Co-operative Union Limited, a person should possess a degree or diploma with Dairy
with 10(ten) years experience, out of which 3(three) years in marketing/procurement/production in
a Dairy unit. The officer must not be below rank of a class-II officer under the Government of
Manipur and having post Graduate degree is desirable. WP(C)No. 236 of 2014 with
MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 19 [33] In the present case, the
respondent No.6 is class-II officer having more than 16(sixteen) years of experience in marketing
and production of a Dairy unit and as such he is eligible for appointment as Managing Director. [34]
It is the case of the petitioner that he is post Graduate in Dairy and class-I officer and two status
above the respondent No.6 in the department of Veterinary & Animal Husbandry, and as such he is
more competent than respondent No.6 for appointment as Managing Director of the Union on in-
charge basis.
[35] In the present case, the issue is not the examination of the respective qualifications of the
petitioner and the respondent No.6 for appointment to the post of Managing Director of the Union
on regular basis and as such this Court does not intends to express any opinion on the relative merit
and demerit of the petitioner vis-à-vis the respondent No.6 and a finding in this regard will
prejudice the case of the either parties in future. The limited question for determination before this
Court is whether the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 will be applicable in case of an
appointment of Managing Director of the Union on in-charge basis.
[36] There is no dispute at the bar that the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 will rule in case
of appointment on in-charge basis in any Government Department and in respect of other bodies as
specified in para 5 of the O.M. WP(C)No. 236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 &
MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 20 [37] On careful consideration of para 4(i) & (ii) of the O.M.
dated 03.10.2020, it is apparent that an appointment on in-charge basis has to be resorted only
when eligible officials are not available for appointment by direct recruitment or by promotion as
per rules and while considering in-charge appointment, the senior most in the feeder cadre has to be
appointed without any extra remuneration in addition to his/her substantive post at lower grade.
The expression "either by direct recruitment or by promotion" as mentioned in para 4(i) of the O.M.
signifies that the O.M. will be applicable only in case of direct recruitment and/or by promotion,
even though the O.M. will be applicable to all posts under the Government of Manipur and other
bodies as mentioned in para 5 of the OM.
[38] In the present case, Section 74(2) of the Act of 1976 prescribes that the officer so nominated to
be a Managing Director shall be deemed to be on 'deputation' with the society which implies that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41693339/ 11
Dr. Rk Labakishore vs State Of Manipur Rep. By ... on 3 May, 2024
appointment of Managing Director of Manipur Co-operative Union by nomination under Section
74(2) of the Act of 1976 will be an appointment by deputation. As noted above, the O.M. will be
applicable only in case of appointment by direct recruitment or by promotion and Section 74(2) of
Manipur Co-operative Societies Act, 1976 provides that the officer nominated to be a Managing
Director of the Union/Society will be deemed to be on deputation.
WP(C)No. 236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 21 [39]
Further, it is not the case of the State Government that resort to in- charge appointment of the
Managing Director of the Union is made due to non- availability of eligible candidates. Rather, it is a
temporary arrangement awaiting regular appointment to the post of MD. This Court is of the
considered view that the present case does not fall within the purview of the OM dated 03.10.2020
because of the absence of the crucial criteria of 'non-availability of eligible candidates as per rules'.
[40] In view of the above provisions of the law, this Court is of the opinion that the Office
Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 stipulating the norms for appointment on in-charge basis will not
be applicable in case of appointment to the Managing Director of Co-operative Society on in-charge
basis for the following reasons that:
(i) the nomination to the Managing Director in terms of Section 74(2) of the Act is a
deputation.
(ii) the post of Managing Director of Manipur Co-operative Union is not a
promotional post from the officers of Veterinary & Animal Husbandry department.
(iii) the post of Deputy Director Dairy is not a feeder post for appointment to the post
of Managing Director of Manipur Milk Producers' Co-operative Union Limited.
WP(C)No. 236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024
Page 22
(iv) resort to in-charge appointment of the Managing Director is not made due to
non-availability of eligible candidates as per rules, but as a temporary measures
awaiting regular appointment.
[41] Due to the above reasons, it is held that the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 is not
applicable in case of appointment of Managing Director Manipur Milk Producers' Co-operative
Union Limited on in-charge basis and as such the writ petition based on the O.M. dated 03.10.2020
is liable to be dismissed at the threshold.
[42] This Court finds force in the submissions of Mr. M. Devananda, learned Addl. AG, and Mr. H.
S, Paonam, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.6 that the writ petition is hit by the
principles of approbate and reprobate and the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The petitioner
having signed in the resolution dated 26.03.2024 and accepting the nomination of respondent No.6
as Managing Director on in-charge basis vide impugned order dated 13.03.2024, cannot question
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41693339/ 12
Dr. Rk Labakishore vs State Of Manipur Rep. By ... on 3 May, 2024
the appointment of respondent No.6. The prayer in the writ petition is also incomplete as the
petitioner has failed to challenge the resolution No.2 of Board of Administrators proceeding dated
26.03.2024 and the approval given by the Registrar Co-operative dated 01.04.2024 by the Registrar
of Co-operative Society.
WP(C)No. 236 of 2014 with MC(WP(c))No.215 of 2024 & MC(WP(C))No.245 of 2024 Page 23 [42]
In view of the above findings, the writ petition is dismissed and the interim order dated 03.04.2024
is vacated. The pending applications are also disposed of in terms of the above directions and
observations.
[43] No costs.
