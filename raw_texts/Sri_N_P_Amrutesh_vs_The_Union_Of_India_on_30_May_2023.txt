I - FACTS OF THE CASE
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 3
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
2. It is the case of the petitioner that he is a practicing advocate of High Court of Karnataka at
Principal Bench, Dharwad and Gulbarga Benches and he is a public spirited citizen, who has taken
up several causes of the citizen as also of advocates, in the matter of maintenance of the Rule of law
and efficacy of justice delivery system.
3. The petition raises several questions of law interalia as to the relative scope and scope of the
Karnataka High Court Act, 1961 (for short, hereinafter referred to as 'Act 1961') and establishment of
Permanent Bench of the High Court of Karnataka under the provisions of Section 51(2) by
converting the High Court of Karnataka, Circuit Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga and of the State
Re-organisation Act, 1956(for short, hereinafter referred to as 'S.R. Act, 1956) issued under Section
51(3) of the S.R. Act, 1956 in 2004/2008. It is further contended that the establishment of the said
Benches, first, as Circuit Benches and later converting them as Permanent Benches is contrary to
law and severely affects the public interest as it is contrary to the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of the Federation of Bar Association -vs- Union of India reported in (2000)6 SCC
Page 715 apart from the recommendation of Hon'ble Justice Jaswant Singh's Commission Report,
since factually the number of cases, filed, disposed of and the expenditure incurred in maintenance
of these establishments are not conducive to the public interest, as it affects the functional integrity
and unity of the institution of the Hon'ble High Court. The respondents are the respective
authorities representing His Excellency, the Hon'ble President of India, the Hon'ble Chief Justice of
Karnataka and His Excellency, the Governor of Karnataka thus answering the description of the
term within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and the 5th respondent is a
Constitutional authority responsible for undertaking performance of audit, including financial audit
of Public Institutions/Authorities.
4. The petitioner further stated that the Mysore High Court Act, 1884 (for short, hereinafter referred
to as 'Act, 1884') was enacted to establish and constitute the High Court of Mysore and to provide
for administration of Justice by the High Court of Mysore. Section 3 of Act, 1984 defines the term
'High Court' which means the Chief Justice of the High Court and refers to the Chief Court or to the
High Court in any Regulation, Act or other Laws for the time being in force and shall be deemed to
have been made to the High Court of Mysore. The provisions of Section 17 of Act, 1884 prescribes
that the High Court shall hold its sittings at such place as the State Government may, from time to
time, appoint any other place by way of Circuit, interalia. Section 19 of Act, 1884 permits the High
Court to make Rules for exercise of powers of one or more of its judges under the said Act or any
other Enactment. The Rules made thereunder were required to receive sanction from the State
Government under Section 21 of the Act. Section 14 of the Act 1961 has continued and retained the
operation of provisions of Sections 17, 19 and 21 of the Act, 1884 interalia which has the force of law
under Article 372 of the Constitution of India.
5. It is the further stated of the petitioner that under the Constitution of India as framed in 1950, the
State of Mysore was classified as Part-B State. Under Section 12 of the States Re- organisation Act,
1956 (for short, hereinafter referred to as 'S.R. Act, 1956) Parts-A, B and C of the Constitution were
modified/deleted and following parts were substituted whereby Part-A state at Sl.No.8 Mysore with
territories specified in Sub- section 1 of Section 7 of the States Re-organisation Act amended the
provision of State of Mysore being Part-B State and formation of a new Mysore State was created
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 4
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
under Section 7 of the S.R. Act.
6. It is further stated of the petitioner that Sub-Section(1) of Section 7(b) of Belgaum District except
Chandgad Taluks and Bijapur, Dharwad and Kanara Districts which were existing in the then State
of Bombay and also under (c) Gulbarga District except Kodanga and Tandur Taluks, Raichur
District except Alampur and Gadwal Taluks and Bidar District except Admadpur, Nilanga and Udgir
Taluks and the portions specified in clause (d) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 3 in the existing State of
Hyderabad became part of the new State of Mysore. It is further contended that under Part-V of the
S.R. Act, 1956, High Courts were established under Section 49(2) which reads as under:-
"As from the appointed day, there shall be a established High Court for each of the
new States of Kerala, Mysore and Rajasthan."
7. The petitioner further states that High Court of Mysore was established under the S.R. Act, 1956
which came into effect in Mysore/Karnataka from 1.11.1956 and the new High Court of Mysore at
Bangalore started functioning from 1.11.1956. Under Part-V, Section 51(1) of the S.R. Act, 1956,
Principal Bench of the High Court of Mysore was established at Bangalore. Section 51 contemplates
Principal seat and other places of High Courts for new States shall be at such place as the President
may, by notified order, appoint after consultation with the Governor of a new State and the Chief
Justice of the High Court for that State, by notified order, provide for the establishment of a
Permanent Bench or Benches of that High Court at one or more places within the State other than
the principal seat of the High Court and for any matters connected therewith. Notwithstanding
anything contained in sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), the Judges and division courts of the High
Court for a new State may also sit at such other place or places in that State as the Chief Justice may,
with the approval of the Governor, appoint. It is further contended that Section 69 of the said Act
contemplates 'Savings', that nothing in this Part shall affect the application to the High Court for a
new State of any provisions of the Constitution, and this Part shall have effect subject to any
provision that may be made on or after the appointed day with respect to that High Court by any
Legislature or other authority having power to make such provision.
8. It is the further stated by the petitioner that after coming into force the Constitution in the year
1950, the High Court of Mysore which was functioning under the 1884 Act, having its seat of justice
at Bangalore, continued to exercise its jurisdiction throughout in the then existing territories under
the First Schedule of the Constitution to the Part-B State. Under the Constitution by virtue of Article
372, it continued to operate and exercise its jurisdiction even after the 1956 Act came into effect, and
exercised its jurisdiction in the existing territories under Part B State and also on the new territories
i.e., Districts which merged and formed the new State of Mysore. In view of Section 62 of 1956 Act,
pending proceedings before the High Court of Bombay, Madras and Hyderabad were transferred to
the Mysore High Court. Therefore, in terms of Article 214 of the Constitution of India, the High
Court of Mysore was established having its Principal Bench at Bangalore, and had continued to do
so even after S.R. 1956 Act came into force. Thereafter, the Mysore High Court Act, 1961 Act 5 of
1962 came to be enacted which provided for an Act 'to make provisions for regulating business and
exercise of powers of the State of Mysore/Karnataka in relation to the administration of justice and
to provide for its jurisdiction'. Though in the meantime, the High Court of Mysore/Karnataka Rules
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 5
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
1959 came into effect which provided Chapter-II Rule 1 (a) for the Principal Bench at Bangalore,
which was in terms of Section 49(2) of the S.R. Act, 1956 and as the said Rules were framed under
Article 225 of the Constitution r/w Section 54 of S.R. Act, 1956, Sections 122 and 129 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, Section 19 of the Mysore High Court Act which had same force of law as though
enacted under Article 254 of the Constitution being precursor to the subsequent High Court of
Mysore (Karnataka) Act, 1961, being saved under Section 69 of the S.R. Act, 1956 which also
recognized the only place of sitting of the Principal Bench at Bangalore.
9. It is further stated that the preamble of the 1961 High Court Act provides that "Whereas it is
expedient to make provision for regulating the business and the exercise of powers of the State of
Karnataka in relation to the administration of justice and to provide for its jurisdiction and other
matters hereinafter appearing thereby the then existing Mysore State Legislature enacted the
Mysore High Court Act which received the Presidential assent on 25.12.1961." It is further
contended that in view of Article 214 of the Constitution under Chapter 5 of Part-6 of the
Constitution, the then existing Mysore High Court continued to exercise its jurisdiction in Part-B
State under the Constitution and after 1956 Act came to be enacted and enforced, it exercised its
jurisdiction in respect of the new territories added/merged with the State of Mysore. Hence, after
re-establishment of the Principal Bench for the new State of Mysore under Section 49(1) and (2) r/w
51(1) of the S.R. Act, 1956 and Section 51 as a whole was not applied to the new State of Mysore as it
had an existing High Court/Chief Court in the State of Mysore and continued to be a High Court for
the New State of Mysore in terms of Section 7 of the S.R. Act, 1956. Thereby the application of
Section 51(2) and 51(3) did not and would not arise at that point of time. The authorities mentioned
in the said provision did not deem it necessary to either establish any separate permanent Benches
under Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act nor there was a need to establish Circuit Benches under Section
51(3) of the S.R. Act. Therefore, the provisions of Section 51(2) and 51(3) could not be invoked in the
absence of provisions of the Mysore High Court Act, 1961 as the application of Part V of the States
Re-organisation Act is enabling provision if the appropriate Legislature had not enacted any law
with respect to the High Court in terms of saving clause in Part V Section 69 of the S.R. Act, 1956.
However, immediately after the New State of Mysore came into existence firstly High Court of
Mysore/Karnataka Rules 1959 were framed and immediately thereafter, the State Legislature
enacted High Court of Mysore/Karnataka Act, 1961, which estopped invoking of provisions of
Section 51(2) and 51(3) of the S.R. Act by respondent Nos.1 to 3 as the 1961 Act was self contained
enactment and by virtue of Section 69 of the S.R. Act, 1956, no contingency of establishment of
Permanent Benches at any other place than at Bangalore was envisaged, which is also the
considered view of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Federation of Bar Associations
reported in (2000)6 SCC 715 as also recommended by the Justice Jaswant Singh Commission.
10. The petitioner further states that under 1961 Act, the Legislature thought it fit not to make
provision for establishment of either a Circuit Bench or a Permanent Bench anywhere outside the
seat of Principal Bench at Bangalore as it was felt that there was no need for necessity. State of
Mysore/Karnataka as created under the S.R. Act, 1956 came into existence based on the language
spoken (i.e., Kannada Language) in the territories merged and unification of Kannada speaking
people into the State of Mysore as it existed then. Hence, merged territories accepted the High Court
of Mysore with it's Principal seat of Justice at Bangalore as their High Court. Moreover, the State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 6
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Mysore was an existing State in Part-B with addition of new territories, its territorial extent was
enlarged to include Kannada Language loving people, who merged/integrated into State of Mysore
physically, emotionally and psychologically and as the Seat of Government, Bangalore was the
Capital City. The Principal Seat of Justice was also Bangalore and there was no incongruity in both
being at one place which was felt, it did not allow any fissiparous or divisive tendencies after the new
State of Mysore came into existence. Many of the Lawyers/Advocates who were then Practising at
High Court of Bombay or at Hyderabad or at other District lever places migrated to Bangalore and
established their practice at the High Court of Mysore/Karnataka at Bangalore and never expressed
regrets for having come over to Bangalore, which is the Garden City.
11. It is further stated that it appears in the year 1973- 74, section of Advocates at Dharwad started
agitation for establishment of a Permanent Bench at Permanent Bench at Dharwad. However, the
same was not conceded either by the Government of Karnataka or by the High Court of Karnataka.
It appears that under misconception of applicability of Section 51 of 1956 Act, agitation was started
and ultimately, it was rejected 8 out of 9 times by the High Court of Karnataka in its Full Court and
Union Government being apprised of the demand for establishment of Permanent Bench at
Dharwad i.e., outside Bangalore, referred the question of establishment of Permanent Bench outside
Principal seat of High Court at Bangalore, in the North Karnataka region to Justice Jaswant Singh
Commission which was enquiring into this issue in respect of establishment of Bench in the State of
Madhya Pradesh and Madras/Tamilnadu, which enquired into the matter and in it's report
submitted that there was no necessity nor need to establish permanent Bench in State of Karnataka
outside its Principal Bench at Bangalore.
12. Further the said report and the opinion was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court by the
Federation of Bar Association in Karnataka against the Union of India and the Hon'ble Supreme
Court by the order dated 24.7.2000 held that the establishment of a Bench of High Court away from
Bangalore is inadvisable. Not satisfied with the said decision, Dharwad Bar Association addressed a
letter/representation on 12.10.2001 to the Hon'ble Chief Justice then to reconsider the
establishment of High Court at Dharwad. Thereafter, the High Court of Karnataka i.e., the then
Hon'ble Chief Justice by a Notification dated 21.3.2002 constituted 7 Member Committee to look
into the matter. Under the Chairman of Mr. Justice G.C. Bharuka, a committee was constituted, who
gave a report dated 6.6.2003 that the Bench may be established in Rayapur area between Hubli and
Dharwad and expressed opinion that the Bench ought to be of permanent character and gave its
report.
13. The said committee consisting of 7 members, submitted a report wherein a note of dissent was
put by two Hon'ble Judges, who did not agree with the establishment of Permanent Bench as
recommended by Justice G.C. Bharuka Committee and the remaining 5 Members took a contrary
view and supported the recommendation. Therefore, the said recommendation cannot be said to be
unanimous recommendation or by majority. Thereafter, on 19.10.2004 assuming power under
Section 51(3) of S.R. Act, 1956, with the approval of His Excellency the Governor of Karnataka, the
then Hon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka issued Notification notifying sitting of
Judges and functioning of High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga though the date of
sitting was to be notified later. Thereafter keen interest was shown by the then Hon'ble Chief
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 7
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Justice, the work of construction of High Court Building was expedited and on 4.6.2008, the then
Hon'ble Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court issued notification establishing Circuit Bench at
Dharwad and Gulbarga for hearing the cases arises from respective District of Bagalkot, Bellary,
Belgaum, Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri, Uttara Kannada, Karwar and Koppal to be heard and decided at
Circuit Bench at Dharwad and the cases arising from the Districts of Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga and
Raichur to be heard and decided at Circuit Bench at Gulbarga. Pending cases were transferred for
being heard and decided at Circuit Bench. However, contrary to the concept of Circuit Bench, new
cases in Circuit Benches were permitted to be filed from 7.7.2008.
14. It is further stated that subsequently the notification dated 29.12.2008 was issued to post the
Review Petitions relating to judgments, Decree, Order or sentence pronounced, made or passed by
the Division Bench or Single Bench in respect of Circuit Bench, Dharwad, as per the roster existing
in the Circuit Bench, Dharwad. On 26.3.2010, the said notification dated 29.12.2008 came up for
consideration before the Division Bench of the Circuit Bench at Dharwad. The Division Bench held
that the said notification dated 29.12.2008 was contrary to Rule 5 of Chapter III of the High Court of
Karnataka Rules, 1959 and accordingly quashed the said notification. However while interpreting
the said notification, the Division Bench held that the notification dated 4.6.2008 establishing
Circuit Benches at Gulbarga and Dharwad did not exclude the litigant from approaching the
Principal bench at Bangalore for filing of the cases before the Principal Bench though could also
exercise their option to file it before the Circuit Bench. It is further stated that the said judicial order
was challenged by the High Court itself through the Registrar General in SLP © 7682/2010 before
the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court stayed the judgment of the Division Bench,
thereby the litigant public from 12 districts coming under Circuit Benches of Dharwad and Gulbarga
were denied access to approach the Principal Bench of Bangalore and their cases were not
entertained before the principal Bench, Bengaluru.
15. It is further stated that as the viability of these two circuit benches was in doubt, the then
Hon'ble Chief Justice took the decision to give separate numbers to the interim applications to
increase/boost the pendency of the cases in the two circuit benches by issuing a notification, which
was again challenged before this Court and the Division Bench of this Court being of the view that
the said notification is contrary to the rules, has struck down the said notification by its judgment
dated 26.3.2010 in the case of M.S. Poojary -vs- the Registrar General reported in 2010(4) Kar.LJ
175. Subsequently, the said notification of giving separate numbers to the interim applications was
withdrawn by the then Hon'ble Chief Justice, thereby the interim applications have been given I.A.
numbers and were not treated separately for the purpose of numbering and it has reduced the
pendency and infact in the year 2012 the pendency in the Gulbarga Circuit bench was less that
3,000 cases and contemplating to close it down as it was not serving any useful purpose and has
become a burden on the establishment. Thereby, the petitioner approached the Information Officer
of the High Court by his application dated 19.1.2013 and accordingly, he has been furnished with the
information. The documents furnished would show that there was no need to continue with the
circuit benches muchless make them into permanent benches in the absence of any cogent material
before the authorities.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 8
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
16. It is further stated that pendency of cases was on decline and both the circuit benches were not
serving the purpose for which it was created/established and infact the number of Hon'ble Judges
sitting at Gulbarga Bench has been reduced from 5 to 3, the Division Bench was sitting only in the
forenoon session etc., However, certain vested interests, who were interested in continuance of the
circuit benches sought political intervention and thereafter the matter was referred to the Union
Cabinet on 4.6.2013 and the subject matter to make Circuit Benches into permanent Benches was
placed before the Union Cabinet and the Union Cabinet has cleared the same on 27.3.2013. It was
notified that the Union Cabinet has given approval for establishment of permanent Benches at
Dharwad and Gulbarga with the concurrence of His Excellency Governor of Karnataka and the
Hon'ble Chief Justice of Karnataka. Thereafter, the President of India in exercise of the powers
under Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act, 1956 issued a formal order as per Annexure-M for establishment
of permanent benches of High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga, thereby the Dharwad
Bench would become functional as Permanent Bench from 24.8.2013 and that Gulbarga Bench from
31.8.2013 and the Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka has been empowered to nominate
Judges to sit at Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches. It is further contended that as this was a sudden
event, it appears to have not taken into account ground realities as to the status of two circuit
benches as there was neither performance report was conducted nor financial audit was conducted
by the 5th respondent before the decision was taken to make it into permanent bench though it
involved an investment of 300-400 crores of rupees with recurring expenditure of Rs.15-18 crores
per annum. Infact suitability of continuation of the Circuit benches had not been ascertained and
the then Hon'ble Chief Justice had not appointed any committee to ascertain the aspect of viability
and sustainability of these two High court Benches and all of a sudden Circuit Benches converted
into permanent benches. It is further contended that correspondence took place mainly for
increasing the strength of the High Court Judges from 41 to 56 inter alia for notifying circuit
benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga as permanent benches under Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act, 1956.
Accordingly, the strength of the Karnataka High Court Judges revised to 50 i.e., 33 permanent
Judges and 17 Addl. Judges and formal order dated 16.11.2009 was issued in this regard as per
Annexure-S. It is further contended that it is also not known as to whether the opinion of the
learned Judges was obtained in Full Court Meeting. In the circumstances, it creates suspicion that it
was politically motivated than in reality judicially required and there was no consultation or
assessment of functioning of the circuit benches for a period of 3 years.
17. It is further contended that Annexures - R and S as also Annexure - C are challenged in a Public
Interest Litigation in Writ Petition No.24110/2011 (PIL-Res) which was admitted and was pending.
Subsequently, a memo came to be filed to withdraw the said writ petition on the ground that
material on record was insufficient and certain additional information was sought under the RTI
Act. Accordingly, the said writ petition came to be dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to file fresh
writ petition. In the mean time in June-2013 the announcement was made that the Circuit Benches
would be made permanent and the Union Cabinet had approved it and thereafter the formal
notification was issued succeeded by the presidential order under Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act on
8.8.2013. Hence the present writ petition is filed for the reliefs sought for.
II. Statement of objections filed by Respondent Nos.1 & 5/Central Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 9
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
18. It is stated that in accordance with the recommendation made by the Jaswant Singh Commission
and the Judgment pronounced by the Apex Court in W.P. (C) No.379 of 2000, Benches of the High
Court are established after due consideration of a complete proposal from the State Government,
which is to provide infrastructure and meet the expenditure, alongwith the consent of the Hon'ble
Chief Justice of the High Court, which is required to look after the day to day administration of the
High Court and its Benches. The proposal has also consent of Governor of the State Government.
19. It is further stated that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Federation of Bar Association
in Karnataka -vs- Union of India in Writ Petition (Civil) No.379 of 2000 held that as the Chief
Justice of High Court concerned is the important consultee in the matter of establishment of a
Bench of the High Court, he being the head of that High Court has to form an opinion when it is
required during such consultation process. Normally, the Chief Justice will not be guided by any
Political or Parochial considerations and when he gives opinion, it is the opinion of the High Court
and not merely his personal opinion.
20. It is further stated that the Bench of High Court was established after receiving the complete
proposal from the State Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court and
the Governor of the State. The Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court in July, 2009 had requested
the Central Government to notify the Circuit Benches of the High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad
and Gulbarga as permanent Benches under Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act, 1956 and to enhance the
sanctioned strength of Hon'ble Judges of the Karnataka High Court from 41 to 56.
21. It is also stated that after approval of the Chief Justice of India and with concurrence of the State
Government, 6 posts of additional Judges for Dharwad Bench and 3 posts for Gulbarga Bench were
created in November 2009. The proposal for establishment of permanent Benches of the High Court
of Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga and issuing Presidential Order under Section 51(2) of the
S.R. Act, 1956 was placed before the Central Cabinet, which in its meeting dated 4.6.2013 had
approved the above proposal. Accordingly, a notification for operationalization of permanent
Benches of the Karnataka High Court at Dharwad, w.e.f 24.8.2013 and Gulbarga w.e.f. 31.8.2013
was issued on 14.8.2013.
22. Respondent Nos.1 & 5 further stated that the sitting of the Judges of High Court of Karnataka in
Single and Division Bench at Dharwad and Gulbarga and establishment of Circuit Benches of the
Karnataka High Court at Dharwad and Gulbarga were notified by the Karnataka High Court in
consultation with the State Government. This was done under Section 51(3) of the S.R. Act, 1956.
The notification of operationalization of permanent Benches of the Karnataka High Court at
Dharwad and Gulbarga was issued by the Central Government on 14.8.2013 with the concurrence of
the Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court, State Government and Governor of the State. The
said notification was issued under Section 51(3) of the S.R. Act, 1956.
23. It is further stated that the Cabinet in its meeting dated 4.6.2013 approved the establishment of
permanent Benches of the Karnataka High Court at Dharwad and Gulbarga and accordingly
presidential order was issued after approval of the Cabinet. The notification for establishment of
Permanent Benches of the Karnataka High Court at Dharwad and Gulbarga was issued in exercise of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 10
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
the powers under Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act after consultation with the Governor of Karnataka
and the Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Writ Petition
No.379/2000 also held that the High Court is the best suited machinery to decide whether it is
necessary and feasible to have a bench outside the principal seat of that High Court. It is submitted
that the recommendations made by the Jaswanth Singh Commission was referred to the concerned
authorities and the action was taken by the Central Government as per the existing procedure and
that establishment of permanent Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga was a policy decision taken by
the Government in exercise of its sovereign functions. It is further contended that establishment of
permanent Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga is a public welfare measure. The establishment of
permanent benches should not be construed as an investment for returns at all, but should only be
taken as "Pro Bono Publico" measure, thereby sought to dismiss the writ petition.
III. Statement of objections filed by learned counsel for
24. The Respondent Nos.2 and 3 stated that even though the present writ petition is filed in the form
of Public Interest Litigation, the element of public interest is totally absent and the petitioner cannot
be considered as an 'aggrieved person' and cause reflected in the writ petition cannot be considered
as a public cause and on that ground alone the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
25. It is further stated that the Chief Secretary, Government of Karnataka, Bengaluru by D.O. letter
dated 19.10.2004 addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Justice, High Court of Karnataka informed that
His Excellency the Governor of Karnataka has approved the proposal for establishment of High
Court circuit benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga under the provisions of Section 51(3) of the S.R.
Act. Subsequently, a notification was issued as required under Section 51(3) of the S.R. Act. In the
said notification, the sittings of Single Judges and Division Benches of High Court of Karnataka at
Dharwad and Gulbarga and also the date of sitting was proposed to be notified after securing a
report of the Hon'ble Committee which was constituted exclusively for establishment of examining
feasibility of circuit benches as per the order passed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice. It is further
contended that as a matter of fact a studied and thoughtful decision was taken to establish circuit
benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga. Various aspects which were required to be considered were
considered threadbare and a final decision was taken in the interest of the public and the same
cannot be found fault with by anyone including the petitioner.
26. It is further stated that the pendency of cases as on 31.5.2014 in the Dharwad Bench was 41,777
and in the Gulbarga Bench was 17,050 and the sanctioned strength of the Hon'ble Judges in the
High Court of Karnataka as on 2014 was 50 and number of permanent Judges was 33 and number
of Additional Judges was 17. It is contended that the proposal for establishment of circuit benches
was examined in detail by the Committee of Hon'ble Judges headed by Hon'ble Sri Justice G.C.
Bharuka. The Committee considered the demand of people of North Karnataka for establishment of
Benches therein, in addition to other aspects. Selection of land for construction of Circuit Bench
buildings was also done on proper and relevant consideration and as per the recommendation by
the committee of Hon'ble Judges.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 11
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
27. It is further stated that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Federation of Bar Association
in Karnataka -vs- Union of India reported in (2000)6 SCC 715 held that High Court is the
best-suited machinery to decide whether it is necessary and feasible to have a Bench outside the
principal seat of that High Court, thereby it is clear that the Hon'ble Chief Justice has got every
power and authority to recommend for establishment of Benches outside the Principal Bench and
hence the prayer of the petitioner seeking for quashing the notification dated 19.10.2004, is not
sustainable in law. The present writ petition filed by the petitioner lacks any public interest of
preserving structural and functional integrity and composition of the institutions of High Court and
in preventing disintegration. In exercise of the powers conferred under sub-section (2) of Section 51
of the S.R. Act, 1956 the President, after consultation with the Government of Karnataka and Chief
Justice of High Court of Karnataka was pleased to order the operationalization of the permanent
Bench of High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad from 24.8.2013 and at Gulbarga from 31.8.2013. The
establishment of Permanent Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga was as a result of need based
demand and necessity of the people of the northern Karnataka and later they were converted into
permanent benches. A lot of agitation took place by the Advocates of that region and the litigant
public as also public at large joined in putting forth their demands. The establishment of High Court
Benches is a policy decision taken as per the constitutional scheme. The very preamble of the
Constitution of India mandates that all efforts be taken to render justice to a common man. Under
the circumstances, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed with costs.
IV. Regarding particulars/material furnished by Respondent Nos.2 and 3 in pursuance of the order

29. Learned counsel for Respondent Nos.2 and 3 produced the relevant material on 24.3.2023 and

showing the expenditure incurred towards salary, allowances etc., at Dharwad and Kalaburagi
Benches from 2008- 09 to 2022-23.
V. Arguments advanced by learned counsel for the petitioner
30. Sri V.R. Datar, learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in view of the provisions of
Article 214 of the Constitution of India there shall be a High Court for each State. Section 51 of the
S.R. Act, 1956 contemplates Principal seat and other places of sitting of High Courts for new States,
which reads as under:
"51. Principal seat and other places of sitting of High Courts for new States.
(1) The principal seat of the High Court for a new State shall be at such place as the
President may, by notified order, appoint.
(2) The President may, after consultation with the Governor of a new State and the
Chief Justice of the High Court for that State, by notified order, provide for the
establishment of a permanent Bench or Benches of that High Court at one or more
places within the State other than the principal seat of the High Court and for any
matters connected therewith.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), the
Judges and Division courts of the High Court for a new State may also sit at such
other place or places in that State as the Chief Justice may, with the approval of the
Governor, appoint."
31. Learned counsel would further contend that as per Section 17 of the Mysore High Court
Act-1884, the High Court shall hold its sittings at such place as the State Government may, from
time to time, appoint in that behalf and whenever it appears to the State Government convenient
that the jurisdiction and powers vested in the High Court by this Act, or any other law for the time
being in force, should be exercised in any place other than the place appointed under paragraph-1 of
this section, or at several of other places by way of circuit, the State Government may by order
authorise and direct any one or more of the Judges of such Court to hold sittings in such place or
places as by such order may be directed, and the Judge or same Judges acting under such order
shall have and exercise the jurisdiction and authority as would be had and exercised by a Judge or
Judges of the High Court, as the case may be, in its ordinary place of sitting. He would contend that
while enacting the Karnataka High Court Act, 1961, under Section 14 of the said Act, the provisions
of Sections 11 to 16, 16A, 16B, 20 and 22 of the Mysore High Court Act, 1884 (Mysore Act I of 1884)
were repealed, but Section 17 of the Mysore High Court Act has not been repealed, thereby, the High
Court of Karnataka has no power to set up permanent Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi. He
would further contend that the provisions of Section 51(2) and (3) of the S.R. Act, 1956 are not
applicable to the formation of Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi. He also contended that Sections
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 13
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
49 to 69 of the S.R. Act, 1956 come within Part V, which relate to High Courts. He would further
contend that certain words in Entry-3, List-II of Seventh Schedule were omitted by the Constitution
(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 03/01/1977. Entry 11A of List III of Seventh
Schedule relates to "Administration of Justice; constitution and organisation of all Courts, except
the Supreme Court and the High Courts". He would further contend that Annexure - "E" dated
19/10/2004 issued in exercise of powers under Section 51(3) of the S.R. Act, 1956 notifying sittings
of Judges and Division Courts of the High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga, is invalid.
He also draws the attention of the Court to the notification dated 4.6.2008 (Annexure-F), wherein it
is stated that in exercise of the powers under Section 51(3) of the S.R. Act, the Hon'ble Chief Justice
vide notification dated 19.10.2004 was pleased to notify sittings of Judges and Division Courts of the
High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga and the Full Court of the High Court vide
resolution dated 3.6.2008 has resolved to commence sitting of Judges and Division Courts at the
Circuit Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga with effect from 07/07/2008. He would further contend
that the President of India in exercise of the powers under Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act, 1956 issued
a formal order as per Annexure-M for establishment of permanent benches of High Court of
Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga, thereby the Dharwad Bench would become functional as
Permanent Bench from 24.8.2013 and that Gulbarga Bench from 31.8.2013. He would further
contend that Clauses 4 and 5 of the Notification dated 08/08/2013 (Annexure-M) delegates the
powers to the Chief Justice to nominate Judges of the High Court of Karnataka to sit at Dharwad
and Kalaburagi Benches. Clause 5 of the said notification prescribes that notwithstanding anything
in sub- paragraph (i) and (ii) of paragraph 4 of the said notification, the Chief Justice of the High
Court of Karnataka may in his discretion, order that any case or class of cases arising in any such
District shall be heard at Bengaluru. He would further contend that in view of Article 214 of the
Constitution of India and report of the Hon'ble Mr.Justice Jaswant Singh Commission dated
30/04/1985, the very establishment of circuit Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi and later
converting them into permanent Benches, is contrary to law.
32. Learned counsel for the petitioner filed the list of dates and particulars/events and contended
that the issuance of Annexure-P and Annexure-N, which relate to establishment of Circuit Benches
at Dharwad and Gulbarga and later converting them to Permanent Benches in 2013, is patently
contrary to law as the Karnataka High Court Act, 1961 does not contemplate the creation and
establishment of circuit benches or permanent benches by invoking the provisions of Sections 51(3)
and 51(2) of the S.R. Act, 1956. He would further contend that the S.R. Act, 1956 was a Temporary or
Transitional enactment for creation of the new States and once the new States were created in terms
of the S.R. Act,1956 the organs of the State such as Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary came
into existence and the said organs became functional and hence it was upto the new State to lay
down its policies in respect of Administration of justice and formation of Benches, if any, for the
High Court, by making appropriate provisions for the Administration of Justice in the State of
Mysore (now Karnataka). Under Section 7 of the S.R. Act,1956 the State of Mysore, a new State
came into existence on 1.11.1956. Thereafter, the first elections to the Legislative Assembly and
Legislative Council of the State Legislature took place in 1957 and thereupon the
Government/Executive was formed. The Judiciary started functioning as High Court of Mysore at
Bangalore in place of the Chief Court of Mysore since 1.11.1956. It is further contended that in terms
of the S.R. Act as the Principal Bench was established at Bangalore and started functioning since
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 14
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
1.11.1956 for the State of Mysore, which was continued in terms of Article 214 of the Constitution of
India and as there was only one provision pertaining to establishment of circuit benches was made
in terms of Section-14 of Mysore High Court Act, 1961 by retaining the provision of Section 17 of the
Mysore High Court Act, 1961, which was not repealed which contemplated that State Government
was empowered to establish Circuit Benches. There was no provision for establishment of
Permanent Benches as the Legislature in its wisdom thought it was not necessary. Hence, the
establishment of circuit benches and permanent benches by invoking the provisions of Sections
51(3) and 51(2) of the S.R. Act in terms of Annexures E and M was ex facie contrary to law muchless
contrary to S.R. Act.
33. Sri V.R. Datar would further contend that the report of the Committee of Hon'ble Judges headed
by Hon'ble Sri Justice Ashok Bhan dated 05/06/2000 clearly depicts that establishment of the
Circuit Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga, was not feasible. The same was confirmed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Federation of Bar Association in Karnataka -vs- Union of India
reported in (2000)6 SCC 715 (Paragraphs 4,5,6 to 10). He also referred to the report dated 6.6.2003
(Annexure-D) submitted by majority of five Hon'ble Judges of this Court so also note of dissent
dated 6.6.2003. Learned counsel brought to the notice of the Court Annexure-M dated 8.8.2013
passed by the President of India, in exercise of the powers under the provisions of Section 51(2) of
the S.R. Act so also statement of objects and reasons of the said Act. He also brought to the notice of
the Court Section 69 of the S.R. Act, 1956 which prescribes that "nothing in this Part shall affect the
application to the High Court for a new State of any provisions of the Constitution, and this Part
shall have effect subject to any provision that may be made on or after the appointed day with
respect to that High Court by any Legislature or authority having power to make such provision",
thereby S.R. Act, 1956 could not have been invoked. In view of the provisions of Section 14 of the
Karnataka High Court Act, Sections 17, 18, 19, 21 and 23 of the Mysore High Court Act, 1894 have
not been repealed. He further contended that in view of the provisions of Article 246(3) of the
Constitution of India and Entry 3 of List II of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the very
constitution of permanent Benches of the High Court is void, ab initio and invalid. Section 28 of the
S.R. Act, 1956 contemplates changes in composition and allocation of sitting members (Legislative
Assembly). He would further contend that vide Annexure-N dated 15.4.2010, the then Hon'ble Chief
Justice of this Court made a reference to the Law Minister of India requesting for enhancement of
strength of permanent Judges and Annexure-P dated 24.8.2009 is the letter from the Chief Minister
to Law Minister of India and vide Annexure-Q dated 15.4.2010, the Governor has given consent to
the proposal of the Hon'ble Chief Justice and communicated the same to the Law Minister of India.
He would further contend that in view of the provisions of Section 51(2) of the S.R. Act- 1956, Part V
of the said Act is not applicable for the constitution of the permanent Benches, as it is only
temporary and transitional provision. Once the Karnataka High Court Act, 1961 came into force, the
provisions of the S.R. Act, 1956 are not applicable. The law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in (2000)6 SCC 716 (paragraphs 11 and 12) is binding on the Court as well as the respondents.
Therefore, learned counsel sought for allowing the writ petition.
34. In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the following
judgments:

Arguments advanced by Sri Shanti Bhushan, learned Deputy Solicitor General of India for
Respondent No.1
35. Per contra, Sri H. Shanthi Bhushan, learned Deputy solicitor General of India for Respondent
No.1 while reiterating the averments made in the statement of objections would contend that the
very writ petition filed by the petitioner is not in the public interest and rather it is in the personal
interest and the same is liable to be dismissed. He would contend that there is no infringement of
any fundamental right nor any scope for enforcement of fundamental rights in the writ petition and
all the Courts exist for convenience of litigants and not for the Lawyers. Adjudicating the present
writ petition would only be an academic exercise. The establishment of the Courts should not be
construed as an investment, but to help the litigants and there is absolute absence of profit motive,
but it is for welfare of the society. Creation of Benches would be beneficial for the litigants. He would
further contend that much water has flown under the bridge and intervening in this matter at this
stage would only be futile exercise. In view of Part IV of the Constitution of India, Directive
Principles of State Policy cannot be challenged. Article-38 contemplates State to secure a social
order for the promotion of welfare of the people and Article 39A contemplates equal justice and free
legal aid. He would further contend that justice delivery to door step is the objective of the State. In
the present case, no circumstances are brought to the notice of this Court by the petitioner and the
establishment of circuit Benches at Dharwd and Gulbarga, cannot be termed as arbitrary, whimsical,
unreasonable and contrary to any statutory provisions resulting in illegality. He would further
contend that the Government has been conferred with power to be exercised as a part of duty
towards the public and every power of this nature is, therefore coupled with a duty, which is to be
performed in public interest.
36. Learned Deputy Solicitor General of India brought to our notice Government of India - Law
Commission of India Report No.230 with regard to some suggestions to reforms in the Judiciary
relating to 'Justice at easy reach' and 'Access to justice' and the recommendation made by the Law
Commission of India. He also relied upon the judgment of Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Anita Kushwaha -vs- Pushap Sudan in Transfer Petition (C) No.1343 of
2008 dated 19th July 2016, wherein it is held at paragraph-30 that four main facets that constitute
the essence of access to justice are:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 17
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
i) The State must provide an effective adjudicatory mechanism;
ii) The mechanism so provided must be reasonably accessible in terms of distance;
iii) The process of adjudication must be speedy; and
iv) The litigants access to the adjudicatory process must be affordable.
37. Lastly, Sri Shanthi Bhushan contended that Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches were established
in the year 2008 and now we are in the year 2023 and more than 14 years has elapsed and the
petitioner has not made out any case to grant relief at this belated stage, keeping in view the interest
of the citizens of the districts coming under the jurisdiction of the Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches,
staff appointed, number of cases disposed off, money spent for establishment etc., Therefore, he
sought to dismiss the writ petition.
38. In support of his contentions, learned Deputy Solicitor General of India has relied upon the
following judgments:
1. Judgment of High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Petition No.2402 of 2002
dated 26.2.2002. (paras 24 and
25)
2. Federation of BAR Associations in Karnataka vs. Union of India - (2000)6 SCC 715
.. (paragraphs 6 and 7)
3. State of Maharashtra vs. Narayan Shamrao Puranik and others - (1982)3 SCC 519
with regard to establishment of Aurangabad Bench (paras 12, 13, 15, 21, 25 and 26)
VII. Arguments advanced by learned senior counsel for Respondents 2 and 3
39. Sri Naganand, learned senior counsel along with Sri S.G. Prashanth Murthy, learned counsel for
Respondent Nos.2 and 3 would contend that originally Mysore High Court Act, 1884 was in force.
The preamble of the said Act reads as under:
"Whereas it is expedient to amend the Constitution of and to provide for the
administration of justice by (inserted by Act XXXV of 1951) the High Court of
Mysore; His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore is pleased to enact as follows:
40. Learned senior counsel also referred to the provisions of Section -17 of the Mysore High Court
Act, 1884 relating to place of sitting of High Court, which reads as under:
"17. Place of sitting of High Court :- The High Court shall hold its sittings at such
place as the 1[State Government] may, from time to time, appoint in that behalf.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 18
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Whenever it appears to the 1[State Government] convenient that the jurisdiction and
powers vested in the High Court by this Act, or any other law for the time being in
force, should be exercised in any place other than the place appointed under
paragraph 1 of this section, or at several of other places by way of circuit, the 1[State
Government] may by order authorise and direct any one or more of the Judges of
such Court to hold sittings in such place or places as by such order may be directed,
and the Judge or same Judges acting under such order shall have and exercise the
jurisdiction and authority as would be had and exercised by a Judge or Judges of the
High Court, as the case may be, in its ordinary place of sitting.
1. Substituted by Act No. 1 of 1956"
41. Learned senior counsel also brought to the notice of the Court Entries - 78 and 79 of List I -
Union List of Seventh Schedule (Article 246) of the Constitution of India, which reads as under:
"78. Constitution and organisation including vacations of the High Courts except
provisions as to officers and servants of High court; persons entitled to practise
before the High Courts.
79. Extension of the jurisdiction of a High Court to, and exclusion of the jurisdiction
of a High Court from, any Union Territory."
42. Learned senior counsel would further contend that before the amendment by Constitution
(Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976 w.e.f. 3.1.1977, Entry-3 of List II of Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution of India contemplates the words, "Administration of justice; constitution and
organistion of all courts, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts". Thereby, the said words
were existing in the Entry-3 of List-II as on the date of enactment of the Karnataka High Court Act,
1961. Now, the same words are introduced in verbatim in Entry-11A of List III w.e.f. 3.1.1977.
43. Learned senior counsel would further contend that what was questioned before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court was the report submitted by the Committee of five Judges, constituted by the Chief
Justice of Karnataka High Court, under Article 32 of the Constitution of India and not the final
decision of the President of India in the case of Federation Of Bar Associations in Karnataka -vs-
Union Of India reported in (2000)6 SCC 715 - (paragraphs-2, 8, 9 and 11), wherein it is held that the
question of establishment of a Bench of High Court away from the principal seat of the High Court is
not to be decided on emotional or sentimental or parochial considerations. 'The High Court is the
best suited machinery to decide whether it is necessary and feasible to have a bench outside the
principal seat of that High Court.' If the High Court does not favour such establishment it is
pernicious to dissect a High Court into different regions on the ground of political or other
considerations. So it is out of question to decide for establishment of a bench outside the principal
seat of a High Court contrary to the opinion of the Chief Justice of that High Court which has been
formed after considering the views of the colleague Judges. He would further contend that
petitioner has not made out any case on merits and the writ petition was dismissed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court as the Committee of Judges constituted by the Chief Justice of the High Court has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 19
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
come to the conclusion that establishment of a bench of the High Court away from Bangalore is not
advisable, thereby the judgment in the case of Federation of Bar Association in Karnataka -vs-
Union of India reported in (2000)6 SCC 715 is based on the committee report and not on any final
decision taken by the jurisdictional authorities and therefore, the present writ petition is liable to be
dismissed with costs.
44. The learned Senior Counsel would further contend that in view of the provisions of Section 51(2)
and (3) of the S.R.Act, 1956, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharashtra -vs-
Narayan Shamrao Puranik and Others reported in (1982) 3 SCC 519 (paragraphs-11, 14,15,16, 17 and
18) has held that the power may be exercised from time to time when occasion arises unless a
contrary intention appears is well settled. A statute can be abrogated only by express or implied
repeal. It cannot fall into desuetude or become inoperative through obsolescence or by lapse of time.
The Judges and Division Courts at a temporary Bench established under Sub- section (3) of Section
51 of the Act function as Judges and Division Courts of the High Court at the Principal seat and
while so sitting at such a temporary Bench they may exercise the jurisdiction and power of the High
Court itself in relation to all the matters entrusted to them.
45. Learned senior counsel would further contend that the recommendation of a Committee
consisting of seven Hon'ble Judges was approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and final decision
was taken by the President of India on the basis of the material on record. The scope of writ
petition/judicial review is very limited. In support of his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel
placed reliance on the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India -vs- Kali
Dass Batish reported in (2006)1 SCC 779, particularly paragraph-14.
46. The learned Senior Counsel further contended that the Courts are meant for a general public at
large and not for lawyers or judges. No litigant is before this Court except the lawyer, who has filed
the present writ petition in the nature of Public Interest Litigation and even other single Lawyer in
the entire State supported the case of the petitioner.
47. The learned Senior Counsel relying upon the provisions of Section 69 of the S.R. Act, 1956
contended that the petitioner cannot seek to enforce a provision of a Pre- Independence Legislation
viz., Section 17 of the Mysore High Court Act, 1884 and seek to confer power on the State
Government whose legislative competence in relation to the matters of High Courts are expressly
denuded in the aforesaid provisions of the Constitution. The said submission is fortified by Article
372 of the Constitution which provides for the continuance of the laws and their adaptation that
were in force prior to the commencement of the Constitution. However, the continuation of the
existing laws was made subject to the other provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, Section 17 of
the Mysore High Court Act, 1884 being repugnant to Entries 78 and 79 of List I of Seventh Schedule,
is unenforceable. In support of his contention, he relied upon the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of John Vallamattom and Another - vs- Union of India reported in (2003)6 SCC
611 (paragraph-18) and Union of India -vs- City Municipal Council reported in (1979) 2 SCC 1
(para-8).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 20
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
48. The learned senior counsel would further contend that paragraphs-4(a) and (b) of the Jaswanth
Singh Committee report are not applicable to the provisions of the Mysore High Court Act, 1884. He
would contend that the Constitution and Organisation of the High Courts, extension of the
jurisdiction to and exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Court, from any Union Territory are the
subject matters for framing of laws under Article 246 of the Constitution by the Parliament in as
much as the same would fall within the ambit of Entry 78 and Entry 79 in List I (Union List) of
Seventh Schedule appended to the Constitution of India. Therefore, the S.R. Act, 1956 legislated by
the Parliament and the exercise of power therein under Section 51(2) and 51(3) of the said Act,
cannot be found fault with. In support of his contentions, he relied upon the judgment in the case of
Abdul Taiyab Abbas Bhai Malik and Others -vs- The Union of India and Others reported in AIR 1977
MP 116,
49. He would further contend that the impugned annexures have been issued by the authorities who
have jurisdiction to do so and Section 17 of the Mysore High Court Act, 1884 envisages that the place
of sitting of the High Court is as notified by the State Government from time to time.
50. He contended that even assuming that the provisions of the S.R. Act, 1956 are not applicable, the
fact that the State Government was involved in the deliberation and consultation process for
creating benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga would reflect the compliance of Section 17 of the Mysore
High Court Act, 1884.
51. Learned senior counsel further contended that 'access to justice is a fundamental right under
Article 21 of the Constitution of India.' Therefore, it is incumbent upon the State including the
Judiciary to ensure that the justice delivery system reaches out to every nook and corner of the
territory. This also means that the State should provide enhanced capability and adequate
infrastructure for the functioning of the Courts to enable the ease of access to justice to every citizen.
In support of his contentions, he relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble supreme Court in the case
of All India Judges Assn. -vs- Union of India reported in (2018)17 SCC 555 (paragraphs 6,7, 9 and
10).
VIII - ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY LEARNED ADDITIONAL ADVOCATE GENERAL FOR
RESPONDENT NO.4/ STATE GOVERNMENT:
52. Sri Dhyan Chinnappa, learned Additional Advocate General along with Sri Kiran
Kumar, learned High Court Government Pleader, for State submits that the present
Public Interest Litigation is filed in the year 2014 and now i.e., after lapse of 14 years,
the relief sought for is a futile exercise and is liable to be dismissed. He further
contended that this Court while dealing with the process of proceedings, the
constitution bench at Dharwad and Kalaburagi, the public interest litigation is not
maintainable. He further contended that Federation of Bar Association case relied
upon by the petitioner, was a case based only on the report and not on the
constitution of bench.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 21
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
The said case has no consequence, after States Reorganisation Act, 1956 came into force and after
taking decision in the matter, in detail. He further contended that the petitioner is a practicing
advocate and, none of the District Bar Associations within the jurisdiction of Dharwad and
Kalaburagi Benches have supported the case of the petitioner and there is no public interest
involved and thereby the writ petition is liable to be dismissed. He further contended that the Courts
are meant for general public at large who come to the Court with great expectations for the relief
sought for and not meant either for the advocates or the Judges. Thereby, the petitioner has not
made out any ground to exercise extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of Constitution of
India and therefore, sought to dismiss the writ petition. In support of his contentions, learned
Additional Advocate General relied upon the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
State of Maharashtra vs. Narayan Shamrao Puranik and others reported in (1982) 3 SCC 519,
paragraphs 11, 15, 16 and 25. He further contended that the entry 77 and 78 List I Seventh schedule,
entry 95 List I Seventh schedule, entry 65 List II Seventh schedule, entry 46 List III Seventh
schedule and entry 11A List III Seventh schedule of the Constitution of India provides for
establishment of Benches of High Court for convenience of litigant public. He further contended
that Section 64 of the States Reorganization Act is meant only for practice and procedure, and
Section 17 of Mysuru Act is nullity in the eye of law. Thereby, petitioner has not made out any case to
grant the relief sought for and therefore, sought to dismiss the writ petition.
IX- ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY LEARNED COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT
NO.6/KALABURAGI BAR ASSOCIATION:
53. Sri Karthik Yadav, learned counsel for Sri S.K.Venkata Reddy, learned counsel for
respondent No.6, while adopting the arguments advanced by Sri S.S.Naganand,
learned Senior Counsel for respondent Nos.2 and 3 and, Sri Dhyan Chinnappa,
learned Additional Advocate General for respondent No.4, would contend that the
provisions of Section 14 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and Sections 2 and 3 of
States Reorganisation Act, 1956, has to be exercised from time to time as and when
occasion arises. He further contended that in similar circumstances two advocates
filed two separate writ petitions before High Court of Judicature, Madras, in
W.P.Nos.2402/2002 and 3333/2002 which came to be dismissed. Against the said
Order Writ Appeal No.926/2002 came to filed which was also dismissed by the
Division Bench of the Madras High Court on 11.03.2004, wherein, at paragraphs 6, 7,
20 and 21, it is specifically held as under:
"6. Learned single Judge then held that the Madras High Court would also be covered
by the State Reorganisation Act, 1956 since Madras was also a State, which was a
subject-matter of the State Reorganisation Act, 1956 in terms of Sec. 4 in Part II of
the said Act. Quoting Sec. 4 of the said Act, it was pointed out that some territory
from the erstwhile State of Madras while some others, which were not part of the
Madras State, were added. The learned Judge, therefore, held that the State of
Madras was a 'new State' within the meaning of State Reorganisation Act and,
therefore, there was always a power available to the Chief Justice under Sec. 51(3) of
the State Reorganisation Act and that the permanent Benches could also be set up
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 22
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
under Sec. 51(2) of the said Act. On these reasons, the learned single Judge dismissed
the writ petition, W.P. No. 2402 of 2002.
7. In so far as the writ petition, W.P. No. 3333 of 2002 was concerned, the learned
Judge refuted the arguments that under Art. 214 there could be only one High Court
for each State and held that the Benches of the High Court are as much part of the
main High Court. For this also, learned single Judge relied on the aforementioned
decision in State of Maharashtra v. Narayanan (supra). Learned Judge then rejected
the contention raised in that petition that the jurisdiction to deal with the High Court
was a parliamentary power and in the absence of any parliamentary law or
constitutional provision, no such decision can be taken. For this, learned Judge relied
on Arts. 225 and 372 and the Letters Patent. Lastly, the learned single Judge also
refuted the contention that Clause 31 of the Letters Patent could not be invoked
because of the unamended language of the said Letters Patent. It was pointed out that
by Adaptation Order, 1937 and 1950, the provisions would have to be read and the
suitable changes would have to be deemed to be there in the Letters Patent. Before
parting, learned Judge ultimately noted that tremendous expenditure had already
been made in creating the infrastructure for the Madurai Bench and that the subject
of creation of a High Court Bench at Madurai was in the vogue for the last thirty
years. Learned Judge ultimately came to the conclusion that the petitioner could not
plead ignorance of the developments regarding the creation of Bench at Madurai and
the writ petition was liable to be dismissed in limine on the ground of laches. The
learned Judge, therefore, dismissed the writ petition, W.P. No. 3333 of 2002.
20. Shri Vijayan, however, took great exception to the factual statement made by Shri
V.T. Gopalan in which the learned Additional Solicitor General also referred to Sec.
51(2) of the State Reorganisation Act and wanted to contend that such a decision
could not be possible in view of the fact that the State of Tamil Nadu was not a 'new
State' and that the power under Sec. 51(2) of the States Reorganisation Act could be
implemented only in respect of the 'New State'. We have already explained that the
learned single Judge has already held that the words 'State of Tamil Nadu' (the then
Madras State) referred to in Sec. 4 under Part II of the States Reorganisation Act can
be deemed to be a 'new State' and the inference of the learned single Judge and the
consequential dismissal of the writ petition, W.P. No. 2402 of 2002, where this
question was raised has remained unchallenged. We would, therefore, leave the
question at that. Further, in our opinion, it would now be futile to go into that
question as the procedural aspect of creation of the Bench of the Madras High Court
at Madurai is inextricably connected with the basic question as to whether there
should be a Bench at all at Madurai or not. We have already pointed out that this
basic issue and the decision therefor could have been challenged only at the proper
time. The petitioner chose to keep silent at the material time and has chosen to woke
up now after crores of rupees have been spent and is trying to raise the procedural
objections only to thwart the basic objective of creation of the Bench at Madurai,
which is not permissible. We have no doubts in our minds that the Central
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 23
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Government would take proper steps in law procedurally by taking recourse to
proper legal procedure. In any event, by a mere procedural challenge, petitioner
could not be permitted to achieve a wider objective of thwarting the Bench at
Madurai at all more particularly at this juncture in the year 2004 when the first
decision was taken in the year 1995 and was ratified in the year 2000 after a firm
decision was taken in that behalf by the Central Government and further when crores
of rupees are spent in creating infrastructure.
21. It must be borne in mind that the High Court, in exercise of its' powers, cannot
ask the Legislature to legislate or to legislate in a particular manner. So also, the High
Court shall not ask the Legislature not to legislate or to legislate in a particular
manner. How a particular objective is to be carried out or realised has to be left to the
wisdom of the Legislature altogether and we have no doubts that the objective of
bringing about the Bench of the Madras High Court at Madurai shall so obtained.
We, therefore, agree with the learned single Judge. The judgment of the learned
single Judge, dismissing the writ petition, W.P. No. 3333 of 2002 and dismiss this
appeal. No other point were argued excepting those referred to above."
Therefore, learned counsel sought to dismiss the writ petition.
54. Smt.Sona Vakkund, learned counsel appearing for Dharwad Bar Association adopted the
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the Central Government, State as well as the High
Court.
X - POINTS FOR DETERMINATION
55. In view of the aforesaid rival contentions urged by learned counsel for parties the points that
would arise for our consideration in the present writ petition are:
"(i) Whether the petitioner has made out a case any public interest to quash the
notification dated 19.10.2004 vide annexure-E, whereunder, Hon'ble the Chief
Justice, High Court of Karnataka, in exercise of powers under Section 51(3) of the
State Reorganisation Act, 1956 with the approval of His Excellency the Governor of
Karnataka, notified the sitting of Judges and Division Courts of the High Court of
Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga; notification dated 04.06.2008 vide
Annexure-F, whereunder, it was notified that the cases arising from the Districts of
Bagalkot, Bellary, Belgaum, Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri, Uttara Kannada-
Karwar and Koppal will be heard and decided at Circuit Bench at Dharwad, and, case arising from
the Districts of Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga and Raichur, will be heard and decided at the Circuit Bench
at Gulbarga, and that sitting of Judges and Division Courts at Circuit Benches at Dharwad and
Gulbarga will commence on 07.07.2008 and that the pending cases from the respective districts
coming within the jurisdiction of the aforesaid two Circuit Benches will be transferred to respective
circuit benches before 07.07.2008 and filing of new cases at circuit benches will be permitted from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 24
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
07.07.2008; and The High Court of Karnataka (Establishment of Permanent Benches at Dharwad
and Gulbarga) Order, 2013, dated 08.08.2013, vide Annexure-M, whereunder, the President of
India, in exercise of powers conferred by sub Section (2) of Section 51 of the States Reorganisation
Act, 1956 (37 of 1956), in consultation with the Governor of Karnataka and Chief Justice of the High
Court of Karnataka, passed the Order to the effect that the permanent Bench of the High Court of
Karnataka at Dharwad shall come into operation on 24.08.2013 and the permanent Bench of the
High Court of Karnataka at Gulbarga shall come into operation on 31.08.2013?
(ii) Whether the petitioner has made out any case for issuance of a writ of mandamus to the 5th
respondent to conduct performance audit including financial audit regarding the investment,
expenditure and functional viability of Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga, in exercise of
extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of Constitution of India?"
XI - CONSIDERATION
56. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by
learned counsel for the parties and perused the entire material including original
records, carefully.
57. The substance of present Public Interest Litigation filed by the petitioner who is a
practicing advocate is, challenge to the notification dated 19.10.2004 vide
annexure-E, notification dated 04.06.2008 vide Annexure-F, and Order dated
08.08.2013, vide Annexure-M, mainly on the ground that the establishment of
benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga was inadvisable in view of the dictum of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Federation of Bar Association in Karnataka vs
Union of India reported in (2000)6 SCC 715, on the ground that, an executive act
cannot over write judicial decision and that, in view of Article 214 of the Constitution
of India only one seat at principal seat is provided and the establishment of circuit
benches is in Violation of Sections 51 and 69 of the States Reorganisation Act and
contrary to the provisions of Mysuru High Court Act, 1884 and against Jaswant Singh
Commission report, and converting circuit benches into permanent benches by the
High Court before reviewing the performance of the benches regarding functional
viability, financial sustainability without effecting the audit by the 5th respondent, as
huge public money is involved and thereby in the interest of public at large, it is
incumbent to quash the notifications sought for in the writ petition.
58. The petitioner relied upon the report of Jaswant Singh Commission report dated
30.04.1985 addressed to Union Law Minister, wherein, it is stated that, although the
members of the Commission were able to examine and report on the demands for
establishment of permanent Benches of High Courts of Madras and Madhya Pradesh
besides Allahabad, they have not found it practicable to complete the work in relation
to Karnataka and North Eastern States by the date set up by the Government vide
Ministry letter No.46/2/81-Jus, dated 04.04.1985 for the reasons mentioned in the
said letter. It is further stated that, before embarking on the task assigned to it in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 25
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
regard to the State of Karnataka, the Commission had a preliminary round of talks
with the Chief Minister of the State. During the course of said task, the Chief Minister
detailed before the Commission the grounds, on the basis whereof the State
Government considered it necessary to have a Bench of the High Court for the two
Revenue Divisions of Belgaum and Gulbarga and the district of Shimoga and its
location at Dharwad. Thereafter, the Commission met the Chief Justice and his
companion judges, all of whom appeared to be opposed to the establishment of a
Bench of the High Court of the State at any place away from its Principal seat.
59. Subsequently, a demand for establishment of separate bench of High Court in
north Karnataka has often been raised in last decades with regular intervals. The
Mysuru State now called 'Karnataka' was formed after reorganization of five regions,
viz.,
(a) Erstwhile Mysuru State
(b) Bombay Karnataka Area
(c) Hyderabard Karnataka Area
(d) Madras-Karnataka
(e) Erstwhile hilly region of Coorg.
The plea of a circuit bench or a permanent Bench at Dharwad-Hubli and Gulbarga was being raised
mainly on the ground of inconvenience/expense caused to the litigant public because of the distance
from those areas to Bengaluru. It did not find favour with successive Chief Justices. In the year 1999
the issue was raked up afresh followed by hunger strike resorted to by the President of Dharwad Bar
Association and certain advocates. Their demand was that a permanent bench of High Court be
established at Hubli. Demand for benches at Belgaum, Gulbarga, Bellary and Bidar were also made
at the same time. Pursuant to the representations of the members of Dharwad District Bar
Association dated 23.03.1999, the then Chief Justice constituted a committee of five Judges to
consider the memorandum submitted for establishing a Bench of the High Court at Hubli-Dharwad.
The Committee, in its meeting dated 29.07.1999, resolved to invite President, Secretary and
representatives of the District Bar Association who made representations for the establishment of
the Bench of the High Court at their respective District Head Quarters. The Committee heard the
President, Secretary and representatives of the Bar Association of Hubli-Dharwad on 25.08.1999, of
Belgaum on 18.09.1999, of Bijapur on 08.10.1999, of Gulbarga, Bidar and Yadgir on 03.12.1999 and
of Bellary on 13.12.1999.
60. Considering the demand for Bench of the High Court at a place away from principal seat, in the
last 30 years, on nine occasions, the said question has been considered i.e., on 20.05.1969,
24.08.1973, 25.03.1975, 29.10.1979, 17.07.1990, 01.04.1991, 30.10.1991, 12.08.1993 and 29.11.1994.
Except for once, i.e., on 29.10.1979, on all other occasions, the representations for creating the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 26
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Bench of the High Court at a place away of principal seat was rejected. In the year 1979, the then
Chief Justice was in favour of establishment of bench at Dharwad subject to the condition that State
Government undertakes to construct a suitable building for the High Court. It was stated that,
unless all amenities were provided, the then Chief Justice opposed for establishment of Bench at
Dharwad. The committee also considered Jaswant Singh committee report and observed that there
are 27 revenue districts in the State of Karnataka including 7 new districts created in the year 1998.
However, so far as the sessions divisions are concerned, there are only 20 divisions and, District
Courts in the newly established District headquarters have not yet been established. The total area
comprised in the State of Karnataka is 1,918 sq.kms and the population as per 1991 census is
4,49,77,000.. The northern districts of State of Karnataka are comprised in Belgaum and Gulbarga
division. The pendency of cases on the file of the High Court arising out of the 8 districts i.e.,
Dharwad, Karwar, Bijapur, Belgaum, Bellary, Bidar, Gulbarga and Raichur, is 30.42% as on
22.11.1997 and the same has come down to 20.11% as on 01.08.1999 and as on 01.01.2000, the
percentage from these districts has further come down to 18.37%. The Committee headed by Justice
Ashok Bhan and four other Hon'ble Judges also held that, the cost of travel is not a major part of the
litigation. Court fees and lawyers fee constitute the bulk of expenditure. The presence of the parties
at Bangalore would not be necessary for the purpose of institution, prosecuting or defending their
cases in view of the new proposal to connect the mufassil courts within the High Court through
computers connecting all the courts in vide area network in the State. There would be no hardship
faced by the litigant public of northern Karnataka region at the principal seat of the High Court at
Bangalore in instituting, prosecuting and defending their cases as the entire process of filing,
scrutiny and the information regarding the status of the case is being computerised and there is also
proposal to connect all the Courts in the State with the High Court through the computers. It was
further opined that Bangalore Bar consists of advocates from all parts of the State and the facilities
and connections which the members of the Bar are having with the litigant public is not only
adequate but the legal machinery is smoothly functioning. Where a State is a Federation of different
areas or it comprises of different regions, such demands to crop up, but they lead to
decentralization. The paramount consideration in deciding such demand should be the real and
genuine need of the people for grant of a separate facility. Thereby, the Committee opined that the
demand is neither real nor genuine and it is not for the benefit of litigant public. Thereby, the
Committee was of the opinion that, none of the criteria laid down by Jaswant Singh commission
report is satisfied for considering expediency and desirability of establishing a Bench away from
principal seat of the High Court. The Committee was of the opinion that it is not necessary to have a
Bench of the High Court of Karnataka at a place away from principal seat of the High Court, and
thereby, the question of considering establishment of Bench at Hubali-Dharwad, Belgaum, Bijapur,
Gulbarga and Bidar or any other place away from the principal seat of the High Court at Bangalore,
does not arise.
61. Subsequently, in the year 2001, the President, Bar Association, Dharwad, made one more
representation requesting the then Chief Justice to recommend for establishment of Bench at
Hubli-Dharwad twin city, at the earliest. In view of the representations and subsequent
developments, the then Chief Justice, by the notification dated 21.03.2002, constituted a Committee
consisting of 07 Hon'ble Judges of this Court, to consider the question as to whether it is necessary
to have a Bench of the High Court at a place other than its principal seat at Bangalore, and if
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 27
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
necessary, to consider the situs of the Bench in one of the places in North Karnataka.
The aforesaid Committee consisting of 07 Hon'ble Judges met on 03.04.2002 and directed that the
representations and suggestions of the people be called for. Accordingly, public notifications were
issued in all leading newspapers inviting representations from all sections of the society having
interest in the issue. Pursuant to the notification, 402 representations were received. The
committee, on examination of representations, found it more advisable to visit the principal towns
of the North Karnataka districts and have a public hearing regarding the demand and its
reasonableness. Accordingly, the Committee held public hearing at following places where audience
was given to diverse sections of the public including representatives of bar association, trade and
industry, public representatives like Ministers, MLAs, MPs, counsellors, women organisations,
physically disabled persons, agriculturists, religious leaders and social activist groups. At every
place, there was a tremendous public response with an unequivocal demand for having a Bench of
the High Court in northern region of the State. The place and dates of visits were:

The statistical data:
1. Geographical Area: The geographical area of the State of Karnataka is 1,91,791 sq.kms and the
total area of district comprised in North Karnataka is 98,621 sq.kms. Thus the total area of 12

4. Per capita income and economic conditions: The
reorganised State's average per capita income in 1956 was less than Rs.200/- and this rose to
Rs.13,621/- by 1998 and to Rs.17,482/- in 2001. The various districts per capita income increased
correspondingly and continuously. However, the range of variation in district income is quite wide.
In 1997-98, the per capita income in Bidar (one of the 12 northern districts in the State) was
Rs.7,861/- whereas in Bengaluru Urban District it was Rs.25,740/-. It is noticeable that the northern
region of the State is relatively more backward and economically downtrodden compared to
southerners.
5. Distance: The distance between Bengaluru and major towns in the northern Karnataka area are as
under.
Bangalore-Hubli 400 kms
Bangalore-Dharwad 426 kms
Bangalore-Belgaum 502 kms
Bangalore-Bijapur 579 kms
Bangalore-Gulbarga 613 kms
Bangalore-Bellary 304 kms
Bangalore-Bidar 669 kms
Bangalore-Raichur 415 kms
The Committee further recorded a finding that, Jaswant Singh Commission had broadly laid down
21 criteria for considering the desirability of establishment of the Bench of the High Court at a place
outside the principal seat. The above statistical data by and large satisfies all the criteria laid down
by Jaswant Singh Committee. The pendency of cases from northern districts is almost one third of
the total pendency of the High Court. The are (51.42%) and population (42.71%) of the demanding
districts is much more than one fourth of the total area and population of the State. The journey
from any place of the demanding districts to Bangalore will take much more than 8 to 10 hours. The
filing of cases from these districts to the High Court is on the incline. The setting of the Bench at any
place in northern Karnataka will certainly tend to their convenience and on ultimate analysis, it will
substantially reduce the overall cost of litigation and inconvenience to the litigant public belonging
to the area.
The High Powered Committee for Redressal of Regional Imbalances constituted by the Government
of Karnataka, in its Final Report submitted in June 2002, has opined that 'more than some of the
disparities in facilities, non-fulfillment of the long- time cherished desire of the people of North
Karnataka to have a Bench of the Karnataka High Court in their region has led to greater anguish
and frustration." The Chief Minister of the State had made public statements regarding the need of a
Bench of the High Court at Hubli-Dharwad which had been supported by all political parties
irrespective of party affiliations. A statement to this effect was also made by the Chief Minister on
the floor of the State Legislature. On February 28, 2003, while addressing the Joint Session of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 29
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Karnataka Legislature, the Governor of the State again reiterated the firm stand of the State
Government favouring establishment of a High Court Bench at Hubli-Dharwad.
It can not be lost sight of that Jaswant Singh Committee was constituted to formulate the criteria for
establishment of the permanent Benches of the High Court outside its Principal seat in the new
states created under the states Reorganisation Act, 1956. By this time, in all the States so created,
except the State of Karnataka, having regard to convenience of the litigants, such Benches have been
established. Creation of benches has hardly posed any problem in administration of justice in such
states. It is of importance to note that Parliament itself has made an unambiguous provision in the
States Reorganisation Act empowering the President of India to establish permanent Benches, if the
situation so demands, after consultation with the State Government and the Chief Justice of the
High Court. This power has to be necessarily exercised if the cause of imparting affordable and
accessible justice to the people so demands. The legislative intendment cannot be set at naught on
an apprehension that the establishment of permanent Benches outside the principal seat would
impair the unity and integrity of the High Court.
Conclusion Accordingly, the Committee opined that the Hon'ble Chief Justice may recommend for
establishment of permanent Bench of the High Court on the location referred to above subject to the
conditions that:
(1) Before notifying the establishment of the permanent Bench and making it
functional, the State Government should create complete infrastructure by
constructing buildings for housing the Bench, the Judges, staff, lawyers as also
ensuring availability of adequate facilities for boarding and lodging of the litigants, to
the full satisfaction of the High Court;
and, (2) State Government should also make appropriate arrangements for availability of water
throughout the year for drinking and other purposes in the corporation area of Hubli-Dharwad. We
are making this specific because there is a general complaint of acute shortage of water in
Hubli-Dharwad which may cause great inconvenience to the litigant public and other functionaries
of the court and may defeat the very purpose of establishing the Bench.
Before parting, we make it clear that under no circumstance, the request for establishment of a
Bench in any temporary accommodation or on any adhoc arrangement should be conceded to
because, according to us, any such adhoc arrangement may acquire a permanent character and the
Bench may be required to continue functioning without their being appropriate infrastructure and
facilities as indicated above.
Out of seven members of Justice G.C.Bharuka Committee, majority of the members i.e., five
members supported establishment of circuit benches. However, two members who were the
members of earlier Committee of Ashok Bhan, expressed that there is no need to have Benches of
High Court of Karnataka at a place other than Bengaluru.

62. A careful perusal of the report of Jaswant Singh Commission dated 30.04.1985 depicts that the
Commission at Chapter V enumerated the Broad Principles and Criteria to be followed in assessing
the expediency and desirability of setting up a bench of the High Court away from the Principal Seat.
The Commission met the Hon'ble Chief Justice and his companion Judges who opposed to establish
the bench at any place other than principal seat, in the year 1985. When the Committee headed by
Justice Ashok Bhan was constituted, the Committee, except considering representations of Bar
Association, has not given audience to representatives of trade and industry, public representatives
like Ministers, MLAs, MPs, counsellors, women organisations, physically disabled persons,
agriculturists, religious leaders and social activist groups and has not noted the distance from the
Principal Seat, number of cases pending. The subsequent Committee submitted the report dated
06.06.2003, wherein, majority of the Committee members supported for establishment of Benches.
However, two members of the Committee opposed for establishment of Bench at a place away from
Principal Seat.
It is also not in dispute on the recommendation made by the Committee the Chief Secretary,
Government of Karnataka, addressed a letter to Hon'ble the Chief Justice, High Court of Karnataka,
informing that His Excellency the Governor of Karnataka has approved the proposal for
establishment of benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga. Accordingly, Hon'ble the Chief Justice, by
notification dated 19.10.2004, in exercise of powers under the provisions of Section 51(3) of the
States Reorganization Act issued notification notifying the sittings of Judges and Division Courts of
the High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga. The notification specifically depicts that the
date of sitting will be notified after getting satisfactory report of the Hon'ble Committee (already
constituted) by the Order of the Hon'ble Chief Justice, High Court of Karnataka. Subsequently, by
notification dated 04.06.2008, Hon'ble Chief Justice permitted to commence sittings of Judges and
division Courts at Dharwad and Gulbarga with effect from 07.07.2008.
63. The provisions of sub section (1), (2) and (3) of Section 51 of the States Reorganization Act, 1956,
reads as under:
51. Principal seat and other places of sitting of High Courts for new States.― (1) The
principal seat of the High Court for a new State shall be at such place as the President
may, by notified order, appoint.
(2) The President may, after consultation with the Governor of a new State and the Chief Justice of
the High Court for that State, by notified order, provide for the establishment of a permanent bench
or benches of that High Court at one or more places within the State other than the principal seat of
the High Court and for any matters connected therewith. (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in
sub- section (1) or sub-section (2), the Judges and division courts of the High Court for a new State
may also sit at such other place or places in that State as the Chief Justice may, with the approval of
the Governor, appoint.
By careful reading of the said provision makes it clear that, the principal seat of the High Court for a
new State shall be at such place as the President may, by notified order, appoint. Further, the
President may, after consultation with the Governor of a new State and the Chief Justice of the High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 31
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Court for that State, by notified order, provide for the establishment of a permanent bench or
benches of that High Court at one or more places within the State other than the principal seat of the
High Court and for any matters connected therewith. Notwithstanding anything contained in
sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the Judges and division courts of the High Court for a new State
may also sit at such other place or places in that State as the Chief Justice may, with the approval of
the Governor, appoint.
64. The then Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka addressed a letter dated 15.09.2004 to Hon'ble
Chief Justice of Karnataka enumerating the number of cases pending as on different dates from
01.01.2000 to 30.07.2004 and has stated that the said statistics indicates a rising trend of cases and
satisfies one of the important criteria of Jaswant Singh Commission's recommendations. However,
proximity has shown to be a motivating factor for accessing the High Court for redressal of
grievances. Northern Karnataka's restrained use of High Court's Court's jurisdiction can be largely
attributed to the difficulties faced by the people of northern Karnataka in reaching the Hon'ble High
Court located at Bengaluru. The establishment of a Bench in northern Karnataka would prove to be
an effective instrument for the expeditious dispensation of justice and would substantially reduce
the inconvenience to the litigating public belonging to said region. It was further stated that the
Government will endeavour to abide by the concerns listed at Part II of Jaswant Singh Commission
prescriptions in deciding the location of the proposed Bench. Therefore, there is necessary to have
an in-principle approval for a Bench of the High Court in northern Karnataka and that the State
Government has earmarked Rs.20 crores in the budget for the current year for establishing a bench
of the High Court in northern Karnataka. It was further stated that, if a higher allocation is required
during the current financial year, the State Government is committed to provide the same. In the
subsequent years also, adequate budget provision for this purpose was assured. Thereby, requested
the Chief Justice to establish two Circuit Benches in northern Karnataka and hear matters
emanating from northern Karnataka region. Such an arrangement would meet the people's
immediate requirements, their aspirations, improve the accessibility of High Court's services to the
people of northern Karnataka. Accordingly, there were letter correspondences between Hon'ble
Chief Justice and Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka.
65. In view of the above, the notifications came to be issued by Hon'ble Chief Justice dated
19.10.2004 and 04.06.2008 exercising powers under Section 51(3) of the States Reorganization Act,
1956, based on the report of Hon'ble Mr. Justice G.C.Bharuka Committee and, taking into
consideration the interest of litigant public of northern Karnataka, it is just and proper.
When majority of the members of Hon'ble Mr. Justice G.C.Bharuka Committee submitted the report
dated 06.06.2003 supporting the establishment of Benches, and consequently, when the Benches
came to be established, except relying on the report of Jaswant Singh Commission which is of the
year 1985 and the report of Justice Ashok Bhanu Committee, how the present writ petition involves
'public interest' is not shown by the petitioner by producing any materials before the Court.
Admittedly, the report of Justice G.C.Bharuka Committee, in which, majority of the members
supported the establishment of Benches, is not challenged in the present writ petition. In the entire
pleadings, there is no whisper as to how the report of the Committee headed by Justice G.C.Bharuka
dated 06.06.2003 is against public interest. It is also not in dispute that His Excellency the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 32
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Governor of Karnataka has also given approval in exercise of powers conferred under Section 51(2)
of the States Reorganization Act, 1956 and the same is also not challenged by the petitioner.
66. It is also not in dispute that, after establishment of Circuit Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga,
and after receiving complete proposal from the State Government in consultation with Hon'ble
Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka and His Excellency the Governor of Karnataka, the Hon'ble
the then Chief Justice of Karnataka, in July 2009 requested the Central Government to notify the
Circuit Benches of High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad and Gulbarga as permanent benches, under
the provisions of sub section (2) of Section 51 of the States Reorganization Act, 1956, and to enhance
the sanctioned strength of Judges of Karnataka High Court from 41 to 56. The Deputy Secretary to
the government of India addressed a letter dated 03.11.2009 to the Chief Secretary, Government of
Karnataka, stating that, with the approva of the Chief Justice of India, it has been decided to create 9
posts of additional Judges (06 for Dharwad Bench and 03 for Gulbarga Bench) in the Karnataka
High Court and with this, the Judge strength of the Karnataka High Court will stand revised to 50
i.e., 33 permanent Judges and 17 additional Judges.
The proposal for establishment of permanent benches of High Court of Karnataka at Dharwad and
Gulbarga was approved by Hon'ble President of India on 08.08.2013, after approval of Central
Cabinet, in exercise of powers under 51(2) of States Reorganization Act. Accordingly, the High Court
of Karnataka (Establishment of Permanent Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga) Order, 2013, came
to be issued by Hon'ble President of India, to the effect that the permanent Bench of the High Court
of Karnataka at Dharwad shall come into operation on 24.08.2013 and the permanent Bench of the
High Court of Karnataka at Gulbarga shall come into operation on 31.08.2013. The same is in
accordance with law.
67. It is undisputed fact that Circuit Benches were constituted on 04.06.2008 to start functioning
w.e.f. 07.07.2008 and the present writ petition came to be filed on 16.05.2014 after lapse of more
than six years. Absolutely there is no explanation for the inordinate delay of 06 years in filing writ
petition challenging establishment of Circuit Benches. The petitioner is a practicing Advocate. As
admitted by him, he is practicing in High Court of Karnataka, principal Bench and also at Dharwad
and Kalaburagi Benches. He was sitting on the fence for more than 06 years watching the
establishment of Benches, enhancement of Judges and Staff strength. He woke up only when the
Circuit Benches were made permanent Benches by the Hon'ble President of India on 08.08.2013
and filed the writ petition on 16.05.2014. Thereby, petitioner is not entitled to any relief. The powers
exercised by the President under Section 51(2) of the States Reorganization Act, 1956, has not been
challenged by the petitioner. The petitioner, being a practicing advocate, who has practiced in the
principal Bench as well as at Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi, as admitted by him in the
memorandum, has filed the present writ petition after lapse of six years from the date of
establishment of Benches. Thereby, the writ petition is not maintainable and the same is liable to be
dismissed. It is also not in dispute that, the recommendation made by Hon'ble Chief Minister,
approved by His Excellency the Governor of Karnataka, approved by Central Cabinet and Hon'ble
Chief Justice of India, with regard to establishment of permanent Benches has not been challenged
by the petitioner. What is challenged is only annexure-M dated 08.08.2013 issued by Hon'ble
President of India in exercise of powers conferred under Section 51(2) of States Reorganization Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 33
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
1956 after consonance with His Excellency the Governor of Karnataka and Hon'ble Chief Justice of
Karnataka. In the entire writ petition, petitioner has not questioned the powers of Hon'ble President
of India under Section 51(2) of the States Reorganization Act, 1956. In the absence of the same, the
writ petition filed by petitioner is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed.
68. It is not the case of the petitioner that the findings of the Committee headed by Hon'ble Mr.
Justice G.C.Bharuka is not based on any material on record. Once the report submitted by Hon'ble
Mr. Justice G.C.Bharuka Committee was accepted on 06.06.2003 and reached finality, followed by
subsequent notifications, the petitioner cannot have any grievance, unless it is established before the
Court that Committee recommendations for establishment of Benches is without any material. On
that ground also the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
69. Learned counsel for petitioner contended that Part V of the States Reorganization Act, 1956, is
not applicable for constitution of permanent bench, as it is only temporary and transitional
provision. He contended that, once the High Court Act, 1961 came into force, any of the provisions
of States Reorganization Act, 1956 is not applicable. Thereby, there is no consistent stand of the
petitioner as to which Act is applicable i.e., States Reorganization Act, 1956 or Mysore High Court
Act, 1884 or Mysore/Karnataka High Court Act, 1961. The preamble of the Karnataka High Court
Act, 1961 clearly depicts that, "an Act to make provision for regulating the business and the exercise
of powers of the High Court of the State of Karnataka in relation to the administration of justice and
to provide for its jurisdiction".
The provisions of Section 3 of the High Court Act, 1961 reads as under:
3. Registrar and Deputy Registrars. - [(1)] The High Court shall have a Registrar and
as many Deputy Registrars as may be determined by the Governor in consultation
with the High Court.
[(2) The High Court may also have as many Additional Registrars, Joint Registrars and Assistant
Registrars as may be determined by the Governor in consultation with the High Court.] The High
Court must necessarily carry on its administrative functions from the principal seat, i.e,. the place
where the High Court transacts every kind of business in all its capacities. The High Court, as such,
is located there, but it may have more than one seat for transaction of judicial business. The
constitution and structure of High Court depends on statute creating it. Unlike the creation of a
permanent bench under sub section (2) of Section 51 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, which
must bring about a territorial bifurcation of the High Court, there is no territorial bifurcation of the
High Court merely because the Chief Justice appoints other places under Section 51(3), where the
Judges and division courts shall also sit. The power under Section 51(3) is in the unquestioned
domain of Hon'ble Chief Justice, the only condition being that he must act with the approval of His
Excellency the Governor. It is basically an internal matter pertaining to the High Court. The Chief
Justice has full power, authority and jurisdiction in the matter of allocation of business of the High
Court which flows not only from provision contained in sub Section (3), but inheres in him in the
very nature of things. The opinion of Chief Justice in this matter must therefore normally prevail,
because it is for more convenient transaction of judicial business. The non obstante clause contained
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 34
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
in sub Section (3) gives an overriding effect to the powers of Hon'ble Chief Justice and Registrar
General as contemplated under Section 3, is only one Registrar General for the High Court of
Karnataka and there are Additional Registrar Generals appointed to the Circuit/Permanent Benches
at Dharwad and Kalaburagi, as contemplated under Section 3 of the Act. Legally, the position is
quite clear under Section 51(3) of the Act. The Judge sitting at Dharwad and Kalaburagi constitute a
part of High Court of Karnataka. They are as much as part of High Court of Karnataka, Bengaluru.
And if we might say so distinguish part of the High Court of Karnataka, as if they were sitting under
the same roof under which Judges functioning at High Court of Karnataka, Bengaluru. All that
happens is that the Chief Justice under the powers given to him distributed the work to various
Judges and various Divisional benches and acting under that power he distributes certain work to
Judges sitting at Dharwad and Kalaburagi.
70. The political changes necessarily affected the constitution and structure of the High Court.
Under the Constitution of India, Parliament alone has legislative competence to make law relating to
entry 78 List I of Seventh Schedule which reads as under:
78.Constitution and Organization (including vacations) of the High Courts except
provisions as to officers and servants of High Courts; persons entitled to practice
before High Court.
Under the Scheme of States Reorganisation Act, 1956, 1956 (Act 37 of 1956) it would appear that
having constituted the High Court for the State of Karnataka under Section 49(1) of the Act and
conferred jurisdiction on it under Section 52 in relation to the territories of the State, formed and
left to the various high constitutional functionaries designated in these subsections of Section 51 of
the Act to determine the place where the principal seat of the High Court should be located and
places where permanent benches of the High Court may be established, as has been done in State of
Karnataka, one bench at Dharwad and one bench at Kalaburagi to ensure access justice to the door
step of litigants or where the Judges of division of high court may also sit, on the reorganisation of
States as from appointed day i.e., 01st November 1956, the territories of the State of Karnataka. On
the second recommendation made by majority of five Judges of the Committee consisting of seven
Judges committee, two circuit benches viz., Dharwad and Kalaburagi, came to be established, taking
into consideration the overall circumstances, with the approval of all constitutional functionaries as
contemplated under Section 51 of the States Reorganization Act, 1956. The cabinet decision was
taken by Government of India and was approved by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. This Court
cannot sit over the decision of not only Government of India but also decision of Hon'ble Chief
Justice of India. One cannot assume or impute to a high constitutional authority, like the Chief
Justice of India, such procedural or substantive error. If Parliament has reposed faith in the Chief
Justice of India as the paterfamilias of the judicial hierarchy in this Country, it is not open for
anyone to contend that the Chief Justice of India might have given his concurrence without
application of mind or without calling for the necessary inputs. Admittedly, in the present case, on
the recommendation made by the committee consisting of Senior Judges of this Court about
establishment of circuit benches, same was approved by Hon'ble Chief Minister and with the
approval from His Excellency the Governor of Karnataka, Chief Justice of Karnataka made a
proposal for establishment of circuit benches and the same was approved by Central Cabinet as well
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 35
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
as Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. Accordingly, Hon'ble President of India, by the order dated
08.08.2013 concurred for establishment of permanent benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi in
exercise of powers under Section 51(2) of the States Reorganization Act, 1956. Thereby, the
petitioner has not made out any ground to quash the notification issued by Hon'ble the President of
India. On that ground also, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
71. It is undisputed fact that the opinion of the Chief Justice to appoint the seat of the High Court at
a place other than the principal seat under sub section (3) of Section 51 of the Act must therefore
normally prevail because it is for the more convenient transaction of judicial business. The Judges
and Division Courts at Dharwad and Kalaburagi are part of the High Court of Karnataka, Bengaluru,
which is the principal seat and they exercise the jurisdiction as Judges of High Court of Karnataka.
Hence it is apparent that, by virtue of power conferred on the Chief Justice under sub section (3) of
Section 51 of the Act, the Chief Justice can establish benches, at such place or places where the
Judges and Division Courts may sit and he has power and authority to issue administrative
directions for filing of cases or institution of proceedings at such place or places. By that process,
there will be no territorial bifurcation of the High Court of Karnataka, merely because of the
arrangement made in terms of the impugned notifications vide Annexures-E and F dated
19.10.2004 and 04.06.2008 respectively. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of High Court has the
prerogative to distribute the business of the High Court, both judicial and administrative. The Chief
Justice is the master of roster and that he alone has the right and power to decide how the benches
of the High Court are to be constituted, which Judge has to sit along and which cases he can and as
required to hear and also as to which Judges shall constitute Division Bench and what work those
benches shall do. It cannot be held to be wrong or illegal. Thereby, there is nothing wrong in
specifying that new cases arising from certain Districts shall be filed at a particular circuit bench, as
those cases are to be heard and decided by Judges sitting at that circuit bench. Such an
arrangement, is for administrative convenience and advantage of the litigants. "After all, the Courts
are meant for the benefit of litigant public and hence, their convenience should be the paramount
consideration and not for the lawyers or Judges." Thereby, the impugned notifications Annexures-E,
F and M issued by the constitutional authorities are positive and concrete step to achieve the goal of
providing "easy and less expensive access to justice to all." On that ground also, the writ petition is
liable to be dismissed.
72. Though, learned counsel for the petitioner mainly contended that constitution of benches at
Dharwad and Kalaburagi is against the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Federation of Bar Association in Karnataka and that dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is
binding on all Courts as provided under Article 141 of the constitution of India, it was a case where a
committee of five judges was constituted, who after hearing only the Bar Associations submitted the
report disfavouring the proposal for establishment of a bench away from principal seat of High
Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, relying upon the Committee report which disfavoured the
establishment of a Bench outside the principal seat of the High Court, held that the Chief Justice
cannot be pressurised to take a different view through agitations and other tactics and question of
establishment of a bench of the High Court away from principal seat of the High Court is not to be
decided on emotional and sentimental or parochial considerations. "The High Court is the best
suited machinery to decide whether it is necessary and feasible to have a bench outside the principal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 36
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
seat of High Court." When the Chief Justice of a High Court is a singular office, and when the
Advocate General is also a singular office, vivisection of the High Court into different benches at
different regions would undoubtedly affect the efficacy of the functioning of the High Court.
Distance factor may be a relevant consideration, but not the sole consideration nor even the decisive
consideration in determining the question of establishing other Benches of the High Court away
from the principal seat. Accordingly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court dismissed the writ petition.
Admittedly, the said writ petition came to be filed by Federation Of Bar Association disfavouring the
proposed establishment of separate bench on the basis of the report of the committee of five Judges
and the finding of the committee approved by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice and no final decision
was taken for establishment of separate benches of High Court of Karnataka away from principal
seat. As held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case, it is the Hon'ble Chief Justice who is the
final authority to take a view.
73. Admittedly in the present case, on the demand made by the Bar Association, Dharwad, the Chief
Justice constituted a Committee consisting of seven Judges to consider the question as to whether it
is necessary to have bench of the High Court in northern Karnataka. Majority of the committee
members, i.e., five judges submitted the report dated 06.06.2003 opining that the Hon'ble Chief
Justice may recommend for establishment of permanent benches of High Court at Dharwad and
Kalaburagi. Thereafter, based on majority recommendation, the Hon'ble Chief Minister requested to
constitute the Bench and Hon'ble the Chief Justice after considering the entire material on record
and subject to satisfaction, agreed to constitute benches of the High Court of Karnataka away from
principal seat. Thereby, the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Federation of
Bar Association filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is based on entirely different facts
and circumstances. Admittedly, the Federation Bar Association in Karnataka is not a party to the
present writ petition. Thereby, the said judgement is no way helpful to the case of the petitioner. At
paragraph 8 of the said judgment, it is held as under:
"8. As the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned is the important consultee in the
matter of establishment of a Bench of the High Court, he being the head of that High
Court has to form an opinion when it is required during such consultation process.
Normally, the Chief Justice will not be guided by any political or parochial
considerations. When he gives the opinion, it is the opinion of the High Court and not
merely his personal opinion. So naturally he will ascertain the views of his colleague
Judges before he conveys his opinion. xxx"
With due respect, the said judgment does not bar the Chief Justice either to set up a subsequent
Committee for the same purpose or precludes the exercise of powers under Section 51(2) and 51(3)
of the States Reorganization Act, 1956. In view of the aforesaid ratio laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, it is apparent that setting up of a Committee headed by Justice G.C.Bharuka, and
accepting its report is in accordance with law and is sustainable.
74. The States Reorganization Act, 1956, is a permanent piece of legislation on the statute book and
hence it cannot fall into desuetude or become inoperative through obsolescence or by lapse of time.
A careful perusal of the provisions of the said act do not suggest that the enactment would lapse

Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
after achieving its object. In other words, the States Reorganization Act, 1956, would continue to
remain in force until specifically repealed by parliament or struck down by competent Court. In one
breath, petitioner contended that the provisions of States Reorganization Act, 1956 are not
applicable, since the object of the Act was Reorganization of States and all matters incidental
thereto. Hence resorting to sub sections (2) and (3) of Section 51 of the Act for the sole purpose of
creating new benches of High Court having no nexus to the object of the Act is misplaced cannot be
accepted. It is also contended by the petitioner that impugned notifications issued by the
Constitutional authorities will not have powers. According to petitioner Section 17 of the Mysore
High Court Act, 1884 has not been repealed by Karnataka High Court Act, 1961 and in the light of
Section 69 of States Reorganization Act, 1956, Section 17 of Mysore High Court Act, 1884 is still
enforceable, cannot be accepted. The constitution and organization of the High Courts and
extension of jurisdiction to and of the High Court from any Union Territory are the subject matter of
framing laws by the parliament as the same would fall within the ambit of entry 78 and 79 in list I of
Seventh Schedule appended to the Constitution of India. Therefore, the provisions of States
Reorganization Act, 1956 legislated by the parliament in exercise of powers therein under Section
51(2) and (3) of the Act cannot be found fault with.
75. "Access to Justice is a fundamental right of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India
and therefore, it is incumbent upon the State to include judiciary to ensure that justice delivery
system reaches out to every nook and corner of its territory." "It means, the State should provide
enhanced capability and adequate infrastructure for functioning of the Court to enable ease of access
to justice to every citizen." Our view is fortified by the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of All India Judges Association vs. Union of India reported in (2018) 17 SCC 555, wherein at
paragraphs 6, 7, 9, 10, it is held as under:
6. It has to be firmly borne in mind and accepted as a reality that raising the
infrastructure standards in the court complexes is the need of the hour as it is the
basic requirement for the courts in the twenty-
first century. We are absolutely clear that when people are aware of their rights, their desire to get
the rights realised is enhanced and they would like to knock at the doors of the Court to shape their
aspiration into reality. It is a welcome phenomenon and conceptually, Rule of Law nourishes and
garners the said idea. The idea of speedy and quality justice dispensation system cannot be treated
with status quoist approach, for the definition of infrastructure and the understanding of the same
in all associated contexts changes with the passage of time and introduction of modern technology
in many a sphere of life. The consumers of justice expect prompt and effective delivery of justice in
an atmosphere that is acceptable. Therefore, infrastructure enhancement will go a long way in
strengthening functioning of the court and would improve the productivity in the justice delivery
system.
7. Be it noted, a court complex is not just a building. It is the building of justice which breathes and
infuses life into the exalted and sublime ideals of justice. The widening gap between the ideal and
the real and between the vision and the pragmatic realisation of justice has to be bridged by proper
access to justice for all.

9. In view of the above, we deem it extremely necessary to declare that it is essential to provide basic
infrastructural facilities, amenities, utilities and access oriented features in all court complexes
around the country as it is axiomatic that infrastructure forms the core for efficient and efficacious
dispensation of speedy and qualitative justice.
10. The court development plan should comprise of three components -- a short-term plan (or
annual plan); a medium-term plan (or a five-year plan); and a long-term plan (ten-year plan). The
annual plans so prepared shall be incorporated into the five-year plan which, in turn, rolls into the
ten-year plan. While focussing on judicial infrastructure, due regard has to be given to adequate and
model court building, furniture, fixture, Judges, chamber, record/file storage, adequate sitting and
recreation arrangement for staff and officers, sitting/waiting room for litigants and Bar members,
latest gadgets and technology. In other words, the core factors in the design of a court complex must
reckon -- (a) optimum working conditions facilitating increased efficiency of judicial officers and the
administrative staff; (b) easy access to justice to all and particularly to the underprivileged, persons
with disability, women and senior citizens; (c) safety and security of Judges, administrative staff,
litigants, witnesses and undertrial prisoners. The court complex must consist of:
I. COURT BUILDING
(i) Court rooms
(ii) Judges' chambers
(iii) Judges' residential complex
(iv) Litigants' waiting area
(v) Administrative offices
(vi) Conference Hall/Meeting Room
(vii) Video conferencing rooms
(viii) Mediation centre/Legal Services Authority
(ix) Common rooms for male/female staff
(x) Staff canteen
(xi) De-stress rooms for male/female staff
(xii) Office space for Government Pleader/Public Prosecutor/Advocate
General/Standing Counsel for Union of India with separate cubicles for conducting
conferences and including space for accommodating their Secretarial staff and files

76. In identical circumstances, the Division Bench of the Madras High Court while
considering the constitution of Madurai and other Benches, in the case of K.Sridhar
Kumar vs. The Union of India reported in 2002-1-LW 742, the learned single Judge
at paragraphs 24, 25 and 26, held as under:
"24. It may also be useful to refer a decision of the Apex Court in S.I. Corporation (P.)
Ltd. v. Secretary, Board of Revenue, AIR 1964 SC 207 which lays down that the
expression "subject to the provisions of the Constitution" occurring in Article 225 of
the Constitution means that it should not be inconsistent with the Constitutional
Provisions other than the question relating to Legislative competence. In other
words, the Supreme Court has held that all existing laws will continue in force
without reference to the question of Legislative competence, subject to the same
being not in conflict with any specific provision of the Constitution. Clause 31 of the
Letters Patent has not been shown to be in conflict with any provision of the
Constitution. On the other hand, the said provision is consistent with the scheme of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 40
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
the Constitution, more particularly Article 231 (2) (c) which contemplates a common
High Court for two or more States to have a Bench in a place other than the principal
seat. That apart, several enactments passed by the Parliament transferable to Entry
78 List I to the VII Schedule contained provision providing for the establishment of
Benches outside the place where the principal seat is situated. Accordingly, there is
no merit in any one of the contentions raised by Mr. K. Vijayan, learned senior
counsel. Though he has referred to a decision of the Supreme Court in Federation of
Bar Association in Karnataka v. Union of India, 2000 (5) Supreme 267 : 2000 (6)
S.C.C. 715, even in the penultimate paragraph Their Lordships have observed that
there is no use in harping on the situations in certain other larger States where High
Courts have benches established away from the principal seat due to variety of
reasons. In such a circumstance, I am of the view that the said decision is not helpful
to the petitioner's case.
25. In the light of what is stated above, there are no merits in the above writ petitions
and they are liable to be dismissed. Before parting with these cases, as stated earlier,
both the writ petitions have been filed by two practising advocates of the High Court,
Madras. The petitioner in the former case got enrolled in the year 1986 and has been
practising in this Court on all branches of law. Though the petitioner in the latter case
did not set out the details regarding his enrolment, however, it is stated that he is a
practising lawyer in the Madras High Court. There is no explanation by either of
them for filing these writ petitions at this juncture. It is pertinent to note that only
considering the plight of the litigant public, escalation in transport and other
incidental charges, the Committee has recommended the constitution of a Bench at
Madurai. According to the learned Additional Advocate General, the structural work
for the Madurai Bench has already been completed. It is not their case that they were
not aware of the report of the Jaswandh Singh Commission recommending
constitution of a Bench at Madurai for the benefit of the litigant public hailing from
Southern Districts, and of the ear-marking of substantial amount for the construction
of the Court- halls, administrative blocks, residential quarters for the Judges etc. even
a year back. The details about the orders passed by the Government and the stages of
construction work, as well as the inspection by the Hon'ble Chief Justice etc., have
been flashed by the Media at every stage. As stated earlier, the petitioners being
practising advocates in the High Court, they cannot plead ignorance of the above
developments. As rightly pointed out by the learned Additional Advocate General,
both the writ petitions have to be dismissed in limine on the ground of laches. Even
on merits, as stated above, the writ petitions are lacking even the basic ingredients
justifying their claim. In any event, this Court places on record its displeasure in the
act of the petitioners in filing these writ petitions unmindful of the precious time of
this Court which otherwise could have been utilised in other better and genuine
cases. This Court places on record the strenuous efforts made by the learned
Additional Advocate General in placing all the relevant materials to arrive at a just
decision.

Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
26. For all the above reasons, both the writ petitions are dismissed. No costs.
Consequently, W.P.M.P. Nos. 3331 and 4684 of 2002 are also dismissed."
77. Against the said order of the learned single Judge, an appeal came to be filed and the Division
Bench, by the order dated 11.03.2004 dismissed the appeal, i.e., in the case of R Suresh Kumar,
Advocate vs. Union of India and others reported in 2004-2 LW 277,at paragraphs 17, 18, 19, 20 and
21 held as under:
"17. This takes us to the other argument by the learned senior counsel that the High
Court had no jurisdiction to pass the resolution dated 31-8-1995 and the subsequent
resolution of the Committee dated 24-1-2000, which was ratified by the Full Court by
resolution dated 18-04-2000 for creating the permanent Bench at Madurai, in the
absence of an order by the Chief Justice under Clause 31 of the Letters Patent or a
legislative provision for creating a permanent Bench at Madurai. Learned counsel
says that the power to create a Bench of the Madras High Court would lie only with
the Central Government as the subject is covered by Entry 78 of the Union List under
Schedule VII to the Constitution of India. The said entry reads as follows:
"78. Constitution and Organisation including vacations of the High Courts except
provisions as to officers and servants of High Courts; persons entitled to practise
before the High Courts."
He, therefore, suggests that even for initiating the proposal to create the Bench at Madurai, a
legislative pronouncement or, as the case may be, an order under Clause 31 of the Letters Patent was
necessary and, in the absence of the same, the process initiated to create a Bench at Madurai is
otiose and without jurisdiction.
18. The argument is undoubtedly incorrect. In the first place, the learned counsel has not been able
to show us anything to suggest that the Chief Justice/High Court cannot initiate the proposal to
create a Bench. It is undoubtedly true that under Clause 31 of the Letters Patent, the Chief Justice
can start a Circuit Bench, of course, with the prior approval of the Governor. In fact, the resolution
dated 31-8-1995 was only to that effect. However, it seems that thereafter the proposal was mooted
to create a Permanent Bench, with which the High Court seems to have agreed. It is pointed out by
Shri V.T. Gopalan that it is for that, resolution dated 24- 1-2000 was passed by the Special
Committee of the High Court, which was constituted by the then Chief Justice and the resolution
was also ratified by the Full Court later on. According to the learned Additional Solicitor General,
the decision, therefore, was taken to create a Permanent bench at Madurai, which was to be
implemented later on through a legal procedure. He argues that the Bench can be created firstly by
passing a specific enactment in pursuance of the powers under Entry 78 of the Union List in
Schedule VII to the Constitution or secondly, through the Presidential notification made under Sec.
51(2) of the States Reorganisation Act. In addition to this, learned Additional Solicitor General says
that a Circuit Bench can be created under Clause 31 of the Letters Patent which has been found to be
on par with the provisions of Sec. 51(3) of the States Reorganisation Act as held in State of
Maharashtra v. Narayan (supra). He made a statement that a proper step will be taken to create a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 42
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Permanent Bench under a proper legislation which could be either passing the law for that purpose
under Entry 78 of the Union List or, as the case may be, by a Presidential notification under Sec.
51(2) of the State Reorganisation Act. After this specific statement made at the Bar by the learned
Additional Solicitor General, we have no doubts in mind that a proper course will be undertaken for
creation of the Bench at Madurai and unless such steps are taken, the Bench will not be operative
unless, of course a third option of creating a Circuit Bench via Clause 31 of the Letters Patent is
taken, for which a prior approval of the Governor would be necessary. However, we cannot
countenance an argument that the process to create a Permanent or a Circuit Bench at Madurai
could not have been initiated at all unless there was a law passed or unless a Presidential
Notification was issued under Sec. 51(3) of the States Reorganisation Act or unless the Chief Justice
had passed an order with the prior approval of the Governor under Clause 31 of the Letters Patent.
We have already explained and it has already come in the address of the learned Additional Solicitor
General that the Central Government had also taken a decision favouring a Permanent Bench at
Madurai. The High Court had also taken a decision firstly to create the Circuit Bench way back in the
year 1995. After all, when such decision is taken, it has to be considered by the concerned authorities
like the Central Government, the Chief Justice and the High Court or, as the case may be, the
Governor. The peculiarity of the situation here was that the High Court agreed to have a Circuit
Bench or, as the case may be, a Permanent Bench only provided there was a full infrastructure ready
and there was nothing wrong in it because it would have been futile to create/constitute a Bench
first and then to wait for years together before activating the same. It is impossible for a Bench to
work in the absence of the necessary infrastructure like proper buildings for the High Court,
residential accommodation for the Judges, residential accommodation for the staff and the other
facilities like Chambers for the lawyers, etc. The contention that all the exercise is without
jurisdiction is, therefore, obviously incorrect.
19. The decision by the Central Government to create a Bench at Madurai backed by the
administrative decision of the High Court would provide a firm pedestal for taking taking the initial
steps to create a Bench. We do not see anything wrong in the State Government creating the
necessary infrastructure in pursuance of the agreement by the High Court and the decision taken by
the Central Government. The learned Additional Solicitor General argues, rightly in our opinion,
when he says that a decision was already taken by the Central Government and it should be left to
the Central Government to implement the same by taking proper steps.
20. Shri Vijayan, however, took great exception to the factual statement made by Shri V.T. Gopalan
in which the learned Additional Solicitor General also referred to Sec. 51(2) of the State
Reorganisation Act and wanted to contend that such a decision could not be possible in view of the
fact that the State of Tamil Nadu was not a 'new State' and that the power under Sec. 51(2) of the
States Reorganisation Act could be implemented only in respect of the 'New State'. We have already
explained that the learned single Judge has already held that the words 'State of Tamil Nadu' (the
then Madras State) referred to in Sec. 4 under Part II of the States Reorganisation Act can be
deemed to be a 'new State' and the inference of the learned single Judge and the consequential
dismissal of the writ petition, W.P. No. 2402 of 2002, where this question was raised has remained
unchallenged. We would, therefore, leave the question at that. Further, in our opinion, it would now
be futile to go into that question as the procedural aspect of creation of the Bench of the Madras
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 43
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
High Court at Madurai is inextricably connected with the basic question as to whether there should
be a Bench at all at Madurai or not. We have already pointed out that this basic issue and the
decision therefor could have been challenged only at the proper time. The petitioner chose to keep
silent at the material time and has chosen to woke up now after crores of rupees have been spent
and is trying to raise the procedural objections only to thwart the basic objective of creation of the
Bench at Madurai, which is not permissible. We have no doubts in our minds that the Central
Government would take proper steps in law procedurally by taking recourse to proper legal
procedure. In any event, by a mere procedural challenge, petitioner could not be permitted to
achieve a wider objective of thwarting the Bench at Madurai at all more particularly at this juncture
in the year 2004 when the first decision was taken in the year 1995 and was ratified in the year 2000
after a firm decision was taken in that behalf by the Central Government and further when crores of
rupees are spent in creating infrastructure.
21. It must be borne in mind that the High Court, in exercise of its' powers, cannot ask the
Legislature to legislate or to legislate in a particular manner. So also, the High Court shall not ask
the Legislature not to legislate or to legislate in a particular manner. How a particular objective is to
be carried out or realised has to be left to the wisdom of the Legislature altogether and we have no
doubts that the objective of bringing about the Bench of the Madras High Court at Madurai shall so
obtained. We, therefore, agree with the learned single Judge. The judgment of the learned single
Judge, dismissing the writ petition, W.P. No. 3333 of 2002 and dismiss this appeal. No other point
were argued excepting those referred to above."
78. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Section 51(3) of the States
Reorganization Act, 1956, in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Narayan Shamrao Puranik and
others reported in (1982) 3 SCC 519 regarding establishment of a permanent Bench at Aurangabad,
at paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 25, 26 and 27, held as under:
"11. Three questions arise for consideration in this appeal: (1) Whether the power of
the President under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act or that of the Chief
Justice of the High Court under sub- section (3) of SSction 51 of the Act, can no
longer be exercised due to lapse of time. (2) Whether the exercise of power by the
Chief Justice under sub- section (3) of Section 51 of the Act appointing Aurangabad
to be a place at which the Judges and Division Courts of the High Court shall also sit
is co- related to the reorganisation of the States, or has no nexus with the object and
purposes sought to be achieved by the Act and is only a part of the demand for
decentralisation of the administration of justice in general. (3) Whether the power of
the Chief Justice under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act does not include a
power to establish a Bench or Benches at such place or places carving out territorial
jurisdiction for such Benches and authorising the filing or institution of proceedings
at such places.
12. It is difficult to agree with the High Court that the High Court of Bombay is not
the High Court of a new State within the meaning of sub-section (1) of Section 49 of
the Act, merely because the bilingual State of Bombay was bifurcated into two
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 44
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
separate States of Maharashtra and Gujarat under Section 3 of the Bombay
Reorganisation Act, 1960. Nor do we see any valid basis for the view taken by the
High Court that the power of the President to establish a permanent Bench or
Benches of the High Court under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act or that of the
Chief Justice to appoint, with the approval of the Governor, a place or places where
the Judges and Division Courts may also sit under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the
Act, can no longer be exercised, in relation to the High Court of Bombay. It was
rightly not disputed before us that the High Court of Bombay was the High Court for
the new State of Bombay within the meaning of sub-section (1) of Section 49 of the
Act and therefore the provisions of Section 51 of the Act are still applicable. That
must be so because the High Court of Bombay owes its principal seat at Bombay to
the Presidential Order issued under sub-section (1) of Section 51 of the Act. The
expression 'new State' occurring in sub-section (1) of Section 49 of the Act is defined
in Section 2(i) to mean "a State formed under the provisions of Part II". The State of
Bombay was a new State formed under Section 8 of the Act, which occurs in Part II.
The Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960 (11 of 1960) which reconstituted the erstwhile
State of Bombay into the State of Maharashtra and the State of Gujarat provides,
inter alia, by sub-section (1) of Section 28 that, as from the appointed day, i.e. May 1,
1960, there shall be a separate High Court for the State of Gujarat and that the High
Court of Bombay shall become the High Court for the State of Maharashtra.
Sub-section (2) of Section 28 of that Act provides that the principal seat of the
Gujarat High Court shall be at such place as the President may, by notified order,
appoint. It is rather significant that the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960 contains
no similar provision with regard to the principal seat of the High Court of Bombay.
That being so, the continued existence of the principal seat of the Bombay High Court at Bombay is
still governed by sub-section (1) of Section 51 of the Act. This conclusion of ours is reinforced by the
opening words of Section 41 of that Act which provides for the setting up of a permanent Bench of
the Bombay High Court at Nagpur, and it reads:
"41. Permanent Bench of Bombay High Court at Nagpur.--Without prejudice to the
provisions of Section 51 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, such Judges of the
High Court at Bombay, being not less than three in number, as the Chief Justice may
from time to time nominate, shall sit at Nagpur in order to exercise the jurisdiction
and power for the time being vested in that High Court in respect of cases arising in
the districts of Buldana, Akola, Amravati, Yeotmal, Wardha, Nagpur, Bhandara,
Chanda and Rajpura:
Provided that the Chief Justice may, in his discretion, order that any case arising in
any such district shall be heard at Bombay."
13. The legislative intent is clear and explicit by the use of the words "without prejudice to the
provisions of Section 51 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956". The legislature presupposed the
continued existence of Section 51 of the Act in relation to the High Court of Bombay. That shows
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 45
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
that while enacting Section 41 of the Act, Parliament retained the power of the President of India
both under sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act and that of the Chief Justice
under sub- section (3) thereof. If there is continued existence of sub-section (1) of Section 51 of the
Act in relation to the principal seat of the High Court for a new State, a fortiori, there is, to an equal
degree, the continued existence of the provisions contained in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 51
of the Act. This is also clear from the provisions of Section 69 of the Act which in terms provides that
Part V which contains Section 51 of the Act shall have effect subject to any provision that may be
made, on or after the appointed day with respect to the High Court of a new State, by the legislature
or any other authority having power to make such provision.
14. Nor can we subscribe to the proposition that the power of the President under sub-section (2) of
Section 51 of the Act, or that of the Chief Justice of the High Court of a new State under sub-section
(3) of that Section, can no longer be exercised due to lapse of time. The High Court is of the view
that the provisions of the Act and in particular of Section 51 were meant to be exercised either
immediately or within a reasonable time of the reorganisation of the States and therefore the
exercise of the power by the Chief Justice under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act appointing
Aurangabad as a place where the Judges and Division Courts of the High Court may also sit, after a
lapse of 26 years, is constitutionally impermissible. Any other view, according to the High Court, is
bound to give rise to a very anomalous situation as in nine out of 16 States not affected by the Act,
the creation of a permanent Bench of a High Court must be by an Act of Parliament while in seven
new States formed under the Act, the same could be achieved by a Presidential Notification under
sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act. Furthermore, in States where the High Courts were
established by Letters Patent, the powers conferred on the Chief Justices of the High Courts qua
sittings of Single Judges and Division Courts can be exercised only with legislative sanction whereas
under sub-section (3) of Section 51 it can be done by the Chief Justices of the High Court for a new
State, with the approval of the Governor of that State. Such a construction of the provisions of
Section 51 of the Act would, according to the High Court, result in creating discrimination between
the States. The reasoning of the High Court that the Act being of a transitory nature, the exercise of
the power of the President under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act, or of the Chief Justice
under sub-section (3) thereof, after a lapse of 26 years, would be a complete nullity, does not
impress us at all. The provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 51 of the Act are supplemental
or incidental to the provisions made by Parliament under Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution.
Article 3 of the Constitution enables Parliament to make a law for the formation of a new State. The
Act is a law under Article 3 for the reorganisation of the States. Article 4 of the Constitution provides
that the law referred to in Article 3 may contain "such supplemental, incidental and consequential
provisions as Parliament may deem necessary". Under the scheme of the Act, these powers continue
to exist by reason of Part V of the Act unless Parliament by law otherwise directs. The power of the
President under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act, and that of the Chief Justice of the High
Court under sub-section (3) thereof are intended and meant to be exercised from time to time as
occasion arises, as there is no intention to the contrary manifested in the Act within the meaning of
Section 14 of the General clauses Act. The High Court has assumed that the provisions of
sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 51 of the Act have 'ebbed out' by lapse of time. This assumption is
plainly contrary to the meaning and effect of Section 69 of the Act which in terms provides that Part
V which contains Section 51 of the Act, shall have effect subject to any provision that may be made
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 46
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
on or after the appointed day with respect to the High Court of any State, by the legislature or any
other authority having power to make such provision.
15. It is a matter of common knowledge that Parliament considered it necessary to reorganise the
existing States in India and to provide for it and other matters connected therewith and with that
end in view, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 was enacted. As a result of reorganisation,
boundaries of various States changed. Some of the States merged into other States in its entirety,
while some States got split and certain parts thereof merged into one State and other parts into
another. These provisions were bound to give rise, and did give rise, to various complex problems.
These problems are bound to arise from time to time. The Act is a permanent piece of legislation on
the statute-book. Section 14 of the General clauses Act, 1897 provides that, where, by any Central
Act or Regulation, any power is conferred, then unless a different intention appears, that power may
be exercised from time to time as occasion arises. The Section embodies a uniform rule of
construction. That the power may be exercised from time to time when occasion arises unless a
contrary intention appears is therefore well settled. A statute can be abrogated only by express or
implied repeal. It cannot fall into desuetude or become inoperative through obsolescence or by lapse
of time. In R v. London County Council [ LR (1931) 2 KB 215 (CA)], Scrutton, L.J. put the matter
thus:
"The doctrine that, because a certain number of people do not like an Act and
because a good many people disobey it, the Act is therefore 'obsolescent' and no one
need pay any attention to it, is a very dangerous proposition to hold in any
constitutional country. So long as an Act is on the statute-book, the way to get rid of it
is to repeal or alter it in Parliament, not for subordinate bodies, who are bound to
obey the law, to take upon themselves to disobey an Act of Parliament."
As to the theory of desuetude, Allen in his Law in the Making, 5th Edn., p. 454 observes:
"Age cannot wither an Act of Parliament, and at no time, so far as I am aware, has it
ever been admitted in our jurisprudence that a statute might become inoperative
through obsolescence."
The learned author mentions that there was at one time a theory which, in the name of 'non-
observance', came very near to the doctrine of desuetude, that if a statute had been in existence for
any considerable period without ever being put into operation, it may be of little or no effect. The
rule concerning desuetude has always met with such general disfavour that it seems hardly
profitable to discuss it further. It cannot be said that sub-section (2) or (3) of Section 51 of the Act
can be regarded as obsolescent. The opening words of Section 41 of the Bombay Reorganisation Act,
1960 manifest a clear legislative intention to preserve the continued existence of the provisions
contained in Section 51 of the Act. It was as recent as December 8, 1976 that the President issued a
notification under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act for the establishment of a permanent
Bench of the Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur. The High Court is therefore not right in observing that
the provisions of Section 51 of the Act were not intended to be operative indefinitely and they were

Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
meant to be exercised either immediately or within a reasonable time, or that the powers of the
President or the Chief Justice thereunder can no longer be exercised in relation to the High Court of
Bombay.
16. The conclusion reached by the High Court that the impugned notification issued by the Chief
Justice under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act was not directly connected with the
reorganisation of the States, or had no nexus with the objects and purposes sought to be achieved by
the Act but was only as part of the demand for decentralisation of the administration of justice in
general, can only be justified as a necessary corollary flowing from its views expressed on other
aspects of the matter. The creation of 14 new States by Part II of the Act based on a linguistic basis
virtually led to the redrawing of the political map of India as a whole. Even after the reorganisation
of the States in 1956, the political map of India continued to change owing to the growing pressure
of political considerations and circumstances, The formation of the linguistic State of Bombay
constituted under Section 8 of the Act became the source of struggle between the Gujarati and
Marathi speaking people as a result of which the State of Bombay was further bifurcated in 1960.
These political changes necessarily affected the constitution and structure of the High Court. Under
the Constitution, Parliament alone has the legislative competence to make a law relating to the
subject under Entry 78 of List I of the Seventh Schedule which reads:
"78. Constitution and organisation (including vacations) of the High Courts except
provisions as to officers and servants of High Courts; persons entitled to practise
before the High Courts."
17. Under the scheme of the Act, it would appear that having constituted a High Court for the new
State of Bombay under sub-section (1) of Section 49 of the Act and conferred jurisdiction on it under
Section 52 in relation to the territories of the new State, Parliament left it to the various high
constitutional functionaries designated in the three sub-sections of Section 51 of the Act to
determine the place where the principal seat of the High Court should be located and places where
permanent Bench or Benches of the High Court may be established, or where the Judges and
Division Courts of the High Court may also sit. On the reorganisation of the States as from the
appointed day, i.e. November 1, 1956, the territories of the new State of Bombay formed under
Section 8 of the Act and with it the jurisdiction of the High Court was considerably extended. The
merger of the new territories of the Vidarbha region of the former State of Madhya Pradesh and the
Marathwada region of the erstwhile State of Hyderabad together with the Saurashtra region of the
newly constituted State of Gujarat was an additional source of strength of the High Court. It became
necessary for the more convenient transaction of judicial business to establish, as from the
appointed day, two Benches of the High Court at Nagpur and Rajkot to deal with matters arising
from Vidarbha and Saurashtra regions respectively. The formation of the separate State of Gujarat
in 1960 under Section 3 of the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960 resulted in severance of ties not
only with the Saurashtra region but also with the Gujarat districts over which the High Court had
exercised jurisdiction for about a century. The High Court of Bombay therefore underwent a major
transformation in 1956 when the bilingual State of Bombay was formed under Section 8 of the Act
and then again in 1960 when with the formation of a separate State of Gujarat under Section 3 of the
Bombay Reorganisation Act, the residuary State of Bombay was to be known as the State of

Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Maharashtra. Nagpur which ceased to be the seat of the High Court of the new State of Madhya
Pradesh, was given a Bench by an order issued by the then Chief Justice of the High Court under
sub-
section (3) of Section 51 of the Act. The arrangement was made permanent by Section 41 of that Act
which provided for the establishment of a permanent Bench at Nagpur to deal with cases arising out
of the Vidarbha region. It was a solemn assurance given to the people of the Marathwada region of
the erstwhile State of Hyderabad by clause (7) of the Nagpur Pact that the provision with regard to
the establishment of a permanent Bench at Nagpur shall also apply mutatis mutandis to the
Marathwada region.
21. It is necessary to emphasise that besides administering justice, the High Court has the
administrative control over the subordinate judiciary in a State. The High Court must necessarily
carry on its administrative functions from the principal seat i.e. the place where the High Court
transacts every kind of business in all its capacities. The High Court as such is located there, but it
may have more than one seat for transaction of judicial business. The constitution and structure of
the High Court depends on the statute creating it. The decision in Nasiruddin v. State Transport
Appellate Tribunal [(1975) 2 SCC 671 : AIR 1976 SC 331 :
(1976) 1 SCR 505] is not directly in point as it turned on the construction of the
provisions of the U.P. High Courts (Amalgamation) Order, 1948. It is however an
authority for the proposition that after the amalgamation of the High Court of
Allahabad and the Chief Court of Oudh, the two High Courts ceased to exist and
became Benches of the newly constituted High Court by the name of the High Court
of Judicature at Allahabad. Further, the Court held that a case 'instituted' at a
particular Bench had to be 'heard' at that Bench. It recognised that there can be two
seats of the High Court without a principal seat.
25. It is clear upon the terms of Section 51 of the Act that undoubtedly the President has the power
under sub-section (1) to appoint the principal seat of the High Court for a new State. Likewise, the
power of the President under sub-section (2) thereof, "after consultation with the Governor of a new
State and the Chief Justice of the High Court for that State, pertains to the establishment of a
permanent Bench or Benches of that High Court of a new State at one or more places within the
State other than the place where the principal seat of the High Court is located and for any matters
connected therewith" clearly confer power on the President to define the territorial jurisdiction of
the permanent Bench in relation to the principal seat as also for the conferment of exclusive
jurisdiction to such permanent Bench to hear cases arising in districts falling within its jurisdiction.
The creation of a permanent Bench under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act must therefore
bring about a territorial bifurcation of the High Court. Under sub- section (1) and sub-section (2) of
Section 51 of the Act the President has to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers as ordained by
Article 74(1) of the Constitution. In both the matters the decision lies with the Central Government.
In contrast, the power of the Chief Justice to appoint under sub- section (3) of Section 51 of the Act
the sittings of the Judges and Division Courts of the High Court for a new State at places other than
the place of the principal seat or the permanent Bench is in the unquestioned domain of the Chief
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 49
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Justice, the only condition being that he must act with the approval of the Governor. It is basically
an internal matter pertaining to the High Court. He has full-power, authority and jurisdiction in the
matter of allocation of business of the High Court which flows not only from the provision contained
in sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act but inheres in him in the very nature of things. The
opinion of the Chief Justice to appoint the seat of the High Court for a new State at a place other
than the principal seat under sub- section (3) of Section 51 of the Act must therefore normally
prevail because it is for the more convenient transaction of judicial business. The non obstante
clause contained in sub-section (3) of Section 51 gives an overriding effect to the power of the Chief
Justice. There is no territorial bifurcation of the High Court merely because the Chief Justice directs
under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act that the Judges and Division Courts shall also sit at
such other places as he may, with the approval of the Governor, appoint. It must accordingly be held
that there was no territorial bifurcation of the Bombay High Court merely because the Chief Justice
by the impugned notification issued under sub- section (3) of Section 51 of the Act directed that the
Judges and Division Courts shall also sit at Aurangabad. The Judges and Division Courts at
Aurangabad are part of the same High Court as those at the principal seat at Bombay and they
exercise jurisdiction as Judges of the High Court of Bombay at Aurangabad. The Chief Justice acted
within the scope of his powers. We see no substance in the charge that the impugned notification
issued by the Chief Justice under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act was a colourable exercise of
power.
26. As to the scope and effect of sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act, the question came up for
consideration before Chagla, C.J. and Badkas, J. in Seth Manji Dana v.C.I.T., Bombay [ Civil Appeal
No 995 of 1957, decided on July 22, 1958 (Bom)] . This was an application by which the validity of
Rule 254 of the Appellate Side Rules was challenged insofar as it provided that all income tax
references presented at Nagpur should be heard at the principal seat of the High Court at Bombay,
and the contention was that the result of this rule was that it excluded income tax references from
the jurisdiction of the High Court functioning at Nagpur. In repelling the contention, Chagla, C.J.
observed:
"Legally, the position is quite clear.
Under Section 51(3) of the State Reorganisation Act, the Judges sitting at Nagpur
constitute a part of the High Court of Bombay. They are as much a part of the High
Court of Bombay, and if we might say so distinguished part of the High Court of
Bombay, as if they were sitting under the same roof under which Judges function in
Bombay. All that happens is that the Chief Justice, under the powers given to him
under the Letters Patent distributes the work to various Judges and various
Divisional Benches, and acting under that power he distributes certain work to the
Judges sitting at Nagpur."
He then continued:
"All that Rule 254 does is to permit as a matter of convenience certain matters to be
presented at Nagpur to the Deputy Registrar. If Rule 254 had not been enacted, all
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 50
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
matters would have to be presented at Bombay and then the Chief Justice would have
distributed those matters to different Judges, whether sitting in Bombay or at
Nagpur. It is out of regard and consideration for the people of Vidarbha and for their
convenience that this rule is enacted, so that litigants should not be put to the
inconvenience of going to Bombay to present certain matters. Therefore, this
particular rule has nothing whatever to do either with Section 51(3) of the States
Reorganisation Act or with the Constitution."
With regard to Rule 254, he went on to say:
"Now, having disposed of the legal aspect of the matter, we turn to the practical
aspect, and let us consider whether this rule inconveniences the people at Nagpur. If
it does, it would certainly call for an amendment of that rule. Now, there is particular
reason why all Income Tax References should be heard in Bombay and that reason is
this. The High Court of Bombay for many years, rightly or wrongly, has followed a
particular policy with regard to Income Tax References and that policy is that the
same Bench should hear Income Tax References, so that there should be a continuity
with regard to the decisions given on these References. I know that other High Courts
have referred to this policy with praise because they have realised that the result of
this policy has been that Income Tax Law has been laid down in a manner which has
received commendation from various sources. The other reason is and we hope we
are not mistaken in saying so that the number of Income Tax References from
Nagpur are very few. If the number was large, undoubtedly a very strong case would
be made out for these cases to be heard at Nagpur."
He then concluded:
"After all, Courts exist for the convenience of the litigants and not in order to maintain any
particular system of law or any particular system of administration. Whenever a Court finds that a
particular rule does not serve the convenience of litigants, the Court should be always prepared to
change the rule."
The ratio to be deduced from the decision of Chagla, C.J. is that the Judges and Division Courts
sitting at Nagpur were functioning as if they were the Judges and Division Courts of the High Court
at Bombay.
27. In Manickam Pillai case [AIR 1958 Ker 188 :
ILR 1958 Ker 629 : 1958 Ker LJ 280] the Kerala High Court held that the curtailment
of the territorial jurisdiction of the main seat of the High Court of a new State is a
necessary concomitant to the establishment of a permanent Bench under sub- section
(2) of Section 51 of the Act while contrasting sub-section (3) with sub-section (2).
There, a question arose whether the temporary Bench of the High Court of Kerala
with its principal seat at Ernakulam created by the Chief Justice at Trivandrum by an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 51
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
order issued under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act was not the High Court of
Kerala, and the Judges and Division Courts sitting at Trivandrum were precisely in
the same position as Judges and Division Courts sitting in the several court-rooms of
the High Court at its principal seat in Ernakulam. In other words, the contention was
that the Judges and Division Courts sitting at Trivandrum could only hear and
dispose of such cases as were directed to be posted before them by the Chief Justice
but no new case could be instituted there.
Raman Nayar, J. (as he then was) speaking for the Court held that the Trivandrum
Bench was not the High Court of Kerala and the Judges and Division Courts sitting at
Trivandrum could hear and dispose of only such cases as may be assigned to them.
With respect, we are of the opinion that the view expressed by Chagla, C.J. in Manji
Dana case [ Civil Appeal No 995 of 1957, decided on July 22, 1958 (Bom)] is to be
preferred. Chagla, C.J. rightly observes that the Judges and Division Courts at a
temporary Bench established under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act function
as Judges and Division Courts of the High Court at the principal seat, and while so
sitting at such a temporary Bench they may exercise the jurisdiction and power of the
High Court itself in relation to all the matters entrusted to them."
79. It is also relevant to state at this stage that, the Government of India-Law Commission of India,
in its Report No.230 on Reforms in the Judiciary-Some Suggestions submitted during August 2009
headed by Hon'ble Dr. Justice A.R.Lakshmanan, Chairman, Dr.Brahm A. Agrawal, Member
Secretary and other Full time and Part time members, at paragraphs 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.24,
1.25, 1.26, 1.40, 1.42, 1.71, 1.72, 1.75 has stated as under:
Increase in number of Judges and creation of new Benches:
1.7 In almost every High Court, there is huge pendency of cases and the present
strength of the judges can hardly be said to be sufficient to cope with the alarming
situation. The institution of cases is much more than the disposal and it adds to
arrears of cases. The litigating citizens have a fundamental right of life i.e., a
tension-free life through speedy justice-delivery system. Now it has become essential
that the present strength of the judges should be increased manifold according to the
pendency, present and probable.
1.8 It is also necessary that the work of the High Courts is decentralized, that is, more
Benches are established in all States. If there is manifold increase in the strength of
the judges and the staff, all cannot be housed in one campus. Therefore, the
establishment of new Benches is necessary. It is also in the interest of the litigants.
The Benches should be so established that a litigant is not required to travel long.
1.9 It is true that the new establishments will require money, but it is necessary as a
development measure, particularly, when efforts are being made for all-round
development of the country. Therefore, the money should not be a problem. We have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 52
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
to watch and protect the interest of the litigants. We must always keep in mind that
the existence of judges and advocates is because of the litigants and they are there to
serve their cause only.
1.10 Sometimes, some advocates object to creating of new Benches and selection of
new sites for construction of new buildings. But they raise objections in their
personal, limited interest.
Creation of new Benches is certainly beneficial for the litigants and the lawyers and a beginning has
to be made somewhere.
1.11 There is huge pendency of cases in the apex court also. Now the time has come when not only
the strength of the Hon'ble Judges in the Supreme Court should be increased and recommendations
are made to fill up the vacancies soon but new Benches be also established in southern and eastern
regions. Justice at easy reach:
1.24 The Indian Judicial system is constantly exposed to new challenbges, new
dimensions and new signals and has to survive in a world in which perhaps the only
real certainty is that the circumstances of tomorrow will not be the same as those of
today. The need of the hour is to erase misconception about the Judiciary by making
it more accessible by utilizing the resources available to improve the service to the
public, by reducing delays and making courts more efficient and less daunting.
1.25 Regarding decongestion, greater responsibility lies on the shoulders of the
Governments of States or the Central Government. They are biggest litigants in the
courts. They should approach the courts or contest cases only if necessary and not
just to pass on the buck or contest for the sake of contesting. The time consumed in
most of the cases by Courts of Sessions is somewhat under control and most of the
cases are decided in a reasonable time-
schedule. Main problem is about huge pendency in Magisterial Courts and the High Courts. It is
absolutely essential to have additional courts for specifically trying the complaint cases filed under
section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The present state of affairs defeats the very object
with which the provision was inserted in the Negotiable Instruments Act. Further, large numbers of
petty offence cases should be taken out of the normal court channel to be decided by the Special
Magistrates by appointing retired officers as Special Magistrates.
1.26 A speedy trial is not only required to give quick justice but it is also an integral part of the
fundamental right of life, personal liberty, as envisaged in article 21 of the Constitution. The Law
Commission is putting forth few suggestions to identify and remedy the causes of such delays in this
Report, of course, after identifying major hurdles and impediments which cause delay in the
disposal of criminal cases.

Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Access to justice 1.40 Traditional concept of "access to justice" as understood by common man is
access to courts of law. For a common man, a court is the place where justice is meted out to
him/her. But since the laws enacted were in English and the proceedings of all the courts were
highly complicated, confusing and expensive for the Indian public, the 'English' illiterate Indian
public found it difficult to get access to the justice-delivery system. As a solution, the need to have
lawyers was felt as an effective mediator between the legal world and the common man.
Therefore, we can see that a lawyer in addition to being champion at the various laws also has a
social responsibility of helping the ignorant and the underprivileged to attain justice.
1.42 Article 39A of the constitution provides for equal justice and free legal aid. The said article
obligates the State to promote justice on a basis of equal opportunity and, in particular, provide free
legal aid by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for
securing justices are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.
Reforms at the village level 1.71 The Gram Nyayalayas Bill has been enacted to set up more trial
courts at the intermediate Panchayat level. The welcome feature is that the procedures have been
kept simple and flexible so that cases can be heard and disposed of within six months. It is also
envisaged that these courts will be mobile, to achieve the goal of bringing justice to people's
doorsteps. Training and orientation of the judiciary, especially in frontier areas of knowledge, like
bio-genetics, IPR and cyber laws, need attention. 1.72 The Constitutional promise of securing to all
its citizens, justice, social, economic and political, as promised in the Preamble of the Constitution,
cannot be realized, unless the three organs of the State i.c. legislature, executive and judiciary, join
together to find ways and means for providing the Indian poor, equal access to its justice system 1.75
We need:
• Speedy justice • Reduction in costs of litigation • Systematic running of the courts •
Faith in the judicial system At the end, the Law Commission made seven
"recommendations", which reads as under:
2.1 Hon'ble Shri Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly, a Supreme Court Judge, in his article titled "Judicial
Reforms" published in Halsbury's Law monthly of November 2008 has suggested a few norms,
which the Judges and lawyers must agree to follow very rigorously, in order to liquidate the huge
backlog. The suggestions are quoted below:
(1) There must be full utilization of the Court working hours. The Judges must be
punctual and lawyers must not be asking for adjournments, unless it is absolutely
necessary. Grant of adjournment must be guided strictly by the provisions of Order 17
of the Civil Procedure Code.
(2) Many cases are filed on similar points and one judgment can decide a large
number of cases. Such cases should be clubbed with the help of technology and used
to dispose other such cases on a priority basis; this will substantially reduce the
arrears.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 54
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Similarly, old cases, many of which have become infructuous, can be separated and
listed for hearing and their disposal normally will not take much time. Same is true
for many interlocutory applications filed even after the main cases are disposed of.
Such cases can be traced with the help of technology and disposed of very quickly.
(3) Judges must deliver judgments within a reasonable time and in that matter, the
guidelines given by the apex Court in the case of Anil Rai vs. State of Bihar, (2001)7
SCC 318 must be scrupulously observed, both in civil and criminal cases.
(4) Considering the staggering arrears, vacations in the higher judiciary must be
curtailed by at least 10 to 15 days and the Court working hours should be extended by
at least half-an-hour.
(5) Lawyers must curtail prolix and repetitive arguments and should supplement it by
written notes. The length of the oral argument in any case should not exceed one
hour and thirty minutes, unless the case involves complicated questions of law or
interpretation of Constitution.
(6) Judgments must be clear and decisive and free from ambiguity, and should not
generate further litigation. We must remember Lord Macaulay's statement made
about 150 years ago.
"Our principle is simply this-
Uniformity when you can have it, Diversity when you must have it, IN all cases,
Certainty"
(7) Lawyers must not resort to strike under any circumstances and must follow the
decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Harish Uppal
(Ex-Capt.) vs. Union of India reported in (2003)2 SCC 45.
80. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of E.Ram Mohan Chowdry vs.
Registrar General, High Court of Karnataka, reported in AIR 2008 KAR 195, while
considering the provisions of Section 51(3) of the States Reorganization Act, 1956, at
paragraph 7 held as under:
"7. In the case of Narayan Shamrao Puranik (supra), the notification issued by the
Chief Justice of Bombay High Court, in exercise of the power under Section 51(3) of
the Act, with the prior approval of the Governor of Maharashtra, directing that the
Judges and Division Courts of the High Court of Bombay, will sit also at Aurangabad,
with effect from August 27, 1981 for the disposal of cases arising out of the
Marathwada region of the State of Maharashtra which was struck down by the
Bombay High Court by its judgment dated 14-12-1981, was the subject matter of
consideration. Interpreting Section 51(3) of the Act, it was held by the Hon'ble
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 55
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Supreme Court as follows:
"25. ...................... In contrast, the power of the Chief Justice to appoint under sub-
section (3) of Section 51 of the Act the sittings of the Judges and Division Courts of
the High Court for a new State at places other than the place of the principal seat or
the Permanent Bench is in the unquestioned domain of the Chief Justice, the only
condition being that he must act with the approval of the Governor. It is basically an
internal matter pertaining to the High Court, he has full power, authority and
jurisdiction in the matter of allocation of business of the High Court which flows not
only from the provision contained in sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act but
inheres in him in the very nature of things. The opinion of the Chief Justice to
appoint the seat of the High Court for a new State at a place other than the principal

There is no territorial bifurcation of the High Court merely because the Chief Justice

Bombay High Court merely because the Chief Justice by the impugned notification
issued under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act directed that the Judges and
Division Courts shall also sit at Aurangabad. The Judges and Division Courts at
Aurangabad are part of the same High Court as those at the principal seat at Bombay
and they exercise jurisdiction as Judges of the High Court of Bombay at Aurangabad.
The Chief Justice acted within the scope of his powers. We see no substance in the
charge that the impugned notification issued by the Chief Justice under sub- section
(3) of Section 51 of the Act was a colourable exercise of power."
(Emphasis supplied by us) Noticing the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Seth Manji
Dana v. C.I.T., Bombay in Civil Appeal No. 995 of 1957, decided on July 22, 1958 and the Full Bench
decision of the Kerala High Court in the case of Manickam Pillai Subbayya Pillai v. Assistant
Registrar, High Court, Kerala, Trivandrum, AIR 1958 Ker 188, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
as follows:
"27. In Manickam Pillai case, the Kerala High Court held that the curtailment of the
territorial jurisdiction of the main seat of the High Court of a new State is a necessary
concomitant to the establishment of a Permanent Bench under sub-section (2) of
Section 51 of the Act while contrasting sub-section (3) with sub-section (2). There, a
question arose whether the temporry Bench of the High Court of Kerala with its
principal seat at Ernakulam created by the Chief Justice at Trivandrum by an order
issued under sub-

section (3) of Section 51 of the Act was not the High Court of Kerala, and the Judges

With respect, we are of the opinion that the view expressed by Chagla. C.J. in Manji

Division Courts at a temporary Bench established under sub- section (3) of Section 51
of the Act function as Judges and Division Courts of the High Court at the principal
seat, and while so sitting at such temporary Bench they may exercise the jurisdiction
and power of the High Court itself in relation to all the matters entrusted to them."
(Emphasis supplied by us) Hon'ble Supreme Court has concluded as follows:
28. ............... order passed by the High Court is set aside and the writ petition filed by
respondent 1 is dismissed. In terms of the Order passed by us on May 4, 1982 ((1982)
2 SCC 440), we direct that in accordance with the notification issued by the Chief
Justice of High Court of Bombay dated August 27, 1981. The sittings of the Judges
and Division Courts may be held and continue to be held at Aurangabad with full and
normal powers to entertain and dispose of all matters arising out of the Marathwada
region, that is to say, the area comprising the districts of Aurangabad, Bhir, Jalna,
Nanded, Osmanbad and Parbani. All cases pertaining to that region and pending as
on May 4, 1982 at the main seat of the High Court at Bombay shall be dealt with and
disposed of as the Chief Justice of the High Court may direct, consistently with the
terms of the aforesaid notifiction dated August 27, 1981."
(Emphasis supplied by us) Hence, it is apparent that, by virtue of the power conferred on the Chief
Justice under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act, the Chief Justice can establish a Bench or
Benches, at such place or places where the Judges and Division Courts may sit and that he has the
power and authority to issue administrative directions for the filing of cases or institution of
proceedings at such place or places. By that process, there will be no territorial bifurcation of the
High Court of Karnataka, merely because of the arrangement made in terms of the impugned
notification. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Rajasthan v. Prakash Chand reported in
(1998) 1 SCC 1 : (AIR 1998 SC 1344) has held that, the Hon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court has
the prerogative to distribute the business of the High Court, both judicial and administrative, that
the Chief Justice is the Master of the Roster and that he alone has the right and power to decide how
the Benches of the High Court are to be constituted, which Judge has to sit along and which cases he
can and as required to hear and also as to which judges shall constitute a Division Bench and what
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 57
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
work those Benches shall do. In exercise of the said prerogative, right and power, if the Chief Justice
of the High Court of Karnataka has directed that cases arising from certain districts shall be heard
and decided by the Judges sitting at a particular Circuit Bench, it cannot held to be wrong or illegal.
There is nothing wrong in specifying that new cases arising from certain districts shall be filed at the
particular Circuit Bench, as those cases are to be, heard and decided by the Judges sitting at that
Circuit Bench. Such an arrangement, is for administrative convenience and the advantage of the
litigants. After all, the Courts are for the benefit of the litigant public and hence their convenience
should be the paramount consideration. The impugned notification is a positive and concrete step to
achieve the goal of providing easy and less expensive access to justice."
81. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Articles 32 and 226 of the
Constitution of India, with regard to Public Interest Litigation, in the case of The Janata Dal vs. H.S.
Chowdhary reported in AIR 1993 SC 892 at paragraphs 96, 107, and 108, held as under:
"96. While this Court has laid down a chain of notable decisions with all emphasis at
their command about the importance and significance of this newly-developed
doctrine of PIL, it has also hastened to sound a red alert and a note of severe warning
that courts should not allow its process to be abused by a mere busybody or a
meddlesome interloper or wayfarer or officious intervener without any interest or
concern except for personal gain or private profit or other oblique consideration.
107. It is thus clear that only a person acting bona fide and having sufficient interest
in the proceeding of PIL will alone have a locus standi and can approach the court to
wipe out the tears of the poor and needy, suffering from violation of their
fundamental rights, but not a person for personal gain or private profit or political
motive or any oblique consideration. Similarly, a vexatious petition under the colour
of PIL brought before the court for vindicating any personal grievance, deserves
rejection at the threshold.
108. It is depressing to note that on account of such trumpery proceedings initiated
before the courts, innumerable days are wasted which time otherwise could have
been spent for the disposal of cases of the genuine litigants. Though we are second to
none in fostering and developing the newly invented concept of PIL and extending
our long arm of sympathy to the poor, the ignorant, the oppressed and the needy
whose fundamental rights are infringed and violated and whose grievances go
unnoticed, unrepresented and unheared; yet we cannot avoid but express our opinion
that while genuine litigants with legitimate grievances relating to civil matters
involving properties worth hundreds of millions of rupees and criminal cases in
which persons sentenced to death facing gallows under untold agony and persons
sentenced to life imprisonment and kept in incarceration for long years, persons
suffering from the undue delay in service matters, Government or private persons
awaiting the disposal of tax cases wherein huge amounts of public revenue or
unauthorised collection of tax amounts are locked up, detenus expecting their release
from the detention orders etc. etc. -- are all standing in a long serpentine queue for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 58
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
years with the fond hope of getting into the courts and having their grievances
redressed, the busybodies, meddlesome interlopers, wayfarers or officious
interveners having absolutely no public interest except for personal gain or private
profit either for themselves or as proxy of others or for any other extraneous
motivation or for glare of publicity break the queue muffling their faces by wearing
the mask of public interest litigation, and get into the courts by filing vexatious and
frivolous petitions and thus criminally waste the valuable time of the courts and as a
result of which the queue standing outside the doors of the Court never moves which
piquant situation creates a frustration in the minds of the genuine litigants and
resultantly they lose faith in the administration of our judicial system."
82. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, while considering the Public Interest Litigation under Articles 32
and 226 of the Constitution of India, in the case of State of Uttaranchal vs. Balwant Singh Chauful
and others reported in (2010) 3 SCC 402, at paragraphs 181 issued directions as under:
"181. We have carefully considered the facts of the present case. We have also
examined the law declared by this Court and other courts in a number of judgments.
In order to preserve the purity and sanctity of the PIL, it has become imperative to
issue the following directions:
(1) The Courts must encourage genuine and bona fide PIL and effectively discourage
and curb the PIL filed for extraneous considerations.
(2) Instead of every individual Judge devising his own procedure for dealing with the
public interest litigation, it would be appropriate for each High Court to properly
formulate rules for encouraging the genuine PIL and discouraging the PIL filed with
oblique motives. Consequently, we request that the High Courts who have not yet
framed the rules, should frame the rules within three months. The Registrar General
of each High Court is directed to ensure that a copy of the rules prepared by the High
Court is sent to the Secretary General of this Court immediately thereafter.
(3) The Courts should prima facie verify the credentials of the petitioner before
entertaining a PIL.
(4) The Courts should be prima facie satisfied regarding the correctness of the
contents of the petition before entertaining a PIL.
(5) The Courts should be fully satisfied that substantial public interest is involved
before entertaining the petition.
(6) The Courts should ensure that the petition which involves larger public interest,
gravity and urgency must be given priority over other petitions. (7) The Courts before
entertaining the PIL should ensure that the PIL is aimed at redressal of genuine
public harm or public injury. The Court should also ensure that there is no personal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 59
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
gain, private motive or oblique motive behind filing the public interest litigation. (8)
The Courts should also ensure that the petitions filed by busybodies for extraneous
and ulterior motives must be discouraged by imposing exemplary costs or by
adopting similar novel methods to curb frivolous petitions and the petitions filed for
extraneous considerations."
83. Keeping the aforesaid principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the
provisions of States Reorganization Act, 1956, Mysore High Court Act, 1884 and
Karnataka High Court Act, 1961, and on careful perusal of the pleadings, it is
pertinent to note that, except the petitioner who is a practicing advocate, no other
advocates who are practicing within the jurisdiction of Dharwad and
Kalaburagi-consisting of 12 Districts (110 talukas) or none of the litigants have any
grievance about establishment of Circuit/Permanent Benches and none of the Bar
Associations at Taluka and District places including Dharwad and Kalaburagi have
any grievance. A careful perusal of the pleadings in the writ petition filed by the
petitioner is mainly on the basis of Jaswantsingh report and the dictum of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Federation of Bar Association in Karnataka. In
the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the report submitted by
the five Judges committee constituted by the then Hon'ble Chief Justice of Karnataka
and while exercising powers under Article 32 of the Constitution held that the High
Court is the best suited machinery to decide whether it is necessary and feasible to
have a bench outside the principal seat of that High Court. The said judgment is
based on the report submitted by the committee and there is no bar for the Chief
Justice to decide whether it is necessary and feasible to have a Bench outside the
principal seat of the High Court. The petitioner has not gone through the subsequent
report of the Justice G.C.Bharuka Committee and the representations made by the
President of Bar Association, Dharwad and the recommendation made by Hon'ble
Chief Minister of Karnataka, and approval by His Excellency the Governor of
Karnataka and cabinet, Central Government and Chief Justice of India. Distance of
the geographical areas, demography and other criteria and disparities in facilities,
non fulfilling of the long time cherished desire of the people of northern Karnataka
and greater anguish and frustration is not noticed by the petitioner and has filed the
present writ petition against the "will of public at large," especially against the
citizens of northern Karnataka, as the petitioner is the resident of Bengaluru. Without
knowing the topography, problems faced by the public at large the present writ
petition is filed for his personal glory and gain. Thereby, absolutely there is no public
interest made out in the present writ petition and in fact, "it is against the public
interest and against the people starving for justice, ignoring the dictums of this Court
and the Hon'ble Supreme Court." Only a person acting bonafide and having sufficient
interest in the proceeding of PIL will alone have locus standi and can approach the
court to wipe out the tears of poor and needy, suffering from violation of their
fundamental rights.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 60
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
Admittedly, though the present writ petition is filed as a Public Interest Litigation, after going
through the pleadings and material placed on record, "it appears that this is nothing but to bring the
tears in the eyes of poor and needy who are suffering from the violation of fundamental rights and
starving for justice." Thereby, the PIL brought before this Court is either for personal gain of the
petitioner or at the instance of somebody to ensure the struck down of the establishment of the
Circuit/permanent benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi, deserves rejection at the threshold.
84. It is well settled that when people are aware of their rights, their desire to get the rights realised
is enhanced and they would like to knock at the doors of the Court to shape their aspiration into
reality. Therefore, establishment of Dharwad and Gulbarga Benches is the need of an hour and is a
basic requirement during the year 2008. The idea of speedy and quality justice dispensation system
cannot be treated with status quoist approach. The consumers of justice expect prompt and effective
delivery of justice in an atmosphere that is acceptable. Therefore, infrastructure enhancement will
go a long way in strengthening functioning of the court and would improve the productivity in the
justice delivery system. A court complex is not just a building. It is the building of justice which
breathes and infuses life into the exalted and sublime ideals of justice. The widening gap between
the ideal and the real and between the vision and the pragmatic realisation of justice has to be
bridged by proper access to justice for all. The said aspect of the matter was not considered in the
proper perspective by the petitioner, who filed the present PIL. The present writ petition is against
the interest of the public at large. Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to any relief before this
Court under the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court.
85. Deprivation of personal liberty without ensuring speedy trial is not consistent with Article 21 of
the Constitution of India. While deprivation of personal liberty for some period may not be
avoidable, period of deprivation pending trial/appeal cannot be unduly long. "At the same time,
timely delivery of justice is part of human rights and denial of speedy justice is threat to public
confidence in the administration of justice. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Court,
the liberty guaranteed in part III of the Constitution would cover within its protective ambit not only
due procedure and fairness, but also access to justice and a speedy trial is imperative."
86. This Court directed the Registrar General, High Court of Karnataka, to furnish the details and
statistics pertaining to constitution of Dharwad and Kalaburagi benches from the date of
establishment till date. The Statement showing the pendency of Civil and Criminal Cases in the High
Court of Karnataka, Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches, from 2008 till 28.02.2023, is as under:

87. In pursuance of the order dated 3.3.2023 passed by this Court, the Registry of
High Court of Karnataka has furnished the details by way of memo dated 23.3.2023
alongwith Annexures-A to E/statements. The statement produced at Annexure-A
clearly indicate that at the inception of establishment of Circuit Benches in the year
2008, 20,766 cases (18401 civil cases and 2365 criminal cases) were pending in the
Dharwad Bench and 25606 cases (23898 civil cases and 1708 criminal cases) were
pending in the Kalaburagi Bench.
"The pendency statement also depicts that as on 28.2.2023, 58,586 cases (51946 civil
cases and 6640 criminal cases) were pending in the Dharwad Bench and 25,606
cases were pending in the Kalaburagi Bench. These figures clearly indicate that from
the year 2008 till 28.2.2023, filing of both civil and criminal cases have increased in
view of establishment of Benches in the northern Karnataka. As the Courts came to
their doorsteps, the awareness of legal rights has increased in the citizens of north
Karnataka and accordingly, the litigants approached the Courts with great
expectation for speedy and qualitative justice. Today, the judiciary is repository of
public faith. It is the trustee of the people. It is the last hope of the people. After every
knock at all the doors fail people approach the judiciary as the last resort.

It is the only temple worshipped by every citizen of this nation, regardless of religion,

88. The statements furnished by the Registry of the High Court of Karnataka at Annexures-B and B1
clearly depict that the State Government spent Rs.93,63,21,175=71 at Dharwad Bench and 12,606.96
lakhs at Kalaburagi Bench for infrastructure and maintenance of buildings from the year 2007- 08
to 2022-23. Further, the information furnished by the Registry as per Annexure-C depicts that the
working strength of officers/officials at Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches is 325 and 193
respectively. Annexure-E depicts that the expenditure incurred to Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches
from 2008-09 to 2022-23 is Rs.1,486,149,833/- and Rs.1,189,781,691/- respectively.
Further, the information furnished by the Registry of High Court of Karnataka by way of memo
dated 11th April 2023 indicates that the approximate expenditure incurred towards salary,
allowances etc., of the Hon'ble Judges sitting at Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches from July-2008
till March-2023 is Rs.16,35,31,600/- and Rs.3,19,54,800/- respectively. The approximate
expenditure of traveling and daily allowances of Hon'ble Judges sitting at Dharwad and Kalaburagi
Benches is Rs.63,937,701/- and Rs.39,373,660/- respectively. The approximate expenditure
incurred towards salary, allowances etc, to the officers/officials working in Dharwad and Kalaburagi
Benches from 2008 till March-203 is Rs.1570685105/- and Rs.1002980707/- respectively. The
approximate expenditure incurred towards travelling allowance and daily allowances to the
officers/officials working in Dharwad and Kalaburagi Benches during the above period is
Rs.9,780,059/- and Rs.7,110,357/- respectively.
89. The constitutional authorities taking into consideration various factors and in the interest of
litigant public at large has established Circuit Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga, which later
converted into permanent benches. Government has spent crores of rupees for establishing the
Circuit Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga as stated supra and the citizens of North Karnataka are
agitating their rights before the said Courts and getting timely justice to their door steps. The
distance from Bangalore (which is the principal seat of the High Court of Karnataka) to various
district centres of North Karnataka ranges between 425-613 kilometers and hence litigants from all
those districts have to travel a long distance to reach the principal seat of the High Court at
Bangalore and it is highly expensive besides being time-consuming for such seekers of justice. In the
circumstances, it is not open for the petitioner to contend that the establishment at Kalaburagi and
Dharwad is futile exercise. Infact lakhs of people are benefited by the establishment of the Courts at
Dharwad and Kalaburagi and the people of north Karnataka are happy as the Courts are established
at their doorsteps and as a result, the litigants need not travel long distances spending huge
expenses. The establishment of Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga should not be construed as an
investment for returns at all, but should only be taken as "Pro Bono Publico measure." It is the duty
of the State Government/constitutional authorities to help the litigants and absolutely there is no
profit motive and the establishment of Benches at Dharwad and Gulbarga is a "public welfare
measure." Establishment of courts benefit the litigant public and justice delivery at the doorstep is
the objective of the State. Admittedly, the circuit benches were established in the year 2008 and now
we are in the year 2023 and more than 14 years has elapsed and the citizens of North Karnataka are
happy to urge their rights in the courts established near their doorsteps and the clock of the judicial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 65
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
system at Dharwad and Kalaburagi is complete.
90. The High Court is the best suited machinery to decide whether it is necessary and feasible to
have a bench outside the principal seat of that High Court as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Federation of Bar Associations in Karnataka -vs- Union of India reported in (2000)6 SCC
715. In the present case, the then Chief Justice constituted seven members committee to look into
the matter and majority of five judges supported the establishment of circuit Benches and the
Hon'ble Chief Justice recommended for establishment of circuit benches. Accordingly, in
consultation with the State Government and the Chief Justice of India, the President of India passed
necessary orders and the same is in accordance with law and the petitioner is not entitled to any
relief in the present writ petition.
XI - Regarding the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner
91. (i) Insofar as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the case of
Federation Bar Associations in Karnataka -vs- Union of India reported in (2000)6 SCC 715, it was a
case where a Committee of five Judges constituted by the then Chief Justice of Karnataka High
Court submitted a report in June-2000 disfavouring the proposal for establishment of a separate
Bench away from the principal seat of the High Court and the same was agreed by the Hon'ble Chief
Justice and that was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court by Federation of Bar
Associations in Karnataka, which came to be dismissed on the ground that establishment of a Bench
of the High Court away from Bangalore is inadvisable, but observed that High Court is the best
suited machinery to decide whether it is necessary and feasible to have a bench outside the principal
seat of that High Court. Admittedly, Federation of Bar Associations in Karnataka is not a party to the
present proceeding and the said judgment does not bar the Hon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court
to constitute the new committee and also for establishment of circuit benches/permanent Benches
outside the principal seat of the High Court. In the present case, subsequently majority of
seven-member committee favoured establishment of benches and same was agreed by the Hon'ble
Chief Justice , thereby the said judgment has no application to the facts and circumstances of the
present case.
(ii) In the case of S.R. Bhagwat -vs- State of Mysore reported in AIR 1996 SC 188, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court while considering Article-246 of the Constitution of India held that Section 11(2) of
Karnataka State Civil Services (Regulation of Promotion, Pay and Pension) Act, 1975 tries to do
away with judgments, decrees and orders of any Court which has become final against the State and
such exercise of power is impermissible. In the present case, the judgment in the case of Federation
of Bar Association is based on the committee report and not on any final decision taken by the
jurisdictional authorities. Therefore, the judgment in the case of S.R. Bhagwat is not applicable to
the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.
(iii) In yet another judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the case of
Union of India -vs- K.M. Shankarappa reported in (2001)1 SCC 582, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that a judicial pronouncement cannot be malafide by the Executive or the Legislature. We have
no dispute with regard to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, but in the present case,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163637453/ 66
Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
there is no judicial pronouncement not to establish the circuit benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi
for ever.
(iv) Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon Fourth Report of Law Commission of India,
wherein it is observed that the structure and composition of the Courts should not be permitted to
be influenced by political considerations and that this has happened in the past in certain cases can
be no valid ground for the extension of that policy. Therefore, learned counsel submits that setting
of Benches at different seats is undesirable. In this regard, Deputy Solicitor General of India has
produced Government of India - Law Commission of India Report No.230, where the Law
Commission was constituted consisting of Chairman, Member Secretary and others and it has given
some suggestions for reforms in the Judiciary. In the report, it is stated that a speedy trial is not only
required to give quick justice, but it is also an integral part of fundamental right of life, personal
liberty as envisaged in Article 21 of the Constitution. Traditional concept of 'access to justice' as
understood by common man is access to Courts of Law. For a common man, a Court is a place where
justice is meted out to him/her. A lawyer in addition to being champion at the various laws also has
a social responsibility of helping the ignorant and the unprivileged to attain justice. Article 39A of
the Constitution of India provides for equal justice and free legal aid. It obligates the State to
promote justice on a basis of equal opportunity and in particular provide free legal aid by suitable
legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justices are not
denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities. The report further emphasises that
the constitutional promise of securing to all its citizens, justice, social, economic and political as
promised in the Preamble of the Constitution, cannot be realised, unless three organs of the State
i.e., Legislature, Executive, Judiciary, join together to find ways and means for providing the Indian
poor, equal access to its justice system. The report further emphasises need of:
• Speedy justice • Reduction in cost of litigation, • Systematic running of the courts •
Faith in judicial system and Other recommendations.
Thereby, the latest report of the Law Commission of India in August, 2009 prevails
than the reports relied upon by the learned Counsel for the petitioner.
(v) The other judgments relied upon by the learned Counsel for the petitioner are: (i)
South India Corporation-
vs- Secretary, Board of Revenue reported in AIR 1964 SC 207 and (ii) Petroleum and National Gas
Regulatory Authority -vs- Indraprastha reported in AIR 2015 SC 2978 with regard to reasonable
interpretation of the constitutional provisions of Section 69 of the State Re-organisation Act, we
have no quarrel, but the said judgments have no application to the facts and circumstances of the
present case.
(vi) Another judgment relied upon by the learned Counsel for the petitioner in the case of Manickam
Pillai Subbayya Pillai -vs- Assistant Registrar, High Court, Kerala, Trivandrum reported in 1958
Kerala 188, to the effect that that in view of Section 51(3) SR Act, there cannot be a separate registry
for establishment of Circuit Bench, which was dealt and negatived in the State of Maharastra stated

Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
supra by the Apex Court at paragraph-27 wherein it was held as under:
"27. the curtailment of the territorial jurisdiction of the main seat of the high Court of
a new State is a necessary concomitant to the establishment of a permanent bench
under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act while contrasting sub- section (3) with
sub-section (2). There, a question arose whether the temporary Bench of the High
court of Kerala with its principal seat at Ernakulam created by the Chief Justice at
Trivandrum by an order issued under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act was not
the high Court of Kerala, and the Judges and division Courts sitting at Trivandrum
were precisely in the same position as Judges and division Courts sitting in the
several courtrooms of the High Court at its principal seat in Ernakulam. In other
words, the contention was that the Judges and Division Courts sitting at Trivandrum
could only hear and dispose of such cases as were directed to be posted before them
by the Chief Justice but no new case could be instituted there. Raman nayar, J. (as he
then was) speaking for the court held that the Trivandrum Bench was not the High
Court of Kerala and the Judges and division Courts sitting at Trivandrum could hear
and dispose of only such cases as may be assigned to them. With respect, we are of
the opinion that the view expressed bv Chagla. C. J. in Manii Dana case, is to be
preferred. Chagla. C. J. rightly observed that the Judges and Division Courts at a
temporary Bench established under sub-section (3) of Section 51 of the Act function
as Judges and Division courts of the High Court at the principal seat. and while so
sitting at such temporary Bench they may exercise the jurisdiction and power of the
High Court itself in relation to all the matters entrusted to them. "
Admittedly in the present case as already stated supra, the Circuit Benches at Dharwad and
Kalaburagi subsequently made as Permanent Benches are part and parcel of Principal Bench of
High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru and only one Registrar General is working for all the three
Benches, except appointing Additional Registrars at the Benches. Thereby, the said judgment has no
application to the facts and circumstances of the present case.
(vii) Though the learned Counsel for the petitioner at one breadth states that the provisions of S.R.
Act is applicable, but at another breadth states that after 47 years, the provisions of S.R. Act are not
applicable and placed reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Municipal Corporation for City of Pune and Another -vs- Bharat Forge Co. Ltd., and Others reported
in AIR 1996 SC 2856 and in the case of State of MP -vs- Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd., reported in
AIR 1964 SC 1179, but the said judgments have no application to the facts and circumstances of the
present case in view of the specific reasons stated supra.
(viii) The other two judgments in the case of Shri Swamiji of Shri Admar Mutt, etc., -vs- The
Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Dept and Others reported in AIR 1980
SC 1 to the effect that the provisions of S.R. Act cannot be applied for temporary measure or
temporary purpose as well as in the case of Motor General Traders and Another -vs- State of A.P.
and Others reported in AIR 1994 SC 121(1).

Sri.N.P.Amrutesh vs The Union Of India on 30 May, 2023
92. As already stated supra, all the demands made by the citizens of North Karnataka, the then Chief
Justice constituted a Committee of 7 members, the committee has taken pains to visit all the places
after considering the pros and cons, and considering Justice Jaswanth Singh Commission Report
and the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, President of Bar Association opined that there
was a necessity to constitute Circuit Benches both at Dharwad and Kalaburagi and subsequently
made as Permanent Benches and the said Benches as part and parcel of the Principal Seat,
Bengaluru High Court and thereby the said judgments have no application to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
93. With regard to other judgments relied upon by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, in view of
the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case and the fact that the Circuit Benches have
become Permanent Benches and are working for more than 14 years providing speedy and timely
access to justice to the citizens of the Northern Karnataka, they have no application to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware -vs- State of Maharashtra
and Others reported in AIR 2005 SC 540 held that the petitioner, who comes to the Court for reliefs
in interest must come not only with clean hands like any other writ petitioner, but also with a clean
heart, clean mind and clean objective and further observed that, it is high time for the Bar Councils
and Bar Associations to ensure that no Member of the Bar becomes party as the petitioner or in
aiding and/or abetting filing frivolous petitions, carrying the attractive brand name of 'Public
Interest Litigation'.
95. In view of the above dictum, the petitioner is not entitled for any relief before this Court and the
writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
96. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.N. Godavarman Thirumalpad -vs- Union of India
reported in AIR 2006 SC 1774 held that a person acting bonafide alone can approach the Court in
public interest. Such a remedy is not open for unscrupulous person, who acts, in fact, for someone
else. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, we see no bonafide on the part of
the petitioner that too a practicing advocate of this Court to file a public interest litigation, infact, it
is against public interest at large, who were starving for tension free life through speedy justice
delivery system and access to justice. On that ground also, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
97. It is relevant to state at this stage that the establishment of Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi
ensures speedy and qualitative justice to the needy citizens of North Karnataka to their door steps,
creates an opportunity to the many young advocates to excel themselves by assisting the Hon'ble
Judges in achieving the object of justice delivery system and after establishment of Circuit Benches
at Dharwad and Kalaburagi, the accomplished advocates have been elevated as Hon'ble Judges of
this Court and thereby, distributive justice has been rendered to all the regions. Therefore, the
establishment of Circuit Benches - Permanent Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi has fulfilled the
object of Preamble of the Constitution of India.

98. For the reasons stated above, the points raised in the present writ petition is answered in the
negative holding that the petitioner has not made any public interest to quash the notification dated
19.10.2014, Annexure-E and the notification dated 4.6.2008 Annexure-F issued by the Chief Justice
of Karnataka and the Presidential Order dated 8.8.2013 Annexure- M issued by the President of
India in exercise of powers conferred under Sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the State Re-
organization Act, 1956 and the petitioner has not made out any case to issue writ of mandamus
directing the 5th respondent to conduct performance audit including financial audit with regard to
investment, expenditure and functional viability of the Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi and it's
sustenance is in public interest in exercise of extra ordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Articles
226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
99. In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case and the petitioner, who wasted public
precious time in filing frivolous public interest litigation to struck down the Benches at Dharwad
and Kalaburagi, though this Court is inclined to impose heavy costs on the petitioner, but taking into
consideration that the petitioner is aged about 62 years as on today and he has become senior citizen
and infact earlier had filed genuine public interest litigations to protect the interest of the general
public at large, we decline to impose any costs on him with an advise to the petitioner - practicing
advocate to be cautious in future in filing such frivolous litigations and shall ensure to protect
precious time of the Court as the Court is not anybody's personal property, but it is a Divine of
Temple. People approach the Court after every knock to all the doors as a last resort. It is the temple
worshipped by every citizen of this nation regardless of religion, caste, sex or place of birth.
