JUDGMENT
This appeal under Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act', for
short) has been filed by the revenue. The subject matter of the appeal pertains to Assessment year
1997-98. The appeal was admitted by a Bench of this Court vide order dated 29.06.2009 on the
following substantial questions of law:
a) Whether the Tribunal was correct in holding that the Assessing Officer was
justifying in dropping the reopened assessments under an order dated 15.03.2005
without recording any reasons by recording its own reasons for the first time in its
order presuming the reasons on which the Assessing Officer would have passed an
order?
2. Facts giving rise to filing of this appeal briefly stated are that the assessee is a society registered
under Section 12A of the Act. During the course of the proceedings for grant of registration under
Section 80G of the Act, the assessee had filed copies of statement of accounts for year ending
31.03.1997. As per the aforesaid accounts, the income before granting exemption under Section 11
and 12 was Rs.12,60,9195/-. The assessee was therefore required to file the return of income under
Section 139(4A) of the Act. The assessee stated to have submitted its account to the ISKON, Mumbai
for consolidation of their accounts. The assessee did not file the return as required under Section
139(4A) of the Act. Therefore, the proceeding under Section 147 of the Act were initiated by the
assessing officer. In response to the aforesaid proceeding, the assessee filed return of income on
28.04.2004. Therefore, the proceeding was dropped vide order dated 15.03.2005.
3. The Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) initiated proceeding under Section 263 of the Act and a
notice was issued to the assessee as to why order dated 15.03.2005 be not cancelled and assessing
officer be directed to frame a fresh assessment for the Assessment year 1997-98. The Director of

The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S International Society For Krishna ... on 9 June, 2020
Income Tax (Exemptions) by an order dated 30.03.2007 inter alia held that the order dated
15.03.2005, by which proceeding under Section 147 were dropped for the Assessment year 1997-98
to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. The order dated 15.03.2005 was
cancelled and matter was remitted to the assessing officer by treating the income shown as opening
balance for the Assessment year 1997-98. Being aggrieved, the assessee filed an appeal before the
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The tribunal by an order dated 05.09.2008 inter alia held that
contention of the assessee that they were sending accounts to Mumbai for the purpose of
consolidation is correct and the aforesaid fact finds place in the order passed by the Director of
Income Tax (Exemptions) under Section 263 of the Act. It was further held that assessee was
registered under Section 12A of the Act and accounts were being submitted along with ISKON,
Mumbai. It was further held that Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) has not found anything
wrong with the accounts for the financial year 1996-97.
4. It was further held that the assessing officer applied his mind on the basis of the facts and found
that no income has escaped assessment for the Assessment year 1997-98. It was further held that
the view taken by the assessing officer is one of the possible views and therefore, in view of law laid
by the Supreme Court in the case of 'MALABAR INDUSTRIES CO. LTD., VS. CIT', 243 ITR 83, it
cannot be held that the order of the assessing officer was erroneous and required an action under
Section 263 of the Act. The tribunal accordingly quashed the order under Section 263 of the Act and
partly allowed the appeal. In the aforesaid factual background, this appeal has been filed.
5. Learned counsel for the revenue submitted that the assessee was admittedly registered under
Section 12A of the Act and did not file the return. Therefore, the proceeding under Section 148 of the
Act initiated. It is further submitted that scope of proceeding under Section 148 and 263 of the Act is
different and the proceeding under Section 263 could not have been brought on the ground that the
income was already assessed to tax in Mumbai. In support of aforesaid submission on a decision of
the Supreme Court in 'COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, MUMBAI VS. AMITABH BACHAN',
(2016) 69 TAXMANN.COM 170 (SC). It is also urged that the assessing officer was under a duty to
proceed with the assessment and to find out whether amount in question was assessed to tax in
Mumbai.
6. On the other hand, learned counsel for the assessee has submitted that the proceedings under
Section 263 of the Act were brought after taking into account factual aspect. A decision of division
bench of this Court in W.A.No.595/2007 has also been referred to and our attention has been
invited to paragraph 6 of the aforesaid decision and it has been pointed out that the return of
income was filed for the first time in the year 2000-01 showing opening corpus fund of Rs.39.59
Crores in the balance sheet. It is also urged that corpus fund is not taxable. In this connection, our
attention has been invited to the order passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well
as Section 11(1)(d) of the Act where the finding has been recorded that amount in question is part of
corpus fund. It is also submitted that proceeding under Section 263 of the Act were ab initio void
and the tribunal has passed a reasoned order, which does not call for any interference.
7. By way of rejoinder reply, learned counsel for the revenue has invited our attention to paragraphs
7 & 8 of the order passed by the division bench in W.A.No.595/2007 and has submitted that

The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S International Society For Krishna ... on 9 June, 2020
assessee is a separate legal entity and was required to file the return.
8. We have considered the submissions made on both the sides and have perused the record.
Admittedly in response to the notice under Section 148, the assessee filed the return on 28.04.2004.
From perusal of the proceeding, it is evident that the assessee was called upon to furnish certain
details as well as documents on 28.10.2004 and 06.01.2005, which were supplied by the assessee on
18.02.2005. The Deputy Director, Income Tax (Exemptions) on 23.02.2005 confirmed that the
assessee's consolidation of accounts was done at Mumbai and assessment was completed. After
examining the submissions, made by the assessee, the proceeding under Section 147 of the Act were
dropped. The Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) in its order has found that the assessee for the
Assessment year 1997-98 had disclosed an opening balance of Rs.15,88,02,860/- as corpus fund.
The finding recorded by the Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) that the proceedings were
dropped without proper enquiry and appreciation, cannot be sustained as from perusal of the
record, it is evident that an enquiry was conducted and confirmation was sought from Deputy
Director, Income Tax (Exemptions), Mumbai who confirmed that consolidation was done at
Mumbai and assessment was completed and exemption under Section 11 of the Act was granted. The
fact that assessee was sending accounts to Mumbai is recorded in the order under Section 263
passed by the Director of Income Tax (Exemptions), Mumbai. The relevant extract has been
reproduced by the tribunal in para 4.5 of the order, which is reproduced below for facility of
reference:
"Up to the asst. year 2000-01, the assessee have included complete accounts of its
Bangalore Branch functioning from Hare Krishna Hill in Rajajinagar, Bangalore in its
final audited accounts."
9. Thus, the accounts were being submitted along with ISKON, Mumbai. The Director of Income
Tax (Exemptions) has not found anything wrong in the accounts for the Assessment year 1997-98. It
is pertinent to mention here that view taken by the assessing officer is one of the two plausible views
and therefore, in view of law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of MALABAR
INDUSTRIAL CO. LTD., supra, the proceeding under Section 263 of the Act cannot be upheld. The
tribunal has therefore, rightly set aside the proceeding under Section 263 of the Act initiated against
the assessee.
In view of preceding analysis, the substantial question of law is answered against the revenue. In the
result, we do not find any merit in this appeal, the same fails and is hereby dismissed.
