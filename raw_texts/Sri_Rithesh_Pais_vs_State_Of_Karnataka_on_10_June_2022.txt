PROCEEDINGS THEREON IN SPL.C.NO.5023/2021 (CRIME
NO.72/2020 OF PUTTUR TOWN P.S.) FOR OFFENCES PUNISHABLE
UNDER SECTIONS 504, 323, 506 OF IPC AND SEC.3(1)(r)(s),
3(2)(va) OF THE SC/ST P.A. AMENDMENT ACT, 2015 WHICH IS
NOW PENDING ON THE FILE OF THE V ADDL.DISTRICT &
SESSIONS JUDGE, D.K. MANGALURU SITTING AT PUTTUR, D.K.
THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The petitioner is before this Court calling in question the proceedings in SPL.C.No.5023/2021
pending before the V Additional District & Sessions Judge, DK, Mangalore sitting at Puttur arising
out of Crime No.72/2020 of Puttur Town Police Station registered for the offences punishable under
Sections 504, 323, 506 of the IPC and Sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s) and 3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Castes
and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to
as "the Act" for short).
2. Sans details, facts in brief germane for consideration of the lis are as follows:
Facts as projected by the prosecution are that on 2.10.2020 at around 10.30 a.m.
when the complainant was working in a newly constructed building belonging to
CW-7 at Yelmudi, Puttur, Puttur Taluk accused/petitioner goes there and asks the
complainant to stop the work for which the complainant appears to have replied that
he is working on the instructions of the owner of the building.
It is further alleged that in front of witnesses CW-2 to CW-6 the accused/petitioner
addressed the complainant taking the name of his caste, threatened his life and
obstructed construction activity of CW-7. Based upon this incident, a complaint is
registered by the 2nd respondent/ complainant against the petitioner alleging that he
has hurled abuses taking the name of his caste which would become offence
punishable under Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the Act. The police after investigation
have filed a charge sheet. Filing of the charge sheet against the petitioner for offences
punishable under the aforementioned provisions of the Act and Sections 504, 506
and 323 of the IPC in Special Case No.5023 of 2021 is what drives the petitioner to
this Court in the subject petition.
3. Heard learned Senior Counsel Sri. Sandesh J. Chouta for Sri. Lakshmikanth G. learned counsel
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5657100/ 2
Sri Rithesh Pais vs State Of Karnataka on 10 June, 2022
appearing for the petitioner, Sri. Ajay Prabhu, learned counsel for Sri. B.S. Sachin representing
respondent No.2 and learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for respondent No.1-State.
4. Learned Senior Counsel would contend with vehemence that the complainant is an employee of
CW-7 - Sri Jayakumar R.Nair against whom the petitioner has instituted civil suit and an order of
injunction is operating against him and, therefore, he has set up his employee to settle his personal
scores or wreck vengeance for the petitioner's act of instituting the suit. He would further contend
that hurling of abuses is neither in a public place nor in a place of public view; it is admittedly hurled
at the basement of the building where no passerby was present.
5. On the other hand, the learned counsel representing 2nd respondent and the State in unison
would contend that the abuses have admittedly been hurled in front of CWs-2 to 6, the witnesses
and the said act is also seen by other public. It is a matter of trial for the petitioner to come out clean
as the complaint narrates such circumstances and as such a trial would become necessary.
6. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
and perused the material on record.
7. To consider the submissions made by the respective learned counsel, a little walk in time is
necessary. The petitioner and one Sri Jayakumar R.Nair were in a squabble with regard to certain
property. The petitioner is plaintiff No.2 in a suit instituted in O.S.No.179 of 2020 in which 8th
defendant is Sri Jayakumar R.Nair. The said suit is instituted by the petitioner seeking perpetual
injunction against the defendants. The civil Court concerned has granted an interim order of
injunction in favour of the petitioner and others which reads as follows:
"Heard. Perused. There are sufficient materials to pass an ex-parte TI order
restraining the defendants from alienating or creating any charge over plaint 'A'
Schedule Property till next date of hearing. If ex-pare TI order is not passed very
purpose of filing the suit will be defeated. Hence, defendants are hereby restrained
from alienating or creating any encumbrance over plaint 'A' Schedule Property till
next date of hearing. Issue ex- pare TI Order. Plaintiffs to comply order 39 Rule 3(a)
of CPC.
Issue S/s and notice on IA No.II to VII to defendants. R/by 31/08/20."
The said suit is pending consideration with the order of injunction granted on 11-08-2020. After the
grant of injunction the first informant/CW-1, the complainant registers a complainant on 2.10.2020
alleging that the petitioner had hurled abuses taking the name of his caste at the basement of the
building where he was working and also intimidated all the workers.
8. What is germane to be noticed is who is the complainant. The complainant/CW-1 is the employee
of defendant No.8 in the suit Sri Jayakumjar R.Nair against whom an order of injunction is
operating in a suit filed by the petitioner. This fact of the complainant being the employee of Sri
Jayakumjar R.Nair is not in dispute as the complaint itself narrates this fact. What springs now to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5657100/ 3
Sri Rithesh Pais vs State Of Karnataka on 10 June, 2022
considered is, whether hurling of abuses has taken place in a public place or a place of public view to
attract Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the Act. Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) read as follows:
"3. Punishments for offences of atrocities.- (1) Whoever, not being a member of a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.-
... ... ... ...
(r) intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to
humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view;
(s) abuses any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe by caste name in
any place within public view;' In terms of Sections 3(1)(r) & 3(1)(s) what is necessary
to drive home an offence that would become punishable under these Sections is that
hurling of abuses must be either in a public place or a place of public view. The
allegation against the petitioner is that he has hurled abuses on the complainant at
the basement of the building and the witnesses to the said incident are CWs-2 to 6.
The complainant is CW-1. It is again not in dispute that all the witnesses including
the complainant are co-employees of Sri Jayakumjar R.Nair or fiends of
CW-1/complainant. This is also an admitted fact.
The Police, after investigation, have filed the charge sheet. Summary of the charge sheet reads as
follows:

If the complaint, summary of charge sheet and the statement of witnesses, CW-2 in particular, are
read in tandem, it would unmistakably reveal that hurling of abuses has happened at the basement
where CWs-1 to 6 were working and in the basement, it is not indicated, any other person was even
present. Two factors would emerge from a reading of the aforesaid statements - one being, the
basement of the building was not a place of public view and two, only persons who claim to be
present were the complainant/CW1 and other employees of Sri Jayakumjar R.Nair or friends of
CW-1. Therefore, hurling of abuses is clearly not in a place of public view or a public place for the
aforesaid provisions of the Act to be get attracted in the case at hand. Reference being made to the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of HITESH VERMA v. STATE OF UTTARAKHAND1 in the
circumstances becomes apposite. The Apex Court has interpreted the very provision that is now
invoked against the petitioner and held what would it mean to be a place of public view or a public
place. The Apex Court has held as follows:
"11. It may be stated that the charge-sheet filed is for an offence under Section 3(1)(x)
of the Act. The said section stands substituted by Act 1 of 2016 w.e.f. 26.1.2016. The
substituted corresponding provision is Section 3(1)(r) which reads as under:
"3.(1)(r) intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view;"
12. The basic ingredients of the offence under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act can be classified as "(1)
intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled Tribe and (2) in any place within public view".
13. The offence under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act would indicate the ingredient of intentional insult
and intimidation with an intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.
All insults or intimidations to a person will not be an offence under the Act unless such insult or
intimidation is on account of victim belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. The object of
the Act is to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
Tribes as they are denied number of civil rights. Thus, an offence under the Act would be made out
when a member of the vulnerable section of the society is subjected to indignities, humiliations and
harassment. The (2020)10 SCC 710 assertion of title over the land by either of the parties is not due
to either the indignities, humiliations or harassment. Every citizen has a right to avail their remedies
in accordance with law. Therefore, if the appellant or his family members have invoked jurisdiction
of the civil court, or that Respondent 2 has invoked the jurisdiction of the civil court, then the
parties are availing their remedies in accordance with the procedure established by law. Such action
is not for the reason that Respondent 2 is a member of Scheduled Caste.

Sri Rithesh Pais vs State Of Karnataka on 10 June, 2022
14. Another key ingredient of the provision is insult or intimidation in "any place within public
view". What is to be regarded as "place in public view" had come up for consideration before this
Court in the judgment reported as Swaran Singh v. State [Swaran Singh v. State, (2008) 8 SCC 435:
(2008) 3 SCC (Cri) 527]. The Court had drawn distinction between the expression "public place" and
"in any place within public view". It was held that if an offence is committed outside the building e.g.
in a lawn outside a house, and the lawn can be seen by someone from the road or lane outside the
boundary wall, then the lawn would certainly be a place within the public view. On the contrary, if
the remark is made inside a building, but some members of the public are there (not merely
relatives or friends) then it would not be an offence since it is not in the public view (sic) [Ed.: This
sentence appears to be contrary to what is stated below in the extract from Swaran Singh, (2008) 8
SCC 435, at p. 736d-e, and in the application of this principle in para 15, below:"Also, even if the
remark is made inside a building, but some members of the public are there (not merely relatives or
friends) then also it would be an offence since it is in the public view."] . The Court held as under:
(SCC pp. 443-44, para 28) "28. It has been alleged in the FIR that Vinod Nagar, the first informant,
was insulted by Appellants 2 and 3 (by calling him a "chamar") when he stood near the car which
was parked at the gate of the premises. In our opinion, this was certainly a place within public view,
since the gate of a house is certainly a place within public view. It could have been a different matter
had the alleged offence been committed inside a building, and also was not in the public view.
However, if the offence is committed outside the building e.g. in a lawn outside a house, and the
lawn can be seen by someone from the road or lane outside the boundary wall, the lawn would
certainly be a place within the public view. Also, even if the remark is made inside a building, but
some members of the public are there (not merely relatives or friends) then also it would be an
offence since it is in the public view. We must, therefore, not confuse the expression "place within
public view" with the expression "public place". A place can be a private place but yet within the
public view. On the other hand, a public place would ordinarily mean a place which is owned or
leased by the Government or the municipality (or other local body) or gaon sabha or an
instrumentality of the State, and not by private persons or private bodies."
(emphasis in original)
15. As per the FIR, the allegations of abusing the informant were within the four walls of her
building. It is not the case of the informant that there was any member of the public (not merely
relatives or friends) at the time of the incident in the house. Therefore, the basic ingredient that the
words were uttered "in any place within public view" is not made out. In the list of witnesses
appended to the charge-sheet, certain witnesses are named but it could not be said that those were
the persons present within the four walls of the building. The offence is alleged to have taken place
within the four walls of the building. Therefore, in view of the judgment of this Court in Swaran
Singh [Swaran Singh v. State, (2008) 8 SCC 435:
(2008) 3 SCC (Cri) 527], it cannot be said to be a place within public view as none
was said to be present within the four walls of the building as per the FIR and/or
charge-sheet.
... ... ... ...
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5657100/ 6
Sri Rithesh Pais vs State Of Karnataka on 10 June, 2022
18. Therefore, offence under the Act is not established merely on the fact that the
informant is a member of Scheduled Caste unless there is an intention to humiliate a
member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe for the reason that the victim belongs
to such caste. In the present case, the parties are litigating over possession of the
land. The allegation of hurling of abuses is against a person who claims title over the
property. If such person happens to be a Scheduled Caste, the offence under Section
3(1)(r) of the Act is not made out.
... ... ... ...
21. In Gorige Pentaiah [Gorige Pentaiah v. State of A.P., (2008) 12 SCC 531: (2009) 1
SCC (Cri) 446] , one of the arguments raised was non-disclosure of the caste of the
accused but the facts were almost similar as there was civil dispute between parties
pending and the allegation was that the accused has called abuses in the name of the
caste of the victim. The High Court herein has misread the judgment of this Court in
Ashabai Machindra Adhagale [Ashabai Machindra Adhagale v. State of Maharashtra,
(2009) 3 SCC 789: (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 20] as it was not a case about the caste of the
victim but the fact that the accused was belonging to upper caste was not mentioned
in the FIR. The High Court of Bombay had quashed the proceedings for the reason
that the caste of the accused was not mentioned in the FIR, therefore, the offence
under Section 3(1)(xi) of the Act is not made out. In an appeal against the decision of
the Bombay High Court, this Court held that this will be the matter of investigation as
to whether the accused either belongs to or does not belong to Scheduled Caste or
Scheduled Tribe. Therefore, the High Court erred in law to dismiss the quashing
petition relying upon later larger Bench judgment."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court, in the afore-quoted judgment, has also considered the
squabble between the parties which could have led to registration of the crime. The facts therein are
akin to the facts in the case at hand. Sri Jayakumar R.Nair wanting to shoot the shoulder of his
employee - CW-1 for the act of the petitioner having registered a suit against Sri Jayakumar R.Nair
and also secured an interim order of injunction leading to registration of the crime cannot be
brushed aside as it demonstrates a clear link in the chain of events. Therefore, the registration of
crime itself suffers from want of bona fides.
9. The aforementioned is the analysis of invocation of the provisions of the Act. Offences under the
IPC are also invoked in the case at hand which would become punishable under Sections 504, 506
and 323 of the IPC. For an offence punishable under Section 323 IPC there should be hurt caused in
the squabble. A perusal at the records would reveal that the wound certificate shows a simple
scratch mark on the fore-arm and another scratch mark on the chest. Bleeding is not what is
indicated. Therefore, simple scratch marks cannot become offence under Section 323 of the IPC.
Insofar as Sections 504 and 506 of the IPC are concerned, they are clearly an offshoot of the
allegations made under the Act. Therefore, none of the offences under Sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s) or
Section 3(2)(va) can be driven home in the case at hand as they are all shrouded with the act of 8th
defendant seeking to wreck vengeance against the petitioner for having registered the suit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5657100/ 7
Sri Rithesh Pais vs State Of Karnataka on 10 June, 2022
Therefore, none of the offences alleged are sustainable in the peculiar facts of the case at hand.
10. Reference being made to another judgment of the Apex Court which bears consideration in
Hitesh Verma's case (supra) in the case of GORIGE PENTAIAH v. STATE OF A.P.2 is apposite
wherein the Apex Court holds as under:
"5. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that even if all the
allegations incorporated in the complaint are taken as true, even then, no offence is
made out under Section 3(1)(x) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") and under
Sections 447, 427, 506 of the Penal Code, 1860. As far as Section 3(1)(x) of the Act is
concerned, it reads as under:
"3. Punishments for offences of atrocities.--(1) Whoever, not being a member of a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,--
(i)-(ix)***
(x) intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view;"
... ...
7. Similarly, we find that the ingredients of Section 506 of the Penal Code are totally
absent in the (2008) 12 SCC 531 complaint. In the complaint it is not even mentioned
that the accused had intimidated or threatened the complainant or anyone else. In
absence of basic ingredients of the section in the complaint, no case under Section
506 IPC can be sustained. Section 506 reads as under:
"506. Punishment for criminal intimidation.-- Whoever commits the offence of
criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both;"
8. "Criminal intimidation" has been defined in Section 503 which reads as under:
"503. Criminal intimidation.-- Whoever threatens another with any injury to his
person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of anyone in whom that
person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person
to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that
person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such
threats, commits criminal intimidation."
Scope and ambit of courts' powers under Section 482 CrPC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5657100/ 8
Sri Rithesh Pais vs State Of Karnataka on 10 June, 2022
12. This Court in a number of cases has laid down the scope and ambit of courts' powers under
Section 482 CrPC. Every High Court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae to do real and
substantial justice, for the administration of which alone it exists, or to prevent abuse of the process
of the court. Inherent power under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised:
(i) to give effect to an order under the Code;
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court; and
(iii) to otherwise secure the ends of justice.
Inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC though wide have to be exercised sparingly, carefully and
with great caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in this
section itself. Authority of the court exists for the advancement of justice. If any abuse of the process
leading to injustice is brought to the notice of the court, then the court would be justified in
preventing injustice by invoking inherent powers in absence of specific provisions in the statute.
Discussion of decided cases
13. Reference to the following cases would reveal that the courts have consistently taken the view
that they must use this extraordinary power to prevent injustice and secure the ends of justice. The
English courts have also used inherent power to achieve the same objective. It is generally agreed
that the Crown Court has inherent power to protect its process from abuse. In Connelly v. Director
of Public Prosecutions [1964 AC 1254: (1964) 2 WLR 1145: (1964) 2 All ER 401 (HL)] Lord Devlin
stated that where particular criminal proceedings constitute an abuse of process, the court is
empowered to refuse to allow the indictment to proceed to trial. Lord Salmon in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Humphrys [1977 AC 1: (1976) 2 WLR 857:
(1976) 2 All ER 497 (HL)] stressed the importance of the inherent power when he
observed that it is only if the prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of the
court and is oppressive and vexatious that the Judge has the power to intervene. He
further mentioned that the courts' power to prevent such abuse is of great
constitutional importance and should be jealously preserved."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court, in the aforesaid judgment, had delineated the concept of
abuses in public place or in a public view which is further amplified by a three Judge Bench in
Hitesh Verma's case (supra).
11. Insofar as the judgment relied on by the State in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. Naresh and
others reported in (2011)4 SCC 324 to contend merely because the witnesses are the friends of the
complainant, it would not vitiate the proceedings. The said judgment is distinguishable on the facts
of the case at hand in juxtaposition to the facts obtaining in the said case, without much ado, as the
case was concerning examination of witnesses in a trial for murder under Section 302 of the IPC and
all the witnesses though were friends, had corroboration with other material. In the case at hand,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5657100/ 9
Sri Rithesh Pais vs State Of Karnataka on 10 June, 2022
neither the complaint nor the statements nor the finding in the charge sheet would be enough to
drive home the offence so alleged under the Act.
12. In the light of the afore-quoted facts, when the basic ingredients of the offence are missing, then
permitting such proceedings to continue and to compel the petitioner to face the rigmarole of
criminal trial would be totally unjustified, leading to abuse of the process of law. In the teeth of the
aforesaid facts and analysis, permitting further proceedings to continue would degenerate into
harassment and result in miscarriage of justice.
13. For the aforesaid reasons, the following:
ORDER
(i) The Criminal Petition is allowed.
(ii) The proceedings in Spl.C.No.5023/2021 (Crime No.72/2020 of Puttur Town P.S.)
for offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 506 of the IPC and Sec.3(1)(r)(s),
3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities)
(Amendment) Act, 2015, pending on the file of V Additional District & Sessions
Judge, D.K. Mangaluru, Sitting at Puttur D.K., stand quashed.
