CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SHIVAJI PANDEY
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 16-05-2016
In a group of these writ applications, as identical question
of law is involved, these writ applications are being disposed of by
this common order.
For convenience, the fact of CWJC No. 5096 of 2013
(Badal Singh Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) is being considered for
the disposal of group of writ applications.
The matter relates to appointment of Assistant Teacher of
non-government aided minority institution (hereinafter to be referred
Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 5
to as 'the said school'). The said school published an advertisement
on 27.3.2007 for the purpose of appointment of Assistant Teacher and
the last date for submission of form was fixed on 16.4.2007. In the
said advertisement, requisite qualification has been mentioned as
Intermediate or equivalent with teacher training course. The date of
interview was fixed on 21.4.2007 in terms of the advertisement. The
petitioner and four others applied for the post of Assistant Teacher. As
none of them were having training degree, the petitioner was found
most suitable and was selected as Assistant Teacher. The management
of the school vide letter dated 4.5.2007, communicated to join the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 4
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
school, accordingly, he joined the post of Assistant Teacher on
1.5.2007
. While working as a Teacher, he was sent for teacher training and he successfully completed the
training. The petitioner again joined the school on 5.4.2011. As per Rule, being minority institution,
the Managing Committee vide order dated 20.12.2011 sent a letter to the District Programme Officer
for granting approval and fixation of the salary. The District Programme Officer vide letter dated
31.12.2011 (Annexure-6) granted approval to the services of the petitioner. After lapse of a period of
about nine month, the District Education Officer vide letter dated 27.9.2012 issued a show-cause to
the Managing Committee about the illegal appointment and a show- cause was also given to the
petitioner. On receipt of the show-cause, Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016
6 the Managing Committee sent its show-cause reply dated 24.11.2012 wherein it has been
mentioned that the appointment of the petitioner is legal and suffers from no illegality. The District
Education Officer, not being satisfied with the explanation, again issued a letter to the Secretary of
the said school as well as to the petitioner informing that they may participate in the hearing on
14.12.2012 with respect to the appointment of the petitioner. The District Education Officer, West
Champaran, Betiah vide his letter no. 6683 dated 27/29.12.2012 found the appointment of the
petitioner illegal and the approval of service granted to the petitioner has been withdrawn. In the
impugned letter, following grounds have been motioned, namely, for the appointment of the
teacher, no advertisement was published in the news paper and without any advertisement, in place
of trained teacher, untrained person without following the roaster point of reservation and without
participation of the representative of the State, have been appointed. It has further been mentioned
that without following the proper procedure, the petitioner has been appointed.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned order suffers from illegality on the
ground that when the petitioner has filed the show-cause, it was the duty of the authority to consider
the case and pass a reasoned order which has not been done nor proper reason has been assigned
for withdrawing the approval Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 7 granted to
the petitioner. As the said school is a minority school having been protected by Article 29 and 30 of
the Constitution of India, the State has the jurisdiction to frame rules for regulating measures with
avowed object of maintaining standard of educational level of the institution so that student of
minority can march along with rest of the students of country but, cannot interfere in the
management of the minority institution. It has been submitted that the letter of the Government
dated 4.3.1993 is completely in the nature of interference with the working of the Board of
Management in the administration. It has further been stated that the appointment of teacher is
part of administrative function which is immune from the interference of State Government. He has
further stated that so far the appointment of untrained teacher is concerned, in this connection, it
has been mentioned that it is in consonance with the circular no. 3829 dated 26.7.1974 and after
obtaining the training, the proposal was sent for the approval of the service of the petitioner.
Though the petitioner was appointed as an untrained teacher and it was made clear at the time of
appointment, the payment would be made after receipt of the grant from the Government and so
much so that the application for approval was sent only when the petitioner acquired degree of
training. It has been argued that the minority institution cannot be compelled to make provision of
reservation to the person of socially Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 8
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 5
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
backward, scheduled caste and scheduled tribes citizen of India. The minority institution, religious
or linguistic have been given protection as provided under Article 29 and 30 of the Constitution of
India. In such view of the matter, the minority institution cannot be compelled to follow the
reservation policy of the State, inasmuch as, it has further been argued that the management of the
said school cannot be compelled to issue the presence of government representative in the matter of
selection of the teacher as it would be interference with the working of the management of the
school. It has further been argued that once an approval was granted, the successor has no
jurisdiction to review and recall the earlier decision of granting approval. It is not so the
appointment has been made without due process, but facts remains that as per the Bye-Law of the
school, the appointment has been made by making a local advertisement and also pasting the
notices at appropriate conspicuous places including in the notice board of the school. The procedure
has been followed in terms of the bye-laws of the school is sufficient compliance of the proper
selection. He has placed reliance of the following judgments in the case of The Ahmedabad St.
Xaviers College Society & Anr. Etc. Vs. State of Gujarat & Anr. reported in AIR 1974 SC 1389, Anjali
Jain & Anr. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2011(3) PLJR 702, T.M.A. Pai Foundation &
Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors. reported in 2003(1) PLJR 1 SC, Sidhrajbhai Sabbai & Patna High
Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 9 Ors. Vs. State of Gujarat & Anr. reported in 1963 SC
540 in such view of the impugned order is completely bad in law, it suffers from illegality on account
of interfering with the working of the management whereas in terms of the repeated judgments of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court, they do have a power for regulation but has no jurisdiction of
interfering with the working of the management committee of the school. It has further been
submitted that though at the initial stage, the petitioner was untrained teacher but when the
Managing Committee sought approval, at that time, he had received training and whatever be the
deficiency were there have been removed. He has further submitted that on many occasions, in
general teacher, the persons were appointed as untrained teacher and later on they were sent for
training and their services have still not been terminated. The requisite qualification is not to be
seen what was there at the time of advertisement rather at the time of approval of the services of the
petitioner by the State Government. Placed reliance on the judgment in the case of The State of
Bihar & Ors. Vs. Ashok Kumar Sinha & Ors. reported in 2008(4) PLJR 298. It has further been
stated that if the order is being passed on different grounds and one of the ground is found to be
unsustainable, the entire order will go. In support of his submission, he has placed reliance on the
judgment in the case of The State of Maharashtra Vs. Babulal Kriparam Takkamore & Ors. reported
in Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 10 AIR 1967 SC 1353 Paragraph 15. It
has further been submitted that the order shows that there was a ban in the appointment, cannot be
extended to the minority school as the ban was applicable only to the government school otherwise
it would amount to interference with the worker of the minority institution.
Per contra, the State has argued that the appointment suffers from illegality of such nature which
can neither waived nor condoned, placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
State of Bihar Vs. Upendra Narayan Singh & Ors. reported in 2009(4) PLJR 73 (SC). The
appointment has not been made after proper due advertisement, circulation of notice known to
general public, second the petitioner on the date of selection had no requisite qualification which
makes it vulnerable of illegality. Mere subsequent acquisition degree of training will not remove the
tag of illegal appointment as it has to be seen the qualification at the time of his entry not at the time
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 6
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
of approval. He has further submitted that though the State cannot interfere with the working of the
minority institution but have regulatory jurisdiction and, in that capacity, the State has a power to
frame rule in what would be qualification of teacher, manner the selection of teachers would be
made as the primary idea is that there should be a proper selection of teacher so that the students of
the minority institution can march along with the students of general Patna High Court CWJC
No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 11 school. He has further placed reliance in the case of All Bihar
Christian Schools Association & Anr. Vs. State of Bihar & Ors. reported in AIR 1988 SC 305,
submitted that there is power to review of earlier administrative order when it is found that the
illegality has been committed and regulate/review the approval granted to the petitioner with regard
to appointment. In reply, the counsel for the petitioner submits that if the appointment was illegal at
the entry point but when the matter came for approval, he had already acquired the degree and, as
such, whatever be the illegality, was not in existence, on the date of approval of appointment of the
petitioner. He has further reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of Rizwan Ahmad Azad
Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2016(1) PLJR 80 and in the case of The State of Bihar &
Ors. Vs. Ashok Kumar Sinha & Ors. reported in 2008(4) PLJR 298. He has further submitted that in
the matter of appointment of less than five posts, no need to call the name from the employment
exchange and placed reliance in the judgment of this Court in the case of Abhay Kumar Rai & Ors.
Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2001(4) PLJR 245 and in the case of Christian Medical
College Hospital Employees' Union & Anr. Vs. Christian Medical College Vellore Association & Ors.
reported in AIR 1988 SC 37. He has further emphasized that the show-cause which was filed by the
petitioner was not gone through properly and, as such, the order impugned suffers from illegality on
Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 12 account of non-speaking order based
on whim and caprices.
Learned counsel for the State has pointed out that the petitioner has never filed any show-cause
rather he has placed reliance on the show-cause filed by the Secretary of the school and he cannot
blame and claim illegality on the non-consideration of the show- cause.
In that view of the mater, this Court has to decide in view of minority tag of the institution, how far
it may claim immunity from Reservation Act framed by the State Government.
In constitutional mechanism, Part-III deals with the fundamental right of the citizen. Article 14
provides equality clause which says that every person is equal before the law and will get equal
protection of law. Article 15 provides prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race,
caste, sex or place of birth. Article 15(5) has been inserted in the Constitution by 93rd Amendment
Act, 2005 has been enforced with effect from 20.1.2006. Article 15(1) provides that there should not
be discrimination against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of
them but clause-4 & 5 has made an exception. Article 15(4) provides that nothing in this article or in
clause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the
advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled
castes Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 13 and schedules tribes. Article
15(5) stipulates that nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 shall prevent
the State from making any special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and
educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 7
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private
educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational
institutions referred to in clause (1) of Article 30. Article 16 deals with the equality of opportunity in
matters of employment which cognitivity with present case. Article 16(1) of the Constitution
provides that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizen in the matter of employment or
appointment to any office under the State. Article 16(4), (4A) and 4(B) enables the State to make
provisions of reservation of post in favour of any backward class of citizen and make provision for
reservation in promotion for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe category of citizen. In the same
part, special right/special protection has been conferred by way of fundamental right to the
minorities, religious minority institution as well as to the linguistic minority which have been
stipulated in Article 29 and 30 of the Constitution of India. Article 29 provides protection of
interests of minorities. Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part Patna
High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 14 thereof having a distinct language, script or
culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same. Clause 2 of Article 29 provides no citizen
shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid
out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. Article 30 deals
with right of linguistic as well as religious minorities to establish and administer educational
institutions of their choice. Article 30(2) of Constitution provides that the State will not refuse to
give aid to educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of minority
whether based on religion or languages. In the present case, all the institutions are minority
institutions. The minority institutions may be categorized in three classes. First educational
institutions are neither seeking aid nor recognition from the State. The second institutions are those
which want aid and the recognition and the third one educational institution which wants only
recognition and not aid. Minority institutions falling in the first category are free to administer their
institution in the manner they like. State has no power under the Constitution to place any
restriction on the right of administration, this does not mean that unaided minority institution is
immune from administration of general law. A minority institution cannot claim immunity from the
contract law, tax measures, economic regulations, social welfare, Labour Industrial Law and similar
other Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 15 measures which are mean to
meet the need of institution but, institutions falling within the second and third category are subject
to regulatory provisions made by the State. It is attached to the State to prescribe the condition for
granting recognition. The object and purpose of prescribing regulations is to ensure that minority
institutions do not fall below the standard of excellence expected of an educational institution and
that they do not fall outside the mainstream of the nation. A minority institution must also be fully
equipped with educational excellence to keep pace with others in the State otherwise the students
coming out of such institutions will not be fully equipped to serve the society or the nation. While
the State has every right to prescribe conditions for granting recognition or disbursing aid, it cannot
under the guise of that power prescribe onerous conditions compelling the minority institutions to
surrender their rights of administration to the government. On the one hand the State is under an
obligation to ensure that educational standards in the recognized institutions must be according to
the need of the society and according to standards which ensure the development of personality of
the students in turning out to be civilized, useful members of the society, and to ensure that the
public funds disbursed to the minority institutions are properly utilized. On the other hand the State
has to respect and honour minority rights under Article 30(1) in the matter of Patna High Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 8
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 16 establishing and carrying on of administration of
institution of their choice. In order to reconcile these two conflicting interests, the State has to strike
a balance and statutory provisions should serve both the objects and such statutory provisions have
to withstand the test of Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India. In this chapters itself, Article 15
and 16 are on side and Article 29 in on other side are two competing rights and both the articles fall
under the same part of the Constitution. So both the rights have to be harmonized in such manner
which should sub-serve the interest to the minority institution as well as minorities citizen must be
assimilated in mainstream of society in such manner, hardly make any difference with the rest of
society and contribute to the nation and people of the State. It has to be kept in mind that there
should be a teacher of standard in the minority institution so that the students who are getting
education may match with the rest of the students of the general school. The right of minority
institution as well as the duty of the State should be arranged in such manner, the State should
remain within Laxman Rekha of regulating of minority institutions and it should not cross that line
it may turn to interference in the right of minority institutions. In what manner the State would
regulate the functioning of the minority institution came for consideration on different occasion
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as in this Court, held that the State Patna High Court
CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 17 has a jurisdiction to frame the rule in such a manner to
regulate the working of the minority institution and the view has been taken that the State should
not interfere with the administration of the management of the minority institution. The State can
fix the syllabus for teaching. It can fix the educational qualification of teacher, the mode of their
selection but the State cannot interfere with the matter of selection of teacher of the minority school.
It lies completely within the domain of the management and the State has been prohibited to
interfere in the matter. It will be relevant to examine some judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
as well as this Court directly dealing with this aspect of the matter. First of its kind, dealing with
competing right of the State vis-à-vis constitutional right and constitutional protection conferred
upon and the minority institution. The Kerala Education Bill, 1957 Reference case reported in 1958
SC 956 = 1959 SCR 995. In the Kerala Education Bill, 1957, a provision was made for reservation in
the minority institution, was seriously objected was referred to the President for assent. The
President of India had some doubt to some clauses of the said bill which was touching the right of
the minority institution. The Hon'ble Court considered the right of minority institution as
adumbrated under Article 30 (1) of the Constitution of India. The Court adverted it does not say that
minorities based on religion should establish educational institutions Patna High Court CWJC
No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 18 for teaching religion only, or that linguistic minorities should
have the right to establish educational institutions for teaching their language only but the article
say that the religious and the linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational
institutions of their choice no limitation placed on the subjects to be taught in such educational
institutions, as such minorities will ordinarily desire that their children should be brought up
properly and efficiently and be eligible for higher university education and go out in the world fully
equipped with such intellectual attainments as will make them fit for entering the public services,
educational institutions of their choice will necessarily include institutions imparting general secular
education also. The court has held in the following terms:-
"-------The first point to note is that the Article gives certain rights not only to
religious minorities but also to linguistic minorities. In the next place, the right
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 9
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
conferred on such minorities is to establish educational institutions of their choice. It
does not say that minorities based on religion should establish educational
institutions for teaching religion only, or that linguistic minorities should have the
right to establish educational institutions for teaching their language only. What the
article say and means is that the religious and the linguistic minorities should have
the right to establish educational institutions of their choice. There is no limitation
placed on the subjects to be taught in such educational institutions. As such
minorities will ordinarily desire that their children should be brought up properly
and efficiently and be eligible for higher university education and go out in the world
fully equipped with such intellectual Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 19 attainments as will make them fit for entering the public services,
educational institutions of their choice will necessarily include institutions imparting
general secular education also. In other words, the Article leaves it to their choice to
establish such educational institutions as will serve both purposes, namely, the
purpose of conserving their religion, language or culture, and also the purpose of
giving a thorough, good general education to their children. The next thing to note is
that the Article, in terms, gives all minorities, whether based on religion or language,
two rights, namely, the right to establish and the right to administer educational
institutions of their choice.----"
The Court has held that the minority institution has a right to establish and administer educational
institution of their choice and the duty of the Government to promote education, there is, on the
other side the obligation of the State under Art. 45 to endeavour to introduce free and compulsory
education. The court has said that both the conflicting right has to be reconciled and give effect to
both. The directive principles cannot ignore or override the fundamental rights but must subserve
the fundamental rights. The right to administer cannot obviously include the right to
mal-administer. The minority institution cannot ask for aid for educational institution run by them
in unhealthy surrounding without any competent teachers, possessing any semblance of
qualification, and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters
subversive of the welfare of the scholars. It will be relevant to quote paragraph no.31, Patna High
Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 20 which reads as follows:-
"31. -------- There is, on the one hand the minority rights under Art. 30(1) to establish
and administer educational institutions of their choice and the duty of the
Government to promote education, there is, on the other side the obligation of the
State under Art. 45 to endeavour to introduce free and compulsory education. We
have to reconcile between these two conflicting interests and to give effect to both if
that is possible and bring about a synthesis between the two. The directive principles
cannot ignore or override the fundamental rights but must, as we have said, subserve
the fundamental rights. We have already observed that Art. 30(1) gives two rights to
the minorities, (1) to establish and (2) to administer, educational institutions of their
choice. The right to administer cannot obviously include the right to maladminister.
The minority cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution
run by them in unhealthy surroundings, without any competent teachers, possessing

Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
any semblance of qualification, and which does not maintain even a fair standard of
teaching or which teaches matters subversive of the welfare of the scholars. It stands
to reason, then, that the constitutional right to administer an educational institution
of their choice does not necessarily militate against the claim of the State to insist
that in order to grant aid the State may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the
excellence of the institutions to be aided. Learned Attorney-General Patna High
Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 21 concedes that reasonable
regulations may certainly be imposed by the State as a condition for aid or even for
recognition.----"
The same issue again came for consideration in the case of Sidhrajbhai Sabbai & Ors. Vs. State of
Gujarat & Anr. reported in AIR 1963 SC 540. There the Court has dealt with two conflicting right as
provided under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India as well as Article 30(1) of the Constitution
of India and both fall in the same part of the Constitution. The Court has held that all minorities
have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Article 30(2)
enjoins the State, in granting aid to educational institutions not to discriminate against any
educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based
on religion or language but the Court said that it is open to the State to impose regulation upon the
exercise of rights. The Court found that the fundamental freedom is to establish and to administer
educational institutions. The educational institutions must be in real sense is an institution which
cater to the educational needs of the citizens, or sections thereof. Regulation made must be in the
true interests of efficiency of instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality, public order and
the like may undoubtedly be imposed. Such regulations are not restriction on the substance of right
which secure proper functioning of the institution. It is relevant to quote paragraph Patna High
Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 22 no.10 of the judgment which reads as follows:-
"(10) Article 30(1) provides that all minorities have the right to establish and
administer educational institutions of their choice, and Art. 30(2) enjoins the State,
in granting aid to educational institutions not to discriminate against any educational
institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether
based on religion or language. Clause (2) is only a phase of the nondiscrimination
clause of the Constitution and does not derogate from the provisions made in el. (1).
The clause is moulded in terms negative : the State is thereby enjoined not to
discriminate in granting aid to educational institutions on the ground that the
management of the institution is in the hands of a minority, religious or linguistic,
but the form is not susceptible of the inference that the State is competent otherwise
to discriminate so as to impose restrictions upon the substance of the right to
establish and administer educational institutions by minorities, religious or
linguistic. Unlike Art. 19, the fundamental freedom under cl. (1) of Art. 30, is absolute
in terms ; it if; not made subject to any reasonable restrictions of the nature the
fundamental freedoms enunciated in Art. 19 may be subjected to All minorities,
linguistic or religious have by Art. 30 (1) All absolute right to establish and
administer educational institutions of their choice; and any law or executive direction
which seeks to infringe the substance of that right under Art. 30(1) would to that

extent be void. This, Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 23
however, is not to say that it is not open to the State to impose regulations upon the
exercise of this right. Tile fundamental freedom is to establish and to administer
educational institutions : it is a right to establish and administer what are in truth
educational institutions, institutions which cater to the educational needs of the
citizens, or sections thereof. Regulation made in the true interests of efficiency of
instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality, public order and the like may
undoubtedly be imposed. Such regulations are not restrictions on the substance of
the right which is guaranteed they secure the proper functioning of the institution, in
matters educational."
Again the Hon'ble Supreme Court has an occasion to consider the right of minorities with regard to
establishment of the institution of their choice and the right with regard to the management of the
affair of the institution in the case of The Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College Society & Anr. Etc., Vs.
State of Gujrat & Anr. reported in 1974 SC 1389. The Court had held that the management must be
free of control so that the founders or their nominees can mould the institution as they think fit and
in accordance with their ideas of how the interest of the community in general and the institution in
particular will be best served. The right of management cannot be taken away and vested to another
body as that would be encroachment upon the guaranteed right. This right is not absolute. It is open
to the State to regulate the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 24 course of
study, the qualification and appointment of teacher, the health and hygiene of student, facilities for
libraries and laboratories are basic component to good institution, is condition precedent for
granting affiliations. These are regulatory measures and do not violate any fundamental right of
minorities institution. It would be relevant to quote paragraph no.10 & 18 of the judgment which
reads as follows:-
"(10) In Re. The Kerala Education Bill 1957 [1959] S.C.R. 995 this Court said that
Article 30(1) covers institution-, imparting general secular education. The object of
Article 30 is to enable children of minorities to go out in the world fully equipped. All
persons whether in the majority or in the minority have the right under Article 25
freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.
Any section of citizens which includes the majority as well as the minority shall have under Article
29 the right to conserve their distinct language, script or culture. That is why the minorities are
given a specific right in respect of educational institutions Linder Article 30. Article 30(1) gives the
right to linguistic minorities as well where no question of religion arises. It is, therefore, not at all
possible to exclude secular education from Article 30. Since the Kerala Education Bill case (supra) in
1959 this Court has consistently held that general secular education is covered by Article 30.
18. This Court in State of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother Provincial, etc. [1971] 1 S.C.R.734 explained the
Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 25 necessary and importance of
regulatory measures of system and standard of education in the interest of the county and the
people. When a minority institution applies for affiliation, it agrees to follow the uniform courses of
study. Affiliation is regulating the educational character and content of the minority institutions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 12
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
These regulations are not only reasonable in the interest of general secular education but also
conduce to the improvement in the statute and strength of the minority institutions. All, institutions
of general secular education whether established by the minorities or the non-minorities must
impart to the students education not only for their intellectual attainment but also for pursuit of
careers. Affiliation of minority institutions is intended to ensure the growth and excellence of their
children and other students in the academic field. Affiliation mainly pertains to the academic and
educational character of the institution. Therefore, measures which will regulate the courses of
study, the qualifications and appointment of teachers, the conditions of employment of teachers, the
health and hygiene of students, facilities for libraries and laboratories are all comprised in matters
germane to affiliation of minority institutions. These regulatory measures for affiliation are for
uniformity, efficiency and excellence in educational courses and do not violate any fundamental
right of the minority institutions under Article 30."
Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 26 The right of the minority institution
vis-à-vis right of the State to regulate the function of the institution means the State has a right to
regulate but not to interfere with the management of the minority institution. The Court has also
said that the appointment of teacher is an important and essential right of administration. That
right cannot be interfered by the State in the name of right of regulation has been dealt with in
paragraph no.19 & 20 which reads as follows:-
"(19) The entire controversy centers round the extent of the right of the religious and
linguistic minorities to administer their educational institutions. The right to
administer is said to consist of four principal matters. First is the right to choose its
managing- or governing body. It is said that the founders of the minority institution
have faith and confidence in their own committee or body consisting of persons
selected by them. Second is the right to choose its teachers. It is said that minority
institutions want teachers to have compatibility with the ideals, aims and aspirations
of the institution. Third is the right not to be compelled to refuse admission to
students. In other words, the minority institutions want to have the right to admit
students of their choice subject to reasonable regulations about academic
qualifications. Fourth is the right to use its properties and assets for the benefit of its
own institution.
(20) The right conferred on the religious and linguistic minorities to administer
educational institutions of Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016
27 their choice is not in an absolute right. This right is not free from regulation. Just
as regulatory measures are necessary for maintaining the educational character and
content of minority institutions similarly regulatory measures are necessary for
ensuring orderly, efficient and sound administration. Das, C.J. in the Kerala
Education Bill case (supra) summed up in one sentence the true meaning of the right
to administer by saying that the right to administer is not the right to
maladminister."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 13
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
The right of appointment lies with the right of management but the fixing of the qualification of
teacher falls within the right of the State to regulate the minority institution as has been dealt in
paragraph no.30 which reads as follows:-
"(30). Educational institutions are temples of learning.
The virtues of human intelligence are mastered and harmonized by education. Where there is
complete harmony between the teacher and the taught, where the teacher imparts and the student
receives, where there is complete dedication of the teacher and the taught in learning, where there is
discipline: between the teacher and the taught, where both are worshipers of learning, no discord or
challenge will arise. An educational institution runs smoothly when the teacher and the taught are
engaged in the, common ideal of pursuit of knowledge. It is, therefore, manifest that the
appointment of teachers is an important part in educational institutions. The, Patna High Court
CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 28 qualifications and the character of the teachers are really
important. The minority institutions have the right to administer institutions. This right implies the
obligation and duty of the minority institutions, to render the very best to the students. In the right
of administration, checks and balances in the shape of regulatory measures are required to ensure
the appointment of good teachers d their conditions of service. The right to administer is to be
tempered with regulatory measures to facilitate smooth administration. The best administration will
reveal no trace or colour of minority. A minority institution should shine in exemplary eclectic in the
administration of the institution. The best compliment that can be paid to a minority institution is
that it does not rest on or Proclaim its minority character."
It will be also relevant to quote paragraph nos. 41, 72, 98, 103, 105, 183, 209 and 210 which reads as
follows:-
"41. Autonomy in administration means right to administer effectively and to manage
and conduct the affairs of the institutions. The distinction is between a restriction on
the right of administration and a regulation prescribing the manner of
administration. The right of administration is day to day administration. The choice
in the personnel of management is a part of the administration. The university will
always have a right to see that there is no maladministration. If there is
maladministration, the university will take steps to Patna High Court CWJC No.5096
of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 29 cure the same. There may be control and check on
administration in order to find out whether the minority institutions are engaged in
activities which are not conducive to the interest of the minority or to the
requirements of the teachers and the students. In State of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother
Provincial etc. (supra) this Court said that if the administration goes to a body in the
selection of whom the founders have no say, the administration would be displaced.
This Court also said that situations might be conceived when they might have a
preponderating voice. That would also affect the autonomy in administration. The
provisions contained in section 33 A(1) (a) of the Act have the effect of displacing the
management and entrusting it to a different agency. The autonomy in administration
is lost. New elements in the shape of representatives of different type are brought in.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 14
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
The calm waters of an institution will not only be disturbed but also mixed. These
provisions in section 33A (1) (a) cannot therefore apply to minority institutions.
72. Article 28 forbids, subject to the exception contained in clause (2), the imparting
of religious instructions in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State
funds. The article also contains provision against compulsion for persons attending
an educational institution recognized by the state or receiving aid out of State funds,
to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to
attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such Patna High Court CWJC
No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 30 institution or in any premises attached thereto.
98 It has been argued on behalf of the respondents that there is no fundamental right
to affiliation or recognition and that a minority educational institution seeking
affiliation or recognition must conform to the conditions which are prescribed for
recognition or affiliation. So far as this aspect is concerned, I am of the view that it is
permissible for the State to prescribe reasonable regulations like the one to which I
have referred earlier and make it a condition precedent to the according of
recognition or affiliation to a minority institution. It is not, however, permissible to
prescribe conditions for recognition or affiliation which have the effect of impairing
the right of the minority to establish and administer their educational institutions.
Affiliation and recognition are, no doubt, not mentioned in article 30(1), the position
all the same remains that refusal to recognize or affiliate minority institutions unless
they (the minorities) surrender the right to administer those institutions would have
the effect of rendering the right guaranteed by article 30(1) to be wholly illusory and
'Indeed a teasing illusion. It is, in our Opinion, not permissible to exact from the
minorities in lieu of the recognition or affiliation of their institutions a price which
would entail. the abridgement or extinguishment of the right under article 30(1). An
educational institution can hardly serve any purpose or be of any practical utility
unless it is affiliated to a University or is otherwise recognized like other Educational
institutions. The right conferred by article 30 is a real and meaningful right. It is
neither an abstract right nor is it to be exercised in vacuum. Article 30(1) was
intended to have a real significance and it is not permissible to construe it in such a
manner as would Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 31 rob it
of that significance. It may be appropriate in this context to refer to the observations
of Das CJ. in the case of Re Kerala Education Bill (supra) on pages 1067-68 "Without
recognition, therefore, the educational institutions established or to be established by
the minority communities cannot fulfil the real objects of their choice and the fights
'under Art.30(1) cannot be effectively exercised. The right to establish educational
institutions of their choice must, therefore, mean the right to establish real
institutions which will effectively serve the needs of their community and the scholars
who resort to their educational institutions. There is, no doubt,' no such thing as
fundamental right to recognition by the State but to deny recognition to the
educational institutions except upon terms tantamount to the surrender of their
constitutional right of administration of the educational institutions of their choice is
in truth and in effect to deprive them of their rights under Art.30(1). We repeat that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 15
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
the legislative power is subject to the fundamental rights and the legislature cannot
indirectly take away or abridge the fundamental rights which it could not do directly
and yet that will be the result if the said Bill containing any offending clause becomes
law."
Similar view was expressed in. the case of Rev. Sidhajbhai Sabhai (1963) 3 SCR 837 = (AIR 1963 SC
540) (supra) wherein it was observed :
"The Government also holds examinations for granting certificates to successful
candidates as trained primary teachers, and scholars receiving training in recognized
institutions alone are entitled to appear at the examination. Manifestly, in the
absence Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 32 or recognition
by the Government training in the College will have little practical utility.
The College is a non-profit 'making institution and depends primarily upon
donations and Government grant for meeting its expenses. Without such grant, it
would be extremely difficult if not impossible for the institution to function."
What is said above with regard to aid or recognition applies, equally to affiliation of a college to the
University because but for such affiliation the student will not be able to obtain a University. degree
which is recognized as a passport to several professions and future employment in Public Service.
103. Another conclusion which follows from what has been discussed above is that a law which
interferes with a minority's choice of qualified, teachers or its disciplinary control over teachers and
other members of the staff of the institution is void as being violative of article 30(1). it is, of course,
permissible for the State and its educational authorities to prescribe the qualifications of teachers,
but once the teachers possessing the, requisite qualifications are selected by the minorities for their
educational institutions, the State would have no right to veto the selection of those teachers. The
selection and appointment of teachers for an educational institution is one of the. essential
ingredients of the right to manage an educational institution and the minorities can plainly be not
denied such right of selection and Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 33
appointment without, infringing article 30(1). In the case of Rev. Father W. Proost (1969) 2 SCR 73
= (AIR 1969 SC 465) (supra), this Court while dealing with section 48-A of the 'Bihar Universities
Act observed that the said provision completely took away the autonomy of the governing body of
the college and virtually vested the control of the college in the University Service Commission. The
petitioners in that case were, therefore, held entitled to the protection of article 30(1) of the
Constitution. The provisions of that section have been referred to earlier. According to the section,
subject to the approval of University appointments, dismissals, removals, termination of service or
reduction in rank of teachers of an affiliated college not belonging to the State Government would
have to be made by the governing body of the college on the recommendation of the University
Service Commission. The section further provided that the said Commission would be consulted by
the governing body of a college in all disciplinary matters affecting teachers of the college and no
action would be taken against or any punishment imposed upon a teacher of a college otherwise
than in conformity with the findings of the Commission.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 16
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
105. Although disciplinary control over the teachers of a minority educational institution would be
with the governing council, regulations, in my opinion, can be made for ensuring proper conditions
of service ,of the teachers and for, securing a fair procedure in the matter of disciplinary action
against the teachers. Such provisions which are calculated to Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of
2013 dt._16-05-2016 34 safeguard the interest of teachers would result in security of tenure and
thus inevitably attract competent persons for the posts of teachers. Such a provision would also
eliminate a potential cause of frustration amount the teachers. Regulations made for this purpose
should be considered to be in the interest of minority educational institutions and as such they
would not violate article 30(1). Clause (a) of sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 51A of the impugned
Act which make provision for giving a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against a penalty to
be proposed on a member of the staff of an educational institution would consequently be held to be
valid. Clause (b) of those sub-sections which gives a power to the Vice- Chancellor and officer of the
University authorised by him to veto the action of the managing body of an educational institution
in awarding punishment to a member of the staff, in my opinion, interferes with the disciplinary
control of the managing body over its teachers. It is significant that the power of approval conferred
by clause (b) in each of the two sub-
sections of section 51A on the Vice-Chancellor or other officer authorised by him is a blanket power.
No guidelines are laid down for the exercise of that power and it is not provided that the approval is
to be withheld only in case the dismissal, removal, reduction in rank or termination of service is
mala fide or by way of victimisation or other similar cause. The conferment of such blanket power
on the Vice-Chancellor or other officer authorised by him for vetoing the disciplinary action of the
managing Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 35 body of an educational
institution makes a serious inroad on the right of the managing body to administer an educational
institution. Clause (b) of each of the two sub-sections of section 51A should, therefore, be held to be
violative of article 30(1) so far as minority educational institutions are concerned.
183. It is upon the principal and teachers of a college that the tone and temper of an educational
institution depend. On them would its reputation, the maintenance of discipline and its efficiency in
teaching. The right to choose the principal and to have the teaching conducted by teachers
appointed by the management after, an overall assessment of their outlook and philosophy is
perhaps the most important facet of the right to administer an educational institution. We can
perceive no reason why a representative of the University nominated by the Vice Chancellor should
be on the Selection Committee for recruiting the Principal or for the insistence ,of head of the
department besides the representative of the University being on the Selection Committee for
recruiting the members of the teaching staff. So long as the persons chosen have the qualifications
prescribed by the University, the choice must be left to the management. That is part of the
fundamental right of the minorities to administer the educational institution established by them.
209. Laws made for sustaining the very conditions of organised society and civilised existence, so
that the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 36 rights of all, including
fundamental rights of the minorities, may be maintained and enforced do not rest on mere
implication. The specific provisions of Art. 245 to 254 read with the three Legislative lists in the
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution confer a host of legislative powers upon State Legislatures and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 17
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
the Parliament to regulate various kinds of activities including those of minority institutions. No
doubt Art. 30(1), like other fundamental Constitutional rights, is meant to limit the scope of
ordinary legislative power. But, it was submitted, on behalf of the State, that it is only a "law which
takes away or abridges the rights conferred" by Part III of the Constitution, containing the
fundamental rights of citizens, which is "void" and that too only "to the extent of the contravention".
Thus, a mere incidental regulation of or restriction upon the exercise of a fundamental right
intended to secure and actually ensuring its more effective enjoyment could not be said to be really
directed at an a bridgement or taking away of the fundamental right at all or to have that effect. Such
a law, when analysed, will be found to aim at something quite different from the abridgement of a
minority's fundamental rights under Art. 30(1) of the Constitution. It would not really take away or
abridge the fundamental rights even though it regulates their exercise. If, on the other hand, a law
necessarily has the compelling effect of a substantial abridgement or taking away of the fundamental
right from a minority institution, it would not be saved simply because it does not say Patna High
Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 37 so but produces that effect indirectly. For the
purposes of applying Art. 13(2) of the Constitution we have to look at the total effect of statutory
provisions and not merely intention behind them. This is how I understand the majority view in
1959 SCR 995 = (AIR 1958 SC 956).
210. The essence of the right guaranteed by Art. 30(1) of the Constitution is a free exercise of their
choice by minority institutions of the pattern of education as well as of the administration of their
educational institutions. Both these, taken together, determine the kind or character of an
educational institution which a minority has the right to choose. Where these patterns are accepted
voluntarily by a minority institution itself, even though the object may be to secure certain
advantages for itself from their acceptance, the requirement to observe these patterns would not be
a real violation of rights protected by Art. 30(1). Indeed, the acceptance could be more properly
viewed as an assertion of the right to choose which may be described as the "core" of the right
protected by Art. 30(1). In a case in which the pattern is accepted voluntarily by a minority
institution, with a view to taking advantage of the benefits conferred by a statute, it seems to me that
it cannot insist upon an absolutely free exercise of the right of administration. Here, the incidental
fetters on the right to manage the institution, which is only a part of the fundamental right, would be
consequences of an exercise of the substance or essence of the right which. as I see it, is freedom of
choice. No doubt, the rights protected by Art. 30(1) Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 38 are laid down in "absolute" terms without the kind of express restrictions found
in Articles 19, 25 and 26 of the Constitution. But, if a minority institution has the option open to it of
avoiding the statutory restrictions altogether, if it abandons, with it, the benefits of a statutory right,
I fail to see how the absoluteness of the right under Art. 30(t) of the Constitution is taken away or
abridged. All that happens is that the statute exacts a price in general interest for conferring its
benefits. It is open to the minority institution concerned to free itself from any statutory control or
fetters if freedom from them is considered by it to be essential for the full exercise of its fundamental
rights under Art. 30(1) of the Constitution. This article, meant to serve as a shield of minority
educational institutions against the invasion of certain rights protected by it and declared
fundamental so that they are not discriminated against, cannot be converted by them into a weapon
to exact unjustifiable preferential or discriminatory treatment for minority institutions so as to
obtain the benefits but to reject the obligations of statutory rights. It is only when the terms of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 18
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
statute necessarily compel a minority institution to abandon the core of its fundamental rights
under Art. 30 (1) that it could amount to taking away or abridgement of a fundamental right within
the meaning of Art. 13(2) of the Constitution. It is only then that the Principle could apply that what
cannot be done directly cannot be achieved by indirect means. Having stated my approach to the
interpretation of Art. 30 (1) of the Constitution, I Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 39 proceed now to consider the effect of this article on the impugned provisions."
The same issue came for consideration in the case of All Bihar Christian Schools Association & Anr.
Vs. State of Bihar & Ors. reported in AIR 1988 SC 305. There, the Christian schools challenged the
provisions of Bihar Non-Government Secondary Schools (Taking over of Management and Control)
Act, 1981. As the minority institutions were holding the view certain provisions dealing with
minority jurisdiction are encroaching upon the right which has been conferred on them through
Article 29 and 30 of the Constitution of India. The Hon'ble Supreme Court took the view that the
provisions of Taking Over Act, 1981 are not encroaching upon the right of minority institution rather
provision are regulatory in nature. It will be relevant to quote paragraph no.9 of the said judgment
which reads as follows:-
"9. In view of these decisions it is now well-settled that minorities based on religion
or language, have fundamental freedom to establish and manage educational
institutions of their own choice, but the State has right to provide regulatory
provisions for ensuring educational excellence, conditions of employment of
teachers, ensuring health, hygiene and discipline and allied matters. Such regulatory
provisions do not interfere with the minorities' fundamental right of administering
their educational institutions; instead they seek to ensure that such institution is
administered efficiently, and that students Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 40 who come out of minority institution after completion of their
studies are well equipped with knowledge and training so as to stand at par in their
avocation in life without any handicap. If regulatory provisions indirectly impinge
upon minorities' right of administration of their institution, it would not amount to
interference with the fundamental freedom of the minorities as the regulatory
provisions are in the interest of the minority institutions themselves. If the minority
institution seeks affiliation or recognition from the State or Education Board the
State has the right to prescribe syllabi and terms and conditions for giving such
affiliation or recognition or extending grants in aid. Minority institutions may be
categorised in three classes, (i) educational institutions which neither seek aid nor
recognition from the State, (ii) institutions that seek aid from the State, and (iii)
educational institutions which seek recognition but not aid. Minority institutions
which fall in the first category are free to administer their institution in the manner
they like, the State has no power under the Constitution to place any restriction on
their right of administration This does not mean that an unaided minority institution
is immune from operation of general laws of the land. A minority institution cannot
claim immunity from contract law tax measures, economic regulations, social welfare
legislation, labour and industrial laws and similar other measures which are intended
to meet the need of the society But institutions falling within the second and third

Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
categories are subject to regulatory provisions which the State may impose It is open
to the State to prescribe conditions for granting recognition or disbursing aid. These
conditions may require a Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016
41 minority institution to follow prescribed syllabus for examination. courses of
study, they may further regulate conditions of employment of teachers, discipline of
students and allied matters. The object and purpose of prescribing regulations is to
ensure that minority institutions do not fall below the standard of excellence
expected of an educational institution and that they do not fall outside the main
stream of the nation. A minority institution must also be fully equipped with
educational excellence to keep in step with others in the State; otherwise the students
coming out of such institutions will not be fully equipped to serve the society of the
nation. While the State has every right to prescribe conditions for granting
recognition or disbursing aid, it cannot under the guise of that power prescribe
onerous conditions compelling the minority institution to surrender their rights of
administration to the Government. On the one hand the State is under an obligation
to ensure that educational standards in the recognised institutions must be according
to the need of the society and according to standards which ensure the development
of personality of the students in turning out to be civilized, useful members of the
society, and to ensure that the public funds disbursed to the minority institutions are
properly utilised for the given purpose. On the other hand the State has to respect
and honour minority rights under Article 30(1) in the matter of establishing and
carrying of administration of institution of their choice. In order to reconcile these
two conflicting interests the State has to strike a balance and statutory provisions
should serve both the objects and such statutory provisions have to withstand the test
of Article 30(1) of the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 42
Constitution. These principles have to be borne in mind in considering the question
of validity of statutory provisions relating to minority educational institutions."
There the Court has categorized three classes of the school. One class which does not take any aid or
seek recognition. The government cannot interfere in the matter but other two classes, namely, they
do not take aid but seek recognition and the third class which take aid and seek recognition. The
court is of the view that in two classes, the Government can frame the regulation provided in what
manner will be the syllabus of the college fixing qualification of teacher, keeping library, laboratory,
playing ground etc. with the purpose of maintaining standard of the student as well as teacher but
the State cannot frame regulation interfering with the affairs of the minority institution. It will be
relevant to quote paragraph no.10, 15, 17 and 21 which reads as follows:-
"10. -------- The minority secondary schools, proprietary secondary schools, centrally
sponsored schools and autonomous secondary schools have not been taken over by
Section 3(1) of the Act. It does not affect a minority secondary school at all. As
regards Section 3(2) it confers power on the State Government to take over the
management and control of recognised minority schools, proprietary or autonomous
secondary schools by issuing a notification in the official Gazette provided the
managing committee, trust, association or the corporate body which may have been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 20
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
maintaining such schools makes an Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 43 unconditional offer to the State Government to make over the
school with all assets and properties. If the State Government accepts the offer and
considers it necessary to take over the management of such a school it may lay down
terms and conditions for the take over of the management and control of the school.
Section 3(2) does not confer any power on the State to compulsorily acquire or take
over the management of a minority school instead the management is free to
maintain and carry on the administration of its school and the State has no power to
interfere with its administration. The State is entitled to take over the school only if
an un- conditional offer is made by the management of the school. There is, however,
no compulsion on the management of a minority school to make over the school to
the Government. If the management of a minority school finds it difficult to maintain
its school, instead of closing down, it may, in the larger interest of the educational
need of the area, hand- over the control and management of the institution to the
State. Section 3(2) does not interfere with minority's rights to maintain or administer
its school, it merely enables the State to take over the control and management of a
minority institution only when an unconditional offer is made to it by the
management of the minority institution. There is, therefore, no question of Section
3(2) infringing the rights of minority institutions.
15 ------------The court further held that since these aforesaid clauses of the Bill were
regulatory, they do not violate Article 30(1) of the Constitution. Section 8(4) of the
Delhi School Education Act 1973 which require a managing committee of recognised
private school to obtain approval of the Director for suspending an employee was
upheld in its application to the minority institutions by this Court in Frank Anthony
Public School Employees' Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016
44 Association case [1986] 4 SCC 707 : (AIR 1987 SC 311) and Mrs. Y. Theclamma's
case [1987] 2 SCC 516 : (AIR 1987 SC 1210). In the latter case this Court observed that
while the right of the minority to establish and administer educational institutions of
their choice cannot be interfered with, restrictions by way of regulations for the
purpose of ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof can
validly be prescribed. Regulations can be made for ensuring proper conditions of
service for the teacher and also for ensuring a fair procedure in the matter of
disciplinary action. Section 8(4) of Delhi Act was designed to afford some measure of
protection to teachers of the minority institutions without interfering with the
management's right to take disciplinary action.
17 --------This Court (majority) held that the unqualified power conferred on an
outside authority which was made a judge of both, facts and law, the exercise of
which was made to depend purely on subjective considerations, constituted an
infringement' of the right guaranteed by Article 30(1) of the Constitution. These
decisions do not affect the view taken by us. As already discussed clauses (c) and (d)
of Section 18(3) of the Act are regulatory in nature to ensure the educational standard
of security of employment of teachers and no unguided, uncanalised, blanket power
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 21
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
in the nature of veto or appellate power has been conferred on any outside agency
against the disciplinary action taken by the management of a minority institution.
The School Service Board is vested with limited power to see that the person
proposed to be appointed possesses the requisite qualifications prescribed and that
the prescribed method of selection was followed by the management. The choice of
the person for appointment continues to vest in the managing Patna High Court
CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 45 committee of the minority school.
Similarly in disciplinary matters also the managing committee of a minority school
has full power to remove, terminate or discharge a teacher, but it has to obtain the
approval of the School Service Board, here again the Service Board has a limited
power to ascertain whether the disciplinary proceedings have been taken in
accordance with the rules framed by the management itself, the School Service Board
has no. Other power in the matter. These provisions do not suffer from the legal
infirmities as pointed out in the aforesaid decisions."
Similar issue has come for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Secy.,
Malankara Syrian Catholic College Vs. T. Jose & Ors. reported in 2007(1) SCC 386. There the
minority institution was getting the aid from the government for running of its education. The
question came for consideration for the appointment of the Principal of the College. The court has
held that the right of minority institution to establish and administer educational institution of their
choice, they do have a right to choose its Governing Body, to appoint teaching staff, to admit eligible
students of their choice, to use property and assets for the benefit of the institution, the right
conferred under Article 30 is only to ensure equality with majority not intended to place the
minority in a more advantageous position vis-à- vis the majority. Right to establish and administer
educational institution is not absolute but the Court says that if any such regulation interfere with
the overall administrative control of the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016
46 management, abridges or dilutes, the right to establish and administer educational institutions,
such regulations, to that extent, will be inapplicable to minority institutions. It is relevant to quote
paragraph no. 20, 21 & 22 of the judgment which reads as follows:-
"20. Aided institutions give instruction either in secular education or professional
education. Religious education is barred in educational institutions maintained out of
State fund. These aided educational minority institutions providing secular education
or professional education should necessarily have standards comparable with
non-minority educational institutions. Such standards can be attained and
maintained only by having well qualified professional teachers. An institution can
have the services of good qualified professional teachers only if the condition of
service ensures security, contentment and decent living standards. That is why State
can regulate the service conditions of the employees of the minority educational
institutions to ensure quality of education. Consequently, any law intended to
regulate the service conditions of employees of educational institutions will apply to
minority institutions also, provided that such law does not interfere with the overall
administrative control of the managements over the staff.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 22
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
21. We may also recapitulate the extent of regulation by the State, permissible in
respect of employees of minority educational institutions receiving aid from the
State, as clarified and crystalised in TMA Pai. The State can prescribe :
Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 47
(i) the minimum qualifications, experience and other criteria bearing on merit, for
making appointments,
(ii) the service conditions of employees without interfering with the overall
administrative control by the Management over the staff.
(iii) a mechanism for redressal of the grievances of the employees.
(iv) the conditions for the proper utilisation of the aid by the educational institutions,
without abridging or diluting the right to establish and administer educational
institutions.
In other words, all laws made by the State to regulate the administration of educational institutions,
and grant of aid, will apply to minority educational institutions also. But if any such regulations
interfere with the overall administrative control by the Management over the staff, or
abridges/dilutes, in any other manner, the right to establish and administer educational institutions,
such regulations, to that extent, will be inapplicable to minority institutions.
22. The Principal or Headmaster of an educational institution is responsible for the functional
efficiency of the institution, as also the quality of education and discipline in the institution. He is
also responsible for maintaining the philosophy and objects of the institution."
The question arise in the case of Sindhi Education Society & Anr. Vs. Chief Secretary, Government of
NCT of Delhi & Ors. reported in Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 48
2010(8) SCC 49. There the minority institution challenged that they cannot be compelled to follow
the resolution claiming encroaching upon their right conferred to them by Article 29 & 30 of the
Constitution of India and claimed that they are outside the purview of the resolution in view of
constitutional protection. In the name of granting reservation to backward class of citizen cannot be
compelled to accommodate the substandard teacher in their educational institution. The Hon'ble
Supreme court approved the objection, held they cannot be compelled to make provision for the
reservation. The court was considering in what manner provision of Article 16 vis-à- vis Article 29
and 30 of the Constitution of India can be balanced where the Court has held as follows:-
"85. ------ Once an organization or society falls outside the ambit of this
circumference, in that event, it will be difficult for the Courts to hold that the State
has a right to frame such laws or provisions or make reservations in the field of
employment of those societies.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 23
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
87. There is no doubt, that there may be minority institutions which are receiving
grant-in-aid from the Government. But, merely receiving grant-in- aid per se would
not make such school or institution `State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the
Constitution of India.
89. ------ various judgments of this Court have also Patna High Court CWJC No.5096
of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 49 consistently taken the view that the State has no right of
interference in the establishment, administration and management of a school run by
linguistic minority except the power to regulate as specified.
90. ------ Thus, except providing grant-in-aid as per the DSE Rules and having no
power to discriminate in terms of Article 30(2) of the Constitution, the Government
has a very limited regulatory control over the minority institutions and no control
whatsoever on the managing committee, internal management of the school and, of
course, has no power to take over such an institution.
97. The minimum qualifications, experience, other criteria for making appointments
etc are the matters which will fall squarely within the power of the State to frame
regulations but power to veto or command that a particular person or class of persons
ought to be appointed to the school failing which the grant-in-aid will be withdrawn,
will apparently be a subject which would be arbitrary and unenforceable.
98. In that case, while dealing with the appointment of a person as Principal, the
Court clearly stated the dictum that the freedom to choose the person to be appointed
as Principal has always been recognized as a vital facet to right to administer the
educational institution. It being an important part of the administration and even if
the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 50 institution is aided,
there can be no interference with the said right. The power to frame regulations and
control the management is subject to another restriction which was reiterated by the
Court in P.A. Inamdar's case (supra) stating that it is necessary that the objective of
establishing the institution was not defeated.
99. Thus, the very object and propose of this enactment was to improve the standard
as well as management of school education. It will be too far fetched to read into this
object that the law was intended to make inroads into character and privileges of the
minority. Besides, in the given facts and circumstances of the case, the Court is also
duty bound to advance the cause or the purpose for which the law is enacted.
Different laws relating to these fields, thus, must be read harmoniously, construed
purposively and implemented to further advancement of the objects, sought to be
achieved by such collective implementation of law. While, you keep the rule of
purposive interpretation in mind, you also further add such substantive or ancillary
matters which would advance the purpose of the enactment still further. To sum up,
we will term it as `doctrine of purposive advancement'.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 24
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
100. Even, otherwise, it is a settled principle of law that Rules must fall within the
ambit and scope of the principal legislation.
101. To appoint a teacher is part of the regular Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of
2013 dt._16-05-2016 51 administration and management of the School. Of course,
what should be the qualification or eligibility criteria for a teacher to be appointed
can be defined and, in fact, has been defined by the Government of N.C.T. of Delhi
and within that specified parameters, the right of the linguistic minority institution to
appoint a teacher cannot be interfered with. The paramount feature of the above laws
was to bring efficiency and excellence in the field of school education and, therefore,
it is expected of the minority institutions to select the best teacher to the faculty. To
provide and enforce the any regulation, which will practically defeat this purpose
would have to be avoided.
114. In fact, it would tantamount to imposing impermissible restriction. A school
which has been established and granted status of a linguistic minority for years, it
will not be proper to stop its grant-in-aid for the reason that it has failed to comply
with a condition or restriction which is impermissible in law, particularly, when the
teacher appointed or proposed to be appointed by such institution satisfy the laid
down criteria and/or eligibility conditions.
119. This principle equally applies to the Government while acting in the field of
reservation as well. It would not be possible for the Courts to permit the State to
impinge upon or violate directly or indirectly the constitutional rights and
protections granted to various classes including the minorities. Thus, the State may
not be well within Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 52 its
constitutional duty to compel the linguistic minority institution to accept a policy
decision, enforcement of which will infringe their fundamental right and/or
protection. On the contrary, the minority can validly question such a decision of the
State in law. The service in an aided linguistic minority school cannot be construed as
`a service under the State' even with the aid of Article 12 of the Constitution.
Resultantly, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that Rule 64(1)(b)
cannot be enforced against the linguistic minority school. Having answered this
question in favour of the appellant and against the State, we do not consider it
necessary to go into the constitutional validity or otherwise of Rule 64(1)(b) of the
Rules, which question we leave open.
The right of minority institution with respect to dismissal of an employee as per
regulation was to take approval of the Director, came for consideration in the case of
Ms. G. Vallikumari Vs. Andhra Education Society & Ors. reported in AIR 2010 SC
1105. The court has held that the protection of minorities is an article of faith in the
Constitution of India. The right to the administration of institutions of minority's
choice enshrined in Article 30(1) means 'management of affairs' of the institution.
This right is, however, subject to the regulatory power of the State. Article 30(1) is not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 25
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
a charter of maladministration; regulation so that the right to administer may be
Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 53 better exercised for the
benefit of the institution, is permissible. Bench to view declaring Section 8(2) Delhi
Education Act is ultra virus of Constitution, as that provision was encroaching upon
the right to minority institution. It is relevant to quote paragraph nos. 11 & 12 of this
judgment which reads as follows:-
11. In Y. Theclamma's case (AIR 1987 SC 1210), the issue considered by this Court
was whether the suspension of the appellant pending departmental inquiry was
legally correct and justified. The Court referred to earlier judgments including the
Constitution Bench judgment in Lily Kurian's case (AIR 1979 SC 52) and observed
(Paras 8 of AIR 1987 SC)::
"It is not necessary to go through all the cases relied upon by the Court in Frank
Anthony Public School case (AIR 1987 SC
311) for the view taken that the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act were of a
regulatory nature and therefore did not have the effect of abridging the fundamental
right guaranteed to the minorities under Article 30(1). It is enough to say that
although there is no reference in the judgment to Lily Kurian case (AIR 1979 SC 52)
the observations made by the court with regard to the applicability of sub-
section (4) of Section 8 of the Act which relates to the exercise of the power of suspension by the
management, fall in line Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 54 with the view
expressed by the majority in All Saints High School case (AIR 1980 SC 1042) where such power was
held to be, on consideration of all the decisions starting from In re the Kerala Education Bill, 1957
(AIR 1958 SC 956), a permissible restriction being regulatory in character.
Presumably the court in Frank Anthony Public School case felt that it was not necessary to refer to
Lily Kurian case as the extent of the regulatory power of the State had been dealt with by the court in
In re the Kerala Education Bill, 1957 and reaffirmed in the subsequent decisions, including that in
All Saints High School case (AIR 1980 SC 1042). In Lily Kurian case one of us (Sen, J.,) speaking for
a Constitution Bench had occasion to observe: (SCC p. 137, para 36) "Protection of the minorities is
an article of faith in the Constitution of India.
The right to the administration of institutions of minority's choice enshrined in Article 30(1) means
`management of the affairs' of the institution. This right is, however, subject to the regulatory power
of the State. Article 30(1) is not a charter for maladministration; regulation, so that the right to
administer may be better exercised for the benefit of the institution, is permissible;"
Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 55 (emphasis supplied) In
that case, the question was whether the conferment of a right of appeal to an external
authority like the Vice-Chancellor of the University under Ordinance 33(4) framed by
the Syndicate of the University of Kerala under Section 19(j) of the Kerala University
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 26
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
Act, 1957 against any order passed by the management of a minority educational
institution in respect of penalties including that of suspension was an abridgement of
the right of administration conferred on the minorities under Article 30(1). The
question was answered in the affirmative and it was held that the conferral of the
power of appeal to the Vice- Chancellor under Ordinance 33(4) was not only a grave
encroachment on such institution's right to enforce and ensure discipline in its
administrative affairs but it was uncanalised and unguided in the sense that no
restrictions were placed on the exercise of the power. It was further said that in the
absence of any guidelines it could not be held that the power entrusted to the Vice-
Chancellor under Ordinance 33(4) was merely a check on maladministration."
The Court rejected the argument that the decision in Frank Anthony Public School Employees'
Association's case (AIR 1987 SC 311) was in conflict with the Constitution Bench judgment in Lily
Kurian's case (AIR 1979 SC 52). Paragraphs 11 and 12, which contain discussion on this issue, read
thus:
"11. It would be seen that the decision of the Court in Frank Anthony Public School
case with regard to the applicability of sub-section (4) of Section Patna High Court
CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 56 8 of the Act to the unaided minority
educational institutions is based on the view taken by the majority in All Saints High
School case which, on its turn, was based on several decisions right from In re the
Kerala Education Bill, 1957 down to St. Xavier, including that in Lily Kurian. It is
therefore difficult to sustain the argument of learned counsel for the respondents that
the decision in Frank Anthony Public School case holding that sub-section (4) of
Section 8 of the Act was applicable to such institutions was in conflict with the
decision of the Constitution Bench in Lily Kurian case and therefore required
reconsideration. The contention of learned counsel for the respondents that sub-
section (4) of Section 8 of the Act requiring the prior approval of the Director for the
suspension of a teacher was a flagrant encroachment upon the right of the minorities
under Article 30(1) of the Constitution to administer educational institutions
established by them is answered in all the earlier decisions of this Court right from In
re the Kerala Education Bill, 1957 down to that in All Saints High School case which
have been referred to by the Court in Frank Anthony Public School case. These
decisions unequivocally lay down that while the right of the minorities, religious or
linguistic, to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice cannot
be interfered with, restrictions by way of regulations for the purpose of ensuring
educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof can validly be prescribed.
12. It cannot be doubted that although disciplinary control over the teachers of a
minority educational institution is with the management, regulations can be made for
ensuring proper conditions of service for the teachers and also for Patna High Court
CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 57 ensuring a fair procedure in the matter of
disciplinary action. As the court laid down in Frank Anthony Public School case the
provision contained in sub-section (4) of Section 8 of the Act is designed to afford
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 27
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
some measure of protection to the teachers of such institutions without interfering
with the Managements' right to take disciplinary action. Although the court in that
case had no occasion to deal with the different ramifications arising out of
sub-section (4) of Section 8 of the Act, it struck a note of caution that in a case where
the management charged the employee with gross misconduct, the Director is bound
to accord his approval to the suspension. It would be seen that the endeavour of the
court in all the cases has been to strike a balance between the constitutional
obligation to protect what is secured to the minorities under Article 30(1) with (sic
and) the social necessity to protect the members of the staff against arbitrariness and
victimisation."
12. The prepositions which can be culled out from the above noted two judgments are:
(i) Section 8(1), (3), (4) and (5) of the Act do not violate the right of the minorities to
establish and administer their educational institutions.
However, Section 8(2) interferes with the said right of the minorities and is, therefore, inapplicable
to private recognized aided/unaided minority educational institutions.
(ii) Section 12 of the Act, which makes the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016
58 provisions of Chapter IV of the Act inapplicable to unaided private recognized minority
educational institutions is discriminatory except to extent of Section 8(2). In other words, Chapter
IV of the Act except Section 8(2) is applicable to private recognized aided as well as unaided
minority educational institutions and the concerned authorities of the education department are
bound to enforce the same against all such institutions. Similar issue came for consideration before
this Court in the case of Anjali Jain Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2011(3) PLJR 702. In
this case, the Court has considered most of the previous judgments and has dealt with the right of
minority institution. In this case it is similar to the fact of these cases, so it will be relevant to
consider the fact of Anjali Jain case (supra). There the issue was raised, whether the State is
competent to impose its reservation policy in respect of selection and appointment of the staff and
teacher of the minority school in view of fact that the school was minority, receiving the government
aid. Jain community established an educational institution, published an advertisement, interview
was conducted, selection of petitioner was made, accordingly appointed Headmistress of the school
sought approval for the petitioner's appointment from the District Inspector of School, Bhojpur. The
District Inspector of the School, Bhojpur granted approval to the appointment and recommended it
to the District Superintendent of Education. The Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 59 District Superintendent of Education approved the appointment on fixed
pay-scale as well as matric trained Assistant Teacher but the Director, Primary Education,
Government of Bihar remitted back for reconsideration in view of the department letter dated
2.5.2005. During pendency of the writ application, the District Superintendent of Education of
Bhojpur passed order communicating that as per reservation policy, the selection was not made in
accordance with law as the reservation policy was not followed nor reservation roaster was applied,
as per the order of the Director, Primary Education, Government of Bihar, the approval granted by
the District Superintendent of Education on 2.5.2005 was cancelled. It was directed that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 28
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
petitioner's school was receiving the government aid, it must follow the departmental circular with
regard to reservation policy in a matter of appointment. The court considered the previous
judgments held that the State has a power to regulate its functioning in a limited sense which should
not contravene the fundamental right which has been guaranteed to them under Article 30(1) of the
Constitution. A minority institution cannot be denied aid on the ground that it is not agreeable to
conform to Government directives which are not for the purposes of enforcing excellence in
education and efficiency in Management.
Relevant to quote paragraph no.37 which reads as Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 60 follows:-
"37. In my view, the principles that emerged from the above referred decisions is that
so far as minority educational institutions are concerned, the State has the power to
regulate its functioning in a limited sense which should not contravene the
fundamental rights which has been guaranteed to them under Article-30 (1) of the
Constitution. A Minority Institution cannot be denied aid on the ground that it is not
agreeable to conform to Government directives which are not for the purposes of
enforcing excellence in education and efficiency in Management. The intrusion by
regulation of State into the right to establish and administer educational institution
of their choice is permissible only to that extent and not beyond. Even though the
regulation made, otherwise be in general public interest, by receiving aid, they cannot
be forced or asked to surrender their autonomy as guaranteed under Article 30 (1) of
the Constitution. Enforcement of reservation policy may be of general public
importance and benefit but it cannot be applied to aided minority educational
institutions who are free to choose and appoint Teachers and staff subject to
minimum educational and academic qualifications being complied with. The
requirement of grant of approval would only be limited to evaluating that they meet
the educational and academic qualifications required for the post and not beyond
that. These considerations by the State cannot take Patna High Court CWJC No.5096
of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 61 decades, as in the present cases, as this can be easily
evaluated in matter of moment and, hence, approval cannot be kept pending for a
long time, longer than necessary to evaluate the qualifications. Subject to the
minimum standards of educational and academic, the approval of appointment
would be as a matter of right."
With regard to making provision of reservation in admission in the private Institutions as well as
minority institutions taking aid from Government, came to consideration again in the case of
Pramati Educational & Cultural Trust & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors. reported in 2014(3) PLJR 86
SC. The question arose about making provision of reservation in educational institutions for
backward class of citizen as well as for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe category of candidate in
terms of Clause 5 of Article 15 of the Constitution of India with respect to private unaided
educational institution. The applicability of reservation policy in minority institution came for
consideration. The Court has taken view that Clause (5) of Article 15 does not apply to the minority
institution, Hon'ble Court adverted with the right of minority institution in the background of

regulatory power of the State with respect to maintaining the educational standard. There the court
has held that Clause (5) of Article 15 of the Constitution, therefore, enables the State to make a
special provision, by law, for the advancement of socially and educationally backward Patna High
Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 62 classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes insofar as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational
institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other
than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution.
It is relevant to quote paragraph no. 42 deals with reservation in non-aided minority institutions of
the said judgment which reads as follows:-
"42. In our considered opinion, therefore, by the Constitution (Eighty-Sixth
Amendment) Act, a new power was made available to the State under Article 21A of
the Constitution to make a law determining the manner in which it will provide free
and compulsory education to the children of the age of six to fourteen years as this
goal contemplated in the Directive Principles in Article 45 before this constitutional
amendment could not be achieved for fifty years. This additional power vested by the
Constitution (Eighty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 in the State is independent and
different from the power of the State under clause (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution
and has affected the voluntariness of the right under Article 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution. By exercising this additional power, the State can by law impose
admissions on private unaided schools and so long as the law made by the State in
exercise of this power under Article 21A of the Constitution is Patna High Court
CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 63 for the purpose of providing free and
compulsory education to the children of the age of 6 to 14 years and so long as such
law forces admission of children of poorer, weaker and backward sections of the
society to a small percentage of the seats in private educational institutions to achieve
the constitutional goals of equality of opportunity and social justice set out in the
Preamble of the Constitution, such a law would not be destructive of the right of the
private unaided educational institutions under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution."
The applicability of reservation policy with respect to minority institution came for consideration.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court adverted the provision for reservation of educationally and socially
backward classes of citizen or for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes does not apply has been
dealt in paragraph no. 45 and 46 which is reads as follows:-
"45. Under Article 30(1) of the Constitution, all minorities, whether based on religion
or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions
of their choice. Religious and linguistic minorities, therefore, have a special
constitutional right to establish and administer educational schools of their choice
and this Court has repeatedly held that the State has no power to interfere with the
administration of minority institutions and can make only regulatory measures and
has no power to force admission of Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013
dt._16-05-2016 64 students from amongst non-minority communities, particularly in
minority schools, so as to affect the minority character of the institutions. Moreover,

Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
in Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala & Anr. (supra) Sikri, CJ.,
has even gone to the extent of saying that Parliament cannot in exercise of its
amending power abrogate the rights of minorities. To quote the observations of Sikri,
CJ. in Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala & Anr. (supra):
"178. The above brief summary of the work of the Advisory Committee and the
Minorities Sub-committee shows that no one ever contemplated that fundamental
rights appertaining to the minorities would be liable to be abrogated by an
amendment of the Constitution. The same is true about the proceedings in the
Constituent Assembly. There is no hint anywhere that abrogation of minorities' rights
was ever in the contemplation of the important members of the Constituent
Assembly. It seems to me that in the context of the British plan, the setting up of
Minorities Sub-committee, the Advisory Committee and the proceedings of these
Committees, as well as the proceedings in the Constituent Assembly mentioned
above, it is impossible to read the expression "Amendment of the Constitution" as
empowering Parliament to abrogate the rights of minorities."
Thus, the power under Article 21A of the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016
65 Constitution vesting in the State cannot extend to making any law which will abrogate the right of
the minorities to establish and administer schools of their choice.
46. When we look at the 2009 Act, we find that Section 12(1)(b) read with Section 2(n) (iii) provides
that an aided school receiving aid and grants, whole or part, of its expenses from the appropriate
Government or the local authority has to provide free and compulsory education to such proportion
of children admitted therein as its annual recurring aid or grants so received bears to its annual
recurring expenses, subject to a minimum of twenty-five per cent. Thus, a minority aided school is
put under a legal obligation to provide free and compulsory elementary education to children who
need not be children of members of the minority community which has established the school. We
also find that under Section 12(1)(c) read with Section 2(n)(iv), an unaided school has to admit into
twenty-five per cent of the strength of class I children belonging to weaker sections and
disadvantaged groups in the neighbourhood.
Hence, unaided minority schools will have a legal obligation to admit children belonging to weaker
sections and disadvantaged groups in the neighbourhood who need not be children of the members
of the minority community which has established the school. While discussing the validity of clause
(5) of Article 15 of the Constitution, we have held that members of communities other than the
minority community Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 66 which has
established the school cannot be forced upon a minority institution because that may destroy the
minority character of the school. In our view, if the 2009 Act is made applicable to minority schools,
aided or unaided, the right of the minorities under Article 30(1) of the Constitution will be
abrogated. Therefore, the 2009 Act insofar it is made applicable to minority schools referred in
clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution is ultra vires the Constitution. We are thus of the view
that the majority judgment of this Court in Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan v.
Union of India & Anr. (supra) insofar as it holds that the 2009 Act is applicable to aided minority
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 31
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
schools is not correct."
In view of the aforesaid discussion, let us examine the facts of present case on the touchstone of
principle laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Court. In the present case, all the schools are
minority institution. Earlier they were granted approval but, later on withdrawn on the background
that none of minority institution followed the provision of reservation policy and did not call the
representative of the Government to attend meeting while making selection of the teacher. The
selection has been made of the persons who are not trained teachers as per circular of the
Government which requires only trained teacher should be appointed and so much so that the
appointment has been made without following the due procedure of law in the matter of selection of
teacher as it was Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 67 not circulated by
publishing in the newspaper. Admittedly it was pasted on the notice board at the school.
In view of the above discussion, rule of reservation is not applicable to the minority institution. At
the same time, merely because the representative of the Government was not there cannot be a
ground for holding the selection of teacher to be illegal as the power of selection is administrative
function of school, State in the name of regulatory power cannot interfere in the matter of selection
of teacher on the ground the representative of Government was not called for to participate in the
meeting, as power of selection is concomitant of administrative power squarely lies with the
management of school, if this would be approved, it will be interference in the functioning of
institution but, a question would arise, specially with regard to educational qualification of persons,
having been appointed as teachers are untrained teacher so much so that the appointment has not
been followed by a proper procedure as has been discussed in view of fact that the Government has a
regulatory power to fix the qualification of teacher, postulates the academic syllabus of the colleges
and school including of minority institution for the purpose of maintaining a standard as well as the
Government has also regulatory power to provide procedure in what manner teachers would be
appointed. For example, if after proper procedure, five persons Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of
2013 dt._16-05-2016 68 having proper qualification having been selected, who will be appointed by
the management of minority intuition lies within the domain of the minority institution but while
making selection, the minority institution will have to follow the proper procedure. If the
appointment has been made in a very arbitrary manner without making advertisement in the daily
newspaper, the claim of the minority institution that they have followed their own bye-laws which
has not been brought on record, cannot take a plea for holding selection according to their bye-laws,
such selection can not be approved, this Court holds that the selection of petitioners are illegal in
view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Bihar Vs. Upendra Narayan Singh
& Ors. reported in 2009(4) PLJR 73 SC where the Supreme Court has adumbrated that the selection
should be done in a proper manner. The proposition is buttressed from the letter of the Government
of Bihar contained in letter no. 0728/80 f"k0&25 dated 10.1.1986, as clause-3 of the said letter
stipulates proper circulation of advertisement in newspaper, which reads as follows:-

as also pasting at some places will not be treated that proper circulation of
advertisement and proper process of selection has been followed. Though the case
does not deal with minority institution but in view of letter of State Government
dated 8.1.1986, in all fairness, it has to be followed even by the minority institution as
indicated in the letter mentioned herein above so that the best talented person would
be inducted as a teacher. In the present case, it is admitted fact that in all the cases,
untrained teachers have been appointed dehors to the government circular but the
claim of the Patna High Court CWJC No.5096 of 2013 dt._16-05-2016 71 petitioners
that at the time of approval, they were all trained teacher does not rectify the illegality
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93000441/ 33
Kumari Shanti vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 May, 2016
in the selection of a teacher and so much so that admittedly in all these cases, the
appointment has been made without proper advertisement. The claim of petitioner
that advertisement was not required to be circulated through Newspaper Publication
as vacancy was less than five is not sustainable in law in view of letter of the
Government. The order dated 18.4.2016 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 13278 of 2015 (Md.
Sallauddin Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) in no way touches issue involved in the
present case.
In that view of the matter, the appointment of the teacher cannot be upheld. The
decision of the Government cannot be held to be illegal. However, the school, in
question, will be at liberty to appoint the trained teacher as per the executive
instruction by publishing the advertisement in the daily newspaper so that best and
talented person would be appointed.
With the aforementioned observation, all the writ applications are dismissed.
