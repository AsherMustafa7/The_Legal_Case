along with Smt. Shilpa S Gogi, learned HCGP for respondent No.2 and Sri Udaya Holla, learned
senior counsel for respondent Nos.4 to 58 and Smt. Aruna P Chavan, learned counsel for respondent
No.59.
2. As both writ petitions are canvassed on common grounds of fact and law, both petitions are taken
up for consideration by this common order.
3. The petitioners are before this Court being aggrieved by the order passed by the KSAT, Bengaluru
whereby the Hon'ble Tribunal was pleased to reject the applications preferred by the petitioners
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 15
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
(who were the applicants) by its order dated 12.05.2021.
- 18 -
4. The bare facts necessary to dispose off the litigation, are that the first respondent issued a
notification bearing No.PS C 1 RTB/2/2017 dated 23.03.2018, thereby inviting applications from
eligible candidates for the post of Drug Inspector in the third respondent department. The
notification came to be issued under the KPSC Rules, 2006, 2013, 2015. A copy of which is produced
as Annexure A1. Under the said notification the eligibility criteria for the prospective candidates was
fixed as follows:
(a) must be holder of B.Pharma degree in Pharmacy;
(b) must have put in a service of not less than eighteen months of experience in the
manufacturing and or testing of Schedule C and/or C1 drugs included in the Drugs
and Cosmetics Rules, 1945.
And it is the second criteria which has turned contentious.
5. That the process of selection of candidates commenced and resulted in completion with
publication of
- 19 -
a list of candidates who were to be interviewed and the said list was published on 07.11.2019
(Annexure A3). While so, a week thereafter an entirely new list came to be published on the website
of the first respondent commission i.e., on 12.11.2020, whereby the original list of eligible
candidates published on 07.11.2019 came to be substituted and the same was done by altering the
selection procedure and is alleged to have been carried out in a prejudicial manner.
6. It is the case of the petitioners that the process of receiving applications started on 26.03.2018
with the last date for submission being 24.04.2018. That subsequently an addendum came to be
issued on 24.04.2018 and last date was extended to 24.05.2018 and the examination dates were
scheduled on 13.12.2018 and 16.12.2018 and all the petitioners herein had cleared the examination
conducted on the dates noted supra.
- 20 -
7. That pursuant to the publication of the results of the written examination, a merit list of the
candidates came to be published and the candidates therein were notified of being eligible to
participate in the interview/viva-voce. That pursuant to the same, a list of candidates eligible for
being interviewed was also drawn up and were also called for document verification and the list of
candidates so invited for interview and document verification is produced as Annexure-A4.
Subsequent to the process of document verification the petitioners were issued letters inviting them
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 16
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
for interview on various dates i.e., 21.11.2019, 22.11.2019, 25.11.2019, 26.11.2019 and 27.11.2019. A
compilation of the letters inviting them for interview is produced as A5 to A18. That out of the total
list of candidates, whose names were put up on 22.11.2019, a fair number of the candidates were
interviewed and the remaining of the candidates were issued endorsements reading as under:
"your interview has been postponed and you will be informed after documents
verification"
- 21 -
A copy of which is produced as Annexure A19 to A21. Some of the candidates were also intimated by
e-mails.
8. That while so, to the shock and surprise of the petitioners, a new list of candidates or the "altered
list"
came to be published on 12.11.2020. Aggrieved, the petitioners moved the Tribunal.
That in the interregnum the respondents had also published a provisional list of
candidates but no reasons were assigned for either not calling them for the interview
or for excluding them from the provisional list of candidates short listed for
interview.
9. That on being notified the respondents appeared before the Tribunal and for the first time before
the Tribunal the respondent No.1 informed the Tribunal that an additional step of getting the
documents verified by an expert committee was introduced. That the additional step, of verification
of certificates by experts, was done with a view to assess the nature of experience
- 22 -
gained by the candidates and as to whether the experience gained was in line with the condition
imposed under the notification; that the additional step also included assessing as to whether the
candidates had acquired expertise in manufacturing and testing of Schedule C and C1 drugs and as
to whether they had worked in research and development department. The criteria/additional step
was not imposed while inviting applications and such criteria was sought to be introduced for the
first time and that too, after the provisional list of candidates, short listed for interview, was
published on 07.11.2019 and after that some of the candidates were indeed interviewed also. The
copy of the Karnataka Health and Family Welfare Services (Drugs Control Department
Non-teaching staff) (Recruitment Rules), 2013 based on which the eligibility criteria was fixed, is
produced and marked as Annexure G. The Tribunal by a common judgment and order has been
pleased to dismiss all the applications.

Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
ARGUMENTS BY LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL SRI ADITYA SONDHI ON BEHALF OF THE
PETITIONER IN W.P. NO.10575/2021.
10. The learned Senior counsel would invite the attention of the Court to Volume III of the
compilation to contend that the post is a statutory post and that the qualification for persons to be
appointed as Inspectors is provided under Rule 49 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules,1945
(hereinafter referred to as the "D & C Rules, 1945" for short). In support of his argument that the
post is a statutory post, he would invite the attention of the Court to Section 21 of the Drugs and
Cosmetics Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the "D & C Act, 1940" for short) which reads as
under:
"21. Inspectors.-(1) The Central Government or a State Government may by
notification in the Official Gazette, appoint such persons as it thinks fit, having the
prescribed qualifications, to be Inspectors for such areas as may be assigned to them
by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be.
- 24 -
(2) The powers which may be exercised by an Inspector and the duties which may be
performed by him, the drugs or [classes of drugs or cosmetics or classes of cosmetics]
in relation to which and the conditions, limitations or restrictions subject to which,
such powers and duties may be exercised or performed shall be such as may be
prescribed.
(3) No person who has any financial interest [in the import, manufacture or sale of
drugs or cosmetics] shall be appointed to be an Inspector under this section.
(4) Every Inspector shall be deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of
section 21 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), and shall be officially subordinate to
such authority [,having the prescribed qualifications.,]as the Government appointing
him may specify in this behalf.]"
11. He would further contend that the eligibility criteria having been stipulated under the Central
Legislation, the same is inviolable and that the power of framing rules, more particularly,
prescribing qualifications to the various posts including the post of Inspectors, has been arrogated
by the Central Government to itself and in
- 25 -
this regard, he would take the Court through the provisions of Section 33 (2) and more particularly
he would impress upon the Court to peruse clause (b) of Sub Section (2) of the D & C Act, 1940.
12. Section 33 of the D & C Act, 1940 commences with the heading "Power of Central Government to
make rules" and reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 18
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
"33. Power of Central Government to make rules. -- [(1) The Central Government
may [after consultation with, or on the recommendation of, the Board] and after
previous publication by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules for the
purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Chapter:
Provided that consultation with the Board may be dispensed with if the Central
Government is of opinion that circumstances have arisen which render it necessary to
make rules without such consultation, but in such a case the Board shall be consulted
within six months of the making of the rules and the Central Government shall take
into consideration any suggestions which the Board may make in relation to the
amendment of the said rules.]
- 26 -
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may --
(a) provide for the establishment of laboratories for testing and analysing drugs [or
cosmetics];
(b) prescribe the qualifications and duties of Government Analysts and the
qualifications of Inspectors;
[emphasis by this Court]
(c) prescribe the methods of test or analysis to be employed in determining whether a
drug [or cosmetic] is of standard quality;
(d) prescribe, in respect of biological and organometallic compounds, the units or
methods of standardisation;
[(dd) prescribe under clause (d) of [section 17A] the colour or colours which a drug may bear or

(e) prescribe the forms of licences [for the manufacture for sale or for distribution], for the sale and
for the distribution of drugs or any specified drug or class of drugs [or of cosmetics or any specified
cosmetic or class of cosmetics], the form of application for such licences, the conditions subject to

- 27 -
such authority] and the fees payable therefore; [and provide for the cancellation or suspension of
such licences in any case where any provision of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder is
contravened or any of the conditions subject to which they are issued is not complied with];

[(ee) prescribe the records, registers or other documents to be kept and maintained under section

(f) specify the diseases or ailments which a drug may not purport or claim [to prevent cure or

(g) prescribe the conditions subject to which small quantities of drugs may be manufactured for the

(h) require the date of manufacture and the date of expiry of potency to be clearly and truly stated
on the liable or container of any specified drug or class of drugs, and prohibit the sale stocking or

- 28 -
date of manufacture or after the expiry of the date of potency;
(i) prescribe the conditions to be observed in the packing in bottles, packages and other containers

or shall not be included in such labels;

(l) require that the accepted scientific name of any specified drug shall be displayed in the
prescribed manner on the lable or wrapper of any patent or proprietary medicine containing such

conditions, limitations or restrictions subject to which, such powers and duties may be exercised or

(o) prescribe the forms of report to be given by Government Analysts, and the manner of application

[(p) specify the offences against this Chapter or any rule made thereunder in relation to which an

(q) provide for the exemption conditionally or otherwise, from all or any of the provisions of this
Chapter or the rules made thereunder, of any specified drug or class of drugs [or cosmetic or class of
cosmetics] [and];
(r) sum which may be specified by the Central Government under section 32B.]"
13. Elaborating further he would take the Court through the provisions of Section 5 which provides
for the constitution of a Drugs Technical Advisory Board and constitution of which board is once
again by the Central Government. That the constitution of the Central Advisory Board amongst
others includes advising the State, the manners of framing of rules etc. He would contend that
- 30 -
there is no nexus between the stipulation regarding the experience and the duties attached to the
post of the Drugs Inspector.
14. The learned Senior counsel was also queried regarding insistence on experience in the
manufacturing of Schedule 'C' drugs and he would once again take the Court through Rule 49 and
would submit that the rule is in two parts and the first part deals with the pre-appointment
qualification and the latter/second part deals with the post-appointment duties that may be
performed only by a particular class of Inspectors and that the second part, as evidenced by the
proviso, is only an enabling provision and not a qualifying criteria for selection to the post of the
Drug Inspectors.
15. To buttress his contention regarding all not being fair, he would place reliance on the
understanding of the statute by several other States, namely, the notification dated 20.11.2019
issued by the Government of Assam by its Medical Health Recruitment Board of Assam
- 31 -
and would point out to Sl.No.5 of the notification which deals with the academic qualification and
would submit that there is no requirement of the candidate to possess any experience in testing and
manufacturing. He would nextly take the Court through the notification issued by the Government
of West Bengal, Department of Health Establishment Branch dated 3rd December. It is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 21
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
Notification, publishing the C and R Rules by the said Government and he would take the Court
through Sl.No.4 which deals with the post of Inspector of Drugs and qualification prescribed is a
degree in pharmaceutical chemistry or a post graduate degree etc., and would once again point out
that neither has the State insisted on any experience quotient, to be eligible for selection to the post
of Inspector of Drugs and would nextly take the Court through the publication issued by the Tamil
Nadu Public Service Commission, whereby applications have been invited for appointment to the
post of Drug Inspectors. He would take the Court through para 4-B of the Notification, which deals
with the educational qualification and yet
- 32 -
again would impress upon the point, that there is no insistence on experience in testing and
manufacturing of schedule C and C1 drugs. He would lastly take the Court through the publication
issued by the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission, Hyderabad, once again pertaining to the
recruitment to the post of Drug Inspector. He yet again takes the Court through paragraph No.2 of
the notification which pertains to educational qualification and would point out that what is
stipulated as eligibility criteria, is merely a degree and that there was no insistence on possessing
experience in testing and manufacturing schedule C and C1 drugs. He would also take this Court
through the notification issued by the Chattisgarh Government (Copy of the same is in Hindi
language) and would contend that yet again what is stipulated is only the academic qualification and
that the stipulation is wholly in consonance with the Central Act and Rules. He would submit that
the endeavour to place before the Court the notifications of various Governments inviting for
applications for employment in the concerned
- 33 -
department is only to demonstrate the fact that the understanding of statute is uniform and that the
action by the State in trying to tweak the qualifications stipulated under the rules is a misadventure.
16. The learned Senior counsel would then take the Court through the minutes of the meeting dated
16.01.2018 and take the Court through para 2 and would point out that the board has resolved to
recommend to remove the clause prescribing experience in Rule 49 of the D & C Rules, 1945 itself,
that is the latter part of Rule 49 of the D & C Rules, 1945 as discussed supra. He would submit that
the respondents were well aware of their shortcomings in imposing such a condition and it was well
within their knowledge that the same amounts to an act of overreach. He would then take the Court
through the provisions of Section 22 of the D & C Act, 1940 which deals with the powers of the drug
inspectors. Taking the Court through Rule 22 (1)(a) of the D & C Rules, 1945. He would contend that
the power of the Central
- 34 -
Government to regulate is across the board. He would then take the Court through Rules 51 and 52
of the D & C Rules, 1945 to demonstrate the functions to be performed by the drug inspectors and
which functions are in consonance with the provisions of Section 22 of the D & C Act, 1940.

18. In particular, the learned senior counsel would take the Court through the Full Bench judgment
of the Allahabad High Court headed by Hon'ble Dr. D Y Chandrachud (as he then was) Chief Justice
and would point out the issue framed for consideration by the full bench,. He would take the Court
through the issue framed in para 1 and 2 which reads as under:
"(1) Whether the experience required in the proviso to Rule 49 of the Drugs and
Cosmetics Rules, 1945 is only a bar of authorization to inspect the manufacture of
substances, or is an essential qualification under Rule 49 for direct appointment as
Drug Inspector under Rule 5(4) of the U.P. State Drug Control Gazetted Officers'
Service Rules, 1995.
(2) Whether the Division Bench judgment in State of U.P. v. Zunab Ali has been
correctly decided.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 23
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
2. This reference requires an interpretation of the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
and of Rule 49 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945."
19. Then he would take the Court through paragraphs 5, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 24 and in
- 36 -
particular would point out the reasoning wherein the Full Bench has held:
"Ex facie, clause (iii) of the proviso specifies experience which is gained during the
tenure of service as a Drug Inspector and not before appointment.
... Consequently the experience specified in the first proviso to Rule 49 is not a
condition of eligibility or a qualification for appointment as an Inspector within the
meaning of Rule 49."
20. The learned Senior counsel would close his submissions by contending that the imposition of the
condition of experience being contrary to the legislative scheme of the Central Statute, the same is
required to be quashed. He would contend that the State has attempted to legislate in field
entrenched and occupied by a Central Legislation.
21. Lastly, he would conclude by contending that the tweaking happened only with the intention of
accommodating in-service candidates and that 25 of the
- 37 -
58 candidates in the select list are all candidates who are hailing from the department. That the
change of criteria after the process has started is not only per se illegal, but is implemented to
achieve a predetermined result.
22. That the State lacks competence to legislate with regard to the qualification etc., as the field is
occupied by the Central Legislation and the State is denuded of any power to legislate contra.
Elaborating further he would submit that even otherwise the question of shifting the goal posts after
the game has begun, that too at the last moment, is impermissible and on that short ground also the
additional process that was sought to be introduced at a later stage after the game has begun is
vitiated by illegality. In conclusion he would contend that the respondent-State lacks competency to
legislate and the present case is one of an attempt to encroach a field fully occupied by Central
Legislation.

Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
23. Per contra, the learned Senior counsel Reuben Jacob appearing for the Commission would
contend that the Commission is a constitutional body and is constituted in terms of Article 315 of
the Constitution of India to discharge its constitutional obligations i.e., conducting recruitments in
terms of the Recruitment Rules. He would also take the Court through Articles 320 and 321. He
would contend that it is the job of the Commission merely to ensure that the candidate meets the
eligibility criteria stipulated by the appointing authority. That the alleged tweaking is only for the
purpose pruning the list for the interview and nothing more. That the said exercise came about
pursuant to the meeting of 11.11.2019 whereby the Central Government experts were decided to be
engaged. He would submit that the short-listing was done based on the comments of the Central
Government Experts and he would fairly admit that in the subsequent list, 24 of them are in-service
candidates.
- 39 -
24. Elaborating further, the learned senior counsel would submit that the candidature of the
petitioners has been rejected after verifying the genuineness of the documents. That the candidates
were informed to upload their certificates along with their online applications. That based on such
certificates the Commission permitted them to participate in the written examination. He would
submit that there was no verification of the documents prior to the written examination, and that,
this procedure is followed in respect of notifications where applications are invited online. He would
submit that after the results of the competitive exam were published, a list in the ratio of 1:3 was
required to be prepared and that, it is the basis for inviting the candidates to attend the interview.
That originally the names of the petitioners were found in the eligibility list. Proceeding further he
would submit that after the provisional list of candidates short-listed for interview was published
and document verification was commenced they took the assistance of experts to assess
- 40 -
the experience certificates. In that, the names of 232 short-listed candidates is compiled in
Annexure-R1.
25. He would submit that the names of the petitioners were not found in the second list, as on
verification of the testimonials it was found by the central experts that they were ineligible and
hence a fresh list came to be drawn up and in view of their ineligibility the names of the petitioners
were left out of the list. That the 24 in-service candidates, who were originally not part of the
selected list came to be included in the revised list and that their inclusion was on account of the
opinion rendered by the Experts/Special Committee of the Commission. The learned Senior counsel
would attempt to justify the revision of provisional select list, by contending that the earlier list was
drawn up without entering upon and assessing the testimonials. That the petitioners were issued
call letters without verifying the documents/testimonials and on subsequent verification it was
found that the candidates were ineligible and hence
- 41 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 25
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
the candidates though were invited to attend interview have not been selected. He would contend
that it is a coincidence that amongst the 80 in-service candidates who had applied to the post only
some were found eligible and amongst the short-listed candidates 25 candidates are in- service
candidates. He would contend that the numbers cannot be utilized to paint a different picture and
show the process of verification in poor light. He would submit that all the candidates whose names
have been short-listed have been subjected to scrutiny and opinion of the Assistant Drug Controllers
deputed by the Central Government to assess the experience certificates. He would fairly admit that
introduction of a separate method of evaluation of the testimonials was on the opinion rendered by
the State Government.
26. He would further contend that the applications of nearly 30 in-service candidates have been
rejected as they did not possess experience in the testing and manufacturing of schedule C and C1
drugs. He would
- 42 -
attempt to impress upon the Court to view the same as a measure to filter ineligible candidates.
27. He would contend that the stipulated experience cannot sought to be negatived on the basis of
the nature of duties stipulated under the statute. He would submit that stipulating qualification is in
the domain of the appointing authority that whether it ought to be research and development or
whether it has to be merely testing or whether it has to be manufacturing etc., are questions that
remain beyond the mandate vested in the petitioners. That, prescribing criteria, is not within the
domain of the petitioners and that the drugs controller in his instructions has placed and forwarded
his opinion on the basis of the ruling of the Hon'ble Apex Court and hence the issue is no more res
integra. He would contend that not all candidates who have participated in the interview have been
selected and that the Commission has adopted a very rigorous procedure to ensure the selection of
the best of the challengers from amongst the pool of
- 43 -
candidates vying for appointment to the post of Drug Inspector.

29. The learned AAG and Senior counsel Sri Dhyan Chinnappa representing the State would attempt
to distinguish Rule 49 and would contend that the said rule is inapplicable to the current facts and
circumstances of the case. He would submit that the Doctrine of Occupied Field is wholly
inapplicable to the facts and circumstances obtaining herein. He would then draw the attention of
the Court to the observations of the Full Bench in para 7 of the said judgment of the Allahabad High
Court, noted supra.
- 45 -
He would contend that the Full Bench has opined that the power is exercised under the D & C Rules,
1945 and amendment of the C & R Rules. He would contend that the conditions have been
incorporated by exercising power vested in the State under Article 309 of the Constitution and that
it is no more res-integra that the State has the power to stipulate a higher qualification than the
stipulated qualification as the posts are in the department which come under the State Government
under the rules framed and governing the functions of the department in the State. He would submit
that the questions raised in the instant writ petition are not issues which had fallen for consideration
by the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court. This is apparent on a reading of the paragraph 16 of
the judgment. He would further attempt to distinguish the argument canvassed on behalf of the
petitioner that Rule 49 of the D & C Rules, 1945, is the repository, conferring powers with regard to
legislation and would attempt to debunk the theory of the petitioner that the State Government is
denuded of any authority to legislate
- 46 -
on the said issue. He would contend that the Hon'ble Apex Court has recognized the power of the
State under Article 309 to legislate even in respect of occupied fields. In this regard he would place
reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in Satyapal Reddy's case (supra), a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 27
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
judgment rendered under the Motor Vehicles Act.
30. Further pointing out the provisions of Article 309 he would contend that the same enables the
State to fix a higher qualification over and above the qualification criteria stipulated under the
Central Legislation. That the action of the KPSC is in consonance with the constitutional provision.
That these aspects, more particularly the scope and dimensions of Article 309 and its implications
on the power of the State to legislate were not aspects that were called in question or considered by
the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court.
31. Nextly, the learned AAG elaborating further would contend that question of repugnancy would
not
- 47 -
arise and would place reliance on the ruling rendered in Suman Devi's case reported in (2021) 6 SCC
163 and would take the Court through paragraphs 2, 12, 14 and
30. CASE CANVASSED ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS:
32. The learned Senior counsel Sri Udaya Holla representing the respondent No.4 to
58, would place reliance on the ruling in the case of S.Satyapal Reddy to contend and
canvass the power of the State to prescribe additional qualifications. He would also
place reliance on the ruling in the case of Mahesha A.C. and others vs. State of
Karnataka and others1 wherein, the Co-
ordinate Bench headed by the then Chief Justice, was pleased to uphold the additional
qualifications, prescribed over and above the minimum qualification as valid and in particular,
would take the Court through paragraph No.12 of the said judgment.
ILR 2015 KAR 1
- 48 -
33. Learned Senior counsel would then place reliance on the ruling in the case of State of Uttar
Pradesh and Others vs. Bhupendra Nath Tripathi and Others2 and in particular, would take this
Court through paragraph No.35 to impress on the principle that the State has leeway in law and
right to impose or prescribe additional qualification. Further reliance is placed on the ruling in the
case of Dhananjay Malik and Others vs. State of Uttaranchal and Others3 whereby the Hon'ble Apex
Court has been pleased to analyse and hold that candidates, who have participated in the selection
process and are unsuccessful are estopped from challenging the recruitment process and would take
this Court through paragraph Nos.7, 8 and 10. He would further place reliance on the ruling
rendered in the case of D. Sarojakumari vs. R. Helen Thilakom and Others4 to buttress the above
contention.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN W.P.No.17163/2021.
34. Learned Senior counsel Sri. Sandesh J. Chouta, appearing on behalf of the petitioners would at
the outset submit that the entire exercise is a fiasco and that norms have been changed in
mid-stream, only to achieve a predetermined result and that 25 out of 70 candidates are all
candidates, who were rendering duties with the Department itself. That 20 of them were discharging
duties as Scientific Officers and the remaining 5 are Lab Technicians. He would submit that the
Rule, with regard to estoppel, whereby the law has been evolved estopping unsuccessful candidates
from questing the process is inapplicable to the petitioners and that the petitioners stand on a
different footing all together.
35. He would submit that i) they have challenged the virus of the stipulation, ii) they have submitted
objections even at the time of Notification and applying for the post, (iii) Objections have been filed
to the Notification
- 50 -
even prior to making their application and in this regard, the ruling of the Hon'ble Apex Court
rendered in the case of Forum for People's Collective Efforts (FPCE) and Another vs. State of West
Bengal and Another5 was placed before the Administrative Tribunal, which was not considered.
36. He would contend that the pith and substance of the two acts need to be compared and the
Tribunal was also enlightened about Nidhi Pandey vs. UPSC and Another's6 case. He would further
pose a query as to why preference in testing and manufacture of Schedule C and C1 drugs alone were
insisted upon, when there are Schedule Drugs from Schedules A to Y under the Central Rules. He
would invite the attention of the Court to Annexure-A5 being the objections submitted by the
petitioners as early as on 12.04.2018 under which, they have requested to drop the stipulation
regarding experience. He would then take the Court to Annexure- (2021) 8 SCC 599
- 51 -
A12 being the Minutes of the Meeting of Drugs Technical Advisory Board held on 16.05.2018 and
would point out the resolution passed by the Board on Agenda II wherein, it has been resolved to
recommend the removal of the provisions relating to experience under Rule 49 (i), (ii) and (iii) of D
& C Rules, 1945. He would submit that written examinations were held between 13.12.2018 and
16.12.2018 and about 3000 candidates took the written examination. He would submit that a
similar examination was also conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission and would
take the Court through paragraph No.4 of the Publication, more particularly, 4 (B), which relates to
Educational Qualification and would submit that though experience is imposed as a requisite
qualification, there is no insistence on experience in the Manufacture and Research of Schedule C &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 29
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
C1 Drugs and that the experience that is sought for is one in general analysis of drugs. He would
submit that one more representation was forwarded on 16.09.2019, which came to be replied on
- 52 -
15.10.2019 stating that the representations have been forwarded to the Drugs Controller.
37. Learned Senior counsel would take this Court through Annexure-A8 dated 28.11.2018 to
demonstrate his contention that the Rules of the game have been changed after the game has begun.
He would submit that the Notification inviting the applications was issued on 23.03.2018, while the
decision to have the Experience Certificate verified by the Drugs Controller pursuant to resolution
by the State. He would submit that the Resolution nowhere stipulates possession of experience in
the research and manufacture of Schedule C and C1 drugs alone.
38. He would take the Court through the duties and obligations of the Officers in the Office of the
Drugs Controller, more particularly, would take the Court through that portion of the Manual of the
Drugs Control Department dealing with duties and responsibilities of the scientific officers to
contend that none of the Scientific
- 53 -
Officers i.e., 20 selected Scientific Officers have any duty which involves either Manufacture or
Research on Schedule C and C1 Drugs. With regard to the Laboratory Technician, the duties
assigned under the Manual are assisting the Government Analyst and Section Heads and carryout
such works as is entrusted by higher-ups. He would submit that 5 such Laboratory Technicians have
been shown as selected. That none of them possessed any experience in the field of Manufacture and
Research of Schedule C and C1 Drugs. He would contend even the Certificates only speak of
experience in testing and analyzing, yet 25 of the in-house or in-service candidates have been
selected when they were wholly ineligible. He would contend that one more objection was also
placed before the concerned Health Minister on 25.10.2019 produced as Annexure - K and
objections were also filed on 21.11.2019 and 25.11.2019 but all remained unconsidered and the
efforts were in vain.
- 54 -
39. He would submit that in all, the names of 232 candidates were shortlisted in the ratio of 1:3 and
many of the candidates including the petitioners were called to attend interviews between 21.11.2019
to 27.11.2019. That, between the said dates, 64 candidates including the petitioner were interviewed
and in fact the petitioner received a communication from the Commission that the documents of the
candidates would be scrutinized on 22.11.2019. That thereafter, the Provisional Select List came to
be published on 15.12.2020. Aggrieved, the petitioners approached the Tribunal and the Tribunal
passed the orders rejecting applications on 12.05.2021 and thereafter, the Final List came to be
published on 22.06.2021 and on 24.06.2021, a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court was pleased to grant
a conditional interim order restraining the respondents from issuing any appointment orders.

Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
40. Learned Senior counsel Sri. Sandesh J. Chouta would take the Court through the ambit of the D
& C Act,
- 55 -
1940 and would submit that the Act is enacted in 1940 and consists of a mere 5 chapters.
41. Elaborating on the same, he would point out that Section 12 of Chapter III vests the power of
making rules exclusively in the Central Government. He would contend that Section 21 of Chapter
IV provides for Appointment of Inspectors both by Central Government and State Government but
the same is not an absolute right, but is qualified and appointments can be only in respect of those
possessing the prescribed qualification i.e., qualification prescribed under the Act and Rules. He
would take the Court through sub-section (2) of Section 21 to impress the nature and scope of the
provisions of the Act. That the powers and duties to be exercised are such of those as prescribed
therein. He would further take the Court through Section 33 wherein yet again the power to make
Rules is vested in the Central Government. He would submit that the Rules relate to the effective
implementation of the Act and in particular, Clause (n) of
- 56 -
Section (2) of Section 33 invests the Central Government with the authority to prescribe the power
and duties of Inspector and the qualifications of the authority to which such Inspectors shall be
subordinate and specify the drugs or classes of drugs or cosmetics or classes of cosmetics in relation
to which and the conditions, limitations or restrictions subject to which, such powers and duties
may be exercised or performed. He would contend that even in respect of duties and obligations of
the Inspectors, the Parliament in its wisdom has vested the same with the Central Government only.
He would further take the Court through the provisions of Section 33 (n) where yet again the power
to make rules has been invested in the Central Government. He would then request the Court to
traverse, three provision i.e., Section 12, Section 33 and Section 33
(n) and would submit that all the three are placed in three different Chapters, namely, Section 12 is
placed in Chapter III, which deals with Import of Drugs and Cosmetics and other matters. He would
point out that Section 33 is placed in Chapter IV, which deals with
- 57 -
Manufacture, Sale and Distribution of Drugs and Cosmetics. He would submit that Section 33 (n) is
placed in Chapter IVA, which yet again deals with provision relating to Ayurveda, Sidda and Unani
Drugs etc. He would submit that the Act of the Parliament and the intention of the Parliament to
exclusively vest the rule making power in the Central Government is amply clear by the persistence
of the Parliament in investing the Central Government alone with all the rule making powers.
42. He would contend that the reasons are not far to see. That the Act deals with drugs including life
saving drugs and hence, the same cannot be left to the wishes of the States and uniform standards
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 31
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
are required and if such uniform standards are not maintained, it could result in catastrophic
consequences.
43. He would further take the Court through Section 38 placed in Chapter V of the Act whereunder
the provision mandates that all such rules legislated by
- 58 -
Parliament shall be placed before each house for a total period of 30 days when the houses are in
session. He would submit that this singular provision would by itself be suffice to infer that the field
is completely occupied by the law made by the Parliament with no ground ceded State to manoeuvre
and contended that it has no statutory authority and power to frame Rules.
44. Learned Senior counsel would take the Court through the Preamble of the Act, more
particularly, Section 103 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and would submit that the same is
equivalent to Article 252 of the Constitution of India, to contend that the source of legislative power
is traceable to Part XI. This argument is placed to counter the contention of the State that the power
of the State is traceable to the List and he would clarify that the Lists merely reflect the fields of
legislation and not the source for legislation. He would then take the Court through Section 3 (e) of
the D & C Act, 1940 and would contend that if the same is read in conjunction with
- 59 -
Sections 21 and 33-G of the D & C Act, 1940, the only inescapable conclusion that can be drawn is
that, the statute vests in the State only the limited power of appointing Inspectors. He would
contend that the power to appoint does not include the power to legislate. He would draw the
attention to the phrase "having the prescribed qualifications" employed in Section 21 of the D & C
Act, 1940, to buttress his argument noted supra.
45. Learned Senior counsel would take the Court through Section 33 (1) and 2 (b) to elaborate on the
phrase "prescribed qualification". He would emphasize on the language of sub-section (1) of Section
33 of the D & C Act, 1940. He would contend that the provision mandates a mandatory prior
consultation with the Board i.e., the Board constituted under the Act and a previous publication by
Notification in the Official Gazette for making any Rules for the purpose of giving effect to the
provisions under Chapter IV, which includes the power of making Rules and he would further take
the Court through proviso to sub-
- 60 -
section (1) of Section 33 of the D & C Act, 1940, to contend that the power to dispense with the
consultation is vested only in the Central Government and in the instant case, he would submit that
there has been no such consultation though mandatory. He would contend that the intention behind
pointing out the same, is only to impress upon the Court the dimension of the central statute.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 32
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
46. Learned Senior counsel answering to the reliance of the respondents on the provision i.e., Article
309 of the Constitution, would contend that the same only enables framing of transitory provision
and does not enable the State to legislate contrary to Article 245 of the Constitution. He would
further contend that even the scope of duties cast on the Inspectors under the Act and Rules can be
traced to Rules 45, 49A, 44, 50A, 51 and 52 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, which are all placed
in Part V of the Rules and which clearly go to demonstrate
- 61 -
the intention of the Parliament to vest exclusively the power of rule making in the Central
Government alone.
47. He would then take the Court through Rule 49 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules. Learned
Senior counsel would also take the Court through various Forms attached to Schedule A of the
Rules, and Schedules B to Y, which relates to Scheduled Drugs. He would then take the Court
through Section 3 (i) of D & C Act, 1940, to emphasize and buttress his argument that qualification
etc are to be only such of those qualification as those prescribed under the Act and Rules. The word
'prescribed qualification' is described under 3 (i) to mean 'prescribed by rules made under this Act'.
48. Nextly, he would contend that the Karnataka State Civil Services Act, 1978, does not create a
post or define a post nor does it contain the eligibility or qualification of any post or the powers and
duties associated with the posts. That 1978 Act does not
- 62 -
empower the State Government to legislate Rules contrary to any Central enactment. He would refer
to the Statement and Objects of the enactment wherein, reference is found to the provisions of
Articles 187 (2), 229 (2) and 309 and to List II Entries 3 and 41 of Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution of India. He would further contend that the Act received accent of the President only
on 12.07.1985 and would submit that the most critical provision is Section 3 of the D & C Act, 1940.
He would contend that Regulation cannot mean to include stipulating qualification or eligibilities, in
the teeth of the parent enactment.
49. Elaborating further on Article 309 the learned Senior counsel Sri Sandesh J Chouta would
contend that the usage of the word 'provided' would render Article 309 is transitional in nature and
in this regard he would place reliance on the ruling in the case of A B Krishna and others vs. The
State of Karnataka and others7 and (1998) 3 SCC 495
- 63 -
would place reliance on the observation in paragraphs 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10, in order to buttress his
contention that powers of the State is displaced on the principles of Doctrine of Occupied Field
where the field is covered by Central Legislation and as the services and posts are in connection with
the affairs of the Union and would submit that though the rules entrust the power of making
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 33
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
appointments in the State no other power is ceded muchless any power to legislate any rules or
thereunder impose any stipulations regarding eligibility to be appointed to the post.
50. The learned Senior counsel would proceed further and has attempted to draw and demonstrate
the fine distinction between the scope of Section 3 of the Karnataka State Civil Services Act, 1978
and the Central Act of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. He would submit that a reading of Section 3
would amply clarify its area of operation and the subjects mentioned therein.
- 64 -
51. Nextly, the learned Senior counsel would take the Court through Section 8 which is the rule
making power but he would contend that such power is limited to legislating rules for the purpose of
carrying out the objects of the Act only and it stands clarified on a bare perusal of sub section (1) of
Section 8 of the Act. He would contend that, the respondents have lost sight of this distinction and
have fallen in error, resulting in the impugned action.
52. He would submit that, the public service commission is constituted under Article 315 and has
four core functions and that the discharge of the functions is as per Article 320. He would contend
that the present subordinate legislation is challenged on five grounds - (i) the lack of legislative
competence to enact the subordinate legislation; (ii) violation of fundamental rights especially
Article 14 and 16; (iii) the rule fails to confirm to the statute under which it is made and it exceeds
the limits of authority conferred by the enabling Act; (iv) recruitment rules of 2013 is repugnant to
the preliminary enactment
- 65 -
namely the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940; and (v) the rule is actuated by manifest arbitrariness,
unreasonableness, to the extent it would force this Court to hold that the legislation is without
competence. In support of the five grounds noted supra he would submit as under -
That, the Rule 49 is a creature of the power vested in the Central Government by virtue of Section
33. That, the sole repository regarding qualification and criterion for the post of a drug inspector is
contained in rule 49 only.
53. He would contend that the contention, that the power of the State to legislate and thereby
complement the Union legislation, is highly misplaced and that reliance on Satyapal Reddy's case
(supra) is misplaced. Elaborating further, he would submit that the language and scope of the Motor
Vehicles Act and the language and scope of the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act are
dissimilar.
- 66 -
54. In this regard, he would submit that under the Motor Vehicles Act the statute separately vests
specific rule making power both in the Union Government and the State Government and that it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 34
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
unfortunately not so in the case of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the statute does not vest any
authority in the state except to the very limited extent of making appointments in accordance with
the Act.
55. In his endeavor to demonstrate the said contention, the learned Senior counsel has taken us
through the various provisions of the M.V. Act. He would refer to Section 27 in Chapter II under
which power is vested in the Union and he would then take the Court through Section 28 whereby,
certain powers are vested in the State to make rules. Similarly, he would point out to Section 38 in
chapter III, Sections 64 and 65 in chapter IV, Sections 95 and 96 in chapter 6; Sections 107 and 108
in chapter 6 and Sections 137 and 138 in Chapter VIII; Section 164 ( c) in chapter XI, Section 176 in
chapter XII
- 67 -
and Section 213 in chapter XIV. In that view of the matter, he would contend that the ruling of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in S Satyapal Reddy's case (supra) and the ratio laid down in the said case and
the dictum therein are wholly inapplicable in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.
56. He would submit that unlike the M.V. Act which specifically empowers the state also to legislate,
the Drugs and Cosmetics Act does not cede any such ground to the State legislature and in that view
of the matter, he would submit that the said illustration and comparison drawn above are sufficient
to hold that, regarding stipulating criteria and eligibility conditions, are fields occupied by the
Central legislation and beyond the legislative competence of the State. With regard to the
arbitrariness in the rule he would contend that Rule 49 of the Rules does not incorporate experience
as a qualification and imposition of any such qualification can only be by way of an amendment to
Rule 49 and which amendment would gain
- 68 -
life only after it has been placed before the parliament. Hence, he would contend that the
Recruitment Rule of 2019 is liable to be struck down as the same amounts to colorable exercise of
power.
57. Nextly, the learned senior counsel would take the Court to list 3 of the VII schedule and would
point out that the drugs is included in Entry 19 of the Concurrent list and in this regard, he would
take the Court through Article 254 of the Constitution relating to Repugnancy of laws. Elaborating
further, he would contend that power to legislate can be traceable only to entry No.19, list III which
are merely fields of legislation and do not vest the State with the power to legislate. He would further
contend that the state by insisting to include the additional qualification of experience is creating an
impediment where none exists.
58. He would submit that, class legislation in the guise of stipulating higher qualification or
additional qualification is forbidden. He would further contend that,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 35
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
- 69 -
the additional qualification that is sought to be imposed has no intelligible differentia, as it would
not enable the Drug inspectors appointed by the State to act differently or can they be distinguished
from the Drug Inspectors hailing from other parts of the country. The imposition has no rational or
any relation to the object sought to be achieved. Hence the same does not amount to a reasonable
classification.
59. He would contend that, when Article 14 is the genisis then article 16 is only a specie. He would
contend that the grounds 3, 4 and 5 raised in the writ petition stands substantiated by the ruling of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Tamil Nadu and another vs. P.Krishnamurthy and
others8 where the Hon'ble Apex Court was examining the validity of the Tamil Nadu Mineral
Concession Rules in the light of the MMDR Act and he would place reliance on paragraphs 16, 17, 18
and 20 of the said ruling. He would contend that the Apex Court (2006) 4 SCC 517
- 70 -
has enumerated and settled six criterias; which are as below :-
15. ............
(a) Lack of legislative competence to make the subordinate legislation.
(b) Violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India.
(c) Violation of any provision of the Constitution of India.
(d) Failure to conform to the statute under which it is made or exceeding the limits of
authority conferred by the enabling Act.
(e) Repugnancy to the laws of the land, that is, any enactment.
(f) Manifest arbitrariness/unreasonableness (to an extent where the court might well
say that the legislature never intended to give authority to make such rules).
60. In this regard he would place reliance on Para 21 of the aforesaid ruling, to canvass that one of
the most relevant consideration to test the constitutionality or otherwise of a statute is the objects
and reasons as well as the legislative history of the statute. He would then nextly place reliance on
the ruling in the case of Central Bank of
- 71 -
India vs. The State of Kerala and others9 and would take the Court through Paragraphs 24, 25, 26,
28, 29 and 30 to contend that the resolution for the present impasse is to be found in article 254
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 36
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
which commences with the heading "inconsistency between laws made by parliament and the laws
made by the legislatures of the State. He would nextly place reliance on the ruling reported in the
case of State of Kerala and others vs. Mar Appraem Kuri Company Ltd., and another10 and would
take the Court through paragraphs 44 to 47 wherein the Apex Court has succinctly dealt with the
aspects of occupied fields and repugnance. He would submit that the Doctrine of Occupied Field is
applicable in so far as it relates to List I and II and the Doctrine of Repugnancy applies to the cases
of list III. He would then take the Court through the Full Bench decision in Kuldeep Singh's case. He
would also place reliance on the ruling in the case of Sachin Saggar vs. The State of Punjab and
others11 (paras 4, (2009) 4 SCC 94 (2012) 7 SCC 106 2010 (79) ALR 879
- 72 -
8 and 19) and he would also place reliance on the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Special
Appeal No.804/2010 (paras 4, 6, 11, 12 and 16) and 2014 (ILR) 1 P & H 24 (paras 8, 9 and 10). In
that view, He would contend that the question of Full Bench decision going subsilentio as contended
by the AAG is unsustainable. He would take the Court through the facts and circumstances leading
to the constitution of Full Bench and its consideration in Kuldeep Singh vs. State of U.P. That the
disputes leading to the constitution of the Full Bench and decision by the same in Kuldeep Singh's
case involve identical circumstances and He would take the Court through Para 12 of the said case to
demonstrate the circumstances therein and the circumstances in the present case with both being
on par.
Reply by the learned senior counsel Sri Aditya Sondhi
61. In reply, the learned senior counsel Sri Aditya Sondhi appearing on behalf of the petitioner in
WP
- 73 -
No.10575/2021, would take the Court through the impugned rule and would point out that the
mischief is to be found in the schedule to the recruitment rules enacted on 12.09.2013 wherein the
post of drug inspector is found at Sl.No.8 and in column No.7 relating to minimum qualification the
state has imposed the condition of possessing 18 months experience in the manufacturing or in
testing of schedule C and C1 drugs which is directly in contravention of Rule 49 of the Central Rules.
He would place reliance on the ruling of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M/s Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and Others vs. State of Bihar and others12 and would take the Court through
para 69 and would also place reliance on A B Krishna's case (supra) and would take the Court
through paras 5, 6 7 and 13 and wound contend that, the appropriate legislature, as found in Article
309 is the Union Government and hence He would contend that the impugned recruitment rule
being vitiated by lack of competence and the enactment trenching upon the field of (1983) 4 SCC 45
- 74 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 37
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
legislation of the Union, calls for issuance of Writ of Certiorari and the same requires to be quashed
accordingly.
REASONS AND CONCLUSIONS
62. Having heard the learned Senior counsels and the counsels on record and having given our
anxious consideration to various contentions, at the very outset, we place our attention on the
submissions by learned Senior counsel Sri. Sandesh J. Chouta with regard to the Scheme of the D &
C Act, 1940.
63. Learned Senior counsel has taken this Court through Chapter III, Chapter IV, Chapters IVA and
V, Chapters constituting the D & C, 1940 Enactment. He would take the Court through Sections 12,
21, 33 and 38 of the D & C Act, 1940. These are provisions, which enable the legislation of rules and
a plain reading of the said provisions leaves no doubt in the mind of this Court that the entire rule
making power has been vested in the Parliament alone and no ground is ceded to the State to
- 75 -
legislate. It is not in doubt that the field of operation ceded to the State is only to the extent of
making appointment of Inspectors but it in no way, otherwise reserves any authority in the State to
frame any Rules regarding appointment much less prescribing any criteria or eligibility. The
provisions of Sections 12, 21, 33 of the D & C Act, 1940, leaves no doubt in the mind of the Court that
the field of legislation is wholly occupied by the central legislation and that the State stands denuded
of any authority to legislate with regard to the same.
64. The conclusions drawn by this Court as above, is further fortified by the provisions of Section 38
placed in Chapter V of the D & C Act, which mandates that all Rules framed under the Act are
required to be placed before the Parliament for a total period of 30 days. Respondents and the State
have not been able to overcome or counter this.
65. That apart, the reliance by the State and other respondents on Satyapal Reddy's case as noted
above, is wholly misplaced. The scheme of the Motor Vehicles Act
- 76 -
leaves no scope for any ambiguity or doubt. The provisions of Section 27 in Chapter II, Sections 28
and 38 in Chapter III, Sections 64 and 65 in Chapter IV, Sections 95 and 96 in Chapter VI, Sections
107 and 108 in Chapter VII, Sections 137 and 138 in Chapter VIII, Section 164 (C) in Chapter XI,
Section 176 in Chapter XII, Sections 213 in Chapter XIV of the Motor Vehicles Act, leaves no doubt
in the mind of the Court that the provisions equally empower both the Central and State
Governments to legislate in respect of various fields and aspects covered under this Central
enactment, which is not the case under the D & C Act, 1940. The language employed by the
legislature in framing the provisions, more particularly, provisions noted above with reference to
Rule making power, leaves no doubt in the mind of this Court that Parliament intended to vest the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 38
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
authority, exclusively in the Central Government. In that view of the matter, we have no hesitation
to hold that the field, insofar as it relates to the prescription of any eligibility qualification, is fully
occupied by the central legislation, that is, the D & C Act, 1940.

support of our above conclusion:-

1. The Hon'ble Apex Court has been pleased to observe and hold as under in -Paragraphs 8 and 9 of
A.B. Krishna v. State of Karnataka, (1998) 3 SCC 495 :
8. The Fire Services under the State Government were created and established under
the Fire Force Act, 1964 made by the State Legislature. It was in exercise of the power
conferred under Section 39 of the Act that the State Government made Service Rules
regulating the conditions of the Fire Services.
Since the Fire Services had been specially established under an Act of the legislature and the
- 78 -
Government, in pursuance of the power conferred upon it under that Act, has already made Service
Rules, any amendment in the Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977 would not
affect the special provisions Validly made for the Fire Services. As a matter of fact, under the scheme
of Article 309 of the Constitution, once a legislature intervenes to enact a law regulating the
conditions of service, the power of the Executive, including the President or the Governor, as the
case may be, is totally displaced on the principle of "doctrine of occupied field". If, however, any
matter is not touched by that enactment, it will be competent for the Executive to either issue
executive instructions or to make a rule under Article 309 in respect of that matter.
9. It is no doubt true that the rule-making authority under Article 309 of the Constitution and
Section 39 of the Act is the same, namely, the Government (to be precise, the Governor, under
Article 309 and the Government under Section 39), but the two jurisdictions are different. As has
been seen above, power under Article 309 cannot be exercised by the Governor, if the legislature has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 39
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
already made a law and the field is occupied. In that situation, rules can be made under the law so
made by the legislature and not under Article 309. It has also to be noticed that rules made in
exercise
- 79 -
of the rule-making power given under an Act constitute delegated or subordinate legislation, but the
rules under Article 309 cannot be treated to fall in that category and, therefore, on the principle of
"occupied field", the rules under Article 309 cannot supersede the rules made by the legislature.
2. The Hon'ble Apex Court has been pleased to observe and hold as under in - Paragraphs 28, 30, 32
and 33 of Central Bank of India v. State of Kerala, (2009) 4 SCC 94:
"28. In A.S. Krishna v. State of Madras [AIR 1957 SC 297 : 1957 SCR 399] the
Constitution Bench considered challenge to validity of the Madras Prohibition Act,
1937 on the ground that the same is repugnant to the Evidence Act, 1872 and the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 which were enacted by Parliament. The
Constitution Bench repelled the challenge and held: (AIR p. 303, para
12) "12. The position, then, might thus be summed up: When a law is impugned on
the ground that it is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it, what
has to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation. To do that, one must
have regard to the enactment as a whole, to its objects and to the
- 80 -
scope and effect of its provisions. If on such examination it is found that the legislation is in
substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature, then it must be held to be valid in its entirety,
even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are beyond its competence. It would be
quite an erroneous approach to the question to view such a statute not as an organic whole, but as a
mere collection of sections, then disintegrate it into parts, examine under what heads of legislation
those parts would severally fall, and by that process determine what portions thereof are intra vires,
and what are not. Now, the Madras Prohibition Act is, as already stated, both in form and in
substance, a law relating to intoxicating liquors. The presumptions in Section 4(2) are not
presumptions which are to be raised in the trial of all criminal cases, as are those enacted in the
Evidence Act. They are to be raised only in the trial of offences under Section 4(1) of the Act. They
are therefore purely ancillary to the exercise of the legislative power in respect of Entry 31 in List II.
So also, the provisions relating to search, seizure and arrest in Sections 28 to 32 are only with
reference to offences committed or suspected to have been committed under the Act. They have no
operation generally or to offences which fall outside the Act. Neither the presumptions in Section
4(2) nor the provisions contained in Sections 28 to 32 have
- 81 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 40
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
any operation apart from offences created by the Act, and must, in our opinion, be held to be wholly
ancillary to the legislation under Entry 31 in List II. The Madras Prohibition Act is thus in its
entirety a law within the exclusive competence of the Provincial Legislature, and the question of
repugnancy under Section 107(1) does not arise."
30. While negating challenge to the State legislation, a three-Judge Bench laid down the following
principles [Ed.: As observed in State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd., (2004) 10 SCC 201, pp.
281-82, para 31.] :
"(1) The various entries in the three lists are not 'powers' of legislation but 'fields' of
legislation. The Constitution effects a complete separation of the taxing power of the
Union and of the States under Article 246. There is no overlapping anywhere in the
taxing power and the Constitution gives independent sources of taxation to the Union
and the States. (2) In spite of the fields of legislation having been demarcated, the
question of repugnancy between law made by Parliament and a law made by the State
Legislature may arise only in cases when both the legislations occupy the same field
with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and a direct
conflict is seen. If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on
the one hand and List I and List III on the other, the State
- 82 -
law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the Union law.
(3) Taxation is considered to be a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence. There is a
distinction made between general subjects of legislation and taxation. The general subjects of
legislation are dealt within one group of entries and power of taxation in a separate group. The
power to tax cannot be deduced from a general legislative entry as an ancillary power.
(4) The entries in the lists being merely topics or fields of legislation, they must receive a liberal
construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense. The words
and expressions employed in drafting the entries must be given the widest possible interpretation.
This is because, to quote V. Ramaswami, J., the allocation of the subjects to the lists is not by way of
scientific or logical definition but by way of a mere simplex numeration of broad categories. A power
to legislate as to the principal matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its
expanse the legislations touching incidental and ancillary matters.
(5) Where the legislative competence of the legislature of any State is questioned on the ground that
it encroaches upon the legislative competence of Parliament to enact a law, the question one has to
- 83 -
ask is whether the legislation relates to any of the entries in List I or III. If it does, no further
question need be asked and Parliament's legislative competence must be upheld. Where there are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 41
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
three lists containing a large number of entries, there is bound to be some overlapping among them.
In such a situation the doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to determine as to which
entry does a given piece of legislation relate. Once it is so determined, any incidental trenching on
the field reserved to the other legislature is of no consequence. The court has to look at the
substance of the matter. The doctrine of pith and substance is sometimes expressed in terms of
ascertaining the true character of legislation. The name given by the legislature to the legislation is
immaterial. Regard must be had to the enactment as a whole, to its main objects and to the scope
and effect of its provisions. Incidental and superficial encroachments are to be disregarded.
(6) The doctrine of occupied field applies only when there is a clash between the Union and the State
Lists within an area common to both. There the doctrine of pith and substance is to be applied and if
the impugned legislation substantially falls within the power expressly conferred upon the
legislature which enacted it, an incidental encroaching in the field assigned to another
- 84 -
legislature is to be ignored. While reading the three lists, List I has priority over Lists III and II and
List III has priority over List II. However, still, the predominance of the Union List would not
prevent the State Legislature from dealing with any matter within List II though it may incidentally
affect any item in List I."
32. In State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. [(2004) 10 SCC 201] the majority of the Constitution
Bench recognised the possibility of overlapping of legislations enacted under different entries in
Lists I and II in the Seventh Schedule and observed:
(SCC pp. 213c-214c) "While reading the three lists, List I has priority over Lists III
and II and List III has priority over List II. However, still, the predominance of the
Union List would not prevent the State Legislature from dealing with any matter
within List II though it may incidentally affect any item in List I. In spite of the fields
of legislation having been demarcated, the question of repugnancy between law made
by Parliament and a law made by the State Legislature may arise only in cases when
both the legislations occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters
enumerated in List III and a direct conflict is seen. If there is a repugnancy due to
overlapping found between List II on the one hand
- 85 -
and List I and List III on the other, the State law will be ultra vires and shall have to
give way to the Union law.
... If there is conflict, the correct approach is to find an answer to three questions step
by step as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 42
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
One -- Is it still possible to effect reconciliation between two entries so as to avoid
conflict and overlapping?
Two -- In which entry the impugned legislation falls, by finding out the pith and
substance of the legislation. In this regard the court has to look at the substance of
the matter. The doctrine of pith and substance is sometimes expressed in terms of
ascertaining the true character of legislation. The name given by the legislature to the
legislation is immaterial. Regard must be had to the enactment as a whole, to its main
objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions. Incidental and superficial
encroachments are to be disregarded. Interpretation is the exclusive privilege of the
constitutional courts and the court embarking upon the task of interpretation would
place such meaning on the words as would effectuate the purpose of legislation
avoiding absurdity, unreasonableness, incongruity and conflict. As is with the words
used so is with the language employed in drafting a piece of legislation. That
interpretation would be preferred which would
- 86 -
avoid conflict between two fields of legislation and would rather import homogeneity.
It follows as a corollary of the above said statement that while interpreting tax laws
the courts would be guided by the gist of the legislation instead of by the apparent
meaning of the words used and the language employed. The courts shall have regard
to the object and the scheme of the tax law under consideration and the purpose for
which the cess is levied, collected and intended to be used. The courts shall make
endeavour to search where the impact of the cess falls. The subject-matter of levy is
not to be confused with the method and manner of assessment or realisation.
and Three -- Having determined the field of legislation wherein the impugned
legislation falls by applying the doctrine of pith and substance, can an incidental
trenching upon another field of legislation be ignored? Once it is so determined if the
impugned legislation substantially falls within the power expressly conferred upon
the legislature which enacted it, an incidental encroaching in/trenching on the field
assigned to another legislature is to be ignored."
- 87 -
33. In Govt. of A.P. v. J.B. Educational Society [(2005) 3 SCC 212] the Court was called upon to
decide whether there was any conflict between the provisions of the All India Council for Technical
Education Act, 1987 and the A.P. Education Act, 1982 and whether the State legislation was liable to
be declared void and inoperative on the ground that the State Legislature was not competent to
enact law in the field occupied by the Central legislation."
3. The Hon'ble Apex Court has been pleased to observe and hold as under in - Paragraphs 39, 40, 47,
49, 55 and 56 of State of Kerala and others vs. Mar Appraem Kuri Company Limited, (2012) 7 SCC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 43
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
106:
"39. One more aspect needs to be highlighted. Article 246(1) begins with a non
obstante clause "Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3)". These words
indicate the principle of federal supremacy, namely, in case of inevitable conflict
between the Union and State powers, the Union powers, as enumerated in List I,
shall prevail over the State powers, as enumerated in Lists II and III, and in case of
overlapping between Lists III and II, the former shall prevail. (See Indu Bhushan
Bose v. Rama Sundari Devi [(1969) 2 SCC 289 : (1970) 1 SCR 443] , SCR at p. 454.)"
- 88 -
40. However, the principle of federal supremacy in Article 246(1) cannot be resorted to unless there
is an "irreconcilable" conflict between the entries in the Union and State Lists. The said conflict has
to be a "real" conflict. The non obstante clause in Article 246(1) operates only if reconciliation is
impossible. As stated, the parliamentary legislation has supremacy as provided in Articles 246(1)
and (2). This is of relevance when the field of legislation is in the Concurrent List. The Union and the
State Legislatures have concurrent power with respect to the subjects enumerated in List III. [See
Article 246(2).] Hence, the State Legislature has full power to legislate regarding subjects in the
Concurrent List, subject to Article 254(2) i.e. provided the provisions of the State Act do not come in
conflict with those of the Central Act on the subject. [See Amalgamated Electricity Co. (Belgaum)
Ltd. v. Municipal Committee, Ajmer [AIR 1969 SC 227 :
(1969) 1 SCR 430] .] Thus, the expression "subject to" in clauses (2) and (3) of Article
246 denotes supremacy of Parliament.
47. The question of repugnancy between parliamentary legislation and State legislation arises in two
ways. First, where the legislations, though enacted with respect to matters in their allotted spheres,
overlap and conflict. Second, where the two legislations are with respect to matters in the
Concurrent List and there is a conflict. In both the situations, the parliamentary legislation will
- 89 -
predominate, in the first, by virtue of non obstante clause in Article 246(1); in the second, by reason
of Article 254(1).
49. In clause (1) of Article 254 the significant words used are "provision of a law made by the
legislature of a State", "any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to
enact", "the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the legislature
of such State", and "the law made by the legislature of the State shall, to the extent of repugnancy, be
void". Again, clause (2) of Article 254 speaks of "a law made by the legislature of a State", "an earlier
law made by Parliament", and "the law so made by the legislature of such State". Thus, it is
noticeable that throughout Article 254 the emphasis is on law-making by the respective legislatures.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 44
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
55. There is one more way in which this problem can be approached. Both the courts below have
proceeded on the basis that there are conflicting provisions in the Central Act, 1982 vis-à-vis the
State Act, 1975 (see paras 13, 14 and 15 of the impugned judgment). In our view, the intention of
Parliament was clearly to occupy the entire field falling in Entry 7 of List III. The 1982 Act was
enacted as a Central legislation to "ensure uniformity in the provisions applicable to chit fund
institutions throughout the country as such a
- 90 -
Central legislation would prevent such institutions from taking advantage either of the absence of
any law governing chit funds in a State or exploit the benefit of any lacuna or relaxation in any State
law by extending their activities in such States".
56. The background of the enactment of the (Central) Chit Funds Act, which refers to the report of
the Banking Commission has been exhaustively dealt with in Shriram Chits and Investment (P) Ltd.
v. Union of India [1993 Supp (4) SCC 226] as also in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the
1982 Act. The clear intention of enacting the Central 1982 Act, therefore, was to make the Central
Act a complete code with regard to the business of conducting chit funds and to occupy the
legislative field relating to such chit funds.
4. The Hon'ble Apex Court has been pleased to observe and hold as under in - Paragraph 51 of
Innoventive Industries Ltd. v. ICICI Bank, (2018) 1 SCC 407 :
"51. The case law referred to above, therefore, yields the following propositions:
51.1. Repugnancy under Article 254 arises only if both the Parliamentary (or existing
law) and the State law are referable to List III in the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution of India.
- 91 -
51.2. In order to determine whether the Parliamentary (or existing law) is referable to the
Concurrent List and whether the State law is also referable to the Concurrent List, the doctrine of
pith and substance must be applied in order to find out as to where in pith and substance the
competing statutes as a whole fall. It is only if both fall, as a whole, within the Concurrent List, that
repugnancy can be applied to determine as to whether one particular statute or part thereof has to
give way to the other.
51.3. The question is what is the subject-matter of the statutes in question and not as to which entry
in List III the competing statutes are traceable, as the entries in List III are only fields of legislation;
also, the language of Article 254 speaks of repugnancy not merely of a statute as a whole but also
"any provision"
thereof.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 45
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
51.4. Since there is a presumption in favour of the validity of statutes generally, the
onus of showing that a statute is repugnant to another has to be on the party
attacking its validity. It must not be forgotten that that every effort should be made to
reconcile the competing statutes and construe them both so as to avoid
repugnancy--care should be taken to see whether the two do not really operate in
different fields qua different subject-matters.
51.5. Repugnancy must exist in fact and not depend upon a mere possibility.
- 92 -
51.6. Repugnancy may be direct in the sense that there is inconsistency in the actual
terms of the competing statutes and there is, therefore, a direct conflict between two
or more provisions of the competing statutes. In this sense, the inconsistency must be
clear and direct and be of such a nature as to bring the two Acts or parts thereof into
direct collision with each other, reaching a situation where it is impossible to obey the
one without disobeying the other. This happens when two enactments produce
different legal results when applied to the same facts.
51.7. Though there may be no direct conflict, a State law may be inoperative because
the Parliamentary law is intended to be a complete, exhaustive or exclusive code. In
such a case, the State law is inconsistent and repugnant, even though obedience to
both laws is possible, because so long as the State law is referable to the same
subject-matter as the Parliamentary law to any extent, it must give way. One test of
seeing whether the subject-matter of the Parliamentary law is encroached upon is to
find out whether the Parliamentary statute has adopted a plan or scheme which will
be hindered and/or obstructed by giving effect to the State law. It can then be said
that the State law trenches upon the Parliamentary statute. Negatively put, where
Parliamentary legislation does
- 93 -
not purport to be exhaustive or unqualified, but itself permits or recognises other
laws restricting or qualifying the general provisions made in it, there can be said to be
no repugnancy.
51.8. A conflict may arise when Parliamentary law and State law seek to exercise their
powers over the same subject-matter. This need not be in the form of a direct conflict,
where one says "do" and the other says "don't". Laws under this head are repugnant
even if the rule of conduct prescribed by both laws is identical. The test that has been
applied in such cases is based on the principle on which the rule of implied repeal
rests, namely, that if the subject-matter of the State legislation or part thereof is
identical with that of the Parliamentary legislation, so that they cannot both stand
together, then the State legislation will be said to be repugnant to the Parliamentary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 46
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
legislation. However, if the State legislation or part thereof deals not with the matters
which formed the subject-matter of Parliamentary legislation but with other and
distinct matters though of a cognate and allied nature, there is no repugnancy.
51.9. Repugnant legislation by the State is void only to the extent of the repugnancy.
In other words, only that portion of the State's statute which is found to be repugnant
is to be declared void.
- 94 -
51.10. The only exception to the above is when it is found that a State legislation is
repugnant to Parliamentary legislation or an existing law if the case falls within
Article 254(2), and Presidential assent is received for State legislation, in which case
State legislation prevails over Parliamentary legislation or an existing law within that
State. Here again, the State law must give way to any subsequent Parliamentary law
which adds to, amends, varies or repeals the law made by the Legislature of the State,
by virtue of the operation of Article 254(2) proviso."
5. The Hon'ble Apex Court has been pleased to observe and hold as under in - Paragraphs No.7 and
8 of S. Satyapal Reddy v. Govt. of A.P., (1994) 4 SCC 391 :
7. It is thus settled law that Parliament has exclusive power to make law with respect
to any of the matters enumerated in List I or concurrent power with the State
Legislature in List III of the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution which shall prevail
over the State law made by the State Legislature exercising the power on any of the
entries in List III. If the said law is inconsistent with or incompatible to occupy the
same field, to that
- 95 -
extent the State law stands superseded or becomes void. It is settled law that when Parliament and
the Legislature derive that power under Article 246(2) and the entry in the Concurrent List, whether
prior or later to the law made by the State Legislature, Article 246(2) gives power, to legislate upon
any subject enumerated in the Concurrent List, the law made by Parliament gets paramountcy over
the law made by the State Legislature unless the State law is reserved for consideration of the
President and receives his assent. Whether there is an apparent repugnance or conflict between
Central and State laws occupying the same field and cannot operate harmoniously in each case the
court has to examine whether the provisions occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters
enumerated in the Concurrent List and whether there exists repugnancy between the two laws.
Article 254 lays emphasis on the words "with respect to that matter". Repugnancy arises when both
the laws are fully inconsistent or are absolutely irreconcilable and when it is impossible to obey one
without disobeying the other. The repugnancy would arise when conflicting results are produced
when both the statutes covering the same field are applied to a given set of facts. But the court has to
make every attempt to reconcile the provisions of the apparently conflicting laws and court would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 47
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
- 96 -
endeavour to give harmonious construction. The purpose to determine inconsistency is to ascertain
the intention of Parliament which would be gathered from a consideration of the entire field
occupied by the law. The proper test would be whether effect can be given to the provisions of both
the laws or whether both the laws can stand together. Section 213 itself made the distinction of the
powers exercisable by the State Government and the Central Government in working the provisions
of the Act. It is the State Government that operates the provisions of the Act through its officers.
Therefore, sub-section (1) of Section 213 gives power to the State Government to create Transport
Department and to appoint officers, as it thinks fit. Sub-section (4) thereof also preserves the power.
By necessary implication, it also preserves the power to prescribe higher qualification for
appointment of officers of the State Government to man the Motor Vehicles Department. What was
done by the Central Government was only the prescription of minimum qualifications, leaving the
field open to the State Government concerned to prescribe if it finds necessary, higher
qualifications. The Governor has been given power under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution,
subject to any law made by the State Legislature, to make rules regulating the
- 97 -
recruitment which includes prescription of qualifications for appointment to an office or post under
the State. Since the Transport Department under the Act is constituted by the State Government and
the officers appointed to those posts belong to the State service, while appointing its own officers,
the State Government as a necessary adjunct is entitled to prescribe qualifications for recruitment or
conditions of service. But while so prescribing, the State Government may accept the qualifications
or prescribe higher qualification but in no case prescribe any qualification less than the
qualifications prescribed by the Central Government under sub-section (4) of Section 213 of the Act.
In the latter event, i.e., prescribing lesser qualifications, both the rules cannot operate without
colliding with each other. When the rules made by the Central Government under Section 213(4)
and the statutory rules made under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution are construed
harmoniously, there is no incompatibility or inconsistency in the operation of both the rules to
appoint fit persons to the posts or class of officers of the State Government vis-a-vis the
qualifications prescribed by the Central Government under sub- section (4) of Section 213 of the Act.
- 98 -
8. It is seen that A.P. Transport Subordinate Service Rules have been made by the Governor
exercising the power under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution and Rule 6 thereof prescribes
the qualifications as enumerated above. Graduation in Mechanical Engineering is one of the higher
qualifications than Diploma. Since Section 213(4) gives such power to the State Government by
operation of Section 217 of the Act, the statutory rules remain valid and operate in the field without
colliding with the Central rules. Both the rules would operate harmoniously and effect can be given
to both the rules. Thus the question of inconsistency or repugnancy under Article 254 of the
Constitution does not arise. Therefore, we do not find that there is any conflict in the exercise of
power by both Central and State Governments or inconsistency in operation of the provisions of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 48
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
statutory rules made by the Governor under proviso to Article 309 and the rules made by the Central
Government under Section 213(4) of the Act. The recruitment as per State rules is valid and legal.
67. We have analysed the ambit and scheme of the D and C Act, 1940 in some detail in the preceding
paragraphs 40 to 47 which would demonstrate that the
- 99 -
Central enactment has completely vested the control of the field in the Central Government. The
analysis of the various provisions would demonstrate that in every chapter a provision is made for
framing rules and the power to frame such rules has been vested in the Central Government. In fact,
Rule 49 of the D and C Rules prescribes the qualification and such prescription by Rule 49 is
traceable to Section 3(i) wherein, the word "prescribed" has been defined to mean "as prescribed by
the rules under this Act", thereby leaving no scope for any anomalous thinking. The power to frame
rules as noted above, under every chapter of the Act is vested with the union and if the above is
appreciated in the background of Section 38, which mandates placing of the rules before both
houses for a total period of 30 days, it leaves no doubt in the mind of this Court that the entire field
of rule making is wholly vested in the Central Government and the State Governments are
completely denuded of any power to legislate in this field. As rightly argued by the learned Senior
counsel appearing for the petitioners the
- 100 -
reason for such exclusion is not far to seek. The Act aims at standardisation of the drugs and
cosmetics produced for human consumption and authorises the officers appointed under the Act to
monitor the manufacture of life saving drugs, which in our considered opinion cannot be left to the
whims and fancies of individual State Governments. The only power that has been delegated is, the
power to appoint inspectors. The power to appoint is not absolute, but tempered. The use of the
phrase "having the prescribed qualification" does not enable the State Government to prescribe
qualifications. The provision of Section 3(i) defines the word "prescribed" and Rule 49 stipulates the
qualification and criteria imposed under the rules. Thus making it imperative to read the power of
the State Government to appoint inspectors in conjunction with the provisions of Section 3(i) read
with Rule 49 of the D and C Rules. The definition of the word "prescribed" and the stipulation of the
qualification under Rule 49 and the use of the phrase "having the prescribed qualifications" does not
leave much for imagination. Rule
- 101 -
49 begins with the nomenclature "qualification of inspectors" and the criteria is also detailed therein
i.e., a degree in pharmacy or pharmaceutical science or Medicine with specialisation in Clinical
Pharmacology or microbiology from a university established in India and it nowhere stipulates
possession of experience.

Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
68. That being the position in law and in the light of the law settled by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
cases of A B Krishna and others vs. State of Karnataka and others; Central Bank of India vs. State of
Kerala; State of Kerala vs. Mar Appraem Kuri Company Ltd.;, and Innoventive Industries Ltd., vs.
ICICI Bank & Another (supra) and in the light of the law laid down by the High Court of Delhi in
Nidhi Pandey's case (supra) and in the light of the law laid down by the Full Bench of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court in Krishan Kumar vs. State of Haryana and another13, it leaves no doubt in the
mind of this Court that the power to legislate in respect of Rule 2022 SCC Online P & H 2130
- 102 -
49 is wholly vested in the Central Government under the scheme of the Act and the State
Government stands completely denuded of any authority to legislate over the said field.
69. The scheme of the D and C Act, 1940 is differently tailored than the Motor Vehicles Act. The
stark distinction has been brought out in our discussion supra, more particularly in paragraphs 55
and 56 wherein, the different provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act which separately enable both
the Central Government and the State Government to legislate have been culled out. In fact the
various provisions in the various chapters of the MV Act have been referred to. A comparative
assessment of the provisions of the D and C Act and the MV Act leaves no doubt in our mind that the
enactments are structurally poles apart. If under the D and C Act we find the vesting of the rule
making power in a single entity i.e., the Central Government, the Motor Vehicles Act has on the
other hand has specifically delegated not only the powers under the
- 103 -
Act, but also the rule making power in the State Government. There appears to be equitable
distribution of the power in both the Central and State Government under the MV Act which is not
the case under the D and C Act which vests the rule making power under every chapter of the Act in
the Central Government, but also mandates the tabling of the rooms before both the houses of the
parliament under section 38 of the Act.
70. The discussion above leaves no doubt in the mind of this Court that the legislation by the Central
Government occupies the field and the State Government is denuded of any power to legislate to the
contra. The argument that the qualification is in addition and complements the criteria is of no
avail. Once it is held that the field of legislation is already occupied by a different legislation and the
same having entrenched itself in the field, the State Government is denuded of any authority and
any attempt to trench upon the occupied field would render it ultra vires.
- 104 -
71. In the light of the above discussion and in the light of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex
Court and the various High Courts, as noted supra, we have no hesitation to hold that the field is
fully occupied by the Central legislation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and in particular the field
insofar as it relates to stipulating qualifications is occupied by provisions of Rule 49 read with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107620971/ 50
Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
Section 3(i) and Section 21.
72. It is also relevant to note that the Full Bench of the State of Punjab and Haryana in the case of
Krishan Kumar's case (supra)have been pleased to negate and declare as ultra virus, the rules
framed by the State Government by holding that the same are repugnant to the Act of 1940. The
issue of power of the State to legislate rules has also been negatived by a Full Bench of the High
Court of judicature at Allahabad, which came to be affirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court also in
Kuldeep Singh's case.
- 105 -
73. In the light of our findings and in the light of the judgment of the Full Bench of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court rendered in the case of Krishan Kumar's case with which we are in respectful
agreement, we have not independently examined the issue of repugnancy.
74. Learned Senior counsel Sri. Udaya Holla, has placed reliance on various rulings. Learned Senior
counsel has placed reliance on the ruling of the Co-Ordinate Bench of this Court rendered in
Mahesha's case (supra) wherein, the Co-ordinate Bench headed by the then Chief Justice was
pleased to uphold the additional qualification. In support of this, reliance is again placed on
Satyapal Reddy's case and Mahesha's case (supra) as noted above. This is yet another case where the
coordinate bench was interpreting the provisions of Section 213 of the MV Act. It is pertinent to note
that sub Section (3) enables the State Government to make rules to regulate sub Section (4) also
authorizes the Central Government to stipulate qualifications. In that view the coordinate bench was
- 106 -
pleased to hold that the State is enabled to stipulate a criteria over and above the minimum
qualification prescribed by the Central Government. We have no quarrel with the said preposition
and the said ruling is of no avail in view of this Court holding (supra) that the field is occupied field
and the State is denuded of power to legislate.
75. In Satyapal Reddy's case (supra), the Court has unerringly held and rightly so in view of the
provisions enabling the State Government to also legislate in respect of stipulating the eligibility
criteria etc. which is not the case under the D & C Act, 1940. Mahesha's case (supra) also involved
the recruitment of Motor Vehicle Inspector under the Motor Vehicles Act and Section 213 (4) of the
Motor Vehicles Act was examined by the Bench and it has been held that in view of the Section 213
(4) of the Motor Vehicles Act, the State has no power to prescribe the qualification less than the
qualification prescribed by the Central Government. In other words, the Division Bench
- 107 -
has upheld the qualification, which is permissible under the Motor Vehicles Act as noted supra.

Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
76. Now, we address the other limb of the argument canvassed on behalf of the private respondents
that the petitioners having participated in the selection process are estopped from questioning the
legality of the process.
77. In support of this contention, reliance is placed on the rulings rendered in Dhananjay Malik's
case (supra) and D. Sarojakumari's case (supra). In our considered opinion the case of the
petitioners stands on a different footing. The cited authorities would not come to the aid of the
petitioners. In Dhananjay Malik's case (supra) the Hon'ble Apex Court taking note of the fact that
the non-selected candidates had participated in the process without any demur or protest and after
the process having gone against them, were estopped from questioning the stipulated criteria or the
process of selection. The fact remains that immediately on
- 108 -
Notification and even prior to filing of the applications, some of the petitioners have filed their
objections, copies of which have been produced as Annexures - A5 and A6 in W.P.No.17163/2021.
The Hon'ble Apex Court while negating the case canvassed by the appellants has in para 10 placed
reliance on Marripatti Nagaraja vs. Government of A.P. and the said paragraph is extracted
hereunder -
"10. In a recent judgment in Marripati Nagaraja v. Govt. of A.P., SCR at p. 516, this
Court has succinctly held that the appellants had appeared at the examination
without any demur. They did not question the validity of fixing the said date before
the appropriate authority. They are, therefore, estopped and precluded from
questioning the selection process.
78. The reliance on the ruling rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in D
Sarojakumari's case (supra) is of no avail to the respondents. The Hon'ble Apex Court
after taking note of its various rulings has observed and held in para 11 as under:
11. As far as the present case is concerned, an advertisement was issued by Respondent 6 inviting
applications for the post of Music Teacher in Samuel
- 109 -
LMS High School. Respondent 1 did not raise any objection at that stage that the post could not be
filled in by direct recruitment and she should be considered for promotion. Not only that, she in
fact, applied for the post and took part in the selection process. After having taken part in the
selection process and being found lower in merit to the appellant, she cannot at this stage be
permitted to turn around and claim that the post could not be filled in by direct recruitment. The
reasoning of the learned Single Judge in rejecting the objection is not in consonance with the law
laid down by this Court. In view of this, we need not go into the other issues raised."

Harsha N vs The Karnataka Public Service ... on 31 March, 2023
79. In the case on hand it is not a case where the petitioner had participated in the process without
any demur. It is pertinent to note that objections have been raised immediately on publication of the
Notification and more particularly with reference to the imposition of the experience criteria.
80. A bare perusal of the objections would clearly demonstrate that the petitioners have objected to
the stipulation of experience in the initial stage itself. Lastly, the contention of malafides or tweaking
of the eligibility
- 110 -
criteria in order to favour in-house candidates cannot be brushed aside lightly. It is seen that after
the process of verification and interview had commenced, the respondents have deemed it necessary
to alter the method of evaluation and invitation to officers of the Central Government to evaluate the
testimonials is nothing but a mere ruse to cover up their tracks for altering the rules of the game,
after the game has begun. In this regard this Court places reliance on the ruling rendered in the case
of K Manjushree vs. State of Andhra Pradesh and another14 and reliance is placed on the
observations in para 24, 26 and 27.
81. As rightly contended, the Certificates issued to the candidates, who were already in employment
of the Department, are stereotyped. That apart, as rightly contended by learned counsel for the
petitioners, the duties and responsibilities do not appear to give any opportunity to the in-house
candidates to carryout any (2008) 3 SCC 512
- 111 -
research or be associated with any manufacturing process as was touted as a necessary qualification.
82. For the discussions and reasons herein above, we pass the following:-
