COMMON ORDER
The petitioner in W.P.No.6829 of 2021 has challenged the impugned assessment order in DIN
No.ITBA/AST/S/143(3)/2020-21/1030898123(1), dated 23.02.2021. The petitioner in W.P.No.7155
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96322573/ 2
Aa.226 vs The Additional/Joint/Deputy/ on 14 December, 2021
of 2021 has challenged the impugned assessment order in DIN No.ITBA/AST/S/143(3)/2020-
21/1030727983(1), dated 17.02.2021.
2.The petitioners have challenged the impugned assessment orders. The issue before the respondent
while passing the aforesaid orders was whether the petitioners were entitled to benefit of deduction
under Section 80P falling under Chapter VI-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The respondent denied
the benefit of deduction under Section 80P of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.6829 & 7155 of 2021
3.It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioners are Agricultural Co-operative Credit Societies
and that the main business is to lend money to the members of the societies and that the excess
income earned by the petitioners are invested in the Fixed Deposit before the Co-operative Banks,
which entitled the petitioners to get income on the Fixed Deposits made in the Co-operative banks.
It is the specific case of the petitioners that the issue had attained finality before this Court and that
there is no basis on which the impugned order could have been passed. The learned counsel for the
petitioners further submits that the issue is now covered by the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Mavilayi Service Co-operative Bank Ltd., vs. Commissioner of Income Tax,
Calicut reported in [2021] 123 taxmann.com 161 (SC). In this connection, reference was made to
Paragraph 45 of the order which reads as under:
“45. To sum up, therefore, the ratio decidendi of Citizen Cooperative Society Ltd.
(supra), must be given effect to. Section 80P of the IT Act, being a benevolent
provision enacted by Parliament to encourage and promote the credit of the
co-operative sector in general must be read liberally and reasonably, and if there is
ambiguity, in favour of the assessee. A deduction that is given without any reference
to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.6829 & 7155 of 2021 any restriction or
limitation cannot be restricted or limited by implication, as is sought to be done by
the Revenue in the present case by adding the word “agriculture” into Section
80P(2)(a)(i) when it is not there. Further, section 80P(4) is to be read as a proviso,
which proviso now specifically excludes co-operative banks which are co-operative
societies engaged in banking business i.e. engaged in lending money to members of
the public, which have a licence in this behalf from the RBI. Judged by this
touchstone, it is clear that the impugned Full Bench judgment is wholly incorrect in
its reading of Citizen Cooperative Society Ltd. (supra). Clearly, therefore, once section
80P(4) is out of harm’s way, all the assessees in the present case are entitled to the
benefit of the deduction contained in section 80P(2)(a)(i), notwithstanding that they
may also be giving loans to their members which are not related to agriculture. Also,
in case it is found that there are instances of loans being given to non-members,
profits attributable to such loans obviously cannot be deducted.”
4.Opposing the prayer, the learned Junior Standing Counsel for the respondent would submit that
though the issue has attained finality before this Court in TCA.No.882 of 2018, dated 16.12.2018 and
the Income Tax Department has preferred an Appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96322573/ 3
Aa.226 vs The Additional/Joint/Deputy/ on 14 December, 2021
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.6829 & 7155 of 2021 S.L.A.(C).No.17745 of 2019,
however later withdrew the same on account of the monetary policy and that the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has left the issue open. The learned Junior Standing Counsel would further submit that the
issue is still open and the petitioners should work out the remedy before the Appellate
Commissioner against the impugned orders, as the appellate remedy is more efficacious.
5.It is further submitted that even as per the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court cited by the
learned counsel for the petitioner reported in Mavilayi Service Co-operative Bank Ltd., vs.
Commissioner of Income Tax, Calicut, the burden of proof is on the petitioners. In this connection,
reference was made to Paragraphs 32 and 39 of the order which reads as under:
“32. Fifthly, as has been held in Udaipur Sahkari Upbhokta Thok Bhandar Ltd. v. CIT
(2009) 8 SCC 393 at paragraph 23, the burden is on the assessee to show, by
adducing facts, that it is entitled to claim the deduction under Section 80P.
Therefore, the assessing officer under the IT Act cannot be said to be going behind
any registration certificate when he engages in a fact- finding enquiry as to whether
the co-operative society https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.6829 & 7155 of
2021 concerned is in fact providing credit facilities to its members. Such fact finding
enquiry (see section 133(6) of the IT Act) would entail examining all relevant facts of
the co-operative society in question to find out whether it is, as a matter of fact,
providing credit facilities to its members, whatever be its nomenclature. Once this
task is fulfilled by the assessee, by placing reliance on such facts as would show that it
is engaged in providing cre dit facilities to its members, the assessing officer must
then scrutinize the same, and arrive at a conclusion as to whether this is, in fact, so.”
“39. The above material would clearly indicate that the limited object of section
80P(4) is to exclude co-operative banks that function at par with other commercial
banks i.e. which lend money to members of the public. Thus, if the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 is now to be seen, what is clear from section 3 read with section
56 is that a primary co-operative bank cannot be a primary agricultural credit society,
as such co-operative bank must be engaged in the business of banking as defined by
section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, which means the accepting, for the
purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public. Likewise,
under section 22(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as applicable to
co-operative societies, no co-operative society shall carry on banking business in
India, unless it is a co- operative bank and holds a licence issued in that behalf by the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.6829 & 7155 of 2021 RBI. As opposed to
this, a primary agricultural credit society is a co-operative society, the primary object
of which is to provide financial accommodation to its members for agricultural
purposes or for purposes connected with agricultural activities.”
6.I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners and the
learned Junior Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent.

Aa.226 vs The Additional/Joint/Deputy/ on 14 December, 2021
7.The issue as on date, on merits appears to be covered by the two decisions of the Division Bench of
this Court and is binding on this Court. Even though the Hon'ble Supreme Court has left the issue
open to be decided at the future point of time, the respondents cannot deviate and pass any orders.
Be that as it may, the issue as to whether the petitioner is entitled to benefit of deduction under
Section 80P of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is concerned, the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
which is relied by both the petitioners as well as the respondent has to be properly adjudicated
which has not be considered while passing the impugned orders.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.6829 & 7155 of 2021
8.Therefore, the cases are remitted back to the respondent to pass appropriate orders on merits and
in accordance with law, within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. If
required the petitioners may be given the benefit of personal hearing through video conferencing, if
the petitioners so desires.
9.These Writ Petitions stand disposed of with the above observations. No costs. Consequently
connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
