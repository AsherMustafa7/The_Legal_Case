Mr. A. Pradhan, ASC
CORAM: JUSTICE V. NARASINGH
ORDER
02.02.2024 Order No.
06. 1. Heard learned counsel for the Petitioner and learned counsel for the State.
2. The Petitioner is an accused in connection with T.R. Case No.28 of 2021 pending on the file of
learned Addl. Sessions Judge- cum-Special Judge under NDPS Act, Khurda, arising out of STF P.S.
No.15 of 2021 for commission of offence alleged under Sections 21(c)/29 of the NDPS Act.
3. Learned counsel, on instruction, submits that except the present BLAPL, no other bail application
of the Petitioner relating to the aforementioned P.S. case is pending in any other Court.
4. Being aggrieved by the rejection of his application for bail U/s.439 Cr.P.C. by the learned Spl.

7. It is submitted by the learned counsel that the Petitioner is in custody since 24.04.2021 and final
charge sheet has been filed on 14.08.2023. Hence, his further continuance in custody is not
warranted. Further submission of the learned counsel is that the antecedent being of the year 2005
i.e. Jaleswar P.S. Case No.165 of 2005 U/s.379/34 of IPC, that ought not to deter this Court from
granting bail to the Petitioner.
8. Learned counsel for the State opposes the prayer for bail in view of the bar contained in Section
37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act and in view of earlier rejection of Petitioner's application by judgment
dated 05.01.2023 adverted to herein above since according to him there is no change in
circumstance.
9. And, it is urged with vehemence by learned counsel for the State, Mr. Pradhan that long
incarceration cannot be a ground for release in all cases and it is also submitted that in view of the
language of Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act antecedent of any nature has to be taken into
account while considering the bail application of an accused under the Special Act. And, in view of
Petitioner's antecedent submits that the present BLAPL is liable to be rejected.
10. The present Petitioner is seeking release, inter alia, on the ground of long incarceration and that
there is no chance of early trial and to fortify his submission, a catena of judgments have been relied
upon at Annexure-7.
10.A. The judgments of the Apex Court relied upon by the learned counsel for the Petitioner are as
under;
(i) Jinofer Kawasji Bhujwala vs. State of Gujarat reported in (2020) 6 SCC 298 The case was under
the Penal Code and one of the reasons for Apex Court to interfere is that the trial did not commence
within the period of six months in terms of the earlier direction of the High Court of Gujarat dated
09.12.2019 and by the time the Apex Court considered the matter nine months has elapsed from the
date of filing of the charge sheet.
(ii) Arnab Ranjan Goswami vs. Union of India and others reported in (2020) 14 SCC 12 The
accusation related to the offences under the Penal Code.
(iii) Jahir Hak vs. State of Rajasthan reported in 2022 SCC OnLine SC 441 The said case dealt with
an offence under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.
Paragraph-19 thereof as quoted from the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Union of India v.
K.A. Najeeb reported in (2021) 3 SCC 713 is extracted hereunder;
"19.Yet another reason which persuades us to enlarge the respondent on bail is that
Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA is comparatively less stringent than Section 37 of the
NDPS Act. Unlike the NDPS Act where the competent court needs to be satisfied that
prima facie the accused is not guilty and that he is unlikely to commit another offence
while on bail; there is no such precondition under UAPA. Instead, Section 43-D(5) of

the UAPA merely provides another possible ground for the competent court to refuse
bail, in addition to the well-settled considerations like gravity of the offence,
possibility of tampering with evidence, influencing the witnesses or chance of the
accused evading the trial by absconsion, etc. (Emphasised)
(iv) Nitish Adhikary @ Bapan vs. State of West Bengal reported in 2022 SCC OnLine
SC 2068 It is a case under the NDPS Act but while releasing the Petitioner, it was
noted that the Petitioner does not have any criminal antecedent (unlike the present
Case).
(v) Rabi Prakash vs. The State of Odisha reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1109 In
this Case, the Apex Court released the Petitioner on bail taking into account that the
Petitioner therein did not have any criminal antecedent, unlike the case at hand.
10.B. The Petitioner also relied on the orders of the Patna High Court in the case of Vijay Krishna
and others vs. State of Bihar reported in 2022 SCC OnLine Pat 1161 in which the allegation was
under the Penal Code and the order of Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in
CRM-M-1814-22 (O&M) dated 04.11.2022 is clearly distinguishable on facts since the contraband
involved therein was "Etizolam" which the Court held to be an anti anxiety medicine. Hence taking
note of the same, the accused was granted bail.
10.C. On a bare perusal of the judgments referred to herein above, it is manifestly clear that the
same have no application in the factual matrix of the case at hand.
10.D. Petitioner while annexing the judgments at annexure-7 has chosen not to give the complete
judgment of the Apex Court in the case Arnab Ranjan Goswami vs. Union of India (supra) and of
Patna High Court in the case of Vijay Krishna (supra).
This Court deprecates such practice.
11. This Court by judgment dated 05.01.2023 rejected the bail application of the Petitioner in BLAPL
No.7354 of 2022 and this Court does not find any change in circumstance to entertain the present
bail application.
12. It is apt to note here that in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Kajad reported in (2001) 7
SCC 673 law has been laid down that grant of bail under the NDPS Act is an exception to the general
rule. The relevant extract of the said judgment is culled out hereunder;
"The purpose for which the Act was enacted and the menace of drug trafficking which
intends to curtail is evident from its scheme. A perusal of Section 37 of the Act leaves
no doubt in the mind of the court that a person accused of an offence, punishable for
a term of imprisonment of five years or more, shall generally be not released on bail.
Negation of bail is the rule and its grant an exception under sub clause (ii) of clause
(b) of Section 37(1)......"

(Emphasized)
13. Long incarceration as a ground for release cannot have universal application bereft of the factual
matrix of each case and oblivious of societal impact.
13.A. In this context it is apt to refer to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Rajesh Ranjan
Yadav Alias Pappu Yadav vrs. CBI through its director reported in (2007) 1 SCC 70. It is apposite to
state that in the said case, the allegation was under the Penal Code where the fetters as in Section
37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act were not attracted.
13.B. Paragraphs-15 and 16 of the said judgment which has a bearing on the point at issue is
extracted hereunder;
"15. Learned counsel for the appellant has repeatedly referred to Article 21 of the
Constitution and on that basis has submitted that the appellant should be released on
bail particularly, since he has already been imprisoned for more than six years.
16. We are of the opinion that while it is true that Article 21 is of great importance
because it enshrines the fundamental right to individual liberty, but at the same time
a balance has to be struck between the right to individual liberty and the interest of
society. No right can be absolute, and reasonable restrictions can be placed on them.
While it is true that one of the considerations in deciding whether to grant bail to an
accused or not is whether he has been in jail for a long time, the court has also to take
into consideration other facts and circumstances, such as the interest of the society."
14. On a conspectus of materials vis-Ã -vis the accusation relating to the Petitioner, this Court is not
inclined to entertain the bail application at this stage.
15. Accordingly, the BLAPL stands disposed of.
16. It is needless to state that the observations herein are only for the purpose of consideration of
this BLAPL and ought not to be construed as this Court expressing any view regarding the
complicity of the Petitioner which has to be adjudicated in the impending trial.
17. Learned Court in seisin is requested to expedite the trial.
