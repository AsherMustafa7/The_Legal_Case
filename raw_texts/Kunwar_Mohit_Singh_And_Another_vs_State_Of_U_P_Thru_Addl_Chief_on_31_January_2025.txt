3. Taking note of the prayer sought in the amendment application, which is innocuous in nature and
would not change the nature of the proceedings in issue, the application seeking amendment in the
prayer of the instant application is hereby allowed.
4. Learned counsel for the applicants is permitted to carry out necessary amendment in the prayer
clause of this application during the course of the day.
5. Heard Sri Sudeep Seth, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Sri Avinash Singh Vishen, Advocate,
Sri Shishir Raj, Advocate, Sri Nishant Pandey, Advocate, Sri Vedant Srivastava, Advocate, Sri Nikhil
Mishra, Advocate & Sri Ravindra Yadav, Advocate, learned counsel for the applicants; Sri Badrul
Hasan, learned AGA-I for the State of U.P.; Sri Vivek Raj Singh, learned Senior Advocate assisted by
Sri Sudhanshu Shekhar Tripathi, Advocate, who has filed Vakalatnama alongwith Ms. Ritwika
Tripathi, Advocate, Sri Raghav Bansal, Advocate & Sri Utkarsh Singh, Advocate, on behalf of the
opposite party No. 2/Kunwar Raj Singh in the Court today, which is taken on record, as well as
perused the record.
6. By means of the instant application, the applicants have sought the following main reliefs:-
"(i) QUASH the impugned order dated 23.12.2024 by means of which the Ld. Trial
Court has issued Bailable Warrants to the Applicants without recording the
satisfaction of the effective service of summons and that the applicants have willfully
escaped the summons.
(ii) QUASH the impugned cognizance and summoning order issued by the Ld. Trial
Court dated 04.01.2024. The impugned cognizance and summoning order dated
04.01.2024 is highly mechanical and has been passed by the Ld. Magistrate without
considering the order passed by this Hon'ble Court in FAFO No. 105 of 2006 dated
31.01.2007. The aforesaid order has been passed without application of mind and has
been passed in a set proforma without any appreciation of the merits of the matter.
(iii) QUASH the impugned Chargesheet dated 07.12.2023 prepared by the Police in
Case Crime No. 488 of 2023 u/s 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 of IPC at PS Bhadokhar,
District- Raebareli. The aforesaid Chargesheet has been filed in an utmost
mechanical and casual manner without ascertaining the true facts and circumstances
of the case. Furthermore, the Investigating Officer has filed the chargesheet in an
utmost arbitrary manner as the applicants have been chargesheeted even after there
is a specific finding as to the invalidity of the will dated 25.11.1994 by this Hon'ble
Court in FAFO No. 105 of 2006 dated 31.01.2007. It is also trite to mention here that
the aforesaid order was in specific knowledge of the Investigating Officer and he has
made it a part of the Chargesheet.
(iv) QUASH the entire criminal proceedings arising out of Case Crime No. 488 of
2023 u/s 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 of IPC at PS Bhadokhar, District- Raebareli."

applicant No. 2 was born out of wedlock of Madhu and Kunwar Brijendra Singh.
(v) The copy of Pariwar Register annexed at page No. 276 of the paper book indicates
that the applicant Nos. 1 and 2 were born out of wedlock of Madhu and Kunwar
Brijendra Singh.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169362869/ 3
Kunwar Mohit Singh And Another vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 31 January, 2025
Gram- Monai, Tehsil- Sadar, District- Raebareli and got their names mutated in the
revenue records related to the said piece of land, which initially was recorded in the
name of one Sardar Shamsher Singh. The order favourable to the applicants in
mutation proceedings was passed on 02.02.2021.
(xi) Sardar Shamsher Singh was the original recorded tenure holder (Taluqedar) of
the land in issue and he executed two 'Wills'. The first registered 'Will' was executed
on 26.06.1991. The second unregistered 'Will' was executed on 25.11.1994.
(xii) It would be apt to indicate here that as per the expert report given by the
Forensic Science Laboratory, Mahanagar, Lucknow, the 'Will' executed by Sardar
Shamsher Singh in the year 1994 was also a genuine 'Will'. In other words, the
registered 'Will' dated 26.06.1991 and unregistered 'Will' dated 25.11.1994 both were
executed by Sardar Shamsher Singh.
(xiii) It would also be apt to indicate here that Sardar Shamsher Singh died leaving
behind his son namely Kunwar Brijendra Singh and his daughters namely Inderjeet
Kaur & Daljeet Kaur.
(xiv) From the registered 'Will' dated 26.06.1991 of Sardar Shamsher Singh, it is
apparent that Madhu was married to Kunwar Brijendra Singh and according to this
'Will', the rights provided by Sardar Shamsher Singh to his son Kunwar Brijendra
Singh would be available to male issues of Kunwar Brijendra Singh from Madhu.
(xv) Gata No. 66, detailed above, was not made part of both the 'Wills' i.e. registered
'Will' dated 26.06.1991 and unregistered 'Will' dated 25.11.1994.
(xvi) The applicants are claiming their rights over the property/land in issue i.e. Gata
No. 66 M alleging themselves to be the sons of Kunwar Brijendra Singh and being in
line of succession as per Section 108 of U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 (in short "Code of
2006").
(xvii) The informant/opposite party No. 2/Kunwar Raj Singh and other persons
similarly situated to him are claiming their rights on the basis of rights provided to
them in the 'Will' dated 25.11.1994 executed by Sardar Shamsher Singh.
(xviii) Upon coming to know about the order passed in mutation proceedings based
upon the law of succession, the opposite party No. 2/Kunwar Raj Singh made a
written complaint and based upon the same, an FIR No. 0488/2023 was lodged on
09.10.2023, under Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 IPC, Police Station- Bhadokhar,
District- Raebareli. The contents of FIR, being relevant, are extracted hereunder:-

(xix) From a bare reading of the above quoted FIR, it is apparent that the allegations against the
applicants, in nutshell, are to the effect that they obtained their birth certificates, wherein the name
of Kunwar Brijendra Singh is shown as their father, from Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, by playing fraud
so as to get certain benefits based upon the law of succession in relation to the property of late
Sardar Shamsher Singh, father of Kunwar Brijendra Singh, and to establish the allegations levelled
in the FIR, the documents which have been referred above annexed as Annexure Nos. SA-1 & SA-2
to the supplementary affidavit have been relied upon.
(xx) Before proceedings further, it would also be relevant/necessary to indicate here certain facts
related to the instant case, as appear from the record, which are as under:-
(a) On coming to know about the heirship/succession certificate dated 12.10.1995
issued from the Office of District Magistrate, Lucknow in favour of Madhu, mother of
the applicants, a complaint was made by Smt. Narendra Kumari claiming herself to
be the wife of Late Kunwar Brijendra Singh, which was entertained, and after
enquiry, it was found that succession/heirship certificate dated 12.10.1995,
favourable to Madhu, was not issued from the Office of District Magistrate- Lucknow
and thereafter, succession/heirship certificate was issued to Smt. Narendra Kumari,
as appears from Annexure Nos. SCA-1 and SCA-2 of the short counter affidavit filed
on behalf of the opposite party No. 2.
(b) As per the applicants, Smt. Narendra Kumari was/is not the wife of Kunwar
Brijendra Singh. It is for the reason that registered 'Will' dated 26.06.1991 indicates
that Madhu is the wife of Kunwar Brijendra Singh.
(c) Kunwar Jaini Singh in relation to property belonging to Sardar Shamsher Singh
i.e. Plot No. 99/11 area 9 Bigha, 2 Biswa, 16 Biswanshi and 8 Kachwanshi situated at
9 Bulter Road, Lucknow filed a Regular Suit No. 928 of 2005, in which, the trial court
i.e. Civil Judge (Senior Division), Lucknow vide order dated 18.01.2006 rejected the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169362869/ 6
Kunwar Mohit Singh And Another vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 31 January, 2025
prayer to grant temporary injunction.
(d) Being aggrieved by the aforesaid, Kunwar Jaini Singh filed FAFO No. 105 of 2006
before this Court impleading M/s Viraj Constructions Pvt. Ltd. and M/s S. Gupta
Build Tech. Ltd., the applicants and Special Nazool Officer as respondents. This
Court vide a detailed order dated 31.01.2007 dismissed the said appeal and affirmed
the order dated 18.01.2006 passed by trial court. The Regular Suit No. 928 of 2005 is
still pending.
(e) Without dwelling into other facts of the case, it would be appropriate to indicate
that in relation to the rights over the property of Sardar Shamsher Singh, civil and
criminal litigations were instituted. Amongst the civil cases, some have been decided
and some are pending, as would appear from paragraph 36 of the instant application,
which is extracted hereunder:-

(xxii) From a bare reading of above quoted charge sheet, this Court finds that the IO has filed the
charge sheet under Sections 419, 420 IPC without collecting the evidence related to the allegations
levelled in the FIR, as per which, the applicants by playing fraud, obtained birth certificates from
Nagar Nigam, Lucknow to get certain benefits on the basis of law of succession. For the purposes of
filing the charge sheet, the IO observed that the applicants did not produce the 'Will' dated
25.11.1994, referred as 'l`ftr olh;r' in the charge sheet, executed by Sardar Shamsher Singh and
concealing this document, they got their names recorded in the revenue records.
8. In the aforesaid background of the case, the instant application has been filed before this Court.
9. Sri Sudeep Seth, learned Senior Advocate, for the purposes of seeking reliefs sought in this
application, in nutshell, submitted that to a purely civil dispute, criminal colour has been given by
the side opposite and also that there is no evidence available with the prosecution so as to prove the
complicity of the applicants in the offences as indicated under Sections 419 and 420 IPC.
10. On the contrary, Sri Vivek Raj Singh, learned Senior Advocate, in nutshell, submitted that in fact
the applicants are not the sons of Kunwar Brijendra Singh rather one is the son of 'Kunwar Brijesh'
and another is the son of 'dst+h flag' and as such, the birth certificates of the applicants are the
forged documents and being so and also that during the mutation proceedings related to Gata No.
66 M, the applicants intentionally did not place on record the subsequent 'Will' dated 25.11.1994,
which would prevail, and also did not disclose themselves as legal heir of Sardar Shamsher Singh,
the offence against the applicants is made out.
11. Considered the aforesaid and perused the record.
12. Upon due consideration of the aforesaid facts of the case, this Court finds that indulgence of this
Court is required in the matter. It is for the following fact(s)/reason(s):-
(i) Indisputedly, Madhu is the mother of the applicants.
(ii) The parties are claiming their rights over the property of Late Sardar Shamsher
Singh and in the registered 'Will' dated 26.06.1991 of Sardar Shamsher Singh,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169362869/ 10
Kunwar Mohit Singh And Another vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 31 January, 2025
genuineness of which is not in dispute, Smt. Madhu has been recognized as the wife
of Kunwar Brijendra Singh.
(iii) Sardar Shamsher Singh died leaving behind his son namely Kunwar Brijendra
Singh and his daughters namely Inderjeet Kaur & Daljeet Kaur.
(iv) At the time of issuance of birth certificates in issue, the applicant No. 1 was about
14 years old and applicant No. 2 was about 12 years old and accordingly, it cannot be
inferred that the applicants were instrumental in getting/obtaining the birth
certificates in issue.
(vi) According to Section 108 of the Code of 2006, the applicants being male lineal
descendants in the male line of descent would get the rights over the Gata No. 66 M,
which is not covered under the 'Wills' aforesaid, if not proved otherwise in civil
proceedings. Accordingly, in not placing the 'Wills' by the applicants in mutation
proceedings would not attract the offence under Section 420 IPC. In this regard,
observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court made in the following judgments have been
taken note of.
(a) Anil Kumar Bose v. State of Bihar, (1974) 4 SCC 616.
(b) Mohd. Ibrahim v. State of Bihar, (2009) 8 SCC 751.
(c) Samir Sahay v. State of U.P., (2018) 14 SCC 233.
(d) R.K. Vijayasarathy v. Sudha Seetharam, (2019) 16 SCC 739.
(e) Deepak Gaba v. State of U.P., (2023) 3 SCC 423.
(f) Vipin Sahni v. CBI, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 511.
(g) Ramandeep Singh v. State of U.P., 2024 SCC OnLine All 7500.
(h) Jit Vinayak Arolkar v. State of Goa, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 31.
(v) As per the allegations levelled in the FIR, the applicants obtained their birth
certificates from Nagar Nigam by playing fraud indicting therein the name of Kunwar
Brijenra Singh as their father to get certain benefits based upon the law of succession
and to establish the same, the IO has not collected any evidence.
13. In view of above, to the view of this Court, to a purely civil dispute, criminal colour has been
given by initiating the proceedings in issue, which according to pronouncement(s) of Hon'ble Apex
Court including in the case(s) of Sunil Bharti Mittal Vs. C.B.I., AIR 2015 SC 923; State of Gujarat Vs.
Afroz Mohd. Hasanfatta; AIR 2019 SC 2499; Gulam Mustafa vs. State of Karnataka and another;
