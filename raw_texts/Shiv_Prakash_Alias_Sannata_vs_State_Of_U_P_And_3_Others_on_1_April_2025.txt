4. This is a second bail application. The first bail application of the applicant was rejected vide order
dated 18.4.2022 passed by this Court passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.54291 of 2021.
5. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that although he had sought time on 31.1.2025 to file
supplementary affidavit but he does not now propose to file any such supplementary affidavit. He
submits that the matter be heard and decided.
6. Notice was issued to the first informant vide order dated 3.12.2024. As per office report dated
25.1.2025, the report of the CJM, Jhansi has been received stating therein that notice has been
served upon the first informant personally but no one appears on behalf of first informant even
when the matter is taken up in the revised list despite service of notice.
7. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the
present case. It is argued that in the trial the victim was examined as P.W.1 and perusal of the
statement goes to show that she went out of her own sweet-will from the house. It has also been
pointed out that the applicant is not having any criminal history as stated in para 14 of the affidavit
and is in jail since 23.3.2019.
8. Per contra learned counsel for the State vehemently opposed the prayer for bail and argued that
the trial is at an advance stage as the statement of the doctor has been recorded. The first bail
application of the applicant was rejected by this Court on merits. The appreciation of the statement
of the victim by this Court in the bail application may have an adverse effect in the trial. The bail
application of the applicant be thus rejected.
9. After hearing the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it is evident that this is the
second bail application. The first bail application of the applicant was rejected by this Court vide
order dated 18.4.2022, the said order reads as under:-
"Heard Sri Om Prakash, learned counsel for the applicant, Sri Ankit Srivastava,
learned counsel for the State and perused the material on record.
This bail application under Section 439 of Code of Criminal Procedure has been filed
by the applicant-Shiv Prakash @ Sannata, seeking enlargement on bail during trial in
connection with Case Crime No.312 of 2018, under Sections 363, 366, 376, 354, 504,
506 IPC and 3/4 POCSO Act, registered at Police Station Mauranipur, District
Jhansi.
Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the applicant has been falsely
implicated in the present case. It is argued that the applicant ran away with Roshani,
the elder sister of the prosecutrix and solemnized his marriage with her and she is
living with the applicant which was opposed by the family members and is the reason
for false implication of the applicant. It is argued that no such incident has taken
place. The doctor has not found any sign of rape upon the prosecutrix. The FIR
although names the applicant as an accused along with Roshni, but the said

allegations are false and incorrect with malafide intentions. The prosecutrix is a
major girl as in the FIR itself her age has been disclosed as 17 years. It has also been
pointed out that the applicant is not having any criminal history as stated in para 16
of the affidavit and is in jail since 23.3.2019.
Per contra learned counsel for the State vehemently opposed the prayer for bail and
argued that as per the medical examination report, the prosecutrix has been opined
to be 16 years of age who has supported the prosecution case in her statement
recorded under Section 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. and even in her statement recorded as
P.W.1 before the trial court. The applicant is named in the FIR, in her statement
recorded under Section 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. and in her statement recorded in the
trial. In so far as the medical examination of the prosecutrix is concerned, the FIR
has been lodged on the basis of application moved under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. hence
the medical examination was conducted after the FIR, as such there is opinion of the
doctor regarding no sign of rape on the prosecutrix.
After hearing the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it is apparent that
the applicant is named in the FIR, in her statement recorded under Section 161 and
164 Cr.P.C. and in her statement recorded in the trial. As per the medical
examination report, the prosecutrix has been opined to be 16 years of age and minor.
The applicant is the husband of the sister of the prosecutrix and as such there are no
chances of his false implication. The reason for false implication of the applicant as
spelled out in para 10 of the affidavit filed in support of bail application and does not
inspire confidence.
Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find it a fit case for bail,
hence, the bail application is rejected."
10. The trial in the matter is at an advance stage. The victim has supported the prosecution case
while being examined as P.W.1. There is no fresh and new ground argued to release the applicant on
bail.
11. Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find it a fit case for bail, hence, the
bail application is rejected.
12. However, it is provided that the applicant may file an application for expeditious disposal of the
trial of the case before the court concerned within two weeks from today, which may as per its load
of work, diary and pendency of cases, pass appropriate orders on the same.
