2. The above impugned order has been passed by the learned Magistrate on a protest petition, which
was directed to be dealt as a private complaint, by an order of the High Court. After having got the
sworn statement of the witness and satisfied that there are prima facie materials available on record,
the learned Magistrate has passed the following order:

3. In fact, this is an unfortunate petition which has seen several rounds of litigation for getting
repeated directions for dealing the protest petition in accordance with law. The matter originated on
a complaint given by the petitioner/defacto complainant. On 04.08.2004, against the respondents
on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the allegation that they have committed certain offence. On the
basis of the said complaint First Information Report has been registered in Crime No.642 of 2004
for the offence under Sections 420, 423 and 417 of IPC against the respondents/accused. As there
was no further progress in the investigation, the petitioner/defacto complainant filed
Crl.O.P.No.17370 of 2005 for seeking direction. Only during the said proceedings, it was informed
by the Prosecuting Agency that the investigation had already been completed and the case has been
referred as ''Mistake of Fact''. Though the case was initially registered at Palladam Police Station,
subsequently it got transferred to District Crime Branch for investigation and at the conclusion of
investigation, final report has been filed as 'Mistake of Fact'. On getting such informations, this
Court has passed an order dated 04.07.2005 in Crl.O.P.No.17370 of 2005 by dismissing the petition.
However, an opportunity was given to the petitioner to file a protest petition on receipt of the
referral notice, from Police. It is alleged by the petitioner that they were never served with referral
notice. However, on getting the knowledge about the result of the investigation, they had filed the
Protest Petition. But, it was prayed to the learned Magistrate, Palladam to reject the final report and
to order re- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis investigation. The said petition was dismissed by the
learned Magistrate by stating that the Magistrate has no power to direct the Prosecuting Agency to
do reinvestigation.
4. Challenging the same, the defacto complainant filed a criminal case in Crl.R.C.No.777 of 2006. In
the said revision petition, order has been passed on 28.11.2006 by dismissing the said revision case.
However, the learned Magistrate was given liberty to conduct an enquiry in the protest petition by
receiving oral and documentary evidence and proceeding in accordance with law. On receipt of the
said order, the defacto complainant once again filed a protest petition before the learned Magistrate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24751213/ 3
S.Thangavelu vs The Sub-Inspector Of Police on 26 November, 2021
in the form of a private complaint on 18.01.2007. The said petition was returned by the learned
Magistrate. Since the learned Magistrate has not followed the direction given by the High Court in
the order dated 28.11.2006 passed in Crl.R.C.No.777 of 2006, the Defacto complainant once again
filed Crl.O.P.No.5094 of 2007 for seeking directions. The said Crl.O.P.No.5094 of 2007 was
disposed of on 23.02.2007 and the learned Judicial Magistrate was directed to comply the earlier
order and to conduct an enquiry on the protest https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis petition by
receiving oral and documentary evidence.
5. Even thereafter, the learned Magistrate did not proceed to conduct the enquiry as directed by this
Court. Instead, he forwarded the petition to the Inspector of Police, Palladam on 26.03.2007, for
taking action under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., and to file a report. Once again the defacto complainant
knocked the door of this Court by filing Crl.R.C.No.709 of 2007 and challenging Order of the
Magistrate dated 26.03.2007 in C.F.R.No.2434 of 2007 and the same was disposed of by this Court
on 21.04.2008. It is pertinent to note that at that point of time, the accused also challenged the
order of the learned Magistrate dated 26.03.2007 by way of filing Original Petitions in
Crl.O.P.No.12300 of 2007 and Crl.O.P.No.9134 of 2008. In view of that, a common order has been
passed in Crl.R.C.No.709 of 2007 and Crl.O.P.No.12300 of 2007 and Crl.O.P.No.9134 of 2008 on
21.04.2008. In the said order, the order of the learned Magistrate dated 26.03.2007 was set aside
once again and direction was given to the learned Magistrate to conduct enquiry on the Protest
Petition after giving due opportunity to the defacto- complainant to produce both oral and
documentary evidence. The above order made it clear that the said direction would not in any way
disturb the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis earlier order of the learned Magistrate which rejected
the prayer for reinvestigation.
6. Thereafter, the learned Magistrate had started to conduct the enquiry on the protest petition
which was filed in the form of a complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C. The sworn statement of PW1
and two other witnesses were recorded and 14 documents have been received from the defacto
complainant. After appreciating the materials on record, the learned Magistrate dismissed the
petition, but on a strange finding that the petitioner had no right to seek CBCID or any other
independent Agency to reinvestigate the case. The said finding has been given without notice of the
earlier order passed by the same Court on that aspect and which was also confirmed by the order of
the High Court dated 28.11.2006 in Crl.R.C.No.777 of 2006. In fact, the impact of the order was
once again reiterated by the High Court, in its common order dated 21.04.2008 passed in
Crl.R.C.No.709 of 2007, Crl.O.P.No.12300 of 2007 and Crl.O.P.No.9134 of 2008. Had the learned
Magistrate perused the records completely and known about the earlier proceedings connected to
this case, he would have averted a repeated order https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis about
re-investigation. Curiously, the learned Magistrate also recorded a finding that the protest petition
itself is not maintainable. Aggrieved over that, the defacto complainant filed Crl.R.C.No.375 of
2011for setting aside the order of the learned Magistrate dated 31.03.2009. This Court has disposed
the Crl.R.C.No.375 of 2011 on 09.01.2017 by passing the following order:
''5. In the result, the order passed by the Court below is liable to be set aside and
accordingly it is set aside and the matter is remanded to the learned Judicial
Magistrate and the learned Judicial Magistrate, Palladam is directed to consider the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24751213/ 4
S.Thangavelu vs The Sub-Inspector Of Police on 26 November, 2021
protest petition on merits and in accordance with law and pass a suitable order
within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.''
7. In pursuant to the above order, the learned Magistrate, Palladam had passed an impugned order
on 05.07.2017. In the impugned order, the learned Judicial Magistrate has recorded that there are
no prima facie grounds to issue process to the accused under Section 204 Cr.P.C. However, he
proceeded to record that the protest petition is liable to be treated as a private
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis complaint and that can be taken on file in C.C.No.130 of 2017
under Section 120 B, 417, r/w.109, 420, 423, 467, 468, 34, 294B, 448 and 506(ii) of IPC. It is to be
seen that the earlier order of the learned Magistrate dated 31.03.2009 was passed after completing
the enquiry contemplated under Section 204 Cr.P.C. If the learned Magistrate found sufficient
grounds for proceeding further, he has to either issue process for enforcing the admission of the
accused, by way of ordering 'summon' or 'warrant' as the case may be. If the materials produced
before the learned Magistrate are found to be not sufficient to make out a prima facie case, he could
have reject the complaint.
8. But, in the impugned order, the learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the case and assigned
a C.C. Number also. If the learned Magistrate opts to take the case on file, the consequent order
would be to issue summons or warrant to the accused for ensuring his appearance and to conduct
trial in accordance with law.
9. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the impugned order of the learned
Magistrate has been passed in violation of the procedure https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
contemplated under law. Since the revision petitioner was once again slapped with a confusing
order, he has prepared the revision case. He relied on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
rendered in H.S.Bains Director Small Saving-Cum-Deputy Secretary, Finan Vs. State (Union
Territory of Chandigarh) reported in 1980 AIR (SC) 1883, in support of his contentions that the
protest petition has to be treated like that of the petition under Section 200 Cr.P.C., and an enquiry
has to be conducted under Section 202, if the learned Magistrate thinks fit and thereafter, the only
course open to the learned Magistrate is to either dismiss the complaint or issue process. In the said
judgment, it is held as under:
''The Magistrate after receiving the Police report, may, without issuing process or
dropping the proceeding decide to take cognizance of the offence on the basis of the
complaint originally submitted to him and proceed to record the statements upon
oath of the complainant and the witnesses present under Sec.200 Criminal Procedure
Code and thereafter decide whether to dismiss the complaint or issue process. The
mere fact that he had earlier ordered an investigation under Sec.156(3) and received
a report under Sec.173 will not have the effect of total effacement of the complaint
and therefore the Magistrate will not be barred https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
from proceeding under Section 200, 203 and 204. Thus, a magistrate who on receipt
of a complaint, orders an investigation under Sec.156(3) and receives a police report
under Sec.173(1), may, thereafter, do one of three things: (1) he may decide that there
is no sufficient ground for proceeding further and drop action; (2) he may take
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24751213/ 5
S.Thangavelu vs The Sub-Inspector Of Police on 26 November, 2021
cognizance of the offence under Sec.190(1)(b) on the basis of the police report and
issue process; this he may do without being bound in any manner by the conclusion
arrived at by the police in their report; (3) he may take cognizance of the offence
under Sec.190(1)(a) on the basis of the original complaint and proceed to examine
upon oath the complainant and his witnesses under Sec.202 if he thinks fit.
Thereafter he may dismiss the complaint or issue process, as the case may be.''
10. The Hon'ble Supreme Court made it clear that even without receiving the protest
petition, the learned Magistrate on his own can issue process, if the Police report is
not agreeable and in his appreciation, the case has to be dealt further. But, here is a
case where the complainant himself has filed a protest petition. In another judgment
of the Full Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, passed in Bhagwant Singh Vs.
Commissioner of Police & https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Another reported in
1985 (2) SCC 537, it is again made clear that every protest petition should be treated
as a private complaint and a proceedings under Section 200 Cr.P.C., For the purpose
of better appreciation, it is relevant to extract paragraph No.4 of the above judgment
as under:
''4. Now, when the report forwarded by the officer-in charge of a police station to the
Magistrate under sub- section (2)(i) of Section 173 comes up for consideration by the
Magistrate, one of two different situations may arise. The report may conclude that
an offence appears to have been committed by a particular person or persons and in
such a case, the Magistrate may do one of three things: (1) he may accept the report
and take cognizance of the offence and issue process or (2) he may disagree with the
report and drop the proceeding or (3) he may direct further investigation under
sub-section (3) of Section 156 and require the police to make a further report. The
report may on the other hand state that, in the opinion of the police, no offence
appears to have been committed and where such a report has been made, the
Magistrate again has an option to adopt one of three courses: (1) he may accept the
report and drop the proceeding or (2) he may disagree with the report and taking the
view that there is sufficient ground for proceeding further, take cognizance of the
offence and issue https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis process or (3) he may direct
further investigation to be made by the police under sub-section (3) of Section 156.
Where, in either of these two situations, the Magistrate decides to take cognizance of
the offence and to issue process, the informant is not prejudicially affected nor is the
injured or in case of death, any relative of the deceased aggrieved, because cognizance
of the offence is taken by the Magistrate and it is decided by the Magistrate that the
case shall proceed. But if the Magistrate decides that there is no sufficient ground for
proceeding further and drops the proceeding or takes the view that though there is
sufficient ground for proceeding against some, there is no sufficient ground for
proceeding against others mentioned in the First Information Report, the informant
would certainly be prejudiced because the First Information Report lodged by him
would have failed of its purpose, wholly or in part. Moreover, when the interest of the
informant in prompt and effective action being taken on the First Information Report
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24751213/ 6
S.Thangavelu vs The Sub-Inspector Of Police on 26 November, 2021
lodged by him is clearly recognised by the provisions contained in sub-section (2) of
Section 154, sub- section (2) of Section 157 and sub-section (2)(ii) of Section 173, it
must be presumed that the informant would equally be interested in seeing that the
Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence and issues process, because that would be
culmination of the First Information Report https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis lodged
by him. There can, therefore, be no doubt that when, on a consideration of the report
made by the officer in charge of a police station under sub-section (2)(i) of Section
173, the Magistrate is not inclined to take cognizance of the offence and issue process,
the informant must be given an opportunity of being heard so that he can make his
submissions to persuade the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and issue
process. We are accordingly of the view that in a case where the magistrate to whom a
report is forwarded under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 decides not to take
cognizance of the offence and to drop the proceeding or takes the view that there is
no sufficient ground for proceeding against some of the persons mentioned in the
First Information Report, the magistrate must give notice to the informant and
provide him an opportunity to be heard at the time of consideration of the report. It
was urged before us on behalf of the respondents that if in such a case notice is
required to be given to the informant, it might result in unnecessary delay on account
of the difficulty of effecting service of the notice on the informant. But we do not
think this can be regarded as a valid objection against the view we are taking, because
in any case the action taken by the police on the First Information Report has to be
communicated to the informant and a copy of the report has to be supplied to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis him under sub-section (2) (i) of Section 173 if that
be so, we do not see any reason why it should be difficult to serve notice of the
consideration of the report on the informant.
Moreover, in any event, the difficulty of service of notice on the informant cannot possibly provide
any justification for depriving the informant of the opportunity of being heard at the time when the
report is considered by the Magistrate.''
11. In the above judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had approved the right of the complainant to
receive referral notice. Having given a complaint, the complainant has got a right to know about the
result of his complaint at the conclusion of the investigation. The right to file protest petition follows
as right to receive referral notice and once such petition is filed, the learned Magistrate has to
consider it like a private complaint filed under Section 200 Cr.P.C.
12. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 4 submitted that it is always open
to the learned Magistrate to postpone the issuance of summons / warrant till the time, the
complainant files the list of witnesses under Section 204(2) Cr.P.C., and the legislation contemplates
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis procedure to safeguard the interest of the accused as well. He
invited the attention of this Court to the judgment of the High Court of Orissa passed in the case of
Anil Kumar Singh Vs. Jagdish Pandey, dated 30.07.2014 in Crl.M.C.Nos.3091, 3093 and 3095 of
2012, in support of his above contentions. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 4 referred
paragraph No.14 of the above said judgment, in which, a reference was made about the judgment of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24751213/ 7
S.Thangavelu vs The Sub-Inspector Of Police on 26 November, 2021
the Bombay High Court made in Pramila Mahesh Shah v. Employees State Insurance and another
(2002 CRI.L.J.2454).
''14. The Bombay High Court in Pramila Mahesh Shah v. Employees State Insurance and another
2002 CRI.L.J.2454, after taking note of the law laid down by the various Courts on the subject, has
come to hold that the view expressed in Bhiku Yeshwant Dhangat (supra) is per incuriam. Hon'ble
Court has proceeded to hold as under:
''xx xx xx
29. Coming to Section 204(2) of Cr.P.C., I must say that the non-compliance of this
provision does not affect the jurisdiction of the Magistrate either to issue process or
to try the case. This view has been taken by the Apex Court in Noorkhan v.State of
Rajasthan, (1964 (1) Cri.L.J.167);
Madhaorao Pandurang v.Yeshwant (1969
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Mah.L.J.(NOC)21); Abdullah Bhat v. Ghulam
Mohd.Wani(1972 Cri.L.J.277)J an K) (FB); and Shashi Nair v.R.C.Mehta(1982(1)
Bom CR 358(Supra). The procedural laws are hand made of justice and the question
of prejudice is of paramount consideration in respect of breach of procedural
provisions. Therefore, even if it was to be held that the provisions of Section 204(2)
are mandatory, that, by itself, would not vitiate the issue of process or the jurisdiction
of the Court and where the matter is at the initial stage, directions can be given to
furnish the copy of list of witnesses, if any, before the proceedings actually
commenced. The stage of the proceedings is relevant to determine the prejudice, if
any, caused to the accused. In the case under consideration, the substantive
proceedings had not yet started. Therefore, in the circumstances, directions to the
complainant to supply copy of witnesses, if any, within a period of four weeks from
the receipt of the copy of the order by the trial Court would be considered as
sufficient compliance of Section 204(2) of Cr.P.C., 1973.''
13. The whole reading of the above observations made by the other High Courts would only say that
even if the jurisdictional Magistrate had opted to issue process before filing of the list of witnesses
by the prosecution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that would not vitiate the proceedings. If the
Magistrate slips to issue process without receiving the list of witnesses, his proceedings cannot be
set aside as illegal. The accused has also got a right to get the copies of the statement of the
witnesses given during 202 proceedings. In the case in hand, the accused has not filed any petition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24751213/ 8
S.Thangavelu vs The Sub-Inspector Of Police on 26 November, 2021
for seeking copies of sworn statement and prayed to stop the proceedings. For the reasons are
non-filing of list of witnesses as contemplated under Section 204(2) Cr.P.C.
14. It is worthwhile to know that even when the defacto complainant has filed his protest petition in
the form of private complaint, he has given the list of witnesses. The learned Magistrate has chosen
to take the sworn statement of three witnesses from the list and received 14 documents. It is open
for the learned Magistrate to restrict 202 enquiry to the point of satisfaction about prima facie case.
But, the learned Magistrate without understanding the spirit of Sections 202 and 204 had raised a
self-contradiction order by taking cognizance of the case, but stopping the process. If, the learned
Magistrate is not satisfied with the evidence on record, he ought not to have the case on file and kept
202 proceedings https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis pending and called for the sworn statement of
other witnesses as well. Once the case is taken on file, and the list of witnesses have also been
furnished by the defacto complainant nothing could prevent the learned Magistrate to issue
summons or warrant as the case may be.
15. Once the summons or warrant is issued and the accused makes his appearance and gets the
copies of the papers, his right to participate in the proceedings is assured. At this stage, it is not
necessary for the learned Magistrate to stop the process without assigning any acceptable reasons
and that too after taking the case on file.
16. On perusal of the impugned order of the learned Magistrate, it is seen that the learned
Magistrate has got himself satisfied to take the protest petition on file by assigning C.C.No.130 of
2017 under Sections 120 B, 417 r/w. 109, 420, 423, 467, 468, 34, 294(b), 448 and 506(ii) of IPC.
Having taken the case on file, the learned Magistrate ought to have concluded the 202 proceedings
and issue summon or warrant to the accused. Once again, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
learned Magistrate seems to continue the 202 Cr.P.C., proceedings, for examining further witnesses.
If the learned Magistrate has not satisfied with the materials already on record, his action of taking
the case on file would be contrary to his own intention.
17. Rightly or wrongly the case has been taken on file and C.C.number has also been assigned. Now,
the learned Magistrate has to follow the next course of action in accordance with law by issuing the
process. Since the prosecution has also filed the list of witnesses, he need not stop the proceedings
under Section 204(ii) Cr.P.C. also. Hence, the order of the learned Magistrate requires modification
and to that extent, I feel that the interference of this Court is warranted.
18. In the result, this Criminal Revision Case is partly allowed and the impugned order of the
learned Magistrate is modified to the extent of issuing summons to the accused in C.C.No.130 of
2017. In compliance of the above order, the learned Magistrate is directed to cause the summons to
be issued to the accused and dispose the case in C.C.No.130 of 2017 at the earliest.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Consequently, connected criminal miscellaneous petition is
closed.
