3. The facts of the case, in brief, are that Eviction Suit Patna High Court C.Misc. No.825 of 2018
dt.12-03-2019 No.3 of 2014 was filed by the plaintiffs/opposite parties for eviction of
defendants/petitioners from a residential house and godown standing over Plot No. 214 K of
Mohalla Nunphar Kedarnath Road in Muzaffarpur town on the ground of personal necessity as also
for payment of arrears of rent. Their case is that they have personal necessity of suit premises for
running business and residential purpose and the defendants are also defaulters as they did not pay
rent from May, 2013.
4. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs are not in need of house and they are not defaulters
as they had given Rs.3 lakh as advance on 11.12.2012 to the plaintiff no. 1 on a condition that no rent
will be charged till the repayment of Rs.3 lakh.
5. During pendency of the suit, the plaintiffs filed an application under Section 15 of the BBC Act on
15.05.2017 for depositing arrears of rent from May, 2013.
6. After hearing the parties, vide impugned order dated 12.12.2017, the learned Munsif East,
Muzaffarpur allowed the application filed by the plaintiffs and the defendants were directed to pay
arrears of rent from the month of filing of the suit @ Rs.1789/- per month till the month of passing
the order within 15 days of passing of the order to the plaintiffs and also Patna High Court C.Misc.
No.825 of 2018 dt.12-03-2019 pay the current rent @ Rs.1789/- per month by 15th every succeeding
month to the plaintiffs.
7. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners(defendants) submitted that the learned Munsif has
not at all considered the payment of Rs.3 lakh as advance to the plaintiffs(opposite parties) with an
agreed condition that till return of Rs.3 lakh, no rent would be charged from the defendants. He has
contended that by not considering the aforesaid agreement entered into between the parties, the
learned Munsif has committed serious illegality in passing the impugned order. He has further
contended that there would be failure of justice if the impugned order is not quashed as the defence
of the defendants has been struck out.
8. At this stage, it would be apposite to reproduce Section 15 of the BBC Act hereunder :-
"Section 15 - Deposit of rent by tenants in suits for ejectment- (1) If, in a suit for
recovery of possession of any building the tenant contests the suit as regards claim
for ejectment, landlord may move an application at any stage of the suit for order on
the tenant to deposit rent month by month at a rate at which it was last paid and also
subject to the law to limitation, the arrears of rent, if any, and the Court after giving
Patna High Court C.Misc. No.825 of 2018 dt.12-03-2019 opportunity to the parties to
be heard, may make any order for deposit of rent month by month at such rate as
may be determined and the arrears of rent, both before or after the institution of the
suit if any and on failure of the tenant to deposit the arrears of rent within fifteen
days of the date of order or the rent at such rate for any month by the fifteenth day of
the next following month; the Court shall order the defence against ejectment to be
struck off and the tenant to be placed in the same position as if he had not defended

the claim to ejectment and further the Court shall not allow the tenant to
cross-examine the landlord's witnesses.
(2) If in any proceeding referred to in sub-section (1) there is any dispute as to the
person or persons to whom the rent is payable the Court may direct the tenant to
deposit in Court the amount payable by him under sub-
section (1) and in such case no person shall be entitled to withdraw the amount in deposit until the
Court decides the dispute and makes an order for payment of the same.
(3) If the Court is satisfied that any dispute referred to in subsection (2) has been raised by a tenant
for reasons which are false or frivolous the Court may order the defence against the eviction to be
struck off and proceed with the hearing of the suit as laid Patna High Court C.Misc. No.825 of 2018
dt.12-03-2019 down in sub-section (1)."
9. From a reading of the aforesaid provision, it would be manifest that in a suit for recovery of
possession of any building, at any stage of the suit, the landlord may move an application for order
on the tenant to deposit rent month by month at the rate at which it was last paid and also subject to
law of limitation. The question of application of Section 15 of the BBC Act depends upon
relationship of the landlord and the tenant.
10. In the present case, defendants do not dispute that they are not the tenants of the plaintiffs.
Considering the evidence on record, after hearing the parties, the court below has ordered the
defendants to deposit arrears of rent from the month of filing of the suit as also to pay the current
rent. There is no pleading that pursuant to the order passed by the court below, arrears of rent was
deposited by the defendants. In terms of Section 15 of the BBC Act, a tenant against whom an order
has been passed is bound to deposit the amount of arrears of rent within 15 days from the date of the
order. If the rent is not deposited within time, the defence of the tenant is liable to be struck off for
non-compliance of the statutory provisions of law. If the court below has not accepted the plea of the
defendants Patna High Court C.Misc. No.825 of 2018 dt.12-03-2019 that in fact the rent was not in
arrear as the defendant has paid Rs.3 lakhs in advance, no illegality can be found with the order
impugned.
11. The order passed by the court below is neither perverse nor unsound or irrational.
12. In that view of the matter, I see no reason to interfere with the impugned order in exercise of
supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
13. The application is dismissed.
