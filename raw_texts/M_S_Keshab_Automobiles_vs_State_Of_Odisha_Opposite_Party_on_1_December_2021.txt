JUDGMENT
01.12.2021 Dr. S. Muralidhar, CJ.
1. This revision petition arises out of the order dated 5th April, 2016 passed by the Odisha Sales Tax
Tribunal (Tribunal), Cuttack dismissing the Petitioner(cid:128)s/Assessee(cid:128)s S.A.No.64 (VAT) of 2014-
15. By the said order, the Tribunal affirmed the order passed on 3rd February, 2014 by the Joint
Commissioner (JCST), Jajpur Range, Jajpur Road dismissing the Petitioner(cid:128)s First Appeal Case
No.AA-399/CUIII/13-14 and thereby confirming the order dated 19th December, 2012 passed by the
Sales Tax Officer (STO), Jajpur Circle, Jajpur Road raising a demand of Rs.3,92,434/- against the
Petitioner for the period 1st April, 2010 to 31st March, 2011 under Section 43 of the Odisha Value
Added Tax Act, 2004 (OVAT Act).
2. While admitting this revision petition on 13 th November, 2017 following question was framed for
consideration:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37080783/ 1
M/S. Keshab Automobiles vs State Of Odisha .... Opposite Party on 1 December, 2021
"Whether in absence of completion of assessment under Sections 39, 40, 42 or 44 of
the OVAT Act, reassessment under Section 43 of the said Act made by the authority
below is sustainable in law?
3. On the same date, an interim order was passed by this Court to the effect that if the Petitioner
deposits the balance tax dues within a period of four weeks, the penalty levied shall remain in
abeyance till the disposal of the revision petition.
4. The background facts are that the Petitioner is a registered dealer carrying on business in
automobiles parts of all types of vehicles and lubricants both on wholesale as well as retail basis.
5. The original return filed by the Petitioner for the aforementioned period was not acknowledged by
the Department. Basing on a fraud case report received from the STO, Investigating Unit, Jajpur
Road, the assessment for the above period was sought to be reopened under Section 43 of the OVAT
Act. By an order dated 19th December, 2012 the STO made a reassessment and raised a demand of
Rs. 3,92,434/- towards tax and Rs.2,61,622.50 towards penalty under Section 43(2) of the OVAT
Act. The JCST and the Tribunal also affirmed the aforementioned order. It is significant that before
the Tribunal none appeared for the Assessee/Appellant.
6. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Jagabandhu Sahoo, learned Senior Advocate
appearing for the Petitioner and Mr. Sunil Mishra, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the
Department (Sales Tax).
7. In support of his contention that no reassessment can be made unless the assessment is
completed.
8. Mr. J. Sahoo, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the Petitioner has placed reliance on the
decision case of the Supreme Court of India in Ghanashyam Das v. Regional Assistant
Commissioner of Sales Tax, Nagpur AIR 1964 SC 766; the Full Bench of this Court in M/s.
Jaynarayan Kedarnath v. Sales Tax Officer, Cuttack-I West Circle (1988) 68 STC 25 and Balaji
Tobacco Stores v. The Sales Tax Officer (decision dated 18th March, 2015 of this Court in W.P.(C)
No.31251 of 2011). By referring to Sections 39, 40, 42, 43 and 44 of the OVAT Act, 2004 and the
amendments made thereto with effect from 1st October, 2015 together with the pre and post
amended Rules and in particular Rule 50, Mr. Sahoo submitted that during the relevant period
when the reassessment proceedings commenced it was the unamended Section 43 that was to apply.
It is submitted that without there actually being an assessment under Section 39 of the OVAT Act,
the provisions of Section 43 (1) of the OVAT Act could not have been invoked for the period prior to
1st October, 2015.
9. On the other hand, Mr. Sunil Mishra, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the Opposite Party
(Department) submitted that the first level change was brought about in the OVAT Act in 2010
when all the returns had to be filed only online. Therefore, the actual "acceptance" of the return in
physical mode was no longer possible. If the return was defective, notice would be issued to the
Assessee to rectify the defects. Otherwise, the returns filed under Section 39 of the Act by way of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37080783/ 2
M/S. Keshab Automobiles vs State Of Odisha .... Opposite Party on 1 December, 2021
„self assessment(cid:128) was „deemed(cid:128) to be accepted. He placed reliance on certain portions of the
„White Paper on State Level Value Added Tax(cid:128) brought out by the Empowered Committee of the
State Finance Commissions on 17th January, 2005.
10. According to Mr. Mishra, the amendments brought with effect from 1st October, 2015 to
Sections 39 and 43 of the OVAT Act and Rule 50 of the OVAT Rules were "clarificatory" of the
existing legal position that in order to reopen the assessment, there need not be a formal acceptance
of the return originally filed by way of self-assessment. Reliance is placed on the decision dated 7th
December, 2016 of this Court in W.P.(C) No.22343 of 2015 (M/s. Nilachal Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. State
of Odisha). It was submitted that in the said decision this Court had negatived a similar plea that
there could be no reopening of the assessment without a formal acceptance of the original return
filed by the Assessee by way of self-assessment.
11. The above submissions have been considered. Undoubtedly, by the amendment brought out with
effect from 1 st October, 2015 the scheme of filing of tax returns, their scrutiny and the manner of
invoking Section 43 of the OVAT Act for reopening the assessment underwent significant changes.
In Section 39, to begin with, sub-section (2) was substituted with effect from 1st October, 2015 in the
following manner:
Section 39(2) after 1.10.2015 Section 39(2) prior to the amendment with effect from
01.10.2015 If a registered dealer furnishes the If a registered dealer furnishes the
return in respect of any tax period return in respect of any tax period, it within the
prescribed time and the shall be deemed to be self-assessed. return so furnished is
found to be in order, it shall be accepted as self assessed subject to adjustment of any
arithmetical error apparent on the face of the said return.
The concept of „deemed(cid:128) self assessment was introduced only with effect from 1st October, 2015.
Prior thereto, if such return filed by the dealer under Section 39 of the OVAT Act and was "found to
be in order" and within the prescribed time, then it was to be accepted as self assessed subject to
adjustment of arithmetical errors.
12. Now turning to Section 43(1) the changes again are stark.
Section 43(1) after 1.10.2015 Section 43(1) prior to 1.10.2015 Where, the assessing authority, on
Where, after a dealer is assessed the basis of any information in his under Section 39, 40 [42 or 44]
for possession which indicates that the any tax period, the assessing whole or any part of the
turnover of authority, on the basis of any the dealer in respect of any tax period information in his
possession, is of or tax periods has- the opinion that the whole or any part
(a) escaped assessment; or of the turnover of the dealer in
(b) been under-assessed; or respect of such tax period or tax
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37080783/ 3
M/S. Keshab Automobiles vs State Of Odisha .... Opposite Party on 1 December, 2021
(c) been assessed at a rate lower than periods has - the rate at which it is assessable; (a) escaped
assessment, or or that the dealer has been allowed- (b) been under-assessed, or
(i) wrongly any deduction from his (c) been assessed at a rate lower than turnover; or the rate at
which it is assessable;
(ii) input tax credit, to which he is or that the dealer has been allowed- not eligible, (i) wrongly any
deduction from his the assessing authority may serve a turnover, or (ii) input tax credit, to notice on
the dealer in such form and which he is not eligible, manner as may be prescribed and The assessing
authority may serve a after giving the dealer a reasonable notice on the dealer in such form and
opportunity of being heard and after manner as may be prescribed and making such enquiry as he
deems after giving the dealer a reasonable necessary, proceed to assess to the opportunity of being
heard and after best of his judgment the amount of making such enquiry as he deems tax due from
the dealer. necessary, proceed to assess to the best of his judgment the amount of tax due from the
dealer.
13. It is significant that prior to its amendment with effect from 1st October, 2015 the trigger for
invoking Section 43 (1) of the OVAT Act required a dealer to be assessed under Sections 39, 40, 42
and 44 for any tax period. The words "where, after a dealer is assessed" at the beginning of Section
43 (1) prior to 1 st October, 2015 pre-supposes that there has to be an initial assessment which
should have been formally accepted for the periods in question i.e. before 1st October, 2015 before
the Department could form an opinion regarding escaped assessment or under assessment or the
accused taking the benefit of a lower rate or being wrongly allowed deduction from his turnover or
input tax credit to which he is not eligible.
14. However, under Section 43(1) of the OVAT Act, after its amendment with effect from 1st
October, 2015 the Assessing Authority can form an opinion about the whole or part of the turnover
of the dealer escaping assessment or being under assessed "on the basis of any information in his
possession". In other words, it is not necessary after 1st October, 2015 for the Assessee(cid:128)s initial
return having to be „accepted(cid:128) before Section 43(1) could be invoked.
15. Therefore, the position prior to 1st October, 2015 is clear. Unless there was an assessment of the
dealer under Sections 39, 40, 42 and 44 for any tax period, the question of reopening the assessment
under Section 43 (1) of the OVAT Act did not arise.
16. While the „White Paper on State Level Value Added Tax(cid:128) brought out in 17th January, 2005
does envisage in para 2.12 that the "dealer will be deemed to have been self assessed on the basis of
before the returns submitted by him" such an observation is at the highest recommendatory in
nature. It cannot be elevated to the status of law.
17. A perusal of the decision of this Court in Nilachal Ispat Nigam Ltd. (supra) reveals that it was in
the context of the Orissa Entry Tax Act (OET Act). Secondly, this Court had no occasion in the said
decision to discuss the effect of more or less similar amendments effected to the provisions of the
OET Act which were brought into effect from 1st October, 2015. This is despite the fact that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37080783/ 4
M/S. Keshab Automobiles vs State Of Odisha .... Opposite Party on 1 December, 2021
decision is dated 7th December, 2016. The amendments did bring about a significant change to the
OET Act and therefore had a direct bearing on the issues discussed in the said decision.
Consequently, this Court finds that the decision in Nilachal Ispat Nigam Ltd. is per in curiam
inasmuch as it fails to discuss the amended provisions of the OET Act which have a direct bearing on
the issues adjudicated by this Court.
18. In Balaji Tobaco Store (supra) this Court accepted the plea of the Petitioner that unless there was
a completion of the assessment of the initial state, reassessment proceeding under Section 43 of the
OVAT Act not been triggered.
19. To the same effect, in the decision in Ghanshyam Das (supra) it was observed by the Supreme
Court as under:
"...if a return was duly made, the assessment could be made at any time unless the
statute prescribed a time limit. This can only be for the reason that the proceedings
duly initiated in time will be pending and can, therefore, be completed without time
limit. A proceeding is said to be pending as soon as it is commenced and until it is
concluded. On the said analogy, the assessment proceedings under the Sales-tax Act
must be held to be pending from the time the said proceedings were initiated until
they were terminated by a final order of assessment. Before the final order of
assessment, it could not be said that the entire turnover or a part thereof of a dealer
had escaped assessment, for the assessment was not completed and if, completed, it
might be that the entire turnover would be caught in the net."
20. This Court in order dated 29th February, 2008 in W.P.(C) No. 2777 of 2008 (M/s. Jayshree
Chemicals Ltd. v. State) observed as under:
"Apart from that, the concept of escaped assessment under Section 43 of the Orissa
Value Added Tax Act comes into play only when the assessment has been made and
completed.
In the instant case, without assessment being complete, the notice of escaped
assessment is misconceived and as such the said notice under Annexure-1 is
quashed."
21. A comparison of the language used in the amended Section 43 (1) of the OVAT Act with its
version prior to 1st October, 2015 makes it clear that a new system has been put in place as far as
reopening of returns filed as "self-assessment" is concerned. Now such reopening is permitted even
if there was no formal acceptance of the return originally filed. The concept of a "deemed"
acceptance of the return has been introduced for the first time since 1st October, 2015. This is not a
mere procedural change. Further, the amending statute itself makes it clear that the amendments
are with effect from 1st October, 2015 and not with retrospective effect from an earlier date.
Therefore, the Court is precluded from presuming that the amendment to Sections 39 (2) and 43 (1)
of the OVAT Act and correspondingly to Rule 50 of the OVAT Rules are either merely clarificatory or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37080783/ 5
M/S. Keshab Automobiles vs State Of Odisha .... Opposite Party on 1 December, 2021
retrospective.
22. From the above discussion, the picture that emerges is that if the self-assessment under Section
39 of the OVAT Act for tax periods prior to 1st October, 2015 are not „accepted(cid:128) either by a formal
communication or an acknowledgment by the Department, then such assessment cannot be sought
to be re-opened under Section 43 (1) of the OVAT Act and further subject to the fulfillment of other
requirements of that provision as it stood prior to 1st October, 2015.
23. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the reopening of the assessment sought to be made in the
present case under Section 43 (1) of the OVAT Act is held to be bad in law. The question framed is
accordingly answered in the negative i.e. in favour of the Assessee and against the Department. It is
accordingly, held that in the absence of the completion of the assessment under Sections 39, 40, 42
and 44, reassessment under Section 43 (1) of the OVAT Act is unsustainable in law.
24. The impugned order of the Tribunal and the corresponding orders of the JCST and STO are
hereby set aside.
25. The revision petition is disposed of in the above terms.
