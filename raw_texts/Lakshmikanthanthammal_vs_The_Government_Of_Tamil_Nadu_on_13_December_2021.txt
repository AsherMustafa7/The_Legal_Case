https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.4775 to 4778 of 2015
3. All the petitioners are the legal heirs of one A.Ramadoss, son of late Adikesavelu Naidu. He owned
land comprised in survey Nos.151/2A, 151/2B and 151/3A situated at Keelkaranai Village,
Kanchipuram District. The subject land along with other lands were acquired for the formation of
'New Town' known as 'Maraimalai Nagar'. Accordingly, notification under Section 4(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act for an extent of 226.31 acres in 77, Keelakaranai Village was approved by the
Government of Tamil Nadu in G.O.Rt.No.1938, RD & LA Department, dated 22.05.1974 and
published as notification dated 16.10.1974.

Lakshmikanthanthammal vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
4. Out of 226.31 acres notified, the third respondent required 106.53 acres towards Phase I
Programme. It involves more than 266 Sub- Divisions and more than 250 interested persons. After
conducting the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act and after duly considering the objections of the
interested persons in the enquiry dated 11.10.1977, approved the draft declaration made under
Section 6 of the Act for the public purpose, to wit, the development of New Satellite Town known as
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.4775 to 4778 of 2015 'Maraimalai Nagar'. The Section 6
declaration was published on 14.10.1977. In pursuance of the said directions and after duly giving
notice to all the interested persons in the manner prescribed under the said Act and Rules, award
was passed in Award No.3 of 1979 dated 06.08.1979. The compensation award amount was passed
in Award No.11 of 1988 dated 10.02.1988.
5. The said A.Ramadoss challenged the acquisition proceedings seeking re-conveyance in
W.P.No.965 of 2010 and the same was disposed of by an order dated 28.01.2010, directing the
respondents to consider the petitioners representation dated 20.01.2010. After the award, the
Special Officer, Primary Land Development Bank, Chengalpet, by a letter dated 17.04.1979 has
reported that a sum of Rs.6,515/- is still outstanding as on date towards the loan order
No.189/72-73. As such, the compensation amount of Rs.1,449 due for survey No.151/3A
admeasuring 0.42 cents which is encumbered in order to be paid to the Special Officer, Chengalpet
Primary Land Development Bank towards the loan. The Tahsildar, by a letter dated 07.06.1979 has
reported that a sum of Rs.1303.60 is still due towards loan No.9/67-68 from the said
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.4775 to 4778 of 2015 A.Ramadoss. Therefore, the said
amount is ordered to be credited towards pumping installation loan. The balance amount of
Rs.2077.40 is ordered to be paid to him. Accordingly, the said amount has been deposited in the Sub
Court, Chengalpet. Insofar as the compensation of the subject land is concerned, the property was
devolved on the Government and the requisition body.
6. Now, the petitioners have challenged the acquisition proceeding after a lapse of 35 years under
the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013, on the ground that the compensation amount has not been paid and the
possession has not been taken as contemplated under Section 24(2) of the Act. That apart, these writ
petitions have been filed after demise of the said P. Ramadoss on 22.06.2014 by a Will dated
27.03.2014 all the legal heirs i.e., the petitioners herein claimed the subject property. Therefore, the
provision under Section 24 (2) of the Act is not applicable to the petitioners as the subject lands
have been taken over under the Section 24(2) of the Act and after a period of 35 years, the
proceedings have been challenged under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.4775 to 4778 of 2015 Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation
and Resettlement Act, 2013
7. The grounds raised by the petitioners in these writ petitions have already been settled by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and
others etc reported in 2020 8 SCC 129, wherein it is held as follows:
366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95880528/ 4
Lakshmikanthanthammal vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2016 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue
as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of 1894 as if it
has not been repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of authorities for
five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.4775 to 4778 of 2015 has not been taken
nor compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession has been taken,
compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse.
Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not include a
deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in proviso to Section
24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of land holdings then all
beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the
Act of 1894 shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.
In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled,
interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of compensation (in court)
does not result in the lapse of land acquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit with respect to
the majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to
the "landowners" as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of
1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the Act
of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.4775 to 4778 of 2015 lapsed under Section 24(2) due to non-payment or non- deposit of
compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section
31(1). Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought reference for higher
compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under Section 24(2) of the
Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not part of
Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is
by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95880528/ 5
Lakshmikanthanthammal vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
under Section 16 of the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section
24(2).
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case
authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years
or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with
concerned authority as on 1.1.2016. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has
to be excluded in the computation of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.4775 to 4778 of
2015 five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of
concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of
enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2016. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and
does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of
taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead
of court to invalidate acquisition.
8. In view of the settled position of law, this Court is of the considered view that these writ petitions
are liable to be dismissed as devoid of merits.
9. In the result, these writ petitions stand dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous
petitions are closed. No costs.
