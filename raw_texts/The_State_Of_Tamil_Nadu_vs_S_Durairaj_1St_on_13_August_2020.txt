JUDGMENT
(Judgment of the Court was delivered by M.SATHYANARAYANAN, J.) The official respondents in
W.P.(MD).No.15904 of 2018 are the appellants.
2. The first respondent/writ petitioner had filed the said writ petition praying for a Writ of
Mandamus directing the appellants/official respondents to re-fix the pension by taking into account,
50% of part time services rendered by the Vocational Instructors between 11.08.1988 and
05.10.1996, along with the regular service in the light of the order dated 09.04.2014, passed in
W.P.No. 16771 of 2013, based on his representation dated 23.06.2017.
3. In the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition, the writ petitioner would state that he was
appointed as a Double Part Time Vocational Instructor on 11.08.1988, at Government Higher
Secondary School, http://www.judis.nic.in Mallanginaru, Virudhunagar District and his services
were regularised vide proceedings dated 05.01.1998, from 05.10.1996 onwards and having attained
the age of superannuation on 04.06.2012, he retired from service.
4. The writ petitioner would further aver that at a later point of time, he became aware of the fact
that this Court, vide order, dated 16.04.2009 in W.P.No.39177 of 2002, had directed the concerned
official respondents to count 50% of the part-time services rendered by the persons similarly placed
like that of the petitioner for the purpose of calculating the pension. The said writ petition came to
be allowed and a challenge made to the said order by filing W.A.No.1702 of 2010, also came to be
dismissed on 20.09.2010, so also, the Special Leave Petition preferred by the said writ petitioner.
5. The petitioner in this regard, has submitted a representation and despite receipt and
acknowledgement, no order has been passed and hence, he came forward to file the writ petition.
Similar matters were grouped and taken up together by the learned Single Judge and the learned
Single Judge, by common order dated 23.07.2018, had exhaustively analysed the factual aspects and
the legal position as well as all the earlier decisions rendered in this regard and disposed of a batch
of cases in W.P(MD)Nos.1910 of 2016, etc., and it is http://www.judis.nic.in relevant to extract
hereunder paragraph 10:
“10. Accordingly, all these writ petitions are ordered and insofar as some of the writ
petitions ie., W.P.(MD) Nos.15469 to 15476/2018, where rejection orders have been
challenged, the said impugned orders are hereby quashed and the said writ petitions
are also ordered in the terms of the said order dated 09.07.2018 by giving the

The State Of Tamil Nadu vs S.Durairaj .. 1St on 13 August, 2020
following directions:
"the respective respondents in each of the writ petitions are hereby directed to take
into account the 50% of the past services rendered by each of the petitioners either as
Vocational Instructors or any other employment either as a Part Time / Full time /
adhoc / temporary / daily wages employees before they brought in under the regular
time scale of pay on permanent basis or absorption and by calculating the said 50% of
their past service, pension eligibility and pension enhancement or difference of pay
and pension shall be calculated and disbursed in favour of the respective petitioners.
After fixing the revised pension by taking into account the past 50% services, the
revised pension arrears shall be calculated and to be disbursed to the petitioners
within a period of 12 weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. It is
needless to mention that the petitioners shall continue to receive the revised
pension."
No costs. Consequently connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed."

6. Challenging the legality of the said order passed in W.P.(MD).No. 15904 of 2018, the present Writ
Appeal is filed.
7. The learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the appellants/official respondents has
drawn the attention of this Court to the common judgment dated 06.04.2018 in W.A.No.882 of
2017, etc., batch [Government of Tamil Nadu, represented by its Secretary to Government, School
Education Department, Chennai – 9 and Others v. K.Pachaiyappan and other] and it is the forceful
submission of the learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the appellants/official
respondents that the Division Bench while disposing of the Writ Appeal had shifted the cut-off date
as the delivery of the said judgment, viz., 06.04.2018 and admittedly, the affidavit in the writ
petition came to the sworn only on 17.07.2018, which is beyond cut-off date and that apart, though
the writ petitioner had attained the age of superannuation on 04.06.2012, had waited for nearly six
years on the sidelines and after knowing about the disposal of the cases, suddenly jumped into
bandwagon and claimed relief and since the respondent/writ petitioner is guilty of delay and laches,
he is not entitled to get any relief in this writ appeal. http://www.judis.nic.in
8. During the course of arguments, the attention of this Court was also invited to the decision
rendered by a Full Bench of this Court in Government of Tamil Nadu, Represented by its Secretary
to Government, Public Works Department and others v. R.Kaliyamoorthy, reported in (2019) 6 CTC
705, wherein, one of the issues is relating to the counting of 50% of the service for the purpose of
terminal benefits, in the light of the proviso to Rule 2 of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 and in
paragraph 45, answered the references as follows:
“45. In the light of the above, we answer the reference as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126353974/ 3
The State Of Tamil Nadu vs S.Durairaj .. 1St on 13 August, 2020
i) Those who are freshly appointed on or after 01.04.2003 are not entitled to pension
in view of proviso to Rule 2 of Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 inserted by
G.O.Ms.No.259 dated 06.08.2003
(ii) Those government servants/employees appointed prior to 01.04.2003 whether
on temporary or permanent basis in terms of Rule 10 (a) (i) of Tamil Nadu State and
Subordinate Service Rules will be entitled to get pension as per the Tamil Nadu
Pension Rules, 1978.
(iii) In case, a government employee/servant had also rendered service in Non-Provincialised
service, or on consolidated pay or http://www.judis.nic.in on honorarium or daily wage basis and if
such services were regularised before 01.04.2003, half of such service rendered shall be counted for
the purpose of conferment of pensionary benefits.
(iv) Those government servants who were appointed in the aforesaid four categories before the cut
off date and later appointed under Rule 10 (a) (i) of Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service Rules
before 01.04.2003 and absorbed into regular service after 01.04.2003 will not be entitled to count
half of their past service for the purpose of determination of qualifying service for pension.
(v) Those government servants who were appointed in the aforesaid four categories before
01.04.2003 but were absorbed in regular service after 01.04.2003 will not be entitled to count half
of their past service for the purpose of determination of qualifying service for pension."
9. No doubt, the writ petitioner had approached the Court with a few months delay and it is not in
dispute that but for the fixation of cut-off date, he would have been entitled to the benefits of service
rendered by him as a Double Part Time Vocational Instructor. The learned Judge in the impugned
common order had also referred to the above cited common judgment dated 06.04.2018, made in
W.A.No.882 of 2017 etc., and having noted the fact that persons http://www.judis.nic.in similarly
placed have been granted the benefits and also taking note of various pronouncements of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, had held that the writ petitioners are entitled to such benefits.
10. Admittedly, the fact of the case would disclose that the petitioner had approached the Court with
a delay of three months and in the light of answering of the references in paragraph No.45 of the
above cited Full Bench judgment [(2019) 6 CTC 705] (supra), this Court finds no merit in this Writ
Appeal. However, it is made clear that if at all any future claim is made by any persons who are
similarly placed like that of the writ petitioners who had worked as Single/Double Part Time
Vocational Instructors, they are not entitled for any interest on the settlement of the retiral/terminal
benefits.
11. In the result, Writ Appeal is dismissed, subject to the above observations, confirming the the
order dated 23.07.2018, passed in W.P(MD)No.15904 of 2018. No costs. Consequently, the
connected civil miscellaneous petition is also dismissed.
