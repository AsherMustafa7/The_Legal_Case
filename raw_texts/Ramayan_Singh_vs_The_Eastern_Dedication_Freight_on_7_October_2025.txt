Ramayan Singh vs The Eastern Dedication Freight ... on 7 October, 2025
The appellant has assailed the order of learned
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1103 of 2023 dt.07-10-2025
2/5
Single Judge dated 21.08.2023 passed in CWJC No. 5311/2023.
2. Core issue involved in the present lis is whether the
appellant is entitled to have the compensation and other
ancillary benefits on account of acquisition of his land under the
new Act, 2013 or under the old Act.
3. The learned Single Judge has taken note of Section
24(2) of RFCTLARRA, 2013 and proceeded to draw an inference
that appellant has been paid 50% of the compensation prior to
01.01.2015
, therefore, appellant is entitled to whatever the compensation and other ancillary benefits only in
terms of old Act.
4. Feeling aggrieved by the aforementioned order of the learned Single Judge, the appellant has
presented this L.P.A.
5. Para -3 and 6 of the impugned dated 21.08.2023 reads as under:-
"3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the copy of award of the petitioner
is dated 16.02.2016 whereas a letter has been issued by the respondent no.1 i.e.
Eastern Dedication Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited on 25.05.2015 in
which it has been decided that entitlement matrix shall be applicable for awards
(20F) declared after 01.01.2015 in accordance with the Right to Fair Compensation
and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1103 of 2023 dt.07-10-2025 Act, 2013 (Act No. 30 of 2013)
(hereinafter referred to as the "RFCTLARRA, 2013"). He further submits that by the
said decision dated 31.01.2023 the claim of petitioner has been rejected after
direction passed by this Hon'ble Court. By a conclusive part it has been decided by
District Land Acquisition Officer that proviso of Section 24 (2) of the RFCTLARRA,
2013 is not applicable in the present case. He also submits that in the light of date of
award as well as letter issued by respondent no.1, the decision is not good and this
order should be set-aside.

4. -------
5.-------
6. If the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner shall be accepted then the
letter dated 25.05.2015 shall have to prevail upon Section 24 (2) of the RFCTLARRA,
2013. This situation is not permissible in the eye of law because the said letter dated
25.05.2015 issued by respondent no.1 shall always be in connivance of Section 24 (2)
of the RFCTLARRA, 2013. The order dated 31.01.2023 passed by District Collector
Acquisition Officer, Kaimur (Bhabua) has been passed in accordance with Section 24
(2) of the RFCTLARRA, 2013 as payment of more than 50% of the compensation
amount has already made as well as the date of award is prior to 01.01.2015.
Therefore, the order dated 31.01.2023 passed by District Collector Acquisition
Officer, Kaimur Patna High Court L.P.A No.1103 of 2023 dt.07-10-2025 (Bhabua)
may appears to be in contradiction with letter dated 25.05.2015 (Annexure No.4 to
the writ petition) but actually it is in consonance with Section 24 (2) of the
RFCTLARRA, 2013. Hence, the present Writ Petition stands dismissed and the order
dated 31.01.2023 passed by District Collector Acquisition Officer, Kaimur (Bhabua) is
sustained".
6. Firstly, we have noticed that the respondents have not filed their counter statement in CWJC.
Under what circumstances, learned Single Judge has drawn an inference that appellant has been
paid 50% of the compensation amount prior to 01.01.2015 is not forthcoming.
7. Learned counsel for the appellant, on instruction, submitted that appellant has not been paid any
compensation pursuant to the award in the year 2012 read with 2016.
8. In the light of the aforementioned factual aspects of the matter, the appellant has remedy of filing
Civil Review instead of filing L.P.A
9. Accordingly, the present L.P.A. stands disposed of reserving the liberty to the appellant to invoke
a Civil Review.
10. Learned Single Judge is requested to condone the delay in respect of the time spent in the
present L.P.A. in the light of Section 14 of the Limitation Act and decide Civil Patna High Court
L.P.A No.1103 of 2023 dt.07-10-2025 Review at the earliest in view of the fact that the award is of
the year 2012 read with in the year 2016.
11. Pending interlocutory application/s, if any, also stands disposed of.
