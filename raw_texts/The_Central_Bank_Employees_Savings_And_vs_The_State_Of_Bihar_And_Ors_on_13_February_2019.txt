ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 13-02-2019
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners; learned A.P.P.
for the State and learned counsel for the Opposite Party No. 9 in
Criminal Misc. No. 14884 of 2014.
2. Despite service of notice on Opposite Party No. 2 in
Cr. Misc. No. 6586 of 2017, nobody appeared on his behalf when
the matter was taken up and heard.
Re.: Criminal Miscellaneous No. 14884 of 2014
3. Learned counsel for the petitioners at the very outset
submitted that he was restricting his prayer with regard to K. Hat
(Sahayak) P.S. Case No. 204 of 2007 arising out of Complaint
Case No. 919 of 2007.
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019

4. The petitioners have moved the Court under Section
482 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Code') being aggrieved by the proceeding of K.
Hat (Sahayak) P.S. Case No. 204 of 2007 arising out of Complaint
Case No. 919 of 2007.
5. The petitioners at various points of time were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81848591/ 3
The Central Bank Employees Savings And ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 February, 2019
members of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank Employees
Savings and Credit Self Supported Co-operative Society Ltd.,
(hereinafter referred to as the 'Society') with its principal office at
Supaul, except for petitioner no. 5, who was the Chief Executive
Officer of the Society.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the
Complaint Case No. 919 of 2007 was filed by the Opposite Party
No. 9 claiming to be a depositor and making a grievance that
despite the deposit having attained maturity, the money was not
returned to him. Learned counsel submitted that in the said case,
the Branch Manager and other employees of the society were also
made accused. Learned counsel submitted that the members of the
Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Society
have no role in managing of the accounts which is the
responsibility of the local Branch headed by the Branch Manager.
It was submitted that even the bye-laws do not confer any
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019
5/13
responsibility upon the petitioners for such transactions which are
to be dealt with at the local level. Learned counsel submitted that
the local Branch had never referred the matter to the Board of
Directors or the Chief Executive Officer of the Society for
releasing any payment or amount and in such view of the matter
also they cannot held responsible for any wrong doing. It was
submitted that even if the grievance is accepted, still it would be a
matter of repayment of the maturity amount which is purely civil
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81848591/ 4
The Central Bank Employees Savings And ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 February, 2019
in nature being a money claim and unless it is established by the
Audit or otherwise that the funds of the Society have been
misappropriated by the petitioners, no criminal proceeding can lie.
Learned counsel submitted that after filing of the complaint case/
institution of F.I.R., there has been a significant development by
which also the petitioners are now protected from the present
criminal proceeding. It was submitted that in terms of the liberty
given to one Bhikhari Thakur, who was a similarly situated
investor, by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court on 03.02.2012 in
C.W.J.C. No. 3179 of 2008, the Registrar, Co-operative Societies,
Bihar, by order dated 16.04.2013 had directed for liquidation of
the Society and appointed the District Magistrate, Supaul as the
liquidator. It was submitted that the same was also published in the
Bihar Gazette on 03.05.2013. Learned counsel submitted that once
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019
6/13
such development has taken place, the entire scenario had changed
and Section 50 of The Bihar Self-Supporting Co-operative
Societies Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') shall
come into play. Learned counsel referred to the provision of
Section 50(2) of the Act which is a bar for either institution or
continuation of any suit or other legal proceeding, once a Society
is in liquidation, except by leave of the Registrar and subject to
such terms as he may impose. It was submitted that in the present
case, once an order of liquidation had been passed and liquidator
appointed, the pending complaint/ criminal case cannot proceed,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81848591/ 5
The Central Bank Employees Savings And ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 February, 2019
which, in effect, would mean that the same has to terminate.
Learned counsel drew the attention of the Court to Section 47 of
the Act, which relates to the power of liquidator and sub-sections
(2) and (3) of the same which authorize him to take action against
any person who may have concealed, withheld or misappropriated
any property of the Society. It was submitted that what has been
alleged in the present case, such cause of action gives authority to
the liquidator under the aforesaid provision of the Act to proceed
in the matter, in accordance with law, and, thus, there cannot be
multiplicity of litigations which even otherwise stand barred under
Section 50(2) of the Act. Learned counsel submitted that the claim
of the complainant/ informant is now to be looked into and dealt
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019
7/13
with by the liquidator and if such exercise reveals that there has
been any misconduct or misappropriation or embezzlement, it is
for the liquidator concerned to take/ initiate appropriate action/
proceeding before the appropriate forum, in accordance with law.
It was submitted that in the present case, the liquidator being the
District Magistrate of Supaul is fully competent to take action as
may be required in the facts and circumstances which come to his
notice.
7. Learned A.P.P. submitted that though the complaint
case was registered much prior to the Society going into
liquidation, but in view of the bar imposed by Section 50 (2) of the
Act, such proceeding cannot continue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81848591/ 6
The Central Bank Employees Savings And ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 February, 2019
8. Learned counsel for the Opposite Party No. 9
submitted that such proceeding can continue for the reason that the
term "other legal proceedings" mentioned in Section 50(2) of the
Act does not apply to criminal proceeding. In support of the same,
learned counsel referred to the decisions of Delhi High Court dated
19.01.2001
in the case of D.K. Kapur vs. Reserve Bank of India & Ors. the relevant being at paragraph no. 14,
where it was held that under Section 446(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 assessment proceedings
before the Income Tax Officer was not barred. He further referred to a decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019 case of
Parbatbhai Aahir v. State of Gujarat reported as AIR 2017 SC 4843, the relevant being at paragraph
no. 15, for the proposition that the High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the
offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour and that
the consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the
balance. However, on a direct query of the Court as to how the judgment in the case of D. K. Kapur
(supra) is relevant since Section 446 (2) of the Companies Act, which relates to the jurisdiction of
the Court which is winding up the Company, and which is not the issue involved in the present case,
learned counsel did not have any answer. Similarly, with regard to the proposition emanating from
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Parbatbhai Aahir (supra), on a query of the
Court as to how such decision was relevant in the present case since there was no consideration with
regard to there being any statutory bar and the judgment being rendered in a situation where the
maintainability of the criminal proceeding was not in question, which also is not an issue in the
present case, again learned counsel could not show to the Court the relevance or applicability of the
aforesaid judgment. Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019
9. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for
the parties, the Court finds that a case for interference has been made out. Clearly, as of now, due to
the development having taken place after filing of the complaint/ F.I.R., by which a liquidator has
been appointed under Section 45 of the Act, there is a bar under Section 50(2) of the Act to
continuance of pending proceedings as well as institution of fresh one without the leave of the
Registrar. The contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that Section 50(2) read with sub
sections (2) and (3) of Section 47 of the Act clearly mandate that once a liquidator is appointed, all
such grievances have to be raised before the liquidator and only he is authorized to take appropriate
remedial measures before the appropriate forum with regard to any act of misappropriation of any
property of the Society and also any wrong doing on the part of any person, which obviously
includes the petitioners also, is well placed.
10. Sections 47 and 50 of the Act, being relevant are reproduced hereinbelow:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81848591/ 7
The Central Bank Employees Savings And ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 February, 2019
47. Powers of liquidator. - (1) The liquidator may-
(a) retain lawyers, accountants, engineers, appraises and other professional advisors;
(b) bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative action or
proceeding in the name and on behalf of the Co-operative Society;
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019
(c) carry on the business of the Co-
operative Society as required for an orderly liquidation;
(d) sell by public auction any property of the Cooperative Society;
(e) do all acts and execute any documents in the name and on behalf of the Co-operative Society;
(f) borrow money on the security of the property of the Co-operative Society;
(g) settle or compromise any claims by or against the Co-operative Society;
and
(h) take all other steps that he considers necessary for the liquidation of the Co-operative Society
and distribution of its properties and funds.
(2) Where a liquidator has reason to believe that any person has in his possession or under his
control, has concealed, withheld or misappropriated any property of the Co-operative Society he
may apply to the court for proceeding into the matter in accordance with law.
(3) Where the proceeding under sub-
section (2) discloses that a person has concealed, withheld or misappropriated property of the Co-
operative Society, the Court may order that person to restore the property of pay compensation to
the liquidator on behalf of the Co-operative Society.
4. No liquidator or his relatives shall purchase, directly or indirectly any part of the stock- in-trade,
debts or assets of the Co-operative Society.
xxxxx
50. Bar of jurisdiction of court. - (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, on Civil or
Revenue Court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of any dispute required by section 40 to be
referred to the Cooperative Tribunal, or recovery proceedings under section 41 or dissolution under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81848591/ 8
The Central Bank Employees Savings And ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 February, 2019
sections 43 and 44.
(2) While a Co-operative Society is in liquidation under section 45, no suit or other legal proceedings
shall be proceeded with or instituted against the liquidator as much (sic) or against the Co-operative
Society or any member thereof on any Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019
matter touching the affairs of the Co-operative Society, except by leave of the Registrar and subject
to such terms as he may impose."
11.From the aforesaid, it is clear that the terms "other legal proceedings" referred in Section 50(2) of
the Act shall cover criminal proceedings also. Further, while defining the power of the liquidator in
Section 47, sub sections (2) and (3) of the same give him the power to proceed against any person
for concealing, withholding or misappropriating any property of the Society. Moreover, Section
47(1)(b) also confers on the liquidator the power to bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal
or administrative action or proceeding in the name and on behalf of the Co-operative Society. This
clearly provides that if any criminal conduct is found attributable to any person connected with the
affairs of the Society, the liquidator has the power to institute criminal proceedings also. In that view
of the matter also, the present complaint case is not fit to continue.
12. Further, as discussed earlier, the Court finds that the judgments in D.K. Kapur (supra) and
Parbatbhai Aahir (supra) would not apply to the facts and circumstances of the present case.
13. For reasons aforesaid, the application is allowed. The entire criminal proceeding arising out of K.
Hat (Sahayak) P.S. Case No. 204 of 2007 (Complaint Case No. 919 of 2007), Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019 including all consequential orders which may have been
passed, as far as it relates to the petitioners, stand quashed. However, the Court would observe that
it would be open to the Opposite Party No. 9 to move before the liquidator with regard to his
grievance which has to be considered by the liquidator, at the appropriate stage, in accordance with
law.
Re.: Criminal Miscellaneous No. 6586 of 2017
14. The petitioner has moved the Court for the following relief:
"That the present application is being filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing
of order dated 11.05.2007, by which Learned S.D.J.M., Purnia has taken cognizance
against thirteen accused persons including the petitioner under Section 409 of
Cr.P.C. in connection with complaint case, bearing C.A. No. 1848 of 2006."
15. It is not in dispute that the basic issue which has been decided in the other case is the same in the
present case and also relates to the same Society, except for the fact that the then Branch Manager of
the Society at Purnea has filed this case against the petitioner who was a member of the Board of
Directors of the Society at the relevant time.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81848591/ 9
The Central Bank Employees Savings And ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 February, 2019
16. Thus, the Court finds that the present case shall also be governed by the decision rendered in the
connected case.
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.14884 of 2014 dt.13-02-2019
17. Accordingly, adopting the reasons in the case decided above, the present application also stands
allowed. The entire criminal proceeding arising out of C.A. No. 1848 of 2006, including the order
taking cognizance dated 11.05.2007, as far as it relates to the petitioner, stands quashed.
