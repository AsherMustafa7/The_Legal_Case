Jitendra Singh Narwariya vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 30 September, 2019
Notice have issued to respondents.
Respondent No.5 is Municipal Corporation Gwalior submits that the Corporation did not grant any
sanction for alleged construction. It is urged that the construction plan sanctioned by the Town and
Country Planning Department of the State was later on revoked on 14.11.2018. It is contended that
the revocation has led the Municipal Corporation serve notice on 13.3.2019 and 18.3.2019 for
demolition of the structure.
It was later informed and not disputed by the respondent no.7 in its return that the structures have
since been removed. There is no construction raised by the respondent no.7 over the Survey No.139,
however, certain Kachha construction in shape of Tin Shade was there, the same was constructed
after getting the N.O.C from the TNCP, that in shape of Kachha Construction for raising the
construction as per the map sanctioned by the TNCP, after obtaining the permission of the
Municipal Corporation. However, the Kachha construction has been removed by the Municipal
Corporation, now there is no construction over the land in shape of construction. The THE HIGH
COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P.No.1793/2019 (PIL) (Jitendra Singh Narwariya Vs. State of
M.P. and others) NOC from the TNCP is subsequently cancelled. The said fact came into the
knowledge after the notice to the present petition. An application for recalling the order has already
been moved before the concerning authorities the same is still pending for consideration. The
cancellation was made because of civil dispute between the private parties which has no connection
with the government land or the government. There is no loss to the public exchequer made,
because of Tin Shade over the private land by the private parties. The Tin Shade was there in the
anticipation of the permission of the Municipal Corporation after obtaining the NOC from the
TNCP. So far as the Annexure P/1 is concern which was shown as receipt of 1.1.2019 and PIL was
filed before this court in the same month within 25 days, that itself shows the eagerness and hurry
on the part of the petitioner to get demolish the Tin Shade and because of this the present petition
