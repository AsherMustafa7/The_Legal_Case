CORAM: THE HON'BLE MR JUSTICE M.NAGAPRASANNA
CAV ORDER
The petitioners - husband and wife, are at the doors of this
Court calling in question an order of arrest, arrest memo, grounds
of arrest and reasons so depicted to believe that the petitioners are
in possession of proceeds of crime and consequently declare that
the arrest and detention of the 1stpetitioner is illegal and void. As a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 2
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
consequence thereof, a declaration is also sought that the arrest
and detention of the 1st petitioner is illegal and seek direction to
release the 1stpetitioner from prison.
2. For the sake of convenience, unless otherwise referred to
by their rank in the writ petition, the 1st petitioner would be
referred to, as the petitioner, in this order.
3. Facts adumbrated are as follows:-
The petitioner, at the relevant point in time, was an elected
Director of the District Central Co-operative Bank ('DCC' Bank) from
1997 and has also been the Chairman of the DCC Bank,
4
Shivamogga, for over 19 years. The petitioner claims to be active
in public field and has contested elections to the Thirthahalli
assembly constituency in the previous elections and lost. On
17-07-2014, a crime in Crime No.325 of 2014 is registered against
the employees of DCC Bank and investigation would commence in
the said crime by the jurisdictional Police and later owing to
magnitude of the alleged crime, the matter was transferred to the
Crime Investigation Department of the State i.e., CID. The
petitioner was not named as an accused. During investigation, on
the score that there were some materials against the petitioner, he
was later added as accused No.15 and is said to have been taken
into custody for custodial interrogation. The Police, after
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 3
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
investigation, file a charge sheet against all employees, but not
against the petitioner. The petitioner was dropped from the array of
accused due to lack of evidence.
4. Since charge sheet was filed in Crime No.325 of 2014, the
further proceedings were taken up. There were other crimes also
registered in C.C.Nos.2634 of 2019, 2775 of 2019 and 2776 of
2019. In C.C.No.2634 of 2019, there were two accused - one the
5
Manager and the other the custodian of the pledged articles of the
City Branch of the DDC Bank in Shivamogga, in C.C.No.2776 of
2019 there were 9 accused and in C.C.No.2775 of 2019 there were
11 accused. But the petitioner was never an accused in any of these
crimes. The accused in C.C.No.2776 of 2019 file a discharge
application and those accused come to be discharged. This order
was challenged by the Bank as well as the State by filing a revision
before the Court of Session. The revision so filed is allowed and the
matter is remitted back to the hands of the concerned Court, which
had discharged the accused, for reconsideration. Against the said
order of remand, four writ petitions are preferred in Writ Petition
Nos. 12423 of 2021, 12426 of 2021, 12451 of 2021 and
Crl.P.No.3006 of 2021. It appears that this Court had granted an
interim order of stay of the order of remand.
5. In the interregnum, it appears, that the petitioner was
disqualified to function or contest the elections of DCC Bank. The
said order comes to be challenged in an appeal filed under Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 4
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
106 of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 ('KCS Act'
for short) and the order of disqualification was set aside. In the
6
meanwhile, to take action under the KCS Act permission was
granted for prosecution of the petitioner under Section 111 of the
KCS Act, authorizing an officer to file a complaint against the
petitioner. Now emerges a crime in Crime No.16 of 2021 filed
before the Jayanagar Police Station, Shivamogga for offences
punishable under Sections 120B, 168, 200, 403, 405, 409, 418,
419, 420, 424, 425, 427, 467, 468, 474 r/w 34 of the IPC and for
offences under Sections 109(11)(14)(15) of the KCS Act. The
petitioner challenges registration of crime invoking the jurisdiction
of this Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The petition comes to
be allowed and the crime in Crime No.16 of 2021 stood quashed
qua all the accused in respect of the offences under the IPC. Insofar
as the offences under the KCS Act, the petitioner was reserved
liberty to pursue appeal before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal.
The appeal so filed by the petitioner is also dismissed by the
concerned Tribunal in terms of its order dated 16-02-2021.
6. As observed hereinabove, crime in Crime No.325 of 2014
in which the name of the petitioner had been dropped, further
investigation was taken up and an additional charge sheet was filed
7
under Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C., now bringing the petitioner
into the crime for offences punishable under Sections 409 and 202
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 5
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
r/w 36 of the IPC. The learned Magistrate before whom the
additional charge sheet is filed is yet to take cognizance in respect
of the additional charge sheet against the petitioner. One more
crime was registered against the petitioner invoking offences
punishable under Section 13(1) and 13(2) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988. This was registered in the year 2014 itself.
The police, after investigation, keep the charge sheet ready and
seek sanction to prosecute the petitioner. The petitioner prefers
Writ Petition No.10108 of 2024 and it appears that an interim of
stay is operating in the said case. The issue in the lis does not
relate to the merit of the crime under the Prevention of Corruption
Act or the crime in Crime No.325 of 2014.
7. The respondent/Directorate of Enforcement conducts a
search in the residential premises of the petitioner in Thirthahalli
Taluk on 05-10-2023 and also at other places and issues summons
to the petitioner for appearance. This brings the petitioner to this
Court in Writ Petition No.22780 of 2023 against the summons so
8
issued after registration of ECIR and also another writ petition in
Writ Petition No.22989 of 2023 challenging the additional charge
sheet so filed arraigning the petitioner as accused No.15 in Crime
No.325 of 2024. Both the writ petitions so filed come to be
dismissed by a coordinate Bench of this Court in terms of its order
dated 20-02-2024. The petitioner prefers a writ appeal against the
said order in Writ Appeal No.497 of 2024. The writ appeal is also
dismissed by the Division Bench affirming the order of the learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 6
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
single Judge by its order dated 22-03-2025.
8. After the dismissal of the writ appeal springs the
proceedings in the subject petition. It is the averment in the
petition that the petitioner had an eye infection and wanted to
undergo a surgery. At that point in time, the officers of Directorate
of Enforcement coming to know that the petitioner was staying in
the Bank's guest house gained entry into the room of the petitioner
and is said to have been detained and taken to the office of the
Directorate of Enforcement and later produced before the Court of
Session on 09-04-2025 at 2.30 p.m. It is then the petitioner was
given the arrest order, arrest memo, grounds of arrest and reasons
9
to believe that he was in possession of proceeds of crime. The
petitioner being in custody is now before this Court in the subject
petition.
9. Heard Sri Jayakumar S. Patil, learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioners and Sri K. Arvind Kamath, learned
Additional Solicitor General of India appearing for the respondents.
10. The learned senior counsel Sri Jayakumar S. Patil
appearing for petitioners would vehemently contend that the
grounds so found in the grounds of arrest are completely
erroneous, and they do not relate to predicate offence. The
predicate office against the petitioner in which he is drawn back by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 7
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
filing an additional charge sheet is Crime No.325 of 2014 or for
offences under Sections 409 and 202 of the IPC. Both those
offences are not scheduled offences under the provisions of the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 ('the Act' for short).
Therefore, the Directorate of Enforcement has no jurisdiction to
initiate proceedings and conduct search or seizure, as is done in the
case at hand. He would submit that the only scheduled offence is
the one under the Prevention of Corruption Act and sanction
10
granted to prosecute is stayed by a coordinate Bench of this Court.
Therefore, the act of Directorate of Enforcement, the moment writ
appeal comes to be dismissed, is misuse and abuse of the power
and runs completely contrary to the judgments of the Apex Court in
the cases of ARVIND KEJRIWAL v. DIRECTORATE OF
ENFORCEMENT1, VIJAY MADANLAL CHOUDHARY v. UNION OF
INDIA2 and MANTRI DEVELOPERS v. DIRECTORATE OF
ENDORCEMENT3.
10.1. The learned senior counsel would take this Court
through the grounds in the grounds of arrest to contend that there
is nothing that would indicate that it is proceeds of crime against
the petitioner and not even a semblance against his wife, the 2nd
petitioner. The learned senior counsel would seek to contend that
there are no facts or reasons to believe that the petitioner or his
wife is in possession of proceeds of crime, even prima facie.
Therefore, he would contend that the arrest of the petitioner,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 8
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
search and seizure thereto are contrary to law; contrary to law for
1
(2025) 2 SCC 248
2
2022 SCC OnLine SC 929
3
2022 SCC Online Kar 1831
11
the reason that the grounds found in the grounds of arrest are
contrary to law, they cannot form the grounds of arrest and the
reasons to believe run counter to Section 19 of the Act. He would
contend that the Directorate of Enforcement cannot conduct
investigation for offences under the IPC or under the Prevention of
Corruption Act. They have to conduct investigation only insofar as
proceeds of crime, but the Directorate of Enforcement here is
wanting to conduct investigation into the entirety of the offences
against the petitioner. He would, therefore, contend that the entire
proceedings are illegal.
11. Per contra, the learned Additional Solicitor General of
India Sri K. Arvind Kamath appearing for the Directorate of
Enforcement would refute the submissions to contend that the
moment summons was issued, the petitioner challenges the
summons. By a detailed order, it comes to be dismissed by a
learned single Judge of this Court in terms of his order dated
20-02-2024 holding that summons would not become a subject
matter of challenge. This was challenged before the Division Bench
by the petitioner in Writ Appeal No.497 of 2024. The Division Bench
12
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 9
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
affirms the order of the learned single Judge and holds that
summons cannot become a subject matter of challenge. It is after
that proceedings are taken up by the Directorate of Enforcement,
as ECIR had been registered way back in the year 2021. The
Directorate of Enforcement did have the reason to believe that the
petitioner and his wife were in possession of proceeds of crime and,
therefore, prior to taking the petitioner into custody all norms that
are necessary to be followed i.e., the grounds of arrest and the
reasons to believe were completely complied. There is twin
compliance in its entirety in the case at hand.
11.1. The learned ASGI would take this Court through the
elaborately drawn reasons to believe to contend that there is huge
misappropriation of funds by the petitioner. The 1st petitioner,
being the Chairman of the bank, had appointed the Manager, who
under the instructions of the 1st petitioner caused misappropriation
of an amount totaling to (cid:128)62,77,63,560/- and in the process, large
amount of proceeds of crime is generated. The modus operandi
involved was opening of 785 fraudulent gold loan accounts without
the knowledge of accounts holders, by utilizing fake, fabricated and

13
forged documents and syphoning off gold ornaments by replacing
them with gold quoted ornaments and the assets obtained by the
petitioner has grown exponentially or tenfold after he comes into
the umbrella of DCC Bank. The assets are huge in number and,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 10
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
therefore, there is no doubt that the petitioners are in possession of
proceeds of crime. No fault can be found with the arrest of the
petitioner. The arrest of the petitioner was available in law. It is
only that he should be served with grounds of arrest and prima
facie reasons to believe that he is in possession of proceeds of
crime. He would vehemently refute every one of the submissions
and seek dismissal of the petition.
12. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made by the learned senior counsel, and the Additional Solicitor
General of India and have perused the material on record.
13. The afore-narrated facts are a matter of record. The
crimes that are registered against the petitioner, how he goes out
and comes back into the web of crime are all narrated hereinabove.
The issue in the lis does not relate to merit of the predicate offence.
It pertains to the proceedings by the Directorate of Enforcement in
the ECIR so registered against the petitioners. An ECIR comes to

be registered in the year 2021 and summons for the first time was
issued in the year 2023. Writ Petition No.12451 of 2021 and
connected cases were filed seeking quashment of proceedings
which arose out of crime No.325 of 2014. Writ Petition No.22780 of
2023 was preferred by the petitioner challenging the summons so
issued in ECIR 5 of 2021 dated 06-10-2023 asking the petitioner to
appear. The coordinate Bench by an elaborate order considering the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of VIJAY MADANLAL
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 11
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
CHOUDHARY (supra) dismisses all the petitions on 20-02-2024,
including the writ petition filed by the petitioner challenging the
summons so issued on 06-10-2023. The reasons so rendered in
rejecting the ECIR are as follows:
"REASONING FOR THE FINDING IN W.P
No.22780/2023
23. It is now settled in view of the judgment of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Vijay Madanlal
Chowdhary (referred supra) that an offence under the
PML Act would be attracted only when any of the
offences mentioned in the schedule to the PML Act is
registered. The authorities under the PML Act cannot
prosecute any person on notional basis or on the
assumption that a scheduled offence has been
committed unless it is so registered with the
jurisdictional Police or pending enquiry or trial by way
of a complaint before a competent forum. It is also
equally well settled that the registration of an ECIR
cannot be equated to the registration of an FIR as the
15
said document is an internal document for the
purposes of the Enforcement Directorate. The
proceeds of crime as defined under Section 2(1)(u) of
the PML Act is dependent on illegal gain of property as
a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled
offence. The position of law is well settled that when once
the accused is acquitted in the predicate offence or if it is
quashed by a Court of competent jurisdiction or if he is
discharged, there can be no offence under the provisions of
the PML Act. With these prefatory notes, if the case on hand
is perused, the petitioner was the Chairman of D.C.C. Bank
during the period between 1997-98, 1999-2010, 2011-2014,
2015-2020. It was during his tenure that a statutory
audit disclosed several deficiencies and lapses in the
Town branch of the D.C.C. Bank inasmuch as the
accused No.1 was appointed as a Senior Assistant at
the branch and though was promoted between 2005
and 2014, yet was continued in the Town branch of the
Bank though there weren't any promotional post at the
Town branch of the D.C.C. Bank. Separate charge
sheets are filed against accused No.1 and others for
sanctioning gold loan to friends and relatives by
accepting fake ornaments and in many cases, gold
loans were advanced without getting the gold pledged.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 12
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
In many cases, it was alleged that the loans were
disbursed to many customers who were the relatives
of accused No.1. It was alleged that accused No.1
with the help of accused No.15 had misappropriated
Rs.62,00,00,000/- belonging to the D.C.C Bank and
accused No.15 had not taken any action. The petitioner
was charge sheeted for the offences punishable under
Sections 409, 202 read with Section 36 of IPC in C.C.
No.2775/2021 which were not schedule offences
under the PML Act. Therefore, the apprehension of
accused No.15 / petitioner that he is sought to be
prosecuted under the PML Act is wholly unwarranted
and baseless. The petitioner was issued with a
summons by the respondents to appear before them.
The power to issue summons under the PML Act is found in
Section 50 of the PML Act which is akin to Section 61 of
Cr.P.C and reads as follows:
16
"50. Powers of authorities regarding summons,
production of documents and to give evidence, etc (1)
The Director shall, for the purposes of section 13, have the
same powers as are vested in a civil court under the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) while trying a suit in
respect of the following matters, namely:
(a) discovery and inspection;
(b) enforcing the attendance of any person, including any
officer of a reporting entity, and examining him on oath;
(c) compelling the production of records;
(d) receiving evidence on affidavits;
(e) issuing commissions for examination of witnesses and
documents; and
(f) any other matter which may be prescribed.
(2) The Director, Additional Director, Joint Director,
Deputy Director or Assistant Director shall have power to
summon any person whose attendance he considers
necessary whether to give evidence or to produce any records
during the course of any investigation or proceeding under
this Act.
(3) All the persons so summoned shall be bound to
attend in person or through authorised agents, as such officer
may direct, and shall be bound to state the truth upon any
subject respecting which they are examined or make
statements, and produce such documents as may be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 13
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
required.
(4) Every proceeding under sub-sections (2) and (3)
shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the
meaning of Section 193 and Section 228 of the Indian Penal
Code (45 of 1860).
(5) Subject to any rules made in this behalf by the
Central Government, any officer referred to in sub-section (2)
may impound and retain in his custody for such period, as he
thinks fit, any records produced before him in any
proceedings under this Act:
17
Provided that an Assistant Director or a Deputy
Director shall not -
(a) impound any records without recording his reasons
for so doing; or
(b) retain in his custody any such records for a period
exceeding three months, without obtaining the previous
approval of the Joint Director."
24. A perusal of Section 50(2) of the PML Act leaves
no doubt that the Enforcement Directorate has the power to
summon any person whose attendance it considers
necessary whether to give evidence or to produce any
records during the course of any investigation or proceeding
under the PML Act.
25. It could be that the Enforcement Directorate
requires the attendance of the petitioner to give evidence or
to produce any records in respect of the schedule offences
committed by the other accused. After all, the allegation
was that the accused No.1 had the benevolence of the
accused No.15 / petitioner herein and therefore, he was
bound to assist the Enforcement Directorate and this did not
in any way prejudice the petitioner. This apart, the
petitioner was accused of an offence in Crime No.4/2014 for
the offences under Section 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(ii)
of the P.C. Act, 1988 and a charge sheet was filed on
20.03.2018. It could be that the summons was issued to the
petitioner in that regard. Under the circumstances, the
petitioner cannot challenge the issuance of summons and his
apprehension that he is sought to be prosecuted for an
offence registered against him in C.C No.2775/2021 under
the PML Act is unwarranted as the offences alleged against
him are not schedule offences under the PML Act. In this
regard, it is apposite to refer to the findings recorded by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Vijay Madanlal
Chowdhary and others:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 14
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
"467. In light of the above analysis, we now proceed to
summarise our conclusion on seminal points in issue in the
following terms: -
18
(i) The question as to whether some of the amendments to
the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 could not have
been enacted by the Parliament by way of a Finance Act has
not been examined in this judgment. The same is left open
for being examined along with or after the decision of the
Larger Bench (seven Judges) of this Court in the case of Rojer
Mathew 705.
(ii) The expression "proceedings" occurring in Clause (na) of
Section 2(1) of the 2002 Act is contextual and is required to
be given expansive meaning to include inquiry procedure
followed by the Authorities of ED, the Adjudicating Authority,
and the Special Court.
(iii) The expression "investigation" in Clause (na) of Section
2(1) of the 2002 Act does not limit itself to the matter of
investigation concerning the offence under the Act and is
interchangeable with the function of "inquiry" to be
undertaken by the Authorities under the Act.
(iv) The Explanation inserted to Clause (u) of Section 2(1) of
the 2002 Act does not travel beyond the main provision
predicating tracking and reaching upto the property derived
or obtained directly or indirectly as a result of criminal activity
relating to a scheduled offence.
(v) (a) Section 3 of the 2002 Act has a wider reach and
captures every process and activity, direct or indirect, in
dealing with the proceeds of crime and is not limited to the
happening of the final act of integration of tainted property in
the formal economy. The Explanation inserted to Section 3 by
way of amendment of 2019 does not expand the purport of
Section 3 but is only clarificatory in nature. It clarifies the
word "and" preceding the expression projecting or claiming as
"or"; and being a clarificatory amendment, it would make no
difference even if it is introduced by way of Finance Act or
otherwise.
(b) Independent of the above, we are clearly of the view that
the expression "and" occurring in Section 3 has to be
construed as "or", to give full play to the said provision so as
to include "every" process or activity indulged into by anyone.
Projecting or claiming the property as untainted property
would constitute an offence of money-laundering on its own,
being an independent process or activity.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 15
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
19
(c) The interpretation suggested by the petitioners, that only
upon projecting or claiming the property in question as
untainted property that the offence of Section 3 would be
complete, stands rejected.
(d) The offence under Section 3 of the 2002 Act is dependent
on illegal gain of property as a result of criminal activity
relating to a scheduled offence. It is concerning the process
or activity connected with such property, which constitutes
the offence of money laundering. The Authorities under the
2002 Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on
the assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed,
unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/or
pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint
before the competent forum. If the person is finally
discharged/acquitted of the scheduled offence or the criminal
case against him is quashed by the Court of competent
jurisdiction, there can be no offence of money-laundering
against him or any one claiming such property being the
property linked to stated scheduled offence through him.
(vi) Section 5 of the 2002 Act is constitutionally valid. It
provides for a balancing arrangement to secure the interests
of the person as also ensures that the proceeds of crime
remain available to be dealt with in the manner provided by
the 2002 Act. The procedural safeguards as delineated by us
hereinabove are effective measures to protect the interests of
person concerned.
(vii) The challenge to the validity of sub-section (4) of Section
8 of the 2002 Act is also rejected subject to Section 8 being
invoked and operated in accordance with the meaning
assigned to it hereinabove.
(viii) The challenge to deletion of proviso to sub-section (1) of
Section 17 of the 2002 Act stands rejected. There are
stringent safeguards provided in Section 17 and Rules framed
thereunder. Moreover, the pre-condition in the proviso to Rule
3(2) of the 2005 Rules cannot be read into Section 17 after
its amendment. The Central Government may take necessary
corrective steps to obviate confusion caused in that regard.
(ix) The challenge to deletion of proviso to sub-section (1) of
Section 18 of the 2002 Act also stands rejected. There are
similar safeguards provided in Section 18. We hold that the
amended provision does not suffer from the vice of
arbitrariness.

Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
(x) The challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 19
of the 2002 Act is also rejected. There are stringent
safeguards provided in Section 19. The provision does not
suffer from the vice of arbitrariness.
(xi) Section 24 of the 2002 Act has reasonable nexus with the
purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act
and cannot be regarded as manifestly arbitrary or
unconstitutional.
(xii) (a) The proviso in Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of
Section 44 of the 2002 Act is to be regarded as directory in
nature and this provision is also read down to mean that the
Special Court may exercise judicial discretion on case-to-case
basis.
(b) We do not find merit in the challenge to Section 44 being
arbitrary or unconstitutional. However, the eventualities
referred to in this section shall be dealt with by the Court
concerned and by the Authority concerned in accordance with
the interpretation given in this judgment.
(xiii) (a) The reasons which weighed with this Court in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah for declaring the twin conditions in Section
45(1) of the 2002 Act, as it stood at the relevant time, as
unconstitutional in no way obliterated the provision from the
statute book; and it was open to the Parliament to cure the
defect noted by this Court so as to revive the same provision
in the existing form.
(b) We are unable to agree with the observations in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah distinguishing the enunciation of the
Constitution Bench decision in Kartar Singh 708; and other
observations suggestive of doubting the perception of
Parliament in regard to the seriousness of the offence of
money-laundering, 706 Supra at Footnote No.3 707 Supra at
Footnote No.3 708 Supra at Footnote No.190 537 including
about it posing serious threat to the sovereignty and integrity
of the country.
(c) The provision in the form of Section 45 of the 2002 Act, as
applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has
direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be
achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of
arbitrariness or unreasonableness.
21
(d) As regards the prayer for grant of bail, irrespective of the
nature of proceedings, including those under Section 438 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 17
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
the 1973 Code or even upon invoking the jurisdiction of
Constitutional Courts, the underlying principles and rigours of
Section 45 may apply.
(xiv) The beneficial provision of Section 436A of the 1973
Code could be invoked by the accused arrested for offence
punishable under the 2002 Act.
(xv) (a) The process envisaged by Section 50 of the 2002 Act
is in the nature of an inquiry against the proceeds of crime
and is not "investigation" in strict sense of the term for
initiating prosecution; 538 and the Authorities under the 2002
Act (referred to in Section 48), are not police officers as such.
(b) The statements recorded by the Authorities under the
2002 Act are not hit by Article 20(3) or Article 21 of the
Constitution of India.
(xvi) Section 63 of the 2002 Act providing for punishment
regarding false information or failure to give information does
not suffer from any vice of arbitrariness.
(xvii) The inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence in
the Schedule to the 2002 Act is a matter of legislative policy;
and the nature or class of any predicate offence has no
bearing on the validity of the Schedule or any prescription
thereunder.
(xviii) (a) In view of special mechanism envisaged by the
2002 Act, ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR under the
1973 Code. ECIR is an internal document of the ED and the
fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been
recorded does not come in the way of the Authorities referred
to in Section 48 to commence inquiry/investigation for
initiating "civil action" of "provisional attachment" of property
being proceeds of crime.
(b) Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person
concerned is not mandatory, it is enough if ED at the time of
arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest.
(c) However, when the arrested person is produced before
the Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to look into
the relevant records presented by the authorised
representative of ED for answering the issue of need for
22
his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of
money-laundering.
(xix) Even when ED manual is not to be published being an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 18
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
internal departmental document issued for the guidance of
the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore
the desirability of placing information on its website which
may broadly outline the scope of the authority of the
functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by
them as also the options/remedies available to the person
concerned before the Authority and before the Special Court.
(xx) The petitioners are justified in expressing serious
concern bordering on causing injustice owing to the vacancies
in the Appellate Tribunal. We deem it necessary to impress
upon the executive to take corrective measures in this regard
expeditiously.
(xxi) The argument about proportionality of punishment with
reference to the nature of scheduled offence is wholly
unfounded and stands rejected."
26. The reliance placed by the learned senior
counsel for the petitioner on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of Y. Balaji (referred supra) that stay
of a predicate offence eclipses a scheduled offence is
inapplicable to the facts of this case as the summons is not
issued by the respondents on the premise that a schedule
offence is registered against the petitioner. Likewise, the
judgment relied by him in the case of CBI v. Ramesh Gelli
(referred supra) is also inapplicable as Section 13 was made
a schedule offence by virtue of Act 16 of 2018. Even
otherwise, there is nothing on record to prejudge the
case whether the summons was issued in respect of
the charge sheet filed against the petitioner under
Section 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(ii) of the P.C
Act, 1988 or to take further steps in the matter of the
investigation into the offences against the co-accused.
Therefore, all the contentions urged by the learned
senior counsel for the petitioner in assailing the
summons issued to the petitioner are liable to be
rejected and are accordingly, rejected. Consequently,
23
W.P. No.22780/2023 filed by the petitioner lacks merit
and is dismissed."
(Emphasis supplied)
The coordinate Bench considers the judgment of the Apex Court in
the case of VIJAY MADANLAL CHOUDHARY and all those
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 19
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
identical submissions of the learned senior counsel that is now
projected, even the submission that the Enforcement Directorate is
now wanting to investigate into the matter. After considering the
said submissions, the coordinate bench holds there is nothing on
record to prejudge the case whether summons was issued in
respect of charge sheet filed against the petitioner under the
offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the petition
was thus dismissed. The 1st petitioner challenges the said dismissal
before the Division Bench in W.A.No.497 of 2024. The Writ Appeal
comes to be dismissed holding that summons issued by the
Enforcement Directorate under Section 50 of the Act cannot be
subject matter of challenge in a writ petition. The Division Bench
dismisses the appeal on the following reasons:
".... .... ....
24
44. Insofar as the reliance placed by Sri. Kamath on the
judgment in the case of Vilelie Khamo (supra) is concerned,
the Supreme Court has, in the said judgment, stated as under:
"xx xx xx xx xx
Suffice it is to state that at this stage we are
dealing with a summons that has been issued.
In such view of the matter, the impugned order
stands set aside and the appellant is at liberty to proceed
in pursuance to the summons that had been issued.
However, we make it clear that all issues are left open to
the respondent, in the event of him being arrayed as an
accused."
45. Sri. Patil has referred to the judgment of the Madras
High Court in the case of K.Govindaraj -Vs.- Union of India
and Others [WP No.5402/2024 and connected matters,
decided on 16.07.2024], more particularly on paragraph
No.14, wherein reference has been made to the interim order
passed by the Supreme Court. In the said order, the Supreme
Court has clearly said that the persons to whom summons are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 20
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
issued under Section 50(2) of the Act, are obliged to respect
and respond to the said summons. Hence, the said judgment
shall not come to the aid of the appellant.
46. So in view of the settled position of law as noted
above, suffice it would be to state, there is no illegality in the
issuance of summons to the appellant. In fact on the basis of
the aforesaid conclusion of ours, it necessarily follows that a
challenge to summons is not maintainable in view of the
judgment in the case of Kirit Shrimankar (supra), wherein
the Supreme Court has held, mere summons does not
constitute a positive action entitling the petitioner to question
it in a writ petition. Similarly, the Supreme Court in the case
of Kunisetty Satyanarayana (supra), has held that mere
charge sheet or show-cause notice does not give rise to any
cause of action, because it does not amount to an adverse
order which affects the rights of any party unless the same
has been issued by a person having no jurisdiction to do so. It
is not the case of the appellant that the Officer who had issued
summons did not had the appropriate jurisdiction. Sri.
Kamath is right in stating that, the summons does not make
25
any allegations against the appellant and merely requires him
to appear before the Authority. There is no adverse order
against the appellant. Under such circumstances, there was
no cause of action to file a writ petition.
47. One of the submissions of Sri. Patil was that, the
learned Single Judge should not have decided the petition filed
by the appellant and other accused together. According to Sri.
Patil, the appellant who was the petitioner in WP
No.22780/2023, challenged proceedings under PMLA and in
WP No.22989/2023, challenged FIR No.325/2014 as it has
caused prejudice to the appellant. He relied upon the
provisions of Section 44 of the PMLA to contend that the trial
of both sets of offences by the same Court shall not be
construed as joint trial. In other words, the same should be
held in separate trial. This provision according to him, is
recognizing that no prejudice should be caused to the accused.
On this submission of Sri. Patil, the submission of Sri. Kamath
was, no such plea was raised on behalf of the appellant before
the learned Single Judge. In fact according to him, it was at
the behest of the appellant that the petitions were clubbed and
heard. Suffice it would be to state, we find that the detailed
arguments were advanced in the petition before the learned
Single Judge without any objection for separating the writ
petition from which the impugned order arises. In fact the
plea of Sri. Kamath was also that, the appellant had filed WP
No.22780/2023 on the ground that the other accused in the
predicate offences had filed writ petitions challenging the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 21
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
proceedings and that in such petitions, the further proceedings
in respect of predicate offences were stayed. According to Sri.
Kamath, the appellant produced copies of the interim order in
such petitions and sought to take advantage of such orders in
his petition. In other words it is his submission that, in view of
the stand taken by the appellant, the learned Single Judge had
heard and decided them together. The submission of Sri.
Kamath do prima facie reflects that, at the behest of the
appellant, the petitions were clubbed together and decided.
There is nothing in the impugned order of the learned Single
Judge which depicts that such an objection was taken by the
appellant during the hearing of the petitions. In the absence
of any objection, the writ petition having been heard and
decided, surely the plea advanced by Sri. Patil is an
afterthought and is liable to be rejected. It is ordered
26
accordingly. Insofar as the judgments in the cases of Bhajan
Lal (supra) and Abhishek Banerjee (supra) relied upon by
Sri. Patil are concerned, the same shall not have any
applicability to the issue in hand, moreso in view of our
conclusion above.
48. In view of our discussion made hereinabove, we
hold that the present appeal filed by the appellant is totally
misconceived; the learned Single Judge is justified in rejecting
the writ petition. We also, dismiss the appeal; the impugned
order dated 20.02.2024 passed by the learned Single Judge in
WP No.22780/2023 is upheld."
14. After the aforesaid orders, comes the fulcrum of the
present lis. The petitioner was taken into custody for investigation
by the Directorate of Enforcement allegedly on 08-04-2025 but by
an arrest order on 09-04-2025. The arrest order reads as follows:
"F.No.ECIR/BGZO/05/2021 Date: 9-04-2025
ARREST ORDER

THE GROUNDS OF ARREST:
"GROUNDS OF ARREST OF SRI R.M.MANJUNATHA GOWDA
1) Based on the complaint filed by the Shimoga District Co-
Operative Central Bank Limited (SDCC Bank) against Smt. B. Shobha, Branch Manager of the SDCC
Bank, City Branch and others, an FIR bearing No. 325/2014 dated 17.07.2014 was registered at
Doddapete Police Station, Shivamogga, Karnataka against Smt. B. Shobha, Bank Manager and
others of SDCC Bank, Shivamogga under Section 406, 408, 409, 420 and 34 of IPC, 1860.
2) As per Charge-sheet bearing no. 02/2014 dated 18.10.2014 filed under Section 409, 120B, 201
r/w 37 of IPC in FIR No. 325/2014, by the Police before the Hon'ble 2nd JMFC Court, Shivamogga
against Smt. B. Shobha, Bank Manager and others, it was revealed that large-scale misappropriation
of funds took place at the Shivamogga District Co-Operative Central Bank city branch which was
orchestrated primarily by the branch manager, Accused No.1 Smt. Shobha. As the sole in-charge of
the branch from August 2005, she exploited her position to misappropriate a significant amount of
bank funds, totalling Rs. 62,77,63,560/-. The modus operandi involved opening savings 785
fraudulent gold loan accounts without the knowledge of the Bank account holders, utilizing fake,
fabricated, and forged documents. To facilitate this, Shobha enlisted the help of Accused No.2
Ravindra. V, the cashier, and Accused No.3 Shashidhar. N, the gold custodian. Ravindra handed
over sanctioned loan amounts to Shobha without proper authorization, while Shashidhar made false
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 25
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
entries in the gold custodian book, indicating the pledge of pure gold ornaments when in reality,
many loans were sanctioned against gold-coated silver bangles or with no gold pledged at all.
Accused No.5 Sunder Shet, the bank's appraiser, played a crucial role by dishonestly certifying that
the gold-coated silver bangles and low karat gold ornaments were pure gold, thus enabling the
fraudulent loan sanctions. Mr. Sunder Shet conspired with Shobha and Shashidhar for personal
gain, contributing to the wrongful loss incurred by the bank. Accused No.8 Gururaj, a goldsmith,
manufactured the gold- coated silver bangles as per the instructions of Shobha and her family
members, received Rs.16,00,000 from the misappropriated funds for his services and for purchase a
bangle manufacturing machine. Accused No.6 Jeethu, proprietor of Vaibhav Lakshmi Jewellers, also
conspired with Shobha, making online transactions of gold and silver using the misappropriated
funds and earning an illegal profit of Rs. 1,11,64,000/-, which he used for acquiring properties and
vehicles. Family members of Smt. Shobha, Accused No. 9 Jagadeesh. C.S. (husband), Accused No.10
Chandrahasa. M.B. (brother), and Accused No.17 Basappa (father of Smt. Shobha), were also
involved in the scam. They had pledged gold coated silver bangles as pure gold to avail loans at the
behest of Smt. Shobha, further aiding her misappropriation. They also benefited directly from the
scam, purchasing properties, land, silver articles, and vehicles using the ill- gotten gains. Accused
No.11 S.A. Shivakumar, the car driver for the bank's Chairman, was also implicated. He conspired
with Shobha, purchased land and sites using the misappropriated funds, and even fraudulently
obtained a gold loan by pledging an artificial gold-coated chain. The entire scam came to light
following an anonymous complaint in July 2014, which led to a surprise inspection by senior
officials of the co-operative society. The inspection revealed a significant discrepancy between the
cash book balance and the physical cash available, indicating a misappropriation of Rs.
1,79,20,235-58/-. Further investigation uncovered the larger scale of the fraud involving the
fraudulent gold loans. Notably, Accused No.18 G. Ramachandra, the branch manager of the Head
Office, also played a role in attempting to shield Shobha. On the instruction of Accused No.15 R.M.
Manjunatha Gowda, the Chairman, G. Ramachandra made false entries in the bank cash book,
showing a deposit of Rs. 50,00,000/- from Smt. Shobha. He also sanctioned fraudulent gold loans
worth Rs. 34,53,000/- against 2 Kg 134 grams of gold and illegally took 366 grams of gold
ornaments from the pledged gold.
3) Further, as per chargesheet, on 15.07.2014, Co-operative society officials along with officials of
the bank, on physical verification of cash at SDCC Bank, City Branch, Shivamogga, reported
shortage of Rs.1,79,20,235-58 which was done by B. Shobha in criminal conspiracy with Ravindra V.
(Cashier).
4) Another FIR in crime No. 04/2014 dated 29.05.2014 under section 13(1) (e) read with section
13(2) of PC Act, 1988 was registered at Lokayukta Police Station, Shivamogga against Mr. R.M

Charge sheet bearing No. 02/2018 dated 20.03.2018 which was filed by the Karnataka Lokayukata
Police before the Ld. Principal District and Sessions Judge, Shivamogga.
8) As per chargesheet filed by the LEA, it was also revealed that, despite being aware of rules and
bylaws of the bank regarding transfers and promotion, you violated the same by ensuring that Mrs.
B. Shobha, in spite of her being promoted to the rank of General Manager in the year 2013,
continued to be posted in the city branch where she had been working from 2005 onwards. Further,
as the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the City Branch from 2006 to 2014. the Advisory
Committee never convened a meeting during their tenure, indicating a lapse in duty. This negligence
allowed the accused, Shobha B. (the then General Manager at SDCC Bank, City Branch) to carry out
irregularities within the said branch. Audit reports (both internal and statutory) from 2006-07 to
2011-12 highlighted several significant deficiencies within the city branch, yet no appropriate action
was taken against the accused, Shobha B.
9) During the course of investigations it was revealed that Shri Shivakumar S A, S/o Appu
Rangappa, your driver at SDCC Bank used to transport parcels containing cash on the basis of
directions given to him and around the time of 2013 Karnataka Assembly Elections, he transported
money contained in a parcel given by Smt. Shobha to Shri Durgappagowda at your instruction.
10) During the course of investigation, it was revealed that you & Shobha connived and diverted
funds from bank through fraudulent sanction of gold loans and used the same for investments and
acquiring properties along with Shri.T. Manjappa and others
11) That as and when funds were required by you, you used to communicate through phone with
Smt. Shobha B. In response, she used to issue cheques for withdrawal of money or cash from the
accounts of the said 34 persons and they would hand over the money to persons whose names were
instructed by you.
12) During the course of investigations it was revealed that you knew about the spurious gold
pledged against Rs. 62.23 Crores misappropriated from the DCC Bank, City Branch and yet you
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 27
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
failed to take any action against B. Shobha & Others as you were yourself the beneficiary of such
"proceeds of crime."
13) You deliberately did not transfer B. Shobha from the city branch of SDCC bank as she was
misappropriating the bank funds under your supervision and protection and from the statements
recorded under of PMLA, it was revealed that on multiple occasions such misappropriated funds,
i.e, "proceeds of crime" were directly and indirectly received by you.
14) During the course of investigations, it was revealed that you gave instructions to B. Shobha
regarding sanction of gold loans using fake gold ornaments.
15) From the investigation carried out under PMLA, it is clearly noticeable that "proceeds of crime"
generated by Ms. B. Shobha from the commissioning of schedule offence of diversion of funds from
the bank by opening fake gold loan accounts, were laundered and handed over to you. You had
acquired various movable and immovable properties and were found to be in possession of various
such properties acquired from PoC generated from schedule offence. When asked to explain the
source of funds from which properties were acquired, you had no plausible explanation to offer. You
along with your wife were also found to be in possession of assets in disproportionate to their known
sources of income. These movable and immovable properties are nothing but the properties
acquired from the proceeds of crime.
16) You have directly and indirectly received the "proceeds of crime" Mrs. B. Sobha through cash
and also got many properties transferred from the close relatives of Mrs.B. Shobha to your close
relatives.
17) Further, it was revealed that you have amassed disproportionate assets, both movable and
immovable, significantly exceeding your legitimate income during the check period from 11.01.1997
to 30.05.2014, which coincides with your tenure in public offices. The investigation done by LEA
concluded that you have possessed assets and incurred expenses totalling Rs. 7,36,15,141.55/-
during the check period, against a calculated legal income of Rs. 3,41,07,842.72/- This resulted in
identification of disproportionate assets valued at Rs. 3,95,07,298.83, which is 115.83% more than
your legal income as you failed to provide a satisfactory account for the excess wealth acquired by
you. As per Chargesheet, it was also revealed that your wife Smt. H.C. Asha, was in possession of Rs.
5 Crores (Approx) worth movable and immovable properties.
18) The assets found in the name of your wife can be directly attributed to you as she stated in her
statement dated 05.10.2023 recorded under section 17 of PMLA, 2002 stated that she was unaware
of the funding sources for the properties in her name, as you, handled all financial matters,
including filing her ITRs.
19) That from the investigations conducted so far, it can be concluded that, you are guilty of the
offence of money laundering u/s 3 of the Act and punishable u/s 4 of the Act as you have failed to
reveal anything about the possession/concealment/use/gain from the proceeds of crime which is
involved in money laundering. However, the materials gathered during the course of investigation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 28
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
under PMLA, it is fully evident that you have indulged in criminal activities relating to the scheduled
offences and generated huge amount of proceeds of crime which is involved in money laundering.
20) Hence, in view of the above discussions, there are reasons to believe that you are guilty of the
offence of money-laundering as defined under Section 3 of PMLA, 2002 which is punishable under
Section 4 of PMLA, 2002 as you have been found to be knowingly involved in the criminal activities
related to scheduled offences thereby generating, assisting, acquiring, proceeds of crime and
projecting and claiming the same as untainted property. Therefore, you are being arrested under
Section 19 of PMLA, 2002 on 09.04.2025.

(Emphasis supplied) Section 19 requires that at the time of arrest the Directorate of
Enforcement should have reasons to believe that the person who is being arrested is
in possession proceeds of crime. Therefore, those reasons to believe are to be
deduced into writing. The elaborate reasons to believe so drawn by the Directorate of
Enforcement against the petitioners in the case at hand are as follows:
REASONS TO BELIEVE:
"Reasons to believe to place Shri R M Manjunatha Gowda under Arrest u/s 19 of
PMLA, 2002 on 09.04.2025
1) Based on the complaint filed by the Shimoga District Co-
Operative Central Bank Limited (SDCC Bank) against Smt. B. Shobha, Branch Manager of the SDCC
Bank, City Branch and others, an FIR bearing No. 325/2014 dated 17.07.2014 was registered at
Doddapete Police Station, Shivamogga, Karnataka against Smt. B. Shobha, Bank Manager and
others of SDCC Bank, Shivamogga under Section 406, 408, 409, 420 and 34 of IPC, 1860.
2) As per Charge-sheet bearing no. 02/2014 dated 18.10.2014 filed under Section 409, 120B, 201
r/w 37 of IPC in FIR No. 325/2014, by the Police before the Hon'ble 2nd JMFC Court, Shivamogga
against Smt. B. Shobha, Bank Manager and others, it was revealed that large scale misappropriation
of funds took place at the Shivamogga District Co-Operative Central Bank city branch which was
orchestrated primarily by the Branch Manager, Accused No.1 Smt. B. Shobha. As the sole in-charge
of the branch from August 2005, she exploited her position to misappropriate a significant amount
of bank funds, totaling Rs. 62,77,63,560/-. The modus operandi involved opening savings 785
fraudulent gold loan accounts without the knowledge of the Bank account holders, utilizing fake,
fabricated, and forged documents. To facilitate this, Shobha enlisted the help of Accused No.2
Ravindra. V, the cashier, and Accused No.3 Shashidhar. N, the gold custodian. Ravindra handed
over sanctioned loan amounts to Shobha without proper authorization, while Shashidhar made false
entries in the gold custodian book, indicating the pledge of pure gold ornaments when in reality,
many loans were sanctioned against gold- coated silver bangles or with no gold pledged at all.
Accused No.5 Sunder Shet, the bank's appraiser, played a crucial role by dishonestly certifying that
the gold-coated silver bangles and low carat gold ornaments were pure gold, thus enabling the
fraudulent loan sanctions. Mr. Sunder Shet conspired with Shobha and Shashidhar for personal
gain, contributing to the wrongful loss incurred by the bank. Accused No.8 Gururaj, a goldsmith,
manufactured the gold-coated silver bangles as per the instructions of Shobha and her family
members, received Rs. 16,00,000 from the misappropriated funds for his services and for purchase
a bangle manufacturing machine. Accused No. 6 Jeethu, proprietor of Vaibhav Lakshmi Jewelers,
also conspired with Shobha, making online transactions of gold and silver using the
misappropriated funds and earning an illegal profit of Rs. 1,11,64,000/-, which he used for acquiring
properties and vehicles. Family members of Smt. Shobha, Accused No. 9 Jagadeesh. C.S. (husband),
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 30
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
Accused No.10 Chandrahasa. M.B. (brother), and Accused No.17 Basappa (father of Smt. Shobha),
were also involved in the scam. They had pledged gold coated silver bangles as pure gold to avail
loans at the behest of Smt. Shobha, further aiding her misappropriation. They also benefited directly
from the scam, purchasing properties, land, silver articles, and vehicles using the ill-gotten gains.
Accused No.11 S.A. Shivakumar, the car driver for the bank's Chairman, was also implicated. He
conspired with Shobha, purchased land and sites using the misappropriated funds, and even
fraudulently obtained a gold loan by pledging an artificial gold-coated chain. The entire scam came
to light following an anonymous complaint in July 2014, which led to a surprise inspection by senior
officials of the co-operative society. The inspection revealed a significant discrepancy between the
cash book balance and the physical cash available, indicating a misappropriation of Rs.
1,79,20,235-58/-. Further investigation uncovered the larger scale of the fraud involving the
fraudulent gold loans. Notably, Accused No.18 G. Ramachandra, the branch manager of the Head
Office, also played a role in attempting to shield Shobha. On the instruction of Accused No.15 R.M.
Manjunatha Gowda, the Chairman, G. Ramachandra made false entries in the bank cash book,
showing a deposit of Rs. 50,00,000/- from Smt. Shobha. He also sanctioned fraudulent gold loans
worth Rs. 34,53,000/- against 2 Kg 134 grams of gold and illegally took 366 grams of gold
ornaments from the pledged gold.

public offices. The investigation done by LEA concluded that R. M. Manjunatha Gowda possessed
assets and incurred expenses totaling Rs. 7,36,15,141.55/- during the check period, against a
calculated legal income of Rs. 3,41,07,842.72/- This resulted in identification of disproportionate

provide a satisfactory account for the excess wealth acquired by him. As per Chargesheet, it was also

worth movable and immovable properties.
9) That the Hon'ble Court has taken cognizance of the charge sheet filed by the Karnataka

special court.
10) Further, as per Charge-sheet dated 30.07.2021 in FIR No. 325/2014, it was alleged that R.M.
Manjunatha Gowda, served as the President of the Shivamogga DCC Bank for approximately 23
years. As President, he possessed complete control and supervision over all branches and staff.
Despite his knowledge of the bank's bylaws and regulations, he allowed Shobha B (A-1) to continue
working at the city branch, even after her promotions to higher positions. Further, he served as the
Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the city branch but failed to convene a single meeting.
Audit reports highlighting serious deficiencies within the branch were ignored and statutory reports
detailing lapses were shelved. R.M. Manjunatha Gowda also unilaterally made decisions during
Board meetings, suppressing director input and instructing bank officials to conceal irregularities.
He failed to take disciplinary action against Shobha B and other involved employees, and neglected
to perform inspections of the city branch.
That Shobha B, who was an employee rose through the ranks, even to positions that did not exist at

Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
to continue working at the city branch and even promoted her to a position that did not exist there.
He violated staff rules regarding transfers and shelved statutory audit reports detailing serious
lapses. Nagabhushan concealed irregularities from the management board and failed to take
disciplinary action against Shobha B and other involved employees. He also neglected to perform
inspections of the city branch.
Further, Bank officials Nagabhushan, Manjappa, and Mahabalagiri brought irregularities to the
Chairman's notice but were instructed to conceal the information. Other bank staff reported
Shobha's fraudulent activity, but their concerns were ignored. The bank directors were prevented
from speaking during board meetings and were kept uninformed about the fraud.

sources for the properties, as her husband, Shri. R.M. Manjunatha Gowda, handled all financial

Sri R.M. Manjunatha Gowda.

opened in the name of their relatives/known persons. Further, he also stated that some portions of
the misappropriated amounts were also given to Shri. Durgappa Gowda (Director of District
Co-Operative Central Bank), Shri. Krishne Gowda (politician and agriculturist) and amount of Rs.
45 to 50 Lakhs was given to Shri. Shivakumar (Driver of Shri. R M Manjunath Gowda) by his wife ii.

Q.9 You are being shown the statement dated 08.04.2025 of Shri Chandrahasa M B, S/o Late Shri.
B Basappa recorded u/s 17 of PMLA wherein he inter-alia stated that Mr. R.M. Manjunatha Gowda
was accomplice in misappropriating the funds by adopting the modus operandi of opening fake gold
loan accounts using fake gold ornaments as mortgage and finally withdrawing in cash of sanctioned
gold loan amount. In the process he also shared the booty on several occasions, however on one
instance, Mr. R.M. Manjunatha Gowda received an amount of Rs. 40 Lakhs for his 2013 MLA
election campaign from Smt B. Shobha. Smt. B. Shobha also purchased one property in the name of
her father which in turn transferred to brother of Mr. R.M. Manjunatha Gowda - Shri. Nageshan
without any consideration. The said property comprises of a plot of 20 guntes in Bommana Katte

Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
18) From the investigation carried out under PMLA as detailed above, it is clearly noticeable that
PoC generated by Ms Sobha from the commissioning of schedule offense of diversion of funds from
the bank by opening fake gold loan accounts, were laundered and handed over to Shri. R
MManjunatha Gowda. He had acquired various movable and immovable properties and was found
to be in possession of various such properties acquired from PoC generated from schedule offense.
When asked to explain the source of funds from which properties were required, he had no plausible
explanation to offer. He along with his wife were also found to in possession of assets in
disproportionate to their known sources of income. These movable and immovable properties are
nothing but the properties acquired from the proceeds of crime. Thus on the basis of information
discussed above, I have reason to believe that Mr. R M Manjunatha Gowda is guilty of offense of
money laundering.
19) It is established that the then President of DCC Bank Shimmoga i.e Mr. R M Manjunatha Gowda
had assisted Smt. Shobha B. the then Branch Manager of City Branch of SDCC Bank in committing
the misappropriation/fraud against the public money with all the prior arrangements by not
transferring her even after completion of her statutory period in the same branch. Further Shobha
B. was discharging the duty of branch manager at said branch, even though she was promoted as
AGM, DGM and General Manager of DCC Bank, Shimoga. As the president of the bank, R M
Manjunatha Gowda was the incharge of the administration of the bank and during the relevant
period he violated the procedural aspect of cooperative rules and the administration was in
accordance with his whims and fancies.
20) Therefore, based on the investigations conducted so far, it has been revealed that Smt. Shobha
B. embezzled funds totaling Rs. 62,77,63,560/- by opening 785 fraudulent gold loan accounts which
was only possible due to the protection provided by the top management, specifically R M
Manjunatha Gowda, the Chairman.
21) Further, Mr. R M Manjunatha Gowda has directly and indirectly received the "proceeds of
crime" from Mrs. B. Shobha through cash and also got many properties transferred from close
relatives of Mrs. B. Shobha to the close relatives of Mr. R M Manjunatha Gowda.
22) Further, during his tenure as Chairman of the DCC Bank Shimoga from 1997 to 2014, R M
Manjunatha Gowda acquired assets and incurred expenses amounting to Rs. 7,36,15,141.55/-, while
his calculated legal income was Rs. 3,41,07,842.72/-. This resulted in the identification of
disproportionate assets valued at Rs. 3,95,07,298.83, which is 115.83% more than his legal income,
as he failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the excess wealth. Additionally, investigations
revealed that his wife, Smt. H.C. Asha, possessed movable and immovable properties worth Rs. 5
crores (Approx.)at the time when raids were conducted by the LEA. From the investigation
proceedings done under PMLA, 2002, i.e, from the statements of persons recorded as mentioned
above, it can also be concluded that he also received funds misappropriated by Shobha B. from the
DCC Bank's coffers on multiple occasions. Further investigations to trace the total quantum of funds
received by R M Manjunatha Gowda and its subsequent utilization are underway.

Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
Kind attention is invited to Section 3 and Section 19 of PMLA, 2002 Section 3 : Whosoever directly
or indirectly attempt to indulge or knowingly assists or is actually involved in any process or activity
connected with the proceeds of crime including its concealment, possession, acquisition or use and
projecting or claiming it as untainted property shall be guilty of offence of money laundering.
Explanation- For removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that -
(i) A person shall be guilty of offence of money-laundering if such person is found to have directly or
indirectly attempted to indulge or knowingly assisted or knowingly is a party or is actually involved
in one or more of the following processes or activities connected with proceeds of crime, namely: -
(a) Concealment; or
(b) Possession; or
(c) Acquisition; or
(d) Use; or
(e) Projecting as untainted property; or
(f) Claiming as untainted property, In any manner whatsoever;
(ii) The process or activity connected with proceeds of crime is a continuing activity
and continues till such time a person is directly or indirectly enjoying the proceeds of
crime by its concealment or possession or acquisition or use or projecting it as
untainted property or claiming it as untainted property in any manner whatsoever
Section 19
19. Power to arrest.--
(1) If the Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director, or any other officer authorised in this behalf
by the Central Government by general or special order, has on the basis of material in his possession
reason to believe (the reason for such belief to be recorded in writing) that any person has been
guilty of an offence punishable under this Act, he may arrest such person and shall, as soon as may
be, inform him of the grounds for such arrest.
(2) The Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director or any other officer shall, immediately after
arrest of such person under sub-section (1), forward a copy of the order, along with the material in
his possession, referred to in that sub-section, to the Adjudicating Authority, in a sealed envelope, in
the manner, as may be prescribed and such Adjudicating Authority shall keep such order and
material for such period, as may be prescribed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 54
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
(3) Every person arrested under sub-section (1) shall within twenty-four hours, be taken to a
Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be, having jurisdiction: Provided
that the period of twenty-four hours shall exclude the time necessary for the journey from the place
of arrest to the Magistrate's Court.
In view of the above, I have reasons to believe that the said Sh. R M Manjunatha Gowda is guilty of
offence of money laundering as per Section 3 punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA as Sh. R M
ManjunathaGowda was directly or indirectly indulging in or knowingly assisted in and was actually
involved in all or any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime including its
concealment, possession, acquisition or use and projecting or claiming it as untainted property.
Further, there are reasons to believe that Sh.R M Manjunatha Gowda is in possession of material
evidence and information relating to the offence of money laundering, which is subject matter of
investigation in the instant case and custodial interrogation of Sh. R M Manjunatha Gowda is
necessary to establish money trail of proceeds of crime and to gather crucial evidence. Further, for
furtherance of investigation, custodial interrogation of Sh.R M Manjunatha Gowda is essential for
identification of Proceeds of Crime, related activities/financial transactions, layering, confrontation
of various persons/documents and to unearth the deep-rooted conspiracy hatched by her in
association with other suspects."
(Emphasis supplied) The reasons so drawn to believe that the petitioners are in possession of
proceeds of crime narrates vivid details of identification of disproportionate assets more than the
income and inter alia several aspects. Going into every aspect of the reasons drawn to believe that
the petitioner is in possession of proceeds of crime and answering them or analysing them would
prejudice the case of the petitioner.
16. The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner is now wanting this Court to sit as an
Appellate Authority to assess every ground in the grounds of arrest or every reason found in the
document of reason to believe. The grounds of arrest are quoted hereinabove. The drawing up of
reasons to believe is also quoted hereinabove. The sufficiency of grounds or efficiency of grounds of
arrest or reasons to believe is not amenable to judicial review. What is necessary is that, it should
bear application of mind. None of these traits of an order being contrary to law is present in the case
at hand. The grounds of arrest are in elaboration. The petitioner and his wife are alleged of amassing
huge wealth by misappropriation of funds. The modus operandi of both these petitioners is narrated
in vivid details in the proceedings drawn up on reasons to believe. The chart of movable and
immovable properties of the family members before the check period and at the end of check period
also forms part of the documents which depict reasons to believe. The Directorate of Enforcement
holds at the end of the documents that it has all the reasons to believe that the petitioner is guilty of
offence of money laundering as per Section 3 of the Act, which becomes punishable under Section 4
of the Act. The finding, prima facie, is that the petitioner is directly or indirectly indulging in
concealment, possession, acquisition or use and projecting or claiming the money as untainted. The
money trail runs to several crores.

17. Heavy reliance is placed by the learned senior counsel on the judgment in the case of ARVIND
KEJRIWAL (supra). The paragraphs so relied on, read as follows:
".... .... ....
2. At the outset, we must clarify that this is not an appeal against refusal or grant of bail. Instead,
this appeal impugns the validity of arrest under Section 19 of the PML Act. It raises a pivotal
question regarding the scope and ambit of the trial court/courts to examine the legality of the arrest
under Section
19. The issue is legal in nature, and with the ratio being propounded in detail, the decision becomes
complex and legalistic. [ While introducing the Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill,
2012 in the Rajya Sabha on 17- 12-2012, the then Finance Minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, stated,
"Firstly, we must remember that money laundering is a very technically-defined offence. It is not the
way we understand "money laundering" in a colloquial sense." This has been quoted with approval
in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India, (2023) 12 SCC 1, at para 118 : (2023) 21 ITR-OL 1
(SC).] .... .... ....
27. In the present case, we are examining Section 19(1) of the PML Act and the rights of the accused.
We are not concerned with the ECIR. The relevant question arising is -- Whether the arrestee is
entitled to be supplied with a copy of the "reasons to believe"? Paras 215 and 216 in Vijay Madanlal
Choudhary [Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India, (2023) 12 SCC 1 : (2023) 21 ITR-OL 1
(SC)] refers to the importance of recording the "reasons to believe" in writing, and states this is
mandatory. Further, both Pankaj Bansal [Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India, (2024) 7 SCC 576 :
(2024) 3 SCC (Cri) 450] and Prabir Purkayastha [Prabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2024)
8 SCC 254 : (2024) 3 SCC (Cri) 573] hold that the failure to record "reasons to believe" in writing
will result in the arrest being rendered illegal and invalid. Paras 302 and 303 of Vijay Madanlal
Choudhary [Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India, (2023) 12 SCC 1 : (2023) 21 ITR-OL 1
(SC)] , which has been quoted subsequently, states that Section 19(1) requires in-depth scrutiny by
the designated officer. A higher threshold is required for making an arrest, necessitating a review of
the material available to demonstrate the person's guilt. Production of the "reasons to believe"
before the Special Court/Magistrate, cannot be construed and is not the same as furnishing or
providing the "reasons to believe" to the arrestee who has a right to challenge his arrest in violation
of Section 19(1) of the PML Act. [ The arrestee may also challenge his arrest under Section 19(1) of
the PML Act on the basis of the "grounds of arrest".] .... .... ....
29. We will reproduce what has been held in Gifford [Gifford v. Kelson, (1943) 51 Man. R 120] :
"A suspicion or belief may be entertained, but suspicion and belief cannot exist
together. Suspicion is much less than belief; belief includes or absorbs suspicion.
* * * When, we speak of "reason to believe" we mean a conclusion arrived at as to the
existence of a fact. Of course "reason to believe" does not amount to positive
knowledge nor does it mean absolute certainty but it does convey conviction of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 56
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
mind founded on evidence regarding the existence of a fact or the doing of an act.
Suspicion, on the other hand, rings uncertainty. It lives in imagination. It is inkling.
It is mistrust. It is chalk. "Reason to believe" is not. It is cheese."
30.Gifford [Gifford v. Kelson, (1943) 51 Man. R 120] accurately explains the difference between the
"reasons to believe" and "suspicion". "Suspicion" requires lower degree of satisfaction, and does not
amount to belief. Belief is beyond speculation or doubt, and the threshold of belief "conveys
conviction founded on evidence regarding existence of a fact or doing of an act". Given that the
power of arrest is drastic and violates Article 21 of the Constitution, we must give meaningful, true
and full play to the legislative intent. [ We would subsequently examine the expressions "reason to
believe", "guilty of an offence punishable under this Act" and "material" in some detail.]
31. Providing the written "grounds of arrest", though a must, does not in itself satisfy the compliance
requirement. The authorised officer's genuine belief and reasoning based on the evidence that
establishes the arrestee's guilt is also the legal necessity. As the "reasons to believe" are accorded by
the authorised officer, the onus to establish satisfaction of the said condition will be on DoE and not
on the arrestee.
32. On the necessity to satisfy the preconditions mentioned in Section 19(1) of the PML Act, we have
quoted from the judgment of this Court in Padam Narain Aggarwal [Union of India v. Padam Narain
Aggarwal, (2008) 13 SCC 305 :
(2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 1] and also referred to and quoted from the Canadian judgment in
Gifford [Gifford v. Kelson, (1943) 51 Man.
R 120] . Existence and validity of the "reasons to believe" goes to the root of the power to arrest. The
subjective opinion of the arresting officer must be founded and based upon fair and objective
consideration of the material, as available with them on the date of arrest. On the reading of the
"reasons to believe"
the court must form the "secondary opinion" on the validity of the exercise
undertaken for compliance of Section 19(1) of the PML Act when the arrest was
made. The "reasons to believe"
that the person is guilty of an offence under the PML Act should be founded on the material in the
form of documents and oral statements.
.... .... ....
40. As explained in A.S. Krishnan v. State of Kerala [A.S. Krishnan v. State of Kerala, (2004) 11 SCC
576 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 612] , Section 26IPC in substance means that the person must have "reason to
believe" if the circumstances are such that a reasonable man would, by probable reasoning, conclude
or infer regarding the nature of things concerned. Such circumstances need not necessarily be
capable of absolute conviction or inference; but it is sufficient if the circumstances are such that it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 57
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
creates a chain of probable reasoning leading to the conclusion or inference about the nature of the
thing. [ Wednesbury unreasonableness [Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury
Corpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] strikes at irrationality when a decision is so outrageous in its defiance
of logic or of accepted standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to
be decided would have arrived at it. See Council for Civil Service Union v. Minister of Civil Service,
1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 WLR 1174 (HL).]
41. Once we hold that the accused is entitled to challenge his arrest under Section 19(1) of the PML
Act, the court to examine the validity of arrest must catechise both the existence and soundness of
the "reasons to believe", based upon the material available with the authorised officer. It is difficult
to accept that the "reasons to believe", as recorded in writing, are not to be furnished. As observed
above, the requirements in Section 19(1) are the jurisdictional conditions to be satisfied for arrest,
the validity of which can be challenged by the accused and examined by the court. Consequently, it
would be incongruous, if not wrong, to hold that the accused can be denied and not furnished a copy
of the "reasons to believe". In reality, this would effectively prevent the accused from challenging
their arrest, questioning the "reasons to believe". We are concerned with violation of personal
liberty, and the exercise of the power to arrest in accordance with law. Scrutiny of the action to
arrest, whether in accordance with law, is amenable to judicial review. It follows that the "reasons to
believe" should be furnished to the arrestee to enable him to exercise his right to challenge the
validity of arrest.
42. We would accept that in a one-off case, it may not be feasible to reveal all material, including
names of witnesses and details of documents, when the investigation is in progress. This will not be
the position in most cases. DoE may claim redaction and exclusion of specific particulars and
details. However, the onus to justify redaction would be on DoE. The officers of DoE are the authors
of the "reasons to believe" and can use appropriate wordings, with details of the material, as are
necessary in a particular case. As there may only be a small number of cases where redaction is
justified for good cause, this reason is not a good ground to deny the accused's access to a copy of
the "reasons to believe" in most cases. Where the non- disclosure of the "reasons to believe" with
redaction is justified and claimed, the court must be informed. The file, including the documents,
must be produced before the court. Thereupon, the court should examine the request and if they
find justification, a portion of the "reasons to believe" and the document may be withheld. This
requires consideration and decision by the court. DoE is not the sole judge.
43. Section 173(6) of the Code, permits the police officer not to furnish statements or make
disclosures to the accused when it is inexpedient in public interest. In such an event, the police
officer is to indicate the specific part of the statement and append a note requesting the Magistrate
to exclude that part from the copy given to the accused. He has to state the reasons for making such
request. The same principle will apply.
44. We now turn to the scope and ambit of judicial review to be exercised by the court. Judicial
review does not amount to a mini-trial or a merit review. The exercise is confined to ascertain
whether the "reasons to believe"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 58
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
are based upon material which "establish" that the arrestee is guilty of an offence
under the PML Act. The exercise is to ensure that DoE has acted in accordance with
the law. The courts scrutinise the validity of the arrest in exercise of power of judicial
review. If adequate and due care is taken by DoE to ensure that the "reasons to
believe" justify the arrest in terms of Section 19(1) of the PML Act, the exercise of
power of judicial review would not be a cause of concern. Doubts will only arise when
the reasons recorded by the authority are not clear and lucid, and therefore a deeper
and in-depth scrutiny is required. Arrest, after all, cannot be made arbitrarily and on
the whims and fancies of the authorities. It is to be made on the basis of the valid
"reasons to believe", meeting the parameters prescribed by the law. In fact, not to
undertake judicial scrutiny when justified and necessary, would be an abdication and
failure of constitutional and statutory duty placed on the court to ensure that the
fundamental right to life and liberty is not violated.
45. At this stage, we must consider the arguments presented by DoE, which rely on judgments
regarding the scope of judicial interference in investigations, including the power of arrest.
Reference in this regard was made to King Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad [King Emperor v.
Khwaja Nazir Ahmad, 1944 SCC OnLine PC 29 : AIR 1945 PC 18] , DukhishyamBenupani v. Arun
Kumar Bajoria [DukhishyamBenupani v. Arun Kumar Bajoria, (1998) 1 SCC 52 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 261
: (1998) 91 Comp Cas 413] , State of Bihar v. J.A.C. Saldanha [State of Bihar v. J.A.C. Saldanha,
(1980) 1 SCC 554 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 272] , and M.C. Abraham v. State of Maharashtra [M.C. Abraham
v. State of Maharashtra, (2003) 2 SCC 649 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 628] . In our opinion, these decisions
do not apply to the present controversy, as the power of arrest in this case is governed by Section
19(1) of the PML Act. These decisions restrict the courts from interfering with the statutory right of
the police to investigate, provided that no legal provisions are violated. Investigation and crime
detection vests in the authorities by statute, albeit, these powers differ from the court's authority to
adjudicate and determine whether an arrest complies with constitutional and statutory provisions.
As indicated above, the power to arrest without a warrant for cognizable offences is exercised by the
police officer in terms of Section 41 of the Code. [Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India,
(2023) 12 SCC 1 : (2023) 21 ITR-OL 1 (SC)] Arrest under Section 41 can be made on the grounds
mentioned in clauses (a) to (i) of Section 41(1) of the Code, which include a reasonable complaint,
credible information or reasonable suspicion that a person has committed an offence, or the arrest is
necessary for proper investigation of the offence, etc. The grounds mentioned in Section 41 are
different from the juridical preconditions for exercise of power of arrest under Section 19(1) of the
PML Act. Section 19(1) conditions are more rigid and restrictive. As such, the two provisions cannot
be equated. The legislature has deliberately avoided reference to the grounds mentioned in Section
41 and considered it appropriate to impose strict and stringent conditions that act as a safeguard.
46. The same reasoning will apply to the contention raised by DoE relying upon the provisions of
Section 437 of the Code and the judgment of this Court in Gurcharan Singh v. State (Delhi Admn.)
[Gurcharan Singh v. State (Delhi Admn.), (1978) 1 SCC 118 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 41] . Section 437 of the
Code applies when an accused suspected of committing a non-bailable offence is arrested or
detained without warrant by a police officer in charge of a police station or is brought before a court,
other than the High Court or the Court of Session. It is observed that the accused would be released
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 59
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
on bail, except for in cases specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 437(1) of the Code. Section
437(1)(i) applies at the stage of initial investigation where a person has been arrested for an offence
punishable with death or imprisonment for life. Section 437(1)(ii) imposes certain fetters on the
power of granting bail in specified cases when the offence is cognizable and the accused has been
previously convicted with death, imprisonment for life, or 7 years or more, or has previously been
convicted on two or more occasions for non-bailable and cognizable offences. The power under
Section 437(1) of the Code is exercised by the court, other than the High Court or the Sessions Court.
In other cases, Section 437(3) of the Code will apply. Gurcharan Singh [Gurcharan Singh v. State
(Delhi Admn.), (1978) 1 SCC 118 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 41] distinguishes between the language of two
sub-sections of Section 437 -- Sections 437(1) and 437(7). It is observed that 437(7) does not apply at
the investigation stage, but rather after the conclusion of trial and before the court delivers its
judgment. Thus, the use of the expression "not guilty" pertains to releasing the accused who is in
custody, on a bond without surety, for appearance to hear the judgment delivered. Notably, Section
437(6) states that if the trial of a person accused of a non-bailable offence is not completed within
sixty days from the first date fixed for taking evidence, the Magistrate to their satisfaction shall
release such person on bail, provided they have been in custody throughout this period. The
Magistrate may direct otherwise only for reasons recorded in writing. Section 439 of the Code,
which relates to the power of the High Court or the Sessions Court to grant bail, remains free from
the legislative constraints applicable in cases covered by Section 437(1) of the Code. However,
Section 437(3) of the Code when applicable applies.
47. DoE has drawn our attention to the use of the expression "material in possession" in Section
19(1) of the PML Act instead of "evidence in possession". Though etymologically correct, this
argument overlooks the requirement that the designated officer should and must, based on the
material, reach and form an opinion that the arrestee is guilty of the offence under the PML Act.
Guilt can only be established on admissible evidence to be led before the court, and cannot be based
on inadmissible evidence. While there is an element of hypothesis, as oral evidence has not been led
and the documents are to be proven, the decision to arrest should be rational, fair and as per law.
Power to arrest under Section 19(1) is not for the purpose of investigation. Arrest can and should
wait, and the power in terms of Section 19(1) of the PML Act can be exercised only when the
material with the designated officer enables them to form an opinion, by recording reasons in
writing that the arrestee is guilty.
.... .... ....
50. In our opinion, the key distinction between Section 19(1) and Section 45 is the authority
undertaking the exercise, in each case. Under Section 19(1), it is the designated/authorised officer
who records in writing, their "reasons to believe" that the arrestee is "guilty" of an offence under the
PML Act. Thus, the arrest is based on the opinion of such officer, which opinion is open to judicial
review, however not merits review, in terms of the well-settled principles of law. Contrastingly,
under Section 45, it is the Special Court which undertakes the exercise. The Special Court
independently examines pleas and contentions of both the accused and DoE, and arrives at an
objective opinion. The Special Court is not bound by the opinion of the designated/authorised
officer recorded in the "reasons to believe". A court's opinion is different and cannot be equated to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 60
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
an officer's opinion. While the Special Court's opinion is determinative, and is only subject to appeal
before the higher courts, DoE's opinion is not in the same category as it is open to judicial review.
.... .... ....
61. The legality of the "reasons to believe" has to be examined based on what is mentioned and
recorded therein and the material on record. However, the officer acting under Section 19(1) of the
PML Act cannot ignore or not consider the material which exonerates the arrestee. Any such non-
consideration would lead to difficult and unacceptable results. First, it would negate the legislative
intent which imposes stringent conditions. As a general rule of interpretation, penal provisions must
be interpreted strictly. [ See Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India, (2023) 12 SCC 1 at para
106 :
(2023) 21 ITR-OL 1 (SC) : (SCC pp. 164-65)"106. The "proceeds of crime" being the
core of the ingredients constituting the offence of money laundering, that expression
needs to be construed strictly. In that, all properties recovered or attached by the
investigating agency in connection with the criminal activity relating to a scheduled
offence under the general law cannot be regarded as proceeds of crime. There may be
cases where the property involved in the commission of scheduled offence attached
by the investigating agency dealing with that offence, cannot be wholly or partly
regarded as proceeds of crime within themeaning of Section 2(1)(u) of the 2002
Act--so long as the whole or some portion of the property has been derived or
obtained by any person "as a result of"
criminal activity relating to the stated scheduled offence."Also see M. Ravindran v.
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, (2021) 2 SCC 485 : (2021) 1 SCC (Cri) 876 at
para 17.9 : (SCC p.
505)"17. ... 17.9. Additionally, it is well settled that in case of any ambiguity in the
construction of a penal statute, the courts must favour the interpretation which leans
towards protecting the rights of the accused, given the ubiquitous power disparity
between the individual accused and the State machinery. This is applicable not only
in the case of substantive penal statutes but also in the case of procedures providing
for the curtailment of the liberty of the accused."] Secondly, any undue indulgence
and latitude to DoE will be deleterious to the constitutional values of rule of law and
life and liberty of persons. An officer cannot be allowed to selectively pick and choose
material implicating the person to be arrested. They have to equally apply their mind
to other material which absolves and exculpates the arrestee. The power to arrest
under Section 19(1) of the PML Act cannot be exercised as per the whims and fancies
of the officer.
62. Undoubtedly, the opinion of the officer is subjective, but formation of opinion should be in
accordance with the law. Subjectivity of the opinion is not a carte blanche to ignore relevant
absolving material without an explanation. In such a situation, the officer commits an error in law
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 61
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
which goes to the root of the decision-making process, and amounts to legal malice.
63. A contention raised by DoE, and accepted in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary [Vijay Madanlal
Choudhary v. Union of India, (2023) 12 SCC 1 : (2023) 21 ITR-OL 1 (SC)] , was that the order of
arrest under Section 19(1) of the PML Act is a decision taken by a high-ranking officer. Thus, it is
expected that the high-ranking officer is conscious of the obligation imposed by Section 19(1) of the
PML Act before passing an order of arrest. We are of the opinion that it would be incongruous to
argue that the high-ranking officer should not objectively consider all material, including
exculpatory material.
64. A wrong application of law or arbitrary exercise of duty leads to illegality in the process. The
court can exercise their judicial review to strike down such a decision. This would not amount to
judicial overreach or interference with the investigation, as has been argued by DoE. The court only
ensures that the enforcement of law is in accordance with the statute and the Constitution. An
adverse decision would only help in ensuring better compliance with the statute and the principles
of the Constitution.
65. Having said so, we accept that a question would arise
-- Does judicial review mean a detailed merits review? We have already referred to the contours of
judicial review expounded in Padam Narain Aggarwal [Union of India v. Padam Narain Aggarwal,
(2008) 13 SCC 305 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 1] , and Partap Singh [Partap Singh v. Enforcement
Directorate, (1985) 3 SCC 72 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 312 : (1985) 58 Comp Cas 477] . We have also referred
to the principles of Wednesbury [Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn.,
(1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] reasonableness. [ Wednesbury unreasonableness [Associated Provincial
Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] strikes at irrationality when a
decision is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted standards that no sensible person
who had applied his mind to the question to be decided would have arrived at it. See Council for
Civil Service Union v. Minister of Civil Service, 1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 WLR 1174 (HL).]
66. In Amarendra Kumar Pandey v. Union of India [Amarendra Kumar Pandey v. Union of India,
(2024) 15 SCC 401 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 881] , this Court elaborated on the different facets of
judicial review regarding subjective opinion or satisfaction. It was held that the courts should not
inquire into correctness or otherwise of the facts found except where the facts found existing are not
supported by any evidence at all or the finding is so perverse that no reasonable man would say that
the facts and circumstances exist. Secondly, it is permissible to inquire whether the facts and
circumstances so found to exist have a reasonable nexus with the purpose for which the power is to
be exercised. In simple words, the conclusion has to logically flow from the facts. If it does not, then
the courts can interfere, treating the lack of reasonable nexus as an error of law. Thirdly,
jurisdictional review permits review of errors of law when constitutional or statutory terms,
essential for the exercise of power, are misapplied or misconstrued. Fourthly, judicial review is
permissible to check improper exercise of power. For instance, it is an improper exercise of power
when the power is not exercised genuinely, but rather to avoid embarrassment or for wreaking
personal vengeance. Lastly, judicial review can be exercised when the authorities have not

Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
considered grounds which are relevant or has accounted for grounds which are not relevant."
(Emphasis supplied) The finding is at paragraph-47. The Apex Court holds that in Section 19(1) of
the Act, the guilt can be established only on admissible evidence to be led before the Court and
cannot be on inadmissible evidence. The learned senior counsel is wanting to draw cue from the said
words of the Apex Court contending that the Directorate of Enforcement has now drawn findings for
reasons to believe on inadmissible evidence. A perusal at the reasons to believe proceedings drawn
by the Directorate of Enforcement no where indicates that it is based on inadmissible evidence. The
evidence as found in the predicate offences particularly of the offence under the Prevention of
Corruption Act, though the sanction is stayed by the coordinate Bench of this Court, would not mean
that the evidence becomes inadmissible for proceeding under the ECIR by the Directorate of
Enforcement.
18. Reliance is also placed on VIJAY MADANLAL CHOUDHARY (supra) by the learned senior
counsel for the petitioner referring to paragraph 253. The said paragraph reads as follows:
"253. Tersely put, it is only such property which is derived or obtained, directly or
indirectly, as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence can be
regarded as proceeds of crime. 256 The authorities under the 2002 Act cannot resort
to action against any person for money-laundering on an assumption that the
property recovered by them must be proceeds of crime and that a scheduled offence
has been committed, unless the same is registered with the jurisdictional police or
pending inquiry by way of complaint before the competent forum. For, the expression
"derived or obtained" is indicative of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence
already accomplished. Similarly, in the event the person named in the criminal
activity relating to a scheduled offence is finally absolved by a Court of competent
jurisdiction owing to an order of discharge, acquittal or because of quashing of the
criminal case (scheduled offence) against him/her, there can be no action for
money-laundering against such a person or person claiming through him in relation
to the property linked to the stated scheduled offence. This interpretation alone can
be countenanced on the basis of the provisions of the 2002 Act, in particular Section
2(1)(u) read with Section 3. Taking any other view would be rewriting of these
provisions and disregarding the express language of definition clause "proceeds of
crime", as it obtains as of now."
The afore-quoted paragraph on which the learned senior counsel places heavy reliance does not take
the petitioner anywhere. The circumstance in which the said paragraph is rendered is entirely
different. The expression, derived or obtained should be indicative of criminal activity, relating to a
scheduled offence already accomplished. Why the finding is rendered is found in the subsequent
paragraphs. Picking few lines from there putting it into these proceedings, is neither here nor there.
19. The case at hand is one, which projects huge corruption by the petitioners. The modus operandi
with regard to misappropriation, amassing of wealth and consequent generation of proceeds of
crime is succinctly brought out in the reasons to believe, that the 1st petitioner is allegedly in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 63
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
possession of proceeds of crime. What is called in question is the arrest of the petitioner
foundationed upon the grounds, in the grounds of arrest and the reasons, in the reasons to believe.
This Court, is ever mindful of the twin imperatives. The inviolable sanctity of individual liberty and
the mandate of the rule of the law. In cases governed by the Act and kindered statutes, like the
UAPA, the statutory scheme mandates disclosure of grounds of arrest. Yet, while such disclosure is
indispensable, the constitutional Courts cannot transmute themselves into Appellate Tribunals,
examining the probative worth of each ground or dissecting every syllable of the reasons, in the
reasons to believe, or the grounds, in the grounds of arrest, so long as the two reflect a demonstrable
application of mind and the fact that the arrest Page No.84 is retyped and replaced vide chamber
order dated 23.04.2025 is not predicated upon whim or conjecture, this Court cannot intrude into
the domain of investigative discretion.
20. Therefore, I do not find any warrant to interfere with the proceedings of arrest to hold that the
arrest of the 1st petitioner is contrary to Section 19 of the Act. The case at hand is a case of
corruption. It becomes germane to notice what the Apex Court observes with regard to cases of
corruption even while considering grant of anticipatory or regular bail, as the case would be. The
Apex Court in the case of DEVINDER KUMAR BANSAL v. STATE OF PUNJAB4, has held as
follows:
"24. If liberty is to be denied to an accused to ensure corruption free society, then the
courts should not hesitate in denying such liberty. Where overwhelming
considerations in the nature aforesaid require denial of anticipatory bail, it has to be
denied. It is altogether a different thing to say that once the investigation is over and
charge-sheet is filed, the court may consider to grant regular bail to a public servant -
accused of indulging in corruption.
25. Avarice is a common frailty of mankind and Robert Walpole's famous
pronouncement that all men have their price, notwithstanding the unsavoury
cynicism that it suggests, is not very far from truth. As far back as more than two
centuries ago, it was Burke who cautioned:"Among a people generally corrupt, liberty
cannot last long". In more recent years, Romain Rolland lamented that France fell
because there was corruption without indignation. Corruption has, in it, very
dangerous potentialities. Corruption, a word of wide connotation has, in respect of
almost 2025 SCC OnLine SC 488 Page No.85 is retyped and replaced vide chamber
order dated 23.04.2025 all the spheres of our day to day life, all the world over, the
limited meaning of allowing decisions and actions to be influenced not by the rights
or wrongs of a case but by the prospects of monetary gains or other selfish
considerations.
26. If even a fraction of what was thevoxpupuli about the magnitude of corruption to
be true, then it would not be far removed from the truth, that it is the rampant
corruption indulged in with impunity by highly placed persons that has led to
economic unrest in this country. If one is asked to name one sole factor that
effectively arrested the progress of our society to prosperity, undeniably it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 64
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
corruption. If the society in a developing country faces a menace greater than even
the one from the hired assassins to its law and order, then that is from the corrupt
elements at the higher echelons of the Government and of the political parties.
27. In Manoj Narula v. Union of India, (2014) 9 SCC 1, this Court held that corruption
erodes the fundamental tenets of the rule of law and quoted with approval its
judgment in Niranjan HemchandraSashittal v. State of Maharashtra, (2013) 4 SCC
642 & held as under:--
"16......'26. It can be stated without any fear of contradiction that corruption is not to
be judged by degree, for corruption mothers disorder, destroys societal will to
progress, accelerates undeserved ambitions, kills the conscience, jettisons the glory of
the institutions, paralyses the economic health of a country, corrodes the sense of
civility and mars the marrows of governance."
(Emphasis supplied)
28. In Subramanian Swamy v. Manmohan Singh,(2012) 3 SCC 64, this Court held as under:--
"68. Today, corruption in our country not only poses a grave danger to the concept of
constitutional governance, it also threatens the very foundation of Indian democracy
and the Rule of Law. The magnitude of corruption in our public life is incompatible
with the concept of a socialist, secular democratic republic. It cannot be disputed that

development and undermines justice, liberty, equality, fraternity which are the core
values in our preambular vision. Therefore, the duty of the Court is that any
anti-corruption law has to be interpreted and worked out in such a fashion as to
strengthen the fight against corruption...."
(Emphasis supplied)
29. In K.C. Sareen v. C.B.I., Chandigarh, (2001) 6 SCC 584, this Court observed thus:--
"12. Corruption by public servants has now reached a monstrous dimension in India.
Its tentacles have started grappling even the institutions created for the protection of
the republic. Unless those tentacles are intercepted and impeded from gripping the
normal and orderly functioning of the public offices, through strong legislative,
executive as well as judicial exercises the corrupt public servants could even paralyse
the functioning of such institutions and thereby hinder the democratic polity...."

30. While approving the judgment of Subramanian Swamy v. Director, Central Bureau of
Investigation, (2014) 8 SCC 682, rendered by another Constitution Bench in Manoj Narula's case, a
Constitution Bench of this Court, dealing with rampant corruption, observed as under:--
"17 Recently, in Subramanian Swamy v. CBI, (2014) 8 SCC 682, the Constitution
Bench, speaking through R.M. Lodha, C.J., while declaring Section 6-A of the Delhi
Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, which was inserted by Act 45 of 2003, as
unconstitutional, has opined that : (SCC pp. 725-26, para 59) "59. It seems to us that
classification which is made in Section 6-A on the basis of status in the government
service is not permissible under Article 14 as it defeats the purpose of finding prima
facie truth into the allegations of graft, which amount to an offence under the PC Act,
1988. Can there be sound differentiation between corrupt public servants based on
their status? Surely not, because irrespective of their status or position, corrupt
public servants are corrupters of public power. The corrupt public servants, whether
high or low, are birds of the same feather and must be confronted with the Page
No.87 is retyped and replaced vide chamber order dated 23.04.2025 process of
investigation and inquiry equally. Based on the position or status in service, no
distinction can be made between public servants against whom there are allegations
amounting to an offence under the PC Act, 1988."
And thereafter, the larger Bench further said:(SCC p. 726, para 60) "60. Corruption is an enemy of
the nation and tracking down corrupt public servants and punishing such persons is a necessary
mandate of the PC Act, 1988. It is difficult to justify the classification which has been made in
Section 6-A because the goal of law in the PC Act, 1988 is to meet corruption cases with a very
strong hand and all public servants are warned through such a legislative measure that corrupt
public servants have to face very serious consequences."
And again : (SCC pp. 730-31, paras 71-72) "71. Office of public power cannot be the workshop of
personal gain. The probity in public life is of great importance. How can two public servants against
whom there are allegations of corruption of graft or bribe-taking or criminal misconduct under the
PC Act, 1988 can be made to be treated differently because one happens to be a junior officer and
the other, a senior decision maker.
72. Corruption is an enemy of nation and tracking down corrupt public servant, howsoever high he
may be, and punishing such person is a necessary mandate under the PC Act, 1988. The status or
position of public servant does not qualify such public servant from exemption from equal
treatment. The decision-making power does not segregate corrupt officers into two classes as they
are common crime-doers and have to be tracked down by the same process of inquiry and
investigation."
18. From the aforesaid authorities, it is clear as noonday that corruption has the potentiality to
destroy many a progressive aspect and it has acted as the formidable enemy of the nation."

Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
31. In Neera Yadavv. Central Bureau of Investigation, (2017) 8 SCC 757, this Court observed thus:
"59. Every country feels a constant longing for good governance, righteous use of
power and transparency in administration. Corruption is no longer a moral issue as it
is linked with the search of wholesome governance and the society's need for
re-assurance that the system functions fairly, free from corruption and nepotism.
Corruption has spread its tentacles almost on all the key areas of the State and it is an
impediment to the growth of investment and development of the country. If the
conduct of administrative authorities is righteous and duties are performed in good
faith with the vigilance and awareness that they are public trustees of people's rights,
the issue of lack of accountability would themselves fade into insignificance.
60. To state the ubiquity of corruption, we may refer to the oft-quoted words of
Kautilya, which reads as under:--
"Just as it is impossible not to taste the honey or the poison that finds itself at the tip
of the tongue, so it is impossible for a government servant not to eat up, at least, a bit
of the king's revenue. Just as fish moving under water cannot possibly be found out
either as drinking or not drinking water, so government servants employed in the
government work cannot be found out (while) taking money for themselves).
It is possible to mark the movements of birds flying high up in the sky; but not so is it
possible to ascertain the movement of government servants of hidden purpose."
[Ref: Kautilya'sArthasastra by R. Shamasastry, Second Edition, Page 77] As pointed out by Paul H.
Douglas in his book on "Ethics of Government", "corruption was rife in British public life till a
hundred years ago and in USA till the beginning of this century. Nor can it be claimed that it has
been altogether eliminated anywhere."
(Ref : Santhanam Committee Report, 1962 : Para 2.3).
61. Tackling corruption is going to be a priority task for the Government. The Government has been
making constant efforts to deal with the problem of corruption. However, the constant legislative
reforms and strict judicial actions have still not been able to completely uproot the deeply rooted
evil of corruption. This is the area where the Government needs to be seen taking unrelenting, stern
and uncompromising steps. Leaders should think of introducing good and effective leadership at the
helm of affairs; only then benefits of liberalization and various programmes, welfare schemes and
programmes would reach the masses. Lack of awareness and supine attitude of the public has all
along been found to be to the advantage of the corrupt. Due to the uncontrolled spread of
consumerism and fall in moral values, corruption has taken deep roots in the society. What is
needed is a reawakening and recommitment to the basic values of tradition rooted in ancient and
external wisdom. Unless people rise against bribery and corruption, society can never be rid of this
disease. The people can collectively put off this evil by resisting corruption by any person, howsoever
high he or she may be."

Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court observes that, if denial of liberty to an accused, is the price to
be paid for a corruption free society, the Courts then should not hesitate in denying such liberty.
The Apex Court holds that the High Court had rightly denied anticipatory bail for the petitioner
therein who had been alleged of offence punishable under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption
Act.
21. In its elucidation on the scourge of money laundering and the role of the Directorate of
Enforcement in checking corruption, the Apex Court in a very recent judgment in the case of
PRADEEP NIRANKARNATH SHARMA v. DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT5, has held as
follows:
".... .... ....
25. The law recognizes that money laundering is not a static event but an ongoing activity, as long as
illicit gains are possessed, projected as legitimate, or reintroduced into the economy. Thus, the
argument that the offence is not continuing does not hold good in law or on facts, and therefore, the
judgment of the High Court cannot be set aside on this ground. Even if examined in the context of
the present case, the appellant's contention does not hold water. The material on record indicates
the continued and repeated misuse of power and position by the appellant, resulting in the
generation and utilization of proceeds of crime over an extended period. The respondent has
successfully demonstrated prima facie that the appellant remained involved in financial transactions
linked to proceeds of crime beyond the initial point of commission. The utilization of such proceeds,
the alleged layering and integration, and the efforts to project such funds as untainted all constitute
elements of a continuing offence under the PMLA. Thus, the proceedings initiated against the
appellant are well within the legal framework and cannot be assailed on this ground.
26. Another ground urged by the appellant is that the amount involved does not meet the statutory
threshold for initiating proceedings under the PMLA as it stood prior to the amendment. The
appellant has relied upon the monetary threshold of Rs. 30 lakhs to argue that at the relevant time,
the offence did not attract the provisions of the PMLA. This argument is equally devoid of merit.
2025 SCC OnLine SC 560
27. The respondent has placed substantial material on record to demonstrate that the quantum of
proceeds of crime significantly exceeds the statutory threshold. The financial trail indicates that the
aggregated value of assets derived from the alleged criminal activity is well beyond the prescribed
limit. It is settled law that the determination of the threshold value must be based on the entirety of
the transaction and not an isolated instance or a narrow interpretation of specific amounts at any
given time.
28. The respondent has categorically established that the amount in question far exceeds the
threshold of Rs. 30 lakhs, even under the unamended provisions of the PMLA. The allegations
against the appellant involve alleged land allotment transactions facilitated through forgery,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 68
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
cheating, and fraud, resulting in an alleged loss of over Rs. 1 crore to the government, along with
hawala transactions of crores of rupees, and illegal gratification through his wife of around Rs. 22
Lakhs. The financial transactions in the alleged acts, as evidenced from the record, reveal a
considerably higher amount of proceeds of crime, rendering the appellant's reliance on the
threshold limit baseless.
29. Furthermore, it is settled law that the determination of the amount involved in a money
laundering offence is not to be viewed in isolation but in the context of the overall financial trail and
associated transactions. The totality of the evidence must be assessed, which is a matter of trial; but
even on a prima facie assessment, it is clear that the proceeds of crime in the present case are
significantly higher than the statutory threshold. The appellant has failed to substantiate his claim
with any material that contradicts the respondent's submissions in this regard. Therefore, this
ground also does not aid the appellant in any manner.
30. The PMLA was enacted with the primary objective of preventing money laundering and
confiscating the proceeds of crime, thereby ensuring that such illicit funds do not undermine the
financial system. Money laundering has far-reaching consequences, not only in terms of individual
acts of corruption but also in causing significant loss to the public exchequer. The laundering of
proceeds of crime results in a significant loss to the economy, disrupts lawful financial transactions,
and erodes public trust in the system. The alleged offences in the present case have a direct bearing
on the economy, as illicit financial transactions deprive the state of legitimate revenue, distort
market integrity, and contribute to economic instability. Such acts, when committed by persons in
positions of power, erode public confidence in governance and lead to systemic vulnerabilities
within financial institutions.
31. The illegal diversion and layering of funds have a cascading effect, leading to revenue losses for
the state and depriving legitimate sectors of investment and financial resources. It is settled law that
in cases involving serious economic offences, judicial intervention at a preliminary stage must be
exercised with caution, and proceedings should not be quashed in the absence of compelling legal
grounds. The respondent has rightly argued that in cases involving allegations of such magnitude, a
trial is imperative to establish the full extent of wrongdoing and to ensure accountability.
32. The PMLA was enacted to combat the menace of money laundering and to curb the use of
proceeds of crime in the formal economy. Given the evolving complexity of financial crimes, courts
must adopt a strict approach in matters concerning economic offences to ensure that perpetrators
do not exploit procedural loopholes to evade justice.
33. The present case involves grave and serious allegations of financial misconduct, misuse of
position, and involvement in transactions constituting money laundering. The appellant seeks an
end to the proceedings at a preliminary stage, effectively preventing the full adjudication of facts and
evidence before the competent forum. However, as established in multiple judicial pronouncements,
cases involving economic offences necessitate a thorough trial to unearth the complete chain of
events, financial transactions, and culpability of the accused.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47236106/ 69
Sri R M Manjunath Gowda vs Directorate Of Enforcement on 22 April, 2025
34. The material submitted by the respondent, coupled with the broad legislative framework of the
PMLA, indicates the necessity of allowing the trial to proceed and not discharging the appellant at
the nascent stage of charge framing. The argument that the proceedings are unwarranted is devoid
of substance in light of the statutory objectives, the continuing nature of the offence, and the
significant financial implications arising from the alleged acts. Discharging the appellant at this
stage would be premature and contrary to the principles governing the prosecution in money
laundering cases.
35. Given the severe and grave nature of the allegations against the appellant, it is imperative that he
must undergo thorough judicial scrutiny during trial. A proper trial is necessary to unearth the full
extent of the offence, to evaluate the evidence produced by the appellant, to analyze the complete
chain of final transactions, and find out the veracity of the severe allegations and the amount of
proceeds of crime. The legal framework under the PMLA serves as a crucial mechanism to ensure
that individuals involved in laundering proceeds of crime are brought to justice and that economic
offences do not go unpunished."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court observes that money laundering is not a momentary event, but
a continuing and pernicious process as long as illicit gains, possessed, projected as legitimate, and
reintroduced into the economy. Enactment of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, the
Apex Court, observes, was imperative, aimed at forestalling the transformation of unclean money
into clean currency and safeguarding the integrity of the financial system. Money laundering, the
Apex Court notes, inflicts not just isolated instances, but also inflicts grievous injury upon the public
exchequer.
22. The case at hand, is a mirror held up to, systematic corruption. Therefore, upon a meticulous
consideration of the facts, the grounds, the elucidation of the law by the Apex Court and the corpus
of the material on record, this Court finds no infirmity that would warrant interference.
Wherefore, the petition should necessarily meet its dismissal. It so does.
Accordingly, petition stands dismissed.
