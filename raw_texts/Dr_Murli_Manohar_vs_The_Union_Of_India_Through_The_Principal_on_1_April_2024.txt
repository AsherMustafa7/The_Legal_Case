Dr.Murli Manohar vs The Union Of India Through The Principal on 1 April, 2024
[2] It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner was appointed to the post of Visiting Assistant
Professor in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering in the Indian Institute
of Information Technology Manipur, vide order dated 25th June, 2015 on contract basis for a period
of one year. Service of the petitioner was extended from time to time. Order dated 30th May, 2023 is
the last such extension of service w.e.f. 03.06.2023 to 02.11.2023.
[3] It is also stated that the petitioner while serving as Assistant Professor in the Department of
Electronics and Communication Engineering from 1st July 2015 to 08.04.2019, the Interim
Director, IIT Manipur issued certificate dated 08.04.2019 for his sincere service and experience.
Further, the petitioner requested the Director, IIIT Senapati, Manipur for issuance of experience
certificate for the period from 01.07.2015 to till date. The petitioner tendered another representation
dated 23.02.2023 to the Director, IIIT, Manipur for issuance of experience certificate as he wished
to WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 2 apply to other
institutes in the interest of his career. However, the Director assured the petitioner that his service
would be extended again till his regularization and that he needs not apply elsewhere and on that
ground experience certificate has not been issued till date. Due to non-issuance of experience
certificate, petitioner has been deprived of his right to apply to other institutes and it is stated that
such certificate is mandatory for applying for appointment to other institutes.
[4] The petitioner further stated that without issuing any termination order, he was informed
verbally on 01.11.2023 that his contract would not be extended beyond 02.11.2023 and no reason
whatsoever was assigned for the same. Further, the terms of his employment stipulate that a notice
period of three months would be intimated before termination of contract. No such notice was
issued, nor was any show cause notice served to the petitioner. [5] It is submitted that the other four
incumbents who had joined IIIT, Manipur along with the petitioner have all been allowed to
continue in their service, and only the petitioner has been personally picked and victimised. The
petitioner is even more qualified than some of the other four incumbents. [6] The petitioner, having
no alternative, approached this Court praying for allowing him to continue in his post and to
regularize him to the said post with all consequential benefits. WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH
MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 3 [7] Respondents have filed affidavit-in-opposition
stating that the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Manipur, an Institute of national
importance under the Ministry of Education, Government of India, was established under the
public-private partnership (PPP) mode under the Indian Institutes of Information Technology
(Public Private Partnership) Act, 2017 and Statute of 2017 with stock holding of (i) Govt. of India-
57.5%, (ii) Govt. Of Manipur- 35.0%, and (iii) M/s Cyber Corporation Manipur Ltd (CCML)- 7.5%
with a view to develop new knowledge in information technology and to provide manpower in this
field. Initially, IIT, Senapati, Manipur was established in the year 2015 and in the 2 nd Governing
Body Meeting of IIIT-Manipur held on 19.02.2015, a total of 16 numbers of various faculty and other
22 non-faculty staff for the institute was proposed. As a contingency plan awaiting regular
recruitment of the posts as per rules, it was further proposed to share faculties of other nearby
institutes and to explore outsourcing. In the year 2015, the Interim Director of IIT-Manipur
appointed 6 (six) Visiting Assistant Professors on temporary contract basis for a period of one year.
It is stated that the petitioner was one among them and was appointed as Visiting Assistant
Professor (on contract) on 01.07.2015 on the basis of the resume submitted by the applicant. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123882690/ 2
Dr.Murli Manohar vs The Union Of India Through The Principal on 1 April, 2024
clarified that the engagement/appointment was done without due process of recruitment through
open advertisement or WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF
2023 4 through a selection committee and as a stop gap arrangement till the completion of the
recruitment process on regular basis. The contractual service of the contract Visiting Assistant
Professors including the petitioner has been extended from time to time. It is further stated that the
extension of the contract service is on the basis of performance as per Clause 2 of the Terms of
Appointment for the Purely Temporary Faculty. Clause 3 provides that the temporary appointment
will be terminated automatically on expiry of the contract period. Clause 12 further provides that the
temporary service is terminable with three months' notice on either side. One of the appointees left
the institute in the year 2019 for regular employment in some other place and out of the 6 original
appointees, only 5 Visiting Assistant Professors are remaining in the institute. It is reiterated that
the institute has the right not to renew/extend the contractual term of the petitioner considering the
nature of his appointment and the numerous adverse reports filed against him which were also
endorsed by the Head of Department, Electronic and Communication Engineering, Head of
Academic Section and Warden of the Girls Hostel. As per Annexure R-4 (colly) appended to the
counter affidavit, the profile of 6 Faculty recruited in the year 2015 on temporary basis in different
departments, seven adverse remarks have been recorded in the remarks column against the
petitioner such as, (i) harassing & intimidation of a female WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH
MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 5 student, (ii) negligence of duty & subordination,
(iii) repeated complaints of students on his poor teaching, (iv) unauthorised absence on 27.11.2023
& 31.10.2023, (v) disregard of institute rules and causing nuisance, (vi) not adhering to timeline for
submission of assessment marks resulting in inordinate delay, and (vii) not maintaining and
conducting lab experiments effectively as mandated. The performance of the petitioner was assessed
as NOT satisfactory. Copies of the reports from HoD (ECE), HoS (Academic), Warden of Girl
Hostels and statements of girl inmates are attached to the profile of the petitioner.
[8] The petitioner filed rejoinder affidavit reiterating the contents of the writ petition and denying
the allegations made against him in the counter affidavit of the respondents. It is stated that the
petitioner has been subjected to harassment and ill treatment with an ulterior motive to terminate
him and appoint someone else in his place. It is denied the allegation of unauthorised absence. It is
stated that the service of other candidates has been extended while the same is illegally denied to
him and the allegation of poor performance and unsatisfactory service are an afterthought to cover
up the lapses on the part of the respondents. The non- functioning of the lab was due to
unavailability/defective equipment in spite of his requisition for rectification of the same. Regarding
delay in assessment of answer scripts, it is clarified that he was not WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH
MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 6 given sufficient time to evaluate and the
department has not set any time frame. It is also stated that the female student and hostel warden
have already withdrawn the complaint against him. It is pointed out that the IIIT-Manipur awarded
a Certificate of Appreciation to the petitioner for highest attendance in the semester and for his
contribution on the occasion of 1st Institute Day held on 21.04.2023. Due to non-issuance of
experience certificate, the petitioner missed to appear in an interview for faculty for ISBM College of
Engineering, Pune to be held on 09.12.2023. [9] The respondents filed their reply to the rejoinder
affidavit filed by the petitioner. It is stated that the petitioner did not furnish any copy of tickets to
justify his late joining to duty from leave nor did he send any mail in this regard. It is stated that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123882690/ 3
Dr.Murli Manohar vs The Union Of India Through The Principal on 1 April, 2024
service of 4 other employees was extended based on their performance and the same was denied to
the petitioner due to poor performance and complaints against him. Regarding the requisition
submitted by the petitioner for purchase of equipment, the same could not be processed as it was
not supported by necessary documents and other technical defects. It is further stated that the
petitioner could not submit the assessment marks in spite of reminders from the institute.
Regarding the withdrawal of the complaint by a female student, it is clarified that the same was
addressed to the hostel warden and not reached the office of the institute. The other 3 WP(C) NO.
764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 7 students have not retracted
from their statements against the petitioner.
[10] Along with the writ petition, the petitioner also filed an application being MC(WP(C)) No. 342
of 2023 for restraining the respondents from disturbing his service during the pendency of the writ
petition. On 06.12.2023, another application being MC(WP(C)) No. 414 of 2023 was also
subsequently filed for a direction to the respondent No.2 to issue experience certificate in respect of
the petitioner for the service rendered by him in IIIT-Manipur. On 03.11.2023 this Court issued
notice and learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents sought some time for instructions
and the matter was directed to be listed on 07.11.2023 for consideration of interim relief.
[11] Vide order dated 07.11.2013, this Court passed an interim order directing the respondents to
allow the petitioner to continue in the service till next date as temporary service of four other
persons initially appointed along with the petitioner was extended. This Court observed that the
matter required hearing after filing of counter and rejoinder affidavits and did not express any
opinion on the regularisation of the service of the petitioner. The matter was directed to be listed on
23.11.2023 for final disposal. [12] The respondents challenged the interim order dated 07.11.2023 by
way of an appeal being WA No.98 of 2023 and vide WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C))
NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 8 order dated 22.11.2023, the appeal against interim order was
dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court being devoid of any merit at that stage.
[13] After completion of pleadings, the matter was finally heard on 15.01.2024 and reserved for
order. Earlier the petitioner moved a contempt petition being Cont. Case (C) No.118 of 2023 alleging
violation of the interim order dated 07.11.2023, but the same was closed on 23.11.2023 recording the
submission of the respondents that the interim order had already been complied with. [14] Mr. B P
Sahu, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been victimised by
the respondents. While contractual service of other employees appointed along with the petitioner
has been extended, his service has not been extended without giving any reason and with a mala fide
intention. It is pointed out that as per Clause 12 of terms of employment, a notice of 3 months would
be required for termination of service and the same was not complied by the respondents. It is
asserted that such action is arbitrary and violative of the principles of equality enshrined in Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It is pointed out that the plea of unsatisfactory service and
adverse reports against the petitioner is an after thought to cover up the observations made by this
Court as well as the Division Bench in appeal regarding non- intimation of show cause notice to the
petitioner. WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 9 [15] Mr.
B P Sahu, learned senior counsel draws the attention of this Court to the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Raman Kumar v. Union of India: 2023 Live Law (SC) 520 @ Para 8 &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123882690/ 4
Dr.Murli Manohar vs The Union Of India Through The Principal on 1 April, 2024
20 where the service of remaining 30 employees were directed to be regularised where the service of
35 similarly situated persons had already been regularised by the authority. Reliance is also placed
on a decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Central Agricultural University v. Gopal
Bhandari [WP(C) No. 765 of 2016, Order dated 30.01.2023] where it was deprecated the practice of
selective absorption of similarly situated persons. Reference is made to the decision of Bombay High
Court in the case of Pandurang Kashinath More v. Union of India: AIR 1959 Bom 134 to highlight
the point that guarantee given by Articles 14 and 16 extends to all strata of employment whether it
be temporary or permanent. Learned senior counsel also cites decision of Calcutta High Court in the
case of Saroj Agarwal v. Union of India:
Indiankanoon.org/ doc/4098839 where back wage was granted as the employer
victimised the employee. It is prayed that the writ petition be allowed and the
respondents be directed to extend the contractual service of the petitioner as done for
other similarly persons and to issue experience certificate to him for applying in other
institutes.
WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 10
[16] Per contra, Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI submits that it is the settled
proposition of the law that a contract employee has no inherent right to claim for
extension of his service and regularisation thereof. He draws the attention of this
Court to the "Terms of Appointment for the Purely Temporary Faculty" [Page 18- 19
of writ petition]. Clause 1 stipulates that the appointment as Visiting Assistant
Professor is purely temporary in nature. Clause 2 provides that further extension will
be based on performance and Clause 3 prescribes for automatic termination of
temporary appointment on expiry of contract period. As per Clause 4, the
performance of Visiting Assistant Professor will be reviewed by the authority and
Clause 12 provides that the temporary service is terminable with 3 months' notice on
either side. Learned DSGI explains that the contract is automatically terminated by
efflux of time unless extended and 3 months' notice is required for pre-
mature termination before expiry of the period of contract. It is stated that the performance of other
candidates is satisfactory and hence their service has further been extended. But in the case of the
petitioner, there are lots of complaints against him and his performance was not satisfactory to the
institute as reflected in the profile of contract Visiting Assistant Professors as enumerated in
Annexure R-4 appended to the counter affidavit of the respondents. It is clarified that no written
intimation is required for non-extension WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF
2023 & 414 OF 2023 11 of temporary engagement in terms of Clause 3 of the terms of engagement.
It is further reiterated that in view of such serious adverse materials against him, the term of
engagement of the petitioner is not extended and he cannot claim for automatic extension and
regularisation. It is pointed out that the engagement was done without following due process as a
stop gap arrangement at the initial stage.
[17] Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI relies on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Yogesh Mahajan v. Professor R C Deka: (2018) 3 SCC 218 @ Para 6 to the point the contract
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123882690/ 5
Dr.Murli Manohar vs The Union Of India Through The Principal on 1 April, 2024
employee has no right to have his or her contract renewed from time to time. There was no material
to show that the contractual appointment was made as per prescribed rules. Reliance is also placed
on the case of Vidyavardhaka Sangha v. Y D Deshpande: (2006) 12 SCC 482 @ Para 4 holding that
'.... the appointment made on probation/ad hoc basis for a specified period of time comes to an end
by efflux of time and the person holding such post can have no right to continue on the post .... and
ask for regularisation, etc'. Referring to the above decisions, learned DSGI submits that the
petitioner who has been appointed on temporary basis for a fixed period cannot claim for further
extension as a right and his service is terminable by efflux of time. The extension is purely
discretionary power of the respondents on appraisal of the WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH
MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 12 performance. In the present case, the respondents
choose not to extend the contract of the petitioner due to poor and unsatisfactory performance. As
regard application being MC(WP(C)) No. 414 of 2023 for direction for issuing experience certificate,
it is submitted that the same is not maintainable being a separate and an independent cause. It is
prayed that the writ petition along with applications be dismissed being devoid of any merit. [18]
This Court considers the material on record, the submissions made at bar and the decisions cited by
parties.
[19] The point for determination involved in the present case is whether temporary appointee for a
fixed term like the petitioner herein has an inherent right for claiming for extension of his
appointment and regularisation.
[20] Admitted facts in the present case are that the petitioner and others were engaged on
temporary basis as Visiting Assistant Professors in IIIT-Manipur as a stop gap arrangement in 2015
at initial stage till competition of process for regular appointments. Their service has been extended
from time to time. The initial engagement on temporary basis was not done through open
advertisement as per procedure prescribed by rules. It is clear from a bare perusal of "Terms of
Appointment for the Purely Temporary Faculty" that the appointment is on purely temporary
WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 13 basis for a fixed
period extendable on performance basis and the temporary appointment is automatically
terminated on expiry of the contract period. Performance will be assessed by the authority. Pre-
mature termination can be made with three months' notice from either side. As per the terms of
temporary appointment, the extension is performance based at the discretion of the authority and
there is no inherent right for such extension. The above cited case laws stipulate that the temporary
appointees have no right to claim for extension and their temporary services will be terminated with
efflux of time. However, there is a caveat to this settled principle that there can be no discrimination
amongst similarly situated persons while considering for extension or regularisation. It is also
settled law that equality under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India would extend to all
employees whether regular or contract. Within this prism, the claim of the petitioner has to be
examined.
[21] It is the case of the petitioner that he has been discriminated and victimised by the respondents.
While other similarly appointees have been granted extension of temporary engagement, the same
benefit is not given to the petitioner without any reason. It is also pointed out that the allegation of
not satisfactory service and adverse report is an afterthought to dilute the observations of this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123882690/ 6
Dr.Murli Manohar vs The Union Of India Through The Principal on 1 April, 2024
for not giving any reason or show WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 &
414 OF 2023 14 cause. On the other hand, it is the specific case of the respondents that the
temporary service of the petitioner has not been extended due to non-satisfactory performance and
complaints against him. As per terms of appointment, the term of appointment can be extended on
performance basis to be evaluated by the concerned authorities of the respondents. It is pointed out
that the performance of the petitioner is not found to be satisfactory and he is rightly not considered
for extension. It is the case of respondents that giving reasons for non-extension of temporary
service is not required as the service is automatically terminated with efflux of time unless extended
further. The reason given in the counter-affidavit by the respondent for non-extension is just to
answer the allegations made by the petitioner in the writ petition. It is stated that the same cannot
be construed as an afterthought.
[22] This Court finds force in the submissions of Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI appearing on
behalf of the respondents. As per terms of temporary appointment, the engagement is automatically
terminated by efflux of time unless extended by the authority on appraisal of satisfactory
performance. This Court is of the considered view that the temporary appointee has no inherent
right to claim extension and the same is discretion of the authority on appraisal of performance. If
similarly placed persons are given extension of service, then the court can interfere and pass WP(C)
NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 15 appropriate directions in
favour of similarly situated persons who have been left out. However, in the present case, the case of
four persons whose service has been extended are not similarly situated as that of the petitioner. The
authority found the performance of four of them as satisfactory and that of petitioner not
satisfactory as reflected in Annexure R-4 (profile of temporary Visiting Assistant Professors engaged
in 2015). The facts of the case laws cited by the petitioner are not similar to the present case as
similarly situated persons were discriminated therein and the courts had to interfere on the
principle of equality. But, in the present case, the performance of the petitioner is not satisfactory
and he is not at par with four other colleagues and is not considered for extension in view of terms of
appointment.
[23] In view of the observations and findings arrived as above, specially in Para 22, this Court does
not find any merit in the writ petition and accordingly, the same is dismissed. Interim order dated
07.11.2023 is vacated. However, in order to do complete justice and to avoid multiplicity of
litigations, the respondents are directed to issue experience certificate to the petitioner within a
period of 15 days from the date of receiving of a copy of this order, if the same is permissible as per
rule/instruction. The parties are directed to bear their own costs.
WP(C) NO. 764 OF 2023 WITH MC(WP(C)) NOS.342 OF 2023 & 414 OF 2023 16 [24] Send a copy
of this order to the Director, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Manipur at Mantripukhri
for information and necessary compliance.
