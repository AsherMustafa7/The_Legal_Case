Code and Sections 5/6 of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
The case of the prosecution is that, on 13.02.2019 at about 11:00 pm, the prosecutrix, aged about 16
years 8 months was found to be disappeared from her residential house situated at Village Jhagra
under the jurisdiction of Police Station Keolari, District Seoni. A missing person's report was lodged

under Sections 161 of Criminal Procedure Code have been recorded. Later on, her statement under
Section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code The High Court Of Madhya Pradesh MCRC-12008-2019
(ANKIT KUMAR THAKUR Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) has also been recorded. On
that basis, offence under Sections under Sections 366, 376 and 376 (2) (n) of the Indian Penal Code
and Section 5/6 of Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012 have been added in the
already registered crime and the applicant has been arrested on 18.02.2019.

ready to furnish adequate surety and shall abide by all terms and conditions imposed upon him.
There is no chance of his absconding or tampering with the evidence. Learned counsel for the
applicant has also submitted that the date of birth of the prosecutrix in the school register is
incorrect. The actual date of birth of the prosecutrix is 26.07.1999, regarding which applicant has
submitted the certificate obtained from Anganwadi Center, Jhagra. It is also submitted that the
applicant has been in custody since 18.02.2019. In view of the aforesaid, prayer has been made to
enlarge the applicant on bail.
Learned Government Advocate for the respondent/ State on the other hand has opposed the
application and submitted that the applicant has forcefully taken the prosecutrix and committed
sexual intercourse with her against her will; hence, prima-facie found involved in such The High
Court Of Madhya Pradesh MCRC-12008-2019 (ANKIT KUMAR THAKUR Vs THE STATE OF
MADHYA PRADESH) a heinous crime. In view of the aforesaid, he is not entitled to be released on
bail.
Geeta Bai Sahu, Anganwadi Worker, Anganwadi Center, Jhagra is present in the Court and
submitted that she has issued the certificate in which date of birth of the prosecutrix was shown to
be 26.07.1999 on the basis of Immunization Register maintained by Anganwadi Center. However, as
per school record, which was obtained by the concerned Police the date of birth of the prosecutrix is
shown to be 13.06.2002. In the considered opinion of this Court the date of birth as mentioned in
the school record i.e. 13.06.2002 is authentic and admissible in evidence at this stage.
As far as the merits of the case is concerned, on going through the statements of the prosecutrix
recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of Cr.P.C., it appears that prosecutrix clearly alleged that the
applicant had forcibly abducted her from her house and taken her to Nagpur and at Nagpur he has
committed forcible sexual intercourse with her.
However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case in their entirety, particularly the
fact as pointed out by the learned Government Advocate and having regard to the gravity and
seriousness of the offence, in the opinion of this Court, at this stage it is not a fit case to grant bail to
the applicant.
Consequently, this first application for bail under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
filed on behalf of applicant, stands dismissed.
