complainant-T.B. Majjagi (PW1) before Malmaruti Police Station in Crime No.26 of 2015 for the
offences punishable under Sections 306, 511, 109 of Indian Penal Code alleging that being unable to
bear the mental harassment given by PW1 forcing her to take back the complaints, on 29th January,
2015 at about 4.00 am, she made an attempt to commit suicide by consuming expired/date- barred

conspiracy and filed complaints before Malmaruti Police Station in Crime No.286 of 2014, 19 of
2015 and 26 of 2015, through accused No.1 and defamed the complainant and caused his illegal
detention and thereby, curtailed his right of freedom and hence, accused have committed offences
punishable under Sections 109, 192, 211, 195, 120B, 420, 467, 468, 471 read with Section 34 of
Indian Penal Code.

procedure, facts, and probabilities of the case. He would submit that the alleged motive and
intention of the accused to commit the alleged offences has not been proved. As regards the
allegation made by the prosecution as to conspiracy under Section 120B of Indian Penal Code is
concerned, none of the witnesses or documents would speak about the exact date, time and place of
conspiracy. Complainant-PW1, for the first time, has come up

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 with dates of conspiracy only during the course of evidence before the
Court and stated that on 02nd, 05th and 08th November 2014, at about 6.00 pm, all the accused
gathered in the parking place of Office of HESCOM Urban Division at Nehru Nagar, Belagavi. These
dates neither appear in the complaint- Exhibit P1 nor in the panchanama or in previous proceedings
alleged to be held before the departmental enquiry, report of Women's Grievance Redressal
Committee, etc. Therefore, the prosecution has failed to prove the allegations levelled against the
accused. He would submit that the PW1 and other witnesses have admitted that the alleged place of
conspiracy is a public place, so also, all the accused were working in different places and they never
worked together with accused No.1 or with PW1 at any point of time. Therefore, the allegation of
alleged conspiracy is only created one. It is further submitted that some of the accused have
appeared in the photographs produced by the prosecution. Those photographs are collected by PW1

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 accused 2 to 4, 7 to 9 and 11 to 13 are not the elected members of KPTCL
Employees Union or it was denied that they are the Office Bearers of the said Union. It is the main
allegation of the complainant and the prosecution that accused No.2 created false document Exhibit
P19, mentioning himself as a Vice President of KPTCL Employees Union, though he was not. But,
PW1 in his cross-examination, has admitted that accused No.2 was Vice-President and DW1 has
clearly stated in his evidence that accused No.2 was appointed as Vice President, as per Exhibit D32.
Therefore, Exhibit D32 is contrary to the letter-Exhibit P28 issued by PW13. This proves that the
accused No.2 was Vice President of the KPTCL Employees Union at the relevant point of time. It is
further submitted that there is no intention or motive on behalf of the accused that, after issuing the
letter at Exhibit P19, PW1 was suspended and transferred to some other place. On the contrary, it is
established by the defence that PW1 was suspended as per Rules and Regulations, as PW1 was
remanded to judicial custody for more than 48 hours. Exhibit P19 is ignored by higher officials and
same is not considered at any point of time.

before the XI Additional District & Sessions Court at Belagavi, wherein for the first time, the name
of accused 2 to 10 appeared and on the basis of said affidavits, PW1 filed complaint before
Malmaruti Police which was registered in Crime No.44 of 2017 for the above said offences is
concerned, till that date, the complainant never made any attempt to file a case against any of the
accused including accused No.1. Though 'B' final reports have been submitted long back by

them as per the order of this Court in Criminal Petition No.100261 of 2017 dated 16th February
2018, as also, as per the orders of Retired District Judge Sri J.S. Somashekhar, in his report dated

Court as well as before the departmental enquiry, considering the allegations, evidence and
documents produced before this Court, so also considering those documents, the High Court
quashed all three First Information Reports filed by PW1 and also the private complaint filed by
PW1 for defamation against accused 2 to 10 and the Presiding Officer was pleased to exonerate

circumstances before the trial Court are one and the same, and if the accused is exonerated in the
Departmental Enquiry, then the trial Court can also accept the enquiry report and exonerate the
accused in the proceedings before it. In the said Judgment, the Hon'ble High Court of Orissa was
pleased to consider the Judgments rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in that regard.
23. It is further submitted that the prosecution failed to prove that allegations made to attract the
offences punishable under Sections 195 & 211 of IPC, wherein no action was taken against the
alleged affidavits filed by accused No.1 or enquiry conducted against any of the accused, as
contemplated under Sections 340 & 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure and also before the

The trial Court cannot go through those documents without valid certificate, under Section 65B of

the alleged affidavits Exhibits P11 and P12 cannot be construed against the accused in the trial
Court. He would submit that the defence tried their level best before the trial Court to show that the

the accused. On all these grounds he sought to allow Criminal Appeals No.100355, 100356, 100370
& 100371 of 2024 filed on behalf of the accused 2 & 4 to 12. To buttress his submission, he has also
relied on the judgment in the case of SANTOKH SINGH v. IZHAR HUSSAIN AND ANOTHER
reported in case of 1973(2) SCC 406.
Submission on behalf of appellant/Accused No.3:
26. Sri Jagdish Patil, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant/accused No.3 in Criminal Appeal

the complainant-T.B. Majjagi (PW1) had alleged that accused No.1 had lodged a bogus complaint
against him, yet, at no point of time prior to this, the complainant has named the present accused.
The complainant has admitted in the cross- examination that even during the enquiry, he has not
stated anything about the other accused, including this accused having instigated or aided for
lodging of bogus complaint by accused No.1. It is only based on the affidavits filed by the accused
No.1 that the involvement of other accused is being alleged. Accused No.1 has also lodged a
complaint way back in the year 2012 which is registered in SC No.70 of 2012. He would further
submit that though the incident is of the year 2014, the complaint was lodged only in the year 2017
and the inordinate delay in filing the complaint is not explained either in the First Information

Exhibits P11 & P12, making allegations of involvement of other accused including the present
accused, accused No.1 had tried to commit suicide. The contents of affidavits Exhibits P11 & P12
filed by accused No.1, could not have been treated either as confession or as material conclusion
concerning the involvement of the present appellant but only as affidavits, and the same could not
have been relied upon by the trial Court to conclude the involvement of the present appellant in the
incident concerning the involvement of the complainant. The affidavits filed by accused No.1 do not
comply with the provisions of Karnataka Criminal Rules of Practice 1968, more specifically,
provisions found in Rule (1) of Chapter XVI. Since provisions of Criminal Rules of Practice having
not been followed, Affidavits filed by accused No.1, could not have been relied upon by the trial
Court.

28. His further submission is that the name of the appellant/accused is not reflected in the charge
sheet and only upon the application filed by the complainant under Section 319 of Code of Criminal
Procedure seeking arraying the complainant as accused, he was arrayed as an accused in the instant
case and there is no credible material to even file a charge sheet against the present accused. The
entire case of prosecution is based on contradictory and circumstantial evidence and hence, he prays
for acquittal of the appellant/accused. Submission on behalf of appellant/accused No.1:

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 P12. These Exhibits cannot be construed as affidavits at all as per Chapter
XVI Rule (1) of Karnataka Criminal Rules of Practice, 1968, as the affidavits filed by accused no.1, do
not contain cause-title. Admittedly, the person who has identified the appellant is not the counsel on
record. Even the suit in OS No.1/2023 (Exhibit D23) is pending consideration before competent
Civil Court, so also, complaint in CC No.68 of 2022 (Exhibit D22) is also pending consideration
before the competent Criminal Court. Admittedly, while withdrawing/dismissing the Criminal
Revision Petitions, no order is passed on alleged affidavits nor they are taken into consideration.
The Criminal Revision Petitions preferred by the appellant/accused No.1 are also not dismissed on
merits and if really, the respondent therein i.e. complainant herein, was really innocent, he ought to
have resisted withdrawal of Revision Petitions and contested the matter on merits as well as
prosecuted the appellant/accused No.1 for having given false evidence. The contents of Affidavits

the affidavits are read in its entirety, no offence can be made out as against the appellant/accused
No.1, as it would clearly demonstrate that no intention was forthcoming on the part of the appellant
herein. The overall mitigating factors would clearly reveal that, in fact, the appellant herein has been
utilised as a tool to settle the score of the complainant-PW1. The Investigating Officer ought to have
conducted the investigation in a way so as to ascertain the truthfulness of the allegations made in
the affidavits or at least recorded the statement of the appellant/accused No.1. The document at
Exhibit D1 which is the complaint filed by Smt. Renuka Shashikant Appugol in Crime No.209 of
2010 and Exhibit D7 the complaint filed by Suresh Kallappa Kamble/Accused No.10 in Crime

conspired and created the letter dated 05th December, 2014 in the name of KPTCL Employees

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 accused No.1 with the complainant soon before the incident becoming

happened on 13th November 2014, where the complainant PW6-Mr.Vinod Karur, Mr. M.T.
Thakkalaki and Mr. Maruti S. Dodamani are involved in the incident. Learned Counsel would
submit that copy of report of Women Grievance Redressal Committee is inclusive of part of
documents marked as Exhibit P15, which the Court may consider. Further, he would submit that
accused No.1, through her letter to the very authority, stated that "as per statement of Sri Karur,
Assistant Executive Engineer (E1), during the enquiry, he has called from his mobile number
9448370242 to 9448370243 at 12:38 pm, and in the call statement submitted by them, the details of
calls between those numbers are not found. Hence, he visited the BSNL office, where he was told
that the call details are supplied in the prescribed format only (html). But, the call details is in the
excel sheet, must have been manipulated." Like this, many lacunae are identified. The above facts,
clearly show that complainant-T.B. Majjagi has submitted false documents and created the story to
misguide the Enquiry Committee. The accused No.1, further submitted

between PW6, accused No.1 and PW1 are not reflecting in the records. As such, the said report at

Exhibit P15 is not fair and the same is biased." T.B. Majjagi-PW1 in his cross-examination on 16th
January, 2020 has deposed that, "I have not given any complaint to my senior authorities stating
that accused No.1 was doing illegal works. It is true to suggest that myself and B.V. Sindhu were
working in the department together." On perusal of these admissions, it appears that there was no
animosity between the complainant and accused No.1, either in connection with the service or
otherwise prior to incident dated 13th November 2014. As such, there should not be any motive for
accused No.1 to make false allegations against the complainant unnecessarily.
30. Further, learned counsel would submit that the evidence of PW1 shows that he has deposed that,
"it is true to suggest that in spite of complaint by B.V. Sindhu, I was promoted as Superintending
Engineer, I was given timely

high-handedness of PW1 in the Department. The WhatsApp messages exchanged between accused
No.1 and Mr. Shivaram Revankar (who subsequently married each other), disclose that on 13th
November 2014, PW1 narrated the happenings and circumstances prior to entering the premises
wherein the complainant-PW1 called her through PW6 and the further incident of sexual
harassment as per the subject matter of Crime No.286 of 2014. This goes to show that the statement
made in the contents of Crime No.286 of 2014 are true and that PW1 asked PW6 to call accused No.1
on 13th November, 2014 at about 1.00 pm to go to Stores, where M.T. Thakkalaki and Maruti S.
Dodamani directed accused No.1 to go to Engineers Association Building and when the accused No.1
went there, the complainant-PW1 asked her to switch off her mobile phone and outraged her
modesty and committed sexual harassment on her. It also contains the statement given by the
accused No.13-Drakshayini M. Nesargi before the Enquiry Committee that she met accused No.1
near the Stores and enquired her as to where she was going at that time? A perusal of Exhibit D12
and D6, reveals that the complainant was booked by Malmaruti

themselves speak about the publications of stories of complainant-PW1 with regard to his act of
sexual harassment. In this case also 'B' report came to be submitted by Police. Exhibit D7 speaks
that PW1 was booked by Malmaruti Police Station in Crime No.193 of 2010 upon the complaint
lodged by accused No.10 for offences punishable and Section 323, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code
and offences under Section 3(i)(x) of SC/ST (POA) Act, 1989. In the said case also, 'B' report came to

harassment. Further, these documents also show high- handedness of complainant-PW1 in getting
all the cases closed by getting filed 'B' reports, even in his own complaint filed before the said Police
Station in Crime No.214 of 2011. The Police, surprisingly, filed 'B' report in the case and counter case
where the incident is admitted by both the parties. The three cases filed by accused No.1 in Crime
No.286 of 2014, 19 of 2015 and 26 of 2015, also ended up in filing 'B' reports in the same line as in
earlier incidents, though there were serious allegations of sexual harassment against the
complainant-PW1. Moreover, the documents produced by the prosecution and defence themselves
goes to show that the antecedents of complainant are always involved with criminal cases, sexual
harassment, and corruption. Learned Counsel would submit that neither the Revision Court nor the
trial Court have held any enquiry against accused No.1 for initiating action against her for the
offences punishable under Sections 195 & 211 of IPC or any similar offences of the said Chapter of
Indian Penal Code for fabricating false evidence and for filing false complaints to procure the
conviction of PW1, when such

that case took no action for proceeding against accused No.1 for the offences punishable under

32. The learned Counsel would submit that absolutely no material elements are made out by the
prosecution for filing false complaints against the complainant by accused No.1. Further, the
intention of accused No.1 for filing such affidavits before the Court is also not established by the
Court. Neither of the Investigating Officers of three cases wherein 'B' reports have been filed, have
taken any steps to proceed against accused No.1 for filing of false cases. The said documents never
took the characteristic of affidavit within the meaning of Karnataka Criminal Rules of Practice. The
complainant wanted to book accused 2 to 13 for his vengeance act and for the reasons best known to
him and to make the accused No.1 a scapegoat, so also, to take revenge against her since he was
remanded to judicial custody in Crime No.26 of 2015 for the offences punishable under Sections
306, 511 and 109 of Indian Penal Code, and also for being suspended from service. The statement of

report in the said case. Hence, he submits that looking at any angle, it is not appearing or
established that accused No.1 has fabricated false evidence, forged documents and filed false cases
against the complainant-T.B. Majjagi to procure his conviction that too conspiring with other
accused. Absolutely, there are no evidences to hold accused No.1 guilty of charges under Section 195,
211, 420, 468, 471 and 120B of Indian Penal Code. Accused No.1 has never created any documents
by way of forgery or used the same either otherwise or as genuine. No offence is made out against
accused No.1 under Section 420 of Indian Penal Code and sought to acquit accused No.1 of alleged
offences.

before JMFC-II Court, Belagavi in Crime No.286 of 2014 based on true facts. Learned Magistrate
has also recorded the statement of accused No.1, under Section 164 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

further submit that the trial Court has imposed the sentence of imprisonment for only three years

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 filed the Revision Petition under Sections 397 read with Section 401 of
Code of Criminal Procedure challenging the impugned judgment of conviction and order on
sentence. Learned Counsel would submit that the punishment imposed by the trial Court on
respondents 2 to 13 for offence punishable under Section 195 Indian Penal Code is very meager. He
submits that the prescribed punishment under Section 195 of Indian Penal Code is imprisonment
for life, but the trial Court has imposed imprisonment for a period of three years, six months with
fine, which is against the procedure and settled legal principle. As the trial Court considered the
evidence adduced by the prosecution, and in view of the gravity of offence, the trial Court ought to
have given maximum punishment to respondents 2 to 13 and hence he seeks interference of this
Court. He further submits that for the offence punishable under Section, 211 read with 149 of IPC is
concerned, the trial Court has sentenced respondents 2 to 13 to pay a fine of Rs.6,000/- each and in
default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for one month, whereas the
punishment prescribed under said Section as applicable in Para II is punishable with imprisonment
for seven years and with fine,

for one month and the same is liable to be interfered with by this Court. As regards punishment
under Section 420 of Indian Penal Code is concerned, the learned counsel submits that the
punishment under said Section is imprisonment for seven years with fine, but the trial Court has
convicted the accused to undergo simple imprisonment for three years six months and to pay a fine
of Rs.20,000/- each, which is very meagre and hence the punishment imposed by the trial Court
under this Section is also liable to be interfered with by this Court. As regards, punishment under
Section 467 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code is concerned, the statute prescribes punishment that
may extend up to ten years, whereas the trial Court has taken too lenient view and imposed
imprisonment of three years six months with fine of Rs.6,000/- each, which also is against the
principles of sentencing rules and quantum of punishment against the statute. With respect to
punishment under Section 468 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code is concerned, the trial
Court has imposed a punishment of two years six

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 months with fine of Rs.10,000/- each as against punishment, which may
extend to 7 years with fine and hence the learned Counsel seeks enhancement of punishment under
the said Section also. With respect to imposing punishment of criminal conspiracy under Section
120B of Indian Penal Code is concerned, the learned Counsel submits that the statute prescribe
rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards where no express provision is made in
this Code for the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if the
accused had abetted such offence. Further in Para II, the punishment prescribed is for a term
exceeding six months or fine or both. But the trial Court has imposed payment of fine of Rs.4,000/-,
which is far below the punishment prescribed under the statute. Hence, learned Counsel sought for
enhancement of punishment as prescribed under statute.
38. The learned Counsel submit that the trial Court has considered the evidence and gone through
the documents produced by the prosecution, which shows that the complainant who was a
senior-most officer, has worked with great integrity and served the organisation for more than 34
years. He has

organisations. As the complainant was strict and very punctual in his duties, respondent 2 to 13, to
tarnish his image, committed the above offences which have been proved by the prosecution. Hence,
he submits that the trial Court erred in not sentencing the accused in deserving manner as
prescribed under the statute.

Drakshayani D/O. Mahadev Nesargi vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 June, 2025
39. It is the further submission of the learned Counsel that several false cases are being filed against
the complainant by respondents 2 to 13 in different Courts including High Court and the Supreme
Court. The respondent No.2/accused No.1 has gone to the extent of filing several cases and further
she has admitted herself in her affidavits that the allegations made are false. That itself shows the
quantum of mental agony and the hardship given by the accused to the complainant. Hence, he
prays for imposing punishment to respondents 2 to 13 for commission of abovesaid offences as
prescribed under the Statute. On all these grounds, he prays for allowing the revision petition by
enhancing the punishment.

40. Having heard the arguments on both sides and perusal of materials placed before us, the
following points would arise for our consideration:
1. Whether the impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by
the trial Court suffers from legal infirmities requiring this Court to intercede?
2. Whether the State has made out a ground for enhancement of sentence passed
against accused 2 to 14?
3. Whether the revision petitioner/complainant has made out a ground for
enhancement of punishment in respect of respondents 2 to 14?
4. What order?
41. Our answer to the above points would be as under:
Point No.1: in the affirmative Points 2 & 3: in the negative Point No.4: as per final

that the First Information Report was false. The present Investigating Officer who has filed the

also, after investigation, the Investigating Officer has submitted 'B' final report under Section 173 of

accused. In the said judgment, at paragraphs 7 & 8 of the judgment, it is observed thus:
"7. At the outset, we may point out that on the aforesaid facts no offence linked with
Section 306 IPC can be found against any of the appellants. The said section 306
penalises abetment of suicide. It is worded thus: "If any person commits suicide,
whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment
of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable
to fine." It is a unique legal phenomenon in the Indian Penal Code that the only act,
the attempt of which alone will become an offence. The person who attempts to
commit suicide is guilty of the offence under Section 309 IPC whereas the person
who committed suicide cannot be reached at all. Section 306 renders the person who
abets the commission of suicide punishable for which the condition precedent is that
suicide should necessarily have been committed. It is possible to abet the commission
of suicide. But nobody would abet a mere attempt to commit suicide. It would be
preposterous if law could afford to penalise an abetment to the offence of mere
attempt to commit suicide.

8. Learned Sessions Judge went wrong in convicting the appellants under Section 116
linked with Section 306, IPC. The former is "abetment of offence punishable with
imprisonment -- if offence be not committed". But the crux of the offence under
Section 306 itself is abetment. In other words, if there is no abetment there is no
question of the offence under Section 306 coming into play. It is inconceivable to
have abetment of an abetment. Hence there cannot be an offence under Section 116
read with Section 306 IPC. Therefore, the High Court was correct in altering the
conviction from the penalising provisions fastened with the appellants by the
Sessions Court."
81. On the basis of this judgment, the learned Principal and Sessions Judge, Belagavi has granted
bail in Criminal Miscellaneous No.177 of 2015 dated 11th February, 2015. On perusal of material
placed before us, it is evident that the complainant-B.V. Sindhu had survived and therefore, the
offence under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code has not been completed. Since the offence has not
been completed, there cannot be any abetment to commit suicide. The observation of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of SATVIR SINGH is aptly applicable to the case inasmuch as offences
registered are under Sections 306, 511 and 109 of Indian Penal Code. After the Investigating Officer
has submitted 'B' final report, the

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 complaint was filed by the complainant with mistaken facts. When
accused B.V. Sindhu had lodged complaint against this accused, it is the duty of the concerned police
to verify whether the offence under Sections 306, 511 and 109 are applicable to the case on hand as
required under Section 157 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Unfortunately, without application
of mind, concerned Police Officer has registered the case against PW1 for commission of offence
punishable under Sections 306, 511 and 109 of Indian Penal Code and also arrested the accused.
Thereafter, he submitted 'B' final report contending that the offence under Sections 306, 511 and
109 are not maintainable in view of the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court. The conduct of Investigating
Officer reveals that due to inadvertence and ignorance of proper provisions of law, the Investigating
Officer has registered case against PW1 and the accused No.1-B.V. Sindhu is not responsible for
registration of case against PW1. Under the given set of circumstances, we are of the considered view
that all the accused are not responsible for registration of case in Crime No.26 of 2015, which ended
in filing of 'B' final report. In this regard, PW1 would have taken necessary legal steps against the

82. On careful scrutiny of entire material on record, it is crystal clear that, on the basis of the three
'B' final reports pertaining to Crime Nos.286 of 2014, 19 of 2015 and 26 of 2015 which are accepted
by the learned Magistrate, the finding given by the Women's Grievance Redressal Committee
Exhibit P15 and the affidavits Exhibits P11 & P12 filed by the accused No.1 before the XI Additional
District & Sessions Judge in Criminal Revision Petitions No.54 and 55 of 2016, the charges are
framed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 120B, 195, 211, 420, 467, 468,
471 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code. Mere acceptance of 'B' Final reports, will not
constitute the offence under Section 192 and 211 of Indian Penal Code unless the Investigating
Officer or the concerned accused have proceeded against the complainant who has filed false
complaint by taking necessary legal steps as required under Sections 195 read with Section 340 of
Code of Criminal Procedure in the same proceedings. The offences under Sections 192 and 211 are

is said to have committed in, or in relation to, any proceedings in any Court or any lawful authority
of public servants, then the concerned authority would have taken necessary legal action against the
concerned complainant who has filed false complaint/affidavit, etc. under Section 195 read with
Section 340 of Code of Criminal Procedure as the offences affect the administration of justice. The
concerned Courts have no jurisdiction to take cognizance for the offence under Sections 172 to 188,

without the complaint being filed before the Court. In the case on hand, Investigating Officer has
filed charge sheet. On the basis of the police report, the Court has taken cognizance, which is not
sustainable under law.
89. Now, the question that arise for our consideration is whether affidavits Exhibits P11 & P12 filed
by accused No.1 before the District Court in criminal revision petitions No.54 and 55 of 2016 are
sufficient to convict the accused for the alleged commission of offences against all the accused? In
this regard, we have gone through the contents of affidavit-Exhibits P11 & P12. The defence set up by
accused No.1 that Exhibits P11 & 12 are filed under inducement and threat and the same have not
been filed on own volition. Exhibits P11 & P12 filed before the XI Additional Principal District &
Sessions Judge, Belagavi in Criminal Revision Petitions No.54 and 55 of 2016, do not contain the
cause-title. These affidavits are commencing as "Affidavit". In both Exhibits P11 and P12, the

matter in which it is sought to be used as required under Chapter XVI of Karnataka Criminal Rules
of Practice, 1968. The same is not complied with. Exhibits P11 & P12 reveal that both affidavits are
made by deponent on 10th May 2016 before the Notary. The Notary has not mentioned the
registration number of these affidavits as required under Rule 11(2) of Notaries Rules, 1956.
Notarial Register maintained by the Notary in From-XV of the Notaries Rules, 1956 also not
produced by the prosecution. Before receiving these affidavits on record, the learned District Judge
has not enquired as to why her advocate has not filed advance application? why her advocate has
filed these types of affidavits without setting forth the cause title? The accused No.1 has filed Board
application on 11th May 2016 by serving copy to the respondent Counsel. The same is endorsed on

posted to 13th May, 2016. On the basis of the board application filed by accused No.1 without the
signature of the advocate, the learned District Judge had advanced the case from 13th May to 11th
May, 2016. The Advocate for respondent No.1 also put his signature on the order sheet pertaining to
Criminal Revision Petitions No.54 and 55 of 2016. On the basis of this affidavit, the Principal
District and Sessions Judge, has permitted the petitioner to withdraw Criminal Revision Petitions.
91. It is to be observed that for withdrawal of criminal revision petitions filed by accused No.1, the
affidavits were not required. However, the revision petitioner/accused No.1 has filed affidavits as
per Exhibits P11 & P12. The copies of the affidavits also served to the other side on the same day i.e.
on 11th May, 2016. The respondent/complainant PW1, has not taken legal action before the

suspended due to false allegations. My husband- Mr. Shivaram Revankar was
working in Vaibhav Nagar Section at Belagavi at that time. During May 2016, I was
pregnant and suffering due to sever hot in Gulbarga. At that time, the complainant-
Mr. Majjigi and his men asked me to withdraw the said Rev. Petition and promised
me of getting revoke the suspension of my husband and also arrange to transfer me
from Gulbarga to the place nearby my native. The said affidavits are prepared on the
instance of Mr. Majjigi and I was made to present those affidavits in the revision

court personally without representation of my advocate that too taking the case on
board in advance without any reason. I never intended to submit such affidavits
before the revision court willingly. The advocate who identified me in the said
affidavits was also not known to me and I never acquainted with him.
5] I have never submitted the falsehood before the courts of law and never intended
to foist the false cases against Mr. Majjigi and never stated the falsehood as evidence
in the courts against him. I have not committed any acts of cheating, forgery etc. I
have never colluded with the other accused and at no point of time made any
conspiracy against Mr. Majjigi. In the present case, the police never made my enquiry
regarding the documents produced by the complainant.

of 2016 by accused No.1, after lapse of nine months one day, the complainant PW1 has lodged
complaint as per Exhibit P1. This delay in filing the complaint will create reasonable doubt as to
whether accused No.1 has voluntarily filed said affidavits- Exhibits P11 & P12 or not and only at the
instance of PW1, she might have filed the affidavits which are not at all required to withdraw the
revision petitions. Just a memo was sufficient to withdraw revision petitions. Instead of that the
accused No.1 has filed detailed affidavits, which was unnecessary. Exhibits P11 & P12 was filed on
10th May 2016, before the XI Additional District and Sessions Judge.
96. Further, copy of the order dated 30th June, 2016, whereby General Manager, HESCOM
suspending Shivaram Revankar, Junior Engineer working in HESCOM Belagavi is also produced.
The said Shivaram Revankar is the husband of accused No.1. He was suspended due to dereliction of
duty. It is also not in dispute that by that time accused No.1 was pregnant and suffering due to

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 stated in the application filed under Section 233(2) of Code of Criminal

Petitions with a promise of getting revocation of suspension of her husband- Shivaram Revankar, as
also, she be transferred from Kalaburagi to a place nearer to her native place. The copy of the order
dated 02nd February, 2017 passed by Assistant Executive Engineer, Bailhongal, reveals that,
Shivaram Revankar has been reinstated to his post and he has reported to duty. The copy of
discharge summary produced by accused No.1 issued by Kamakshi Hospital at Kalaburagi dated 3rd
October, 2016, reveals that accused No.1 was suffering from history of nine months amenorrhea.
These documents and contents of the application filed under Section 233(2) of Code of Criminal
Procedure reveal the possibilities of complainant-PW1 influencing accused No.1 as to revocation of
suspension of her husband and she getting transferred from Kalaburagi to a place nearby to her
native place and under such circumstances she might have filed affidavits Exhibits P11 and P12,
though there is no need to file any affidavit to withdraw a criminal revision petition.

102. For the aforesaid reasons, it appears that, the said affidavits Exhibits P11 and P12 are filed by
accused No.1 under inducement and promise made by the PW1 and the same is not admissible
under Section 24 of Indian Evidence Act. The conduct of parties, mode of filing advance application
before the XI Additional District and Sessions Judge Court without identification by concerned
advocate and the affidavits filed without setting forth the cause-title, the statement of objections
filed by accused No.1 against 'B' final reports by the concerned Investigating officer and revocation
of suspension of Shivaram Revankar husband of accused No.1 and the transfer of accused No.1 from
Gulbarga to a place nearer to her native place, delay in filing the complaint by PW1, that too only
after filing of the affidavits by the accused No.1 before the revision Court as per Exhibits P11 and P12
after lapse of nine months one day, will create reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of accused
No.1 in filing affidavits, Exhibits P11 & P12. No prudent person will file these types of affidavits
which are not required to withdraw the revision petitions. Accused No.1, being an educated lady,
being fed up with the suspension of her husband and so also of her transfer to Gulbarga and with
regard to filing of 'B' reports

more than nine months one day after disposal of criminal revision petitions, PW1 has lodged
complaint without explaining the delay in filing the complaint.
103. After filing these affidavits before the Revision Court, the learned Sessions Judge has not
applied his judicious mind in examining the contents/averments of affidavit. Without application of
mind, on the basis of affidavits, the Revisional Court has permitted the accused No.1 to withdraw
criminal revision petitions. When the accused No.1 has not been represented by her Counsel, at least
the Revisional Court could have explained the consequences of filing these types of affidavits and
could have insisted the Revision Petitioner to keep the presence of counsel to ascertain that
averments made in the affidavits is on own volition or under inducement/threat/duress.
Additionally, Exhibits P11 and P12 are not identified by the advocate who has appeared on behalf of
revision petitioner.

hand, the Investigating officer has not investigated the matter in detail. Neither PW1, nor the

submitted by the Investigating officer reveals that he has not arrested accused No.1. He has not even
issued notice as required under Section 41(A) of Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 to interrogate the
accused No.1. Why the Investigating officer has not arrested accused No.1 for interrogation and why
the investigating officer has not examined advocate who identified the deponent, who affixed her
signature on Exhibits P11 and P12, why the investigating officer has not examined the notary who
has given oath to the accused No.1, under which circumstance the accused No.1 has filed these

112. The prosecution has relied upon Exhibit P28, which, according to PW1, was issued by one
Lakshmipathi. The said Lakshmipathi has been examined as PW33. However, a perusal of his
deposition reveals that he has not deposed anything regarding the issuance of Exhibit P28. Instead,
he has referred to Exhibit P64 in his evidence. Notably, both Exhibits P28 and P64 refer to the same
document. Furthermore, Exhibit P80 contains the list of Central Executive Committee (CEC)
Members of the KPTCL Employees Union for the term 2014- 2017. At Sl.Nos.17 to 24, individuals
such as Umeshappa K.S., Banakar G.H., Revanasiddappa Hagaragi, Prabhakar A.M., Y.M. Nittur,

number 44, the name of Nataji Patil appears as the Organising Secretary of the Belagavi Circle.
During cross-examination, PW1 has categorically admitted that, under the by-laws of the
Association, each company is required to have a President and that the President is vested with the
authority to appoint Vice Presidents.
113. DW1-M. Nagaraju, who served as the Executive President of the KPTCL Employees Union
between 2011-2016, has clearly deposed that Accused No.2 held the post of Vice President since
2014. His oral testimony and the contents of Exhibit D32 directly contradict the documents relied
upon by the prosecution, namely Exhibits P14 and P28. Further, PW13 Lakshmipathi, who served as
the General Secretary, has admitted that the President was empowered to appoint Vice Presidents.
In line with this authority, DW1 has issued the official memorandum marked as Exhibit P32. The
prosecution has not produced any credible material to discredit either the contents of Exhibit P32 or
the evidence of DW1. In light of the documentary evidence demonstrating that Accused No.2 was
indeed the Vice President of the KPTCL Employees Union at the

114. Even assuming for the sake of argument that Accused No.2 was not the Vice President at the
relevant time, PW1 has admitted in his evidence that Accused No.2 held the position of Organising
Secretary. It is well established that even an Organising Secretary is competent to make
representations on behalf of any member or employee of the Association. There exists no bar
preventing such a person from initiating a representation, particularly in defense of another
member allegedly subjected to departmental injustice. Moreover, PW1 has admitted that despite the
complaint by Accused No.1-B.V. Sindhu, he was promoted to the post of Superintending Engineer,
received timely increments, and continues to draw pensionary benefits. His arrears were also
cleared. PW1 further admitted that Accused No.1 did not instruct him to take action on the basis of
Exhibit P9 and that Exhibits P14 and P19 do not mention the names of all the accused. He
categorically stated that Accused No.1 did not instruct the preparation of those documents, nor did
she identify Accused 2 to 13 in her complaints. According to testimony of PW1, he only suspected

Accused No.1. He also conceded that Accused 2 to 13 were stationed in different locations and that
the names of Accused Nos.5 and 10 are absent in Exhibit P14, while Accused No.6 was not a
signatory to Exhibits P14 or P19. Similarly, the name of accused No.8 name does not appear in the
photocopy of Exhibit P9. Despite the lack of substantive evidence, the prosecution moved an
application to implead these persons as accused, which lacks legal justification.
115. A close examination of the materials on record clearly reveals that the charges framed against
the accused under Sections 120B, 195, 211, 420, 467, 468, and 471 read with Section 149 of the IPC
were primarily based on three 'B' Final Reports in Crime Nos. 286 of 2014, 19 of 2015, and 26 of
2015, which were accepted by the learned Magistrate. The prosecution has also relied on Exhibit
P15, the report of the Women Grievance Redressal Committee, and affidavits marked as Exhibits P11
and P12, filed by Accused No.1 before the XI Additional District and Sessions Judge in Criminal
Revision Petitions No.54 and 55 of 2016. However, these documents do

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 not independently establish the conspiracy alleged against Accused 2 to

116. Given that accused 2 to 13 were employees of KPTCL posted in different locations, it was
incumbent upon the prosecution to establish how all these individuals came together, at a specific
time, place and date, to hatch a conspiracy against PW1 and others. The prosecution has failed to
provide any material explanation or evidence in this regard. After a thorough and critical evaluation
of the evidence on record, there is a glaring absence of cogent, consistent, and legally admissible

evidence to substantiate the charges under Sections 195, 211, 420, 467, 468, and 120B of the IPC.
The Trial Court has not evaluated the evidence in its proper legal context and has committed a grave
error in its appreciation of the material facts and law applicable to the case.
117. The learned counsel for the accused has further substantiated his defense by producing
documents that cast serious doubt on the credibility of PW1. It has been demonstrated that PW1 was
not only a dominant official but also held the post of President of the KPTCL Employees Union.

brought on record that other employees, namely Smt. Sudha and Smt. Renuka Shashikant Appugol,
had also filed complaints against PW1 alleging sexual and mental harassment. Crime No.209/2010
was registered under Sections 506 and 509 IPC in this regard, which ended in a 'B' report. The
defense has also produced Exhibits D1 to D36, including Exhibit D7-complaint filed by Suresh
Kallappa Kamble against PW1, resulting in registration of Crime No.193/2010 under Section 3(1) of
the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Though a 'B' report was filed (Exhibit P8), the
complainant protested the same and submitted a sworn statement (Exhibit D9). Supporting
documents such as wound certificates, mahazars, witness statements, and the order sheet in Crime
No.193 of 2010 (Exhibit D10) show that PW1 had obtained anticipatory bail from the III Additional
District & Sessions Judge, Belagavi. The order in Summary Case No.7 of 2011 directed registration
of First Information Report against PW1 for offences under Sections 323, 504, and 506 IPC and
Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST (PoA) Act. Additionally, Exhibits D12, D13, and D15 are media

CRL.RP NO.100305 2024 misappropriated Rs.66.00 lakh from HESCOM, Belagavi. While we do
not render any findings on these allegations at this stage, they bear relevance to the question of the
credibility and motive of PW1.
118. In view of the foregoing discussion and analysis of the evidence, this Court finds that the
prosecution has miserably failed to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The
evidence adduced is neither consistent nor sufficient to support a finding of criminal conspiracy or
forgery, as alleged. Hence, we answer Point No.1 in the affirmative, holding that the accused are
entitled to be acquitted of all charges leveled against them.
Regarding Points 2 & 3:

119. While answering Point No.1 above, as we have held that the prosecution has failed to prove guilt
of the accused for the alleged commission of offences, the question of enhancing the sentence as
sought for by the State as well as by the Revision Petitioner who is complainant-PW1, does not arise.
Hence, we answer Points 2 and 3 in the negative.
