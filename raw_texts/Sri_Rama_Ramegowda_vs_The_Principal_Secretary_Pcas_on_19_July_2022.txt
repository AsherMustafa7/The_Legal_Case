Sri.Rama @ Ramegowda vs The Principal Secretary (Pcas) on 19 July, 2022
3. Facts in brief are as follows:
The petitioner is convicted for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC
and Sections 3(2)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act, 1989 ('SC/ST Act' for short) by the learned Additional Sessions and
Special Judge, Mandya in Spl. Case No.63/2002 by order dated 22-01-2005 to
undergo life imprisonment. Further appeals filed were dismissed by this Court and
the same was affirmed by the Apex Court as well.
Therefore, since 22-01-2005 the petitioner has been in prison.
4. A representation was submitted by the petitioner on 28-01-2022 seeking his premature release
owing to his behavior, conduct and performance in the prison. This is rejected by the respondent
No.4 on 28-01-2022 which leads the petitioner to this Court in the subject petition.
5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would contend that in terms of Section 433(b) of
the Cr.P.C. the State Government is to consider the circumstances in which the convict can be
released from prison prior to completion of the sentence and would place reliance upon several
judgments of the Apex Court.
6. On the other hand, the learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for the respondents
would contend that there is no warrant for such reconsideration, as it has already been considered
and rejected in the light of the offence being under Section 302 of the IPC r/w Section 3(2)(v) of the
SC/ST Act.
7. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
parties and perused the material on record.
8. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The petitioner is in custody for the last 17 years and 9
months is also not in dispute. Section 433(b) of the Cr.P.C. reads as follows:
"433. Power to commute sentence.-The appropriate Government may, without the
consent of the person sentenced, commute-
(a) ... ... ...
(b) a sentence of imprisonment for life, for imprisonment for a term not exceeding
fourteen years or for fine;
Premature release of convicts depending on their behavior is also accepted preposition which is
considered by the Co-ordinate Benches of this Court. The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in
W.P.201567/2021 disposed on 12.11.2021 has held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13857620/ 3
Sri.Rama @ Ramegowda vs The Principal Secretary (Pcas) on 19 July, 2022
"2. This petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India read
with Section 482 of Cr.P.C., praying this Court to issue a writ of mandamus directing
the respondents to consider the case of premature release of life convict as per
G.O.No.HD.119 PRA 2018 dated 21.04.2020 vide Annexure-C and release the
petitioner, who is currently in Belagavi Prison as CTP No.3929.
3. The petitioner is the convict. The learned counsel for the petitioner brought to the
notice of this Court that an application was given on 12.01.2021 and the same is
acknowledged by the Jailer on 12.01.2021, but till date, they have not taken any
decision on the application considering his request in terms of proceedings of the
Government of Karnataka, which is produced as Annexure-C to the writ petition.
4. The learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for the respondent-State
has filed objections contending that the file of the said prisoner is not eligible to be
placed before the Standing Advisory Board Committee for premature release as per
the direction of the Government of Karnataka vide Annexure-C.
5. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the learned High Court
Government Pleader appearing for the respondent-State and perused the contents of
the petition and the statement of objections filed by the respondents. When an
application was filed on 12.01.2021, the respondents ought to have taken a decision
on the said application. Till date, admittedly, no decision is taken. No doubt, the
statement of objections is filed before this Court, but when the application is filed, the
respondents have to take a decision on the application.
Hence, the respondents are directed to consider the application, which is produced as
Annexure-B to the petition within two months from the date of receipt of copy of this
order.
6. With the above observation, the petition is disposed of."
Yet another Co-ordinate Bench in W.P.No.205715/2019 disposed on 06.11.2020 has held as follows:
"5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner who is arrayed as
accused No.2 is in prison serving sentence since 16 years and he is entitled for
remission as provided under Section 432 of Cr.P.C. He further submitted that
accused Nos.1, 3 and 4 who are also convicted with life sentence are already released
from the prison, by granting remission by the State Government. Annexure - K was
issued by the Chief Superintendent of Central Prison, Kalaburagi to the petitioner
informing that he is not entitled for remission in view of the letter dated 07.06.2017,
issued by the under Secretary to the Government of Karnataka, Bengaluru, which is
produced at Annexure -M and the letter dated 24.06.2019 issued by the Additional
Director General of Police and Inspector General of Prisons, Bengaluru to the Chief
Superintendent Central Prison, Kalaburagi which is produced at Annexure -L,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13857620/ 4
Sri.Rama @ Ramegowda vs The Principal Secretary (Pcas) on 19 July, 2022
informing that the petitioner is not entitled for remission.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the other accused who are
similarly placed were considered for remission, but the prayer of the present
petitioner was rejected only on the ground that he had once escaped from the custody
during 2010, while he was being shifted from the central prison, Kalaburagi to the
Central Prison at Ballary. It is stated that on 06.07.2010, the petitioner had escaped
from the lawful custody, but he was apprehended on 09.07.2010. In this regard, FIR
was registered and the petitioner was tried for the same and he was convicted and
sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. Learned counsel further
submitted that the petitioner has already underwent such period, but in spite of that,
the respondents are not considering the prayer of the petitioner for remission.
7. It is submitted that the petitioner is entitled for remission when he is convicted to
undergo life imprisonment. It is ridiculous to say that the petitioner even though
entitled for remission as a life convict, his prayer is rejected only on the ground that
he has committed the offence, for which he has served sentence for six months and
for the said reason, he has to be in prison till the end of his life. He submits that it is
not the intention of the legislature while enacting Section 432 of Cr.P.C.
8. Learned counsel drew my attention to Annexure
- C, proceedings of the Government of Karnataka, wherein specific guidelines are
issued for extending the remission and premature release of life convicts which is
dated 21.07.2016. Specific guidelines are issued for extending remission and it
contains exceptions, where such remission should not be extended. Learned counsel
also drew my attention to the recommendation issued by the State and Central
Government, where the conduct of the petitioner in prison is certified as satisfactory.
Therefore, it is his contention that detention of the petitioner in prison, without
granting remission amounts to illegal detention and it is in violation of Articles 14
and 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner has already undergone 16 years of
sentence and now he is aged 50 years. All other accused who were similarly placed
are released from prison on remission. Therefore, he prays for allowing the petition
by issuing necessary direction in the interest of justice. Learned counsel for the
petitioner contended that there must be fair play in administration of all citizens
placed alike or to be treated alike. Hence, he prays for allowing the petition.
9. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader opposing the petition
submitted that the proposed guidelines as per Annexure - M is issued by the
Secretary to the Government and in view of the same, the petitioner is not entitled for
remission. He submits that the conduct of the petitioner in escaping from the lawful
custody and serving sentence once again, disentitles him from seeking remission.
Hence, he prays for dismissal of the petition.

Sri.Rama @ Ramegowda vs The Principal Secretary (Pcas) on 19 July, 2022
10. Perused the materials on record in the light of the rival submissions. Admittedly,
the petitioner was convicted in SC Nos.213/2004 and 49/2006 by the learned
Principal Sessions Judge, Kalaburagi vide judgment of conviction and order of
sentence dated 07.2.2006, and sentenced him to undergo life imprisonment. Similar
conviction and sentence is also imposed on accused Nos.1, 3 and 4 who were already
released from prison on remission. The guidelines issued by the Government of
Karnataka for remission and premature release of life convicts is as per Annexure - C,
which also contains exceptions to the guidelines. There are as many as 8 categories of
prisoners to whom the said guidelines is not applicable. The respondents are relying
on Annexure - M which is the letter addressed by the under Secretary to the
Government of Karnataka to the Inspector General of Prisons, informing that a
proposal is forwarded to the Government to exclude the prisoners who escaped from
the custody should not be released on parole bail during preceding five years. As
rightly contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, Annexure - M discloses
that it is only a proposal to include these two exceptions in the general guidelines
issued which is as per Annexure - C. Admittedly, these two additional grounds are not
yet been part of the guidelines approved and issued by the Government of Karnataka.
11. It is not in dispute that the present petitioner had escaped from custody while he
was being shifted from Central Prison, Kalaburagi to Ballary. It is also not in dispute
that the petitioner was convicted and sentenced to undergo six months imprisonment
for the said offence. Admittedly, the petitioner is in prison, since 16 years and he is
serving sentence and is aged about 50 years. When the co-accused have been released
on remission, there is absolutely, no reason to refuse such benefit to the petitioner.
Therefore, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case to allow the petition by directing the
State Government to consider the request made by the petitioner sympathetically in
the light of the direction for extending remission which is as per Annexure- C. With
this observation."
9. The learned counsel for the petitioner has further placed reliance upon the judgment in the case
of SATPAL VS.
STATE OF HARYANA1 wherein the Apex Court considering the case of identically placed convict
who had been convicted for life and considering the purport of Section 433(b) of Cr.P.C. has held as
follows:
"2. The petitioner was arrested on March 27, 1978 in a case registered under Section
302 Penal Code, 1860. He was convicted on August 16, 1978 and was sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life. According to the petitioner he has undergone about
13 years and six months' actual imprisonment and total period of imprisonment
including remissions comes to more than 17 years. Admittedly his sentence has not
been remitted fully nor commuted for imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14
years either under Section 55 Penal Code, 1860 or under Section 433(b) Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 by the appropriate government. However, the petitioner's
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13857620/ 6
Sri.Rama @ Ramegowda vs The Principal Secretary (Pcas) on 19 July, 2022
case is that he has undergone more than 14 years' sentence including remissions and
since the said sentence was got executed in jail custody in the form of rigorous
imprisonment, the government must be deemed to have commuted his sentence to 14
years either under Section 55 Penal Code, 1860 or Section 433(b) Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 notwithstanding that no formal order in that behalf was made by the
State Government and as such his continued detention in jail is illegal and he is
entitled to be released forthwith. The argument has been advanced by Mr Balwant
Singh Malik, the learned counsel for the petitioner on the following grounds:
(1992)4 SCC 172
- 10 -
(I) 'Imprisonment for life' as one of the punishments was substituted for
'transportation for life' in Section 53 of the Penal Code, 1860 by Amending Act 26 of
1955. No corresponding amendment has been made in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 and there is no provision under the Code for the execution of the
sentence of 'imprisonment for life'. In the absence of any provision for executing the
sentence of 'imprisonment for life' in the Code of Civil Procedure the detention of life
convicts in prison is unlawful and illegal and as such the government, in order to
legalise detention, has necessarily to commute life sentence under Section 55 Penal
Code, 1860 or Section 433(b) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to one of rigorous
imprisonment, which under the said provisions cannot legally exceed a term of 14
years. The petitioner having completed 14 years, he is entitled to be released.
(II) The sentence of 'life imprisonment' has not been defined either under the Penal
Code, 1860 or under any other law. It is no where provided that a life convict has to
undergo rigorous imprisonment. The Government by causing the life convicts to be
dealt with as a prisoner sentenced to rigorous imprisonment must be deemed to have
commuted sentence of imprisonment for life to a sentence of rigorous imprisonment
under Section 55 Penal Code, 1860 or Section 433(b) Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 for a term not exceeding 14 years.
3. The arguments advanced by the learned counsel stand concluded against him by the judgment of
this Court in Naib Singh v. State of Punjab [(1983) 2 SCC 454 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 536] . In the said case
Naib Singh challenged his continued detention in jail on the following grounds: (SCC Headnote) "(1)
In regard to the sentence of life imprisonment the place where it has to be executed or carried out
has to be appointed under Section 32 of the Prisoners Act, 1900, and since the sentence of
'imprisonment for life' like the sentence of 'transportation of (sic for) life' could be executed only by
way of banishment or exile by the convict being 'removed to the place or places' required to be
appointed by the State Government under Section 32 of the Prisoners Act, the executing authorities
were obliged to 'execute' or 'carry out' the said sentence in jail indirectly by way of commuting it for
imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding 14 years under Section 55, IPC or
Section 433(b), CrPC, 1973. In other words in the absence of any proper authority of law warranting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13857620/ 7
Sri.Rama @ Ramegowda vs The Principal Secretary (Pcas) on 19 July, 2022
the detention and execution of the sentence of such life convict in jail, his detention in such
- 11 -
jail custody will have to be regarded as illegal and unlawful.
(2) Nature of sentence of life imprisonment is undefined and it is not necessarily rigorous; but
because the petitioner was made to undergo his sentence of life imprisonment in jail and that too in
rigorous manner for more than 14 years (inclusive of remissions) his sentence should be deemed to
have been commuted by the State Government either under Section 55, IPC or under Section
433(b), CrPC, 1973 without a formal order in that behalf and he be released forthwith."
This Court rejected both the contentions and dismissed the petition. V.D. Tulzapurkar, J. speaking
for the Court held as under: (SCC Headnote) "Under Section 32 of the Prisoners Act a sentence of
transportation either for a term or for life could be and a sentence of life imprisonment can be made
executable in local jails by constituting such jails as the 'places' within the meaning of Section 32
under orders of the State Governments. Apart from Section 32 of the Prisoners Act, Section 383 of
CrPC, 1898 and Section 418 of CrPC, 1973 also contain the necessary legal authority and power
under which a criminal court can by issuing a warrant direct the execution or carrying out of a
sentence of life imprisonment in local jails. Ever since the sentence of transportation either for a
term or for life became executable in jails within the country and the same position must obtain in
regard to persons sentenced to imprisonment for life on and after January 1, 1956 in view of Section
53-A, IPC inserted by the Amending Act 26 of 1955.
The nature of punishment required to be suffered under a sentence of 'imprisonment for life'
awardable on and after January 1, 1956 is rigorous imprisonment. Earlier the sentence of
transportation either for life or for a term meant rigorous imprisonment in the sense of exaction of
hard labour from the convict. Since under Section 53-A(2) transportation for a term has been
equated to rigorous imprisonment for the same term, by necessary implication the sentence of
'transportation for life', now substituted by 'imprisonment for life' by Section 53-A(1), which is
awardable for more serious, or more grave or more heinous crimes must mean rigorous
imprisonment for life, that is to say it cannot be anything but rigorous.
It is not necessary that while passing the sentence of imprisonment for life a criminal court should
keep in view the
- 12 -
provisions of Section 60, IPC and choose one or the other form so as to clarify the exact nature of
punishment intended to be inflicted on the accused. A distinction between 'imprisonment for life'
and 'imprisonment for a term' has been maintained in the Penal Code in several of its provisions.
Moreover, whenever an offender is punishable with 'imprisonment for life' he is not punishable with
'imprisonment which may be of either description' within the meaning of Section 60 and therefore,
that section would be inapplicable."

Sri.Rama @ Ramegowda vs The Principal Secretary (Pcas) on 19 July, 2022
4. It is not disputed by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the judgment in Naib Singh case
[(1983) 2 SCC 454 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 536] is a complete answer to his arguments but he has
vehemently argued that the said judgment needs reconsideration by a larger Bench. The learned
counsel also made an attempt to challenge the correctness of the Privy Council judgment in Kishori
Lal v. Emperor [AIR 1945 PC 64 : 46 Cri LJ 626 : 72 IA 1] and of this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse
v. State of Maharashtra [(1961) 3 SCR 440 :
AIR 1961 SC 600 : (1961) 1 Cri LJ 736] . Both these judgments have been relied upon
by this Court in Naib Singh case.
5. We have carefully read the judgment of this Court in Naib Singh case and have
given our thoughtful consideration to the points dealt with and decided therein. We
respectfully agree with the reasoning and the conclusions reached by this Court in the
said judgment. We see no justification whatsoever to refer the points decided in Naib
Singh Case to a larger Bench. We, therefore, dismiss the writ petition"
In the light of the orders passed by the Apex Court and that of Co-ordinate Benches
of this Court, the respondents-authorities will have to take into consideration the
conduct, behavior and performance of the petitioner while in prison for the last 17
years and 9 months. The endorsement dated 28-01-2022 impugned herein relies on a
circular dated 21-04-2020 which depicts certain offenders would not become entitled
to premature release.
- 13 -
10. In the teeth of the judgment rendered by the Apex Court and that of this Court, as
also, the purport of Section 433(b) of the Cr.P.C., the matter requires to be
reconsidered at the hands of the respondents. For the aforesaid reasons, the
following:
ORDER
(i) Writ Petition is allowed in part.
(ii) The impugned endorsement bearing
No.KekaMy/J1/407/2021-22 dated 28-01-2022 issued by respondent No.4 is hereby
quashed.
(iii) Respondent No.1 is directed to consider afresh the request made by the
petitioner to extend remission and to release him from prison, bearing in mind the
guidelines issued by the Government bearing No.HD 119 PRA 2018 dated
