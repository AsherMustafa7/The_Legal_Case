in S.A. No.251 of 1993) under Order 22 Rule 4 and 9 of the C.P.C., 1908 and Section 5
of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 praying for substitution of the LRs of the deceased
respondent No.1 (Maheswar Thatoi) in S.A. No.251 of 1993 after setting aside the

2. It has been stated by the petitioner in these three I.As, supported with separate affidavits for
condoning the delay that, the respondent No.1 in S.A. No.251 of 1993 i.e. Maheswar Thatoi expired
on 31.12.2007 leaving behind his LRs indicated in the petition vide I.A. No.612 of 2024, but, the
appellant could not take steps for substitution of his LRs in due time, only due to her innocence and
ignorance about the law being a rustic village old lady coupled with her sufferings from various
ailments due to her extreme old age being in the age of 75 years. In the month of June 2024, when
the second appeal vide S.A. No.251 of 1993 was listed, then, her counsel came to know for the first
time from the counsel for the respondent No.1 that, the respondent No.1 has expired in the
meanwhile and thereafter, his counsel contacted her (petitioner) and instructed her (petitioner) to
file the petition for substitution. Then, she (petitioner) filed these three I.As praying for substitution
of the LRs of the deceased respondent No.1 after setting aside the order of abatement and condoning
the delay stating that, the delay in filing the petition for substitution of the LRs of respondent No.1
by her (petitioner) is neither intentional nor deliberate, but, only due to the above bona fide reasons.
{{ 3 }} Accordingly, the notices were issued to the PLRs of the deceased respondent No.1 and after

receiving the said notices, the PLRs of the deceased respondent No.1 made their appearance in this
I.A. engaging their learned counsel.
3. At the time of hearing of these three I.As, only the LRs of the deceased respondent No.1 contested
through their learned counsel without filing any written objection and relied upon the decisions
reported in AIR 2013 SCW 6158: Esha Bhattacharjee Vrs. Managing Committee of Raghunathpur
Nafar Academy & Others and AIR 2012 SCW 1812: Office of the Chief Post Master General & Others
Vrs. Living Media India Ltd. & Another.
4. Accordingly, neither any of the Opposite Parties nor any of the PLRs of the respondent No.1 in
S.A. No.251 of 1993 filed any written objection against the I.As of the petitioner.
5. So, The contents of all the three I.As filed by the petitioner supported with separate affidavits have
not at all been controverted by the Opposite Parties including the LRs of the deceased respondent
No.1 in S.A. No.251 of 1993 through any written objection.
{{ 4 }}
6. As such, the contents in the I.As filed by the petitioner supported with affidavits separately in
each I.As remained uncontroverted.
The law concerning the uncontroverted affidavits have already been clarified by the Hon'ble Courts

filed this petition along with an affidavit, in order words, her petition is supported by annexing
affidavit, the counter filed by the Opposite Party is not supported by any affidavit. Rather, it has
been signed by the counsel for the Opposite Party only. From the aforesaid aspect, it is clear that,
there was no bonafide and meaningful assurance made by the Opposite Party. (Para 10)
(iv) 2017 (I) OLR 950: Dr. Kshitendra Narayan Mishra Vrs. State of Orissa & Others--In absence of
counter affidavit, averments made in the writ petition are to be taken into consideration, by

applying the doctrine of non-traverse.
{{ 5 }}
(v) 2017 (I) OLR 222: Pratap Kumar Jena Vrs. Government of Odisha & Others--Principle of non-
traverse--In the present case, since the opposite parties have not filed the counter affidavit to
controvert the contention raised in the writ application, the facts which have been pleaded by the
petitioner are deemed to be admitted--Any argument advanced by the learned counsel appearing for
the opposite parties cannot sustain in the absence of any pleadings thereof. (Vi) 2015(2) CCC 690
(M.P.):Madho Singh & Others Vrs. Ramkali & Others--When application supported by affidavit--No
justification in disbelieving same. (Para 6) (Vii) AIR 1964 S.C. 962: C.S. Rowjee Vrs. State of Andra

7. When, the averments made in the I.As filed by the petitioner about the cause and reason for
non-filing the petition for substitution in due time as indicated above remained
uncontroverted/unchallenged, then at this juncture, by applying the principles of law enunciated in
the ratio of the decisions referred to (supra), the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the
LRs of the deceased respondent No.1 relying upon the decisions of the Apex Court indicated above
in Para No.3 of this order in absence of {{ 6 }} any written objection from the side of the said PLRs
of deceased respondent No.1 cannot be acceptable under law.
8. It is the settled propositions of law that, "the rights of the parties are to be adjudicated/decided
upon the merits of controversies between them. Any party should not be thrown out merely on
technicalities. Even if, a party is negligent in defending a proceeding, still other party can be
compensated through costs. Because, Law Courts will lose their efficacy, if they cannot possibly
respond to the needs of the societies. Technicalities their might be many, but, the justice oriented
approach ought not to be thwarted on the basis of such technicality, since technicality cannot and
ought not to outweigh the course of justice. So, law courts should always be in favour of condoning
delay for giving opportunity to the parties to meet their case on merits instead of debarring them to
adjudicate their rights on technical grounds without condoning the delay. The object of C.P.C. is
really rules of natural justice. Its purpose is to enable both the parties to get hearing on merit
instead of dismissing the suit debarring the parties on any technical ground from testing their
rights".
{{ 7 }} The above propositions of law has already been clarified by the Hon'ble Courts and Apex
Court in the ratio of the following decisions:-
(i) IV (2005) C.L.T. 347 (Madras):Yanaimal Thottam Trust Vrs. B.Lakshmanan &
Another--Courts would always be in favour of substantial justice rather than
technicalities. (Para 5)

(iii) 2001 (8) SCC 151:M.S. Grewal & Another Vrs. Deep Chand Sood & Others--(Para 28)--Law
Courts will lose their efficacy, if they cannot possibly respond to the need of the society.
Technicalities their might be many, but, the justice oriented approach ought not to be thwarted on
the basis of such technicality, since the technicality cannot and ought not to outweigh the course of
justice.

(non-traversed) by any of the Opposite Parties including the contesting PLRs of the deceased
respondent No.1 in S.A. No.251 of 1993, then at this juncture, by applying the principles of law
enunciated in the ratio of the aforesaid decisions {{ 8 }} of the Hon'ble Courts and Apex Court, it is
felt proper to condone the delay in filing the I.As by the petitioner for substitution of the LRs of the
deceased respondent No.1 in S.A. No.251 of 1993 subject to payment of cost only to the contesting
PLRs of the deceased respondent No.1 in S.A. No.251 of 1993 for no other reason, but, only in order
to avoid the multiplicity of litigations between the parties for the self-same matter. Because, if the
LRs of the deceased respondent No.1 shall not be allowed to be substituted after condoning the
delay, then, the adjudication of civil rights of the petitioner (appellant in S.A. No.251 of 1993) shall
be curtailed forever.
For which, by adopting, liberal pragmatic, non-pedantic and justice oriented approach and for
removal of injustice taking the substantial justice as paramount consideration, it is felt proper to
allow the I.As filed by the petitioner with condition.

petitioner are allowed with condition.
