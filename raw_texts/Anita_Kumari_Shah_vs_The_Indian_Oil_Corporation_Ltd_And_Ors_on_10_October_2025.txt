(e) For issuance of a writ in the nature

f) For issuance of a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing of the fresh advertisement issued by
the respondent Patna High Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 Indian oil Corporation Ltd
(annexure 1 of the writ application) insofar as the location of Raepur Buzurg is concerned;"
4. The brief facts culled out of the writ petition is that the petitioner applied for an
LPG distributorship under the "Open(W)" category at Raepur Buzurg District
Samastipur, in response to an advertisement dated 17.06.2017 issued by the Indian
Oil Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter called as the IOCL).
5. It is submitted by the petitioner that pursuant to the aforesaid advertisement, a
draw of lots was conducted on 29.01.2018 for the advertised location, in which she
was declared successful.
6. It is submitted that as per the terms of the advertisement, the petitioner was
required to offer land for both the showroom/office and the godown for the purpose
of LPG distributorship. The petitioner offered her own land, over which she has title
and possession, for the godown. It is further submitted that for the purpose of the
Patna High Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 showroom, the petitioner
offered land that had been leased in favour of her husband through a registered lease
deed dated 12.07.2017, which was duly registered on 17.07.2017.
7. It is stated that the main features of the said lease deed are that the lease was for a
period of 15 years from the date of execution, the lessee was the husband of the
petitioner, the lease deed contained a sub-lease clause, allowing the lessee to
sub-lease the property, and the lease included a cancellation clause, wherein the lease
would automatically stand cancelled in case the LPG distributorship was not awarded
to the lessee.

Anita Kumari Shah vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. And Ors on 10 October, 2025
8. It is further submitted that subsequently, IOCL requested the Circle Officer,
Morwa, to provide a Naziri Naksha of the land offered by the petitioner for showroom
construction. The same was submitted by the petitioner to IOCL on 11.04.2018.
9. Thereafter, IOCL issued a letter dated 18.06.2018 calling upon the petitioner to
submit alternate land within two days, stating that the Patna High Court CWJC
No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 land offered by the petitioner for construction of
showroom at the advertised location was not found suitable. The petitioner claims no
field verification of the credentials and land offered by him was conducted at that
stage.
10. It is the contention of the petitioner that eventually, field verification was
conducted, and the petitioner contends that the land was found to be suitable by
IOCL officials during physical inspection. However, IOCL issued a rejection letter
dated 14.08.2018 (Annexure-8), citing that the lease deed submitted by the petitioner
was conditional and unenforceable, as it would stand cancelled if the distributorship
was not allotted to the lessee. Furthermore, the lease was not in the petitioner's name
but in her husband's name, who had not applied for the distributorship.
11. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the lease deed, though
conditional, was complied with all eligibility criteria as per the brochure. It is further
contended that the rejection was arbitrary, mala fide, and violation of principles
Patna High Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 of natural justice, as no
opportunity of hearing was given prior to cancellation and that the same lease was
accepted at the time of draw, and her candidature was validly approved for
participation.
12. A counter affidavit was filed by the respondents IOCL. The Learned counsel for
the respondents submitted that, on perusal of Annexure-8, it appears that after full
consideration of the documents, the respondents had rejected the candidature of the
petitioner.
13. For better appreciation of the case, the relevant part of the Annexure-8, is
reproduced as follows:
"Please refer your application (IOC02313364718072017) for award of above
mentioned LPG Distributorship.
We regret to inform you that upon field verification of the information submitted by
you in your application mentioned above, the following variance was observed:
1. Applicant submitted conditional lease deed for showroom. In page no.5, para no.2
of registered lease deed, if distributorship is not allotted to lessee, Patna High Court
CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 lease deed will be automatically cancelled.

Anita Kumari Shah vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. And Ors on 10 October, 2025
Since, spouse of applicant did not apply for LPG distributorship; hence lease deed is
not enforced. Hence, lease deed for showroom is not accepted.
Applicant does not have any own land or in family unit in advertised location for construction of
showroom as define in multiple dealership/distributorship norms of eligibility criteria.
In view of the above, your candidature is rejected and the amount of Rs. 40,000./- deposited with
the Corporation stands forfeited in line with clause No. 11 h & 11 i of the advertisement."
14. Further, the Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the lease deed was conditional
and the lease would automatically cancel if the LPG distributorship was not allotted to the lessee,
and therefore unenforceable.
15. It is further contended that the lease was not in the name of the applicant i.e. the petitioner but
in her husband's name, who was not the applicant, and hence, the land offered could Patna High
Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 not be considered "own land" or from the "family
unit" as per eligibility norms.
16. It is submitted that the FVC asked multiple times to provide for an alterante land vide emails
dated 18.06.2018, 20.06.2018, 07.07.2018, and 09.07.2018 which was not complied by the
petitioner. It is further submitted that the forfeiture of (cid:128)40,000/- was justified in terms of Clause
11(h) & 11(i) of the brochure.
17. It is further argued that the petitioner had given an undertaking affidavit declaring that any
incorrect or misleading information would render her ineligible for LPG distributorship. Therefore,
the decision to reject the candidature was taken in adherence to established policy and guidelines,
and there was no arbitrariness and that the writ-petition is misconceived and is fit to be dismissed.
18. Further, the Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the issue involved in the
present case, i.e., the non-compliance by the applicants with the terms and conditions of the Patna
High Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 advertisement, the brochure, and the
requirement of documents as per the settled guidelines, has already been set at rest by a catena of
decisions rendered by this Court. It was contended that, in view of such non-compliance, the
candidature of the petitioner has been cancelled.
19. In support of the case of the respondent Corporation, the Learned counsel has relied on the
following judgments of the Division Bench of this Court reported in (1) 2012 (2) PLJR 783 (M/s
Indian Oil Corporation Limited Vs. Raj Kumar Jha & ors), and (2) order passed in LPA No. 925 of
2012 (Mukesh Pandey Vs. The Hindustan Petroleum Corporation & Ors.).
20. The observations made by the Hon'ble Division Bench in M/s Indian Oil Corporation Limited
(supra) are quoted hereinbelow:

Anita Kumari Shah vs The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. And Ors on 10 October, 2025
"8. We are of the opinion that the Corporation being the State within the meaning of
Article 12 of the Constitution is supposed to act fairly, reasonably and uniformly and
has to be objective in its approach. Once the standard is set out in the advertisement,
Patna High Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 the Corporation has to
adhere to the said standard without any variation. In case, the Corporation allows
any alteration the same will amount to subjective approach which is frowned upon by
the Courts time and again. To remain objective the Corporation is required to adhere
to the standards mentioned in the advertisement. In the present case, it is not in
dispute that the application made by the writ petitioner was not in conformation with
the requirements mentioned in the advertisement. In our opinion, the Corporation
was justified in rejecting the application of the writ petitioner.
9. The Learned Single Judge ought not to have interfered with the decision of the
Corporation which was taken in consonance with the terms and conditions contained
in the advertisement. Besides; may be, in the present case it was a mere typographical
error. However, there might be a case of mischief or misrepresentation also. It is
difficult to draw a line where an error ends and a mischief or misrepresentation
begins. The best way to avoid discrimination is strict adherence to the Patna High
Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018 dt.10-10-2025 standards mentioned in the
advertisement. For the aforesaid reasons we hold that the Corporation was justified
in rejecting the application of the writ petitioner. The Appeal is allowed. The
impugned judgment and order dated 28th January, 2010 passed by the Learned
Single Judge in CWJC No. 13196 of 2009 is set aside. CWJC No. 13196 is dismissed."
21. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the Learned counsel for the respondents.
22. In light of the legal proposition laid down in the aforesaid judgments, this Court is of the
considered view that once a standard is set out in the advertisement, the Corporation is bound to
adhere to the said standard without any variation. In case, if the Corporation permits any alteration,
it would amount to a subjective approach, which has been disapproved by the Courts time and
again. In the present case, the petitioner through her application form, offered unsuitable land for
LPG distributorship based on the selection criteria Patna High Court CWJC No.18393 of 2018
dt.10-10-2025 stipulated in the Unified Guidelines for Selection of LPG Distributors - June 2017,
which was rightly rejected by the respondents.
23. Therefore, the petitioner cannot claim any right for consideration of her application. This Court
finds no error or irregularity in the decision of the respondents in issuing rejection letter
(Annexure-8) to the petitioner.
24. In view of the above discussion, the Writ petition is liable to be dismissed, as it is devoid of
merits.
25. In result, Writ petition is dismissed.
