2. The application has been filed, seeking transfer of Matrimonial Divorce Case No. 1696 of 2022
instituted under Section 13(1)(i)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act by the opposite party from the Court
of learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Patna to the court of learned Principal Judge, Family
Court, Madhubani.
3. The marriage of the petitioner was solemnised with the opposite party on 08.12.2021. Just after
marriage, allegedly she was subjected to torture in various ways on account of non fulfillment of
dowry leading to institution of Rahika P.S. Case No. 67 of 2023. The petitioner has further been
ousted from the matrimonial home; since the petitioner was not Patna High Court MJC No.1680 of
2023 dt.10-10-2025 getting any financial assistance, this led to filing of M.R. Case No. 101 of 2023
before the court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Madhubani seeking monthly maintenance and
litigation expenses. A copy of the final order passed in the afore noted case has been produced
before this Court and the same is kept on record. On perusal of the order passed in the afore noted
MR Case No. 101of 2023, it appears that the opposite party has been directed to pay a sum of

application and further Rs.2,000/- has been award as a litigation cost.

4. It is the contention of the petitioner that despite the order having been passed by the learned
Principal Judge, Family Court, Madhubani, till date the petitioner has not been offered as a single
penny and as such she is facing serious financial crunch to pursue the litigation. Moreover, the
petitioner is aged about 28 years and now she has been residing with her parents at Madhubani and
there is no one in her family to look after and, as such, she is facing difficulty to pursue the divorce
case. Learned Advocate for the petitioner also placed reliance upon the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of N.C.V. Aishwarya v. A.S. Saravana Karthik Sha [AIR Patna High Court
MJC No.1680 of 2023 dt.10-10-2025 2022 SC 4318] to support the aforesaid contention.
5. A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the opposite party. It is submitted that the
petitioner is a working lady and has been associated with an NGO namely, Maithili Diva and during
her work she has to travel everywhere alone and, moreover, in Complaint Case No. 223/2023, which
is pending before the court of Judicial magistrate 1 st Class, Danapur, where the court has taken
cognizance for the offences, as alleged, on 12.05.2023, the petitioner was all along remained
physically present on all occasions. However, she never intended to appear in Matrimonial Divorce
Case No. 1696 of 2022. The filing of the transfer petition is said to be only a move to put pressure on
the petitioner with ulterior motive and to harass the petitioner.
6. Considered the submissions advanced by the learned Advocates for the respective parties and also
taken note of the judicial pronouncements of the Apex Court in the case of Sumita Singh Vs. Kumar
Sanjay, reported in, (2001) 10 SCC 41 and Rajani Kishor Pardeshi Vs. Kishor Babulal Pardeshi,
reported in, (2005) 12 SCC 237, where the Court has underscored that more weightage and
consideration should be given to the convenience of the female litigants and transfer of Patna High
Court MJC No.1680 of 2023 dt.10-10-2025 legal proceedings from one Court to another Court
should ordinarily be allowed in order to avoid undue hardship to the female litigants. This Court
further finds that the petitioner, besides a woman aged about 28 years, there is no one in her family
to look after her, except the old parents, and, prima facie, she is not getting any financial support.
Save and except the allegation that the petitioner is associated with an NGO, it has not been
disclosed as to how and what she is earning, all the more, the conduct of the opposite party also
appears to be not conducive and uptill now he has been evading to pay maintenance amount, as has
been granted by the court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Madhubani in MR No. 101 of 2023. The
distance of Madhubani to Patna is also more than 200 kilometers; this is also one of the factor
which is required to be considered.
7. For reasons afore noted and the mandate of the Apex Court, this Court finds substance in the
transfer application. Accordingly, Matrimonial Divorce Case No. 1696 of 2022 pending in the court
of learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Patna is transferred to the court of learned Principal
Judge, Madhubani.
8. MJC No. 1680 of 2023 stands allowed.

Court, Madhubani, a fresh notice shall be issued in favour of the opposite party for his appearance.
