3. It is submitted by the Learned counsel for the petitioner that the selection criteria were not
disclosed, and candidates with lower marks were included in the revised list Patna High Court
CWJC No.23854 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 arbitrarily.
4. It is further submitted that the petitioner fulfilled eligibility criteria and had submitted all
required documents. Despite repeated representations and RTI applications, no response was
received from the authorities.
5. It is alleged that the acts of the respondents are arbitrary, violative of Articles 14, 17, and 21 of the
Constitution of India, and amount to discrimination against the petitioner.
6. A counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the respondent Nos. 2, 4 and 6. It is admitted that the
Bihar State Minority Financial Corporation implements the "Chief Minister Minority Employment
Loan Scheme" for unemployed minority youth. While the petitioner's name was included in the
initial list recommended by the District Selection Committee, it was found that the list was not in
accordance with the prescribed guidelines. Consequently, the Managing Director of the Corporation
directed the District Minority Welfare Officer to send fresh list as per Patna High Court CWJC
No.23854 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 guidelines.
7. It is submitted by the Learned counsel for the respondents that the petitioner applied under
Category IV, for which only 5% of the total allocated funds were reserved. Out of Rs.25 crores for the
entire state, only Rs.88.30 lakhs were allocated for disbursal in West Champaran district. In the
corrected list, the other candidates who were selected under Category IV had obtained 35, 33, and
32 marks respectively whereas the petitioner has obtained only 25 marks, which was below the
cutoff. Therefore, the petitioner's name was not recommended for loan in the corrected list and
urged to dismiss the writ petition as it is devoid of merits.
9. Upon hearing the Learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records, this Court finds that it
is not in dispute that the petitioner's name initially appeared in the first list. However, the said list
was later withdrawn and it was revised it did not conform to the guidelines issued by the State
Government. The selection under the Patna High Court CWJC No.23854 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025
scheme was governed by a defined marking pattern and categorization system, and the revised list
was prepared in accordance with those guidelines. From perusal of the contents of the counter
affidavit it appears that the petitioner obtained 25 marks, did not meet the required cut- off in
Category IV, where the lowest selected candidate had obtained 32 marks. Therefore, the Court finds
no procedural irregularity or illegality in the revision of the list. The revised selection appears to
have been made on merit and in adherence to the guidelines issued by the State Government for
sanction of loan under the scheme. The Court is also of the view that no fundamental right of the
petitioner has been violated. Mere inclusion in provisional / initial list does not confer any right to
the petitioner for loan particularly where selection is based on merit and availability of limited
funds.
10. In view of the submissions made by the Learned counsel for the respondents, and upon perusal
of the contents of the writ petition and the Patna High Court CWJC No.23854 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025

reliefs sought therein, this Court is of the considered view that the writ petition is devoid of merits
and does not warrant any interference.
11. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed as devoid of merits.
12. Interlocutory Application, if any, shall stands disposed of.
