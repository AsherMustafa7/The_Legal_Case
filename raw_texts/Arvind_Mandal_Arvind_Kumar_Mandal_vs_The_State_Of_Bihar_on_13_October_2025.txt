acquitted by the Trial Court from the charges under Sections
323, 331, 447, 504, 506/34 of the I.P.C.
3. As per prosecution case, all the accused persons
including respondent nos. 2 to 4 armed with lathi, danda and
bricks entered in the courtyard of the informant and started
abusing. It is alleged that all the accused persons started
assaulting the informant with lathi-danda. It is further alleged
that when the informant's brother Manoj Mandal, mother Laxmi
Devi and Bhabhi came to rescue him then all the accused
persons assaulted them. It is further alleged that the informant's
Bhabhi was pregnant and they pulled her sari and assaulted. It is
further alleged that they also looted the box containing an
amount of Rs.5,000/- and other articles of Rs.10,000/-

nos. 2 to 4 to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be
tried.
5. During the trial, the prosecution examined
altogether four witnesses viz. PW-1 Ramesh Mandal, PW-2
Pinku Mandal, PW-3 Md. Suleman and PW-4 Manoj Mandal.
No documentary evidence was adduced on behalf of the
prosecution.
6. The defence has not adduced any oral or
documentary evidence.
7. After closure of prosecution evidence, the
statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313
Cr.P.C. and after conclusion of trial, learned trial court has
acquitted the accused persons.
8. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that
prosecution has proved the case against the accused persons
beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt as the prosecution
witnesses have supported the prosecution case. It is submitted
that as they are eye witnesses of the alleged occurrence and
knows the true fact of the case and they have deposed and given
description of the appellant. It is submitted that the concerned
court has failed to appreciate the materials available on record
and has given a wrong finding and passed the impugned

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 3
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
judgment of acquittal. Learned counsel for the appellant during
course of argument has admitted that PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3
have become more or less hostile and PW-4 during the
examination-in-chief has supported the prosecution case.
9. Learned APP appearing for the State submits that
in the present case prosecution has examined altogether four
witnesses. Out of the four witnesses, PW-1and PW-2 have been
declared hostile, PW-3 has been declared tendered on the
ground that he has not supported the case of prosecution.
Learned counsel submits that though PW-4 has given evidence
before the court but his evidence during cross-examination
reflects that his statement was not recorded by the police. It is
further submitted that the evidence of PW-4 has not been
supported by any other other witnesses who have been
examined. It is evident that PW-4 has given evidence first time
before the Court and therefore his evidence is not reliable.
Learned counsel further submits that from perusal of the
impugned judgment of acquittal, it is evident that the
Investigating Officer and the informant of the case have not
been examined by the prosecution. It is submitted that on the
point of place of occurrence, there was none to support the
specific place of occurrence and in absence of Investigating
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
5/16
Officer the place of occurrence cannot be established. Further,
the informant, who has set the prosecution into motion, has not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 4
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
been examined. It is further submitted that the trial Court has
recorded the finding that necessary process has been issued for
producing prosecution witnesses, but for the reasons best known
to the prosecution no evidence was produced. From perusal of
the impugned judgment, it is evident that the same has been
passed on the basis of material available on record and there is
no reason to differ from the finding of concerned court.
10. In criminal appeal against acquittal what the
Appellate Court has to examine is whether the finding of the
learned trial court is perverse and prima facie illegal. Once the
Appellate Court comes to the finding that the grounds on which
the judgment is based is not perverse, the scope of appeal
against acquittal is limited considering the fact that the legal
presumption about the innocence of the accused is further
strengthened by the finding of the Court. At this point, it is
imperative to consider the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Surajpal Singh & Ors. Versus The State
reported in 1952 SCR 193, paragraph 13 of which reads as
under:
"..the High court has full power to review
the evidence upon which the order of
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
6/16
acquittal was founded. But it is equally
well settled that the presumption of
innocence of the accused is further
reinforced by his acquittal by the trial Court
and the findings of the trial Court which
had the advantage of seeing the witnesses
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 5
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
and hearing their evidence can be reversed
only for very substantial and compelling
reasons."
11. In the case of Ghurey Lal versus State of Uttar
Pradesh reported in (2008) 10 SCC 450 in paragraph 75, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the said view and observed as
under:
"The trial Court has the advantage of
watching the demeanour of the witnesses
who have given evidence, therefore, the
appellate court should be slow to interfere
with the decisions of the trial court. An
acquittal by the trial court should not be
interfered with unless it is totally perverse
or wholly unsustainable."
12. The trial court has analyzed the evidence of PW-
1 Ramesh Mandal, PW-2 Pinku Mandal, PW-3 Md. Suleman
and PW-4 Manoj Mandal. Except PW-4, other witnesses have
not supported the story of prosecution. The trial court has also
recorded the finding that necessary process has been issued for
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
7/16
producing the witnesses of prosecution but the prosecution has
failed to produce the witnesses. It is recorded by the trial court
that PW-4 in his evidence has deposed that he has not given his
statement before the police. In this way, the statement of PW-4
does not carry any weightage as he was adducing his evidence
first time before the court. The statement of P.W. 4 has not been
corroborated by any of the witnesses. It has been rightly
submitted by the learned APP for the State that the Investigating
Officer and the informant of the case have not been examined as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 6
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
examination of four prosecution witnesses clearly reflects that
the Investigating Officer and informant have not been examined
and from the finding of court it is quite evident that process has
been issued to produce all the prosecution witnesses but for the
reason best known to prosecution, the informant and the
Investigating Officer have not been examined. In this way, the
prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable
doubt.
13. On the point of non-examination of
Investigating Officer, it is necessary to cite some decisions
rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court.
14. In Behari Prasad Vs. State of Bihar reported in
(1996) 2 SCC 317, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that though
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
8/16
non-examination of the Investigating Officer may not always be
fatal where it causes prejudiced to the accused, it becomes a
significant infirmity, as observed in the judgment which reads as
under:-
"We may also indicate here
that it will not be correct to contend
that if an Investigating Officer is not
examined in a case, such case should
fail on the ground that the accused
were deprived of the opportunity to
effectively cross examine the witnesses
for the prosecution and to bring out
contradictions in their statements
before the police. A case of prejudice
likely to be suffered by an accused
must depend on the facts of the case
and no universal straight jacket
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 7
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
formula should be laid down that non
examination of investigating Officer
per se vitiates a criminal trial. These
appeals, therefore, fail and are
dismissed. The appellants who have
been released on bail should be taken
into custody to serve out the
sentence."
15. In the case of Syed Ibrahim versus State of
Andhra Pradesh, reported in (2008) 10 SCC 601, it has been
held that wherein it has been held that,
"when place of occurrence itself has
not been established, it would not be
proper to accept the prosecution
side."

16. I am dealing with an appeal against acquittal
and shall keep in mind the principles governing the cases of
appeal against acquittal. The principles have been reiterated by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in catena of decisions.
17. In the case of H.D. Sundara and Others vs.
State of Karnataka reported in (2023) 9 SCC 581, Hon'ble
Supreme Court, in paragraph 8, has held as follows :
"8. In this appeal, we are called upon to
consider the legality and validity of the
impugned judgment State of Karnataka v.
H.K. Mariyapp, 2010 SCC OnLine Kar 5591
rendered by the High Court while deciding
an appeal against acquittal under Section
378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (for short "Cr.P.C"). The principles
which govern the exercise of appellate
jurisdiction while dealing with an appeal
against acquittal under Section 378 Cr.P.C
can be summarized as follows:
"8.1. The acquittal of the accused further
strengthens the presumption of innocence;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 8
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
2. The appellate court, while hearing an
appeal against acquittal, is entitled to the
oral and documentary evidence;
8.3. The appellate court, while deciding an
appeal against acquittal, after
reappreciating the evidence, is required to
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
10/16
consider whether the view taken by the
trial court is a possible view which could
have been taken on the basis of the
evidence on record;
8.4. If the view taken is a possible view, the
appellate court cannot overturn the order
of acquittal on the ground that another
view was also possible; and 8.5. The
appellate court can interfere with the order
of acquittal only if it comes to a finding
that the only conclusion which can be
recorded on the basis of the evidence on
record was that the guilt of the accused
was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and
no other conclusion was possible."
18. In Chandrappa Vs. State of Karnataka,
(2007) 4 SCC 415, Hon'ble Supreme Court after referring to
several authorities has held as follows:
"42. From the above decisions, in our considered
view, the following general principles regarding
powers of the appellate court while dealing with
an appeal against an order of acquittal emerge:
(1) An appellate court has full power to review,
reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon
which the order of acquittal is founded.
(2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no
limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of
such power and an appellate court on the evidence
before it may reach its own conclusion, both on
questions of fact and of law.
(3) Various expressions, such as, "substantial and
compelling reasons", "good and sufficient
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
11/16
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 9
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
grounds", "very strong circumstances", "distorted
conclusions", "glaring mistakes", etc. are not
intended to curtail extensive powers of an
appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such
phraseologies are more in the nature of "flourishes
of language" to emphasise the reluctance of an
appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to
curtail the power of the court to review the
evidence and to come to its own conclusion.
(4) An appellate court, however, must bear in
mind that in case of acquittal, there is double
presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the
presumption of innocence is available to him
under the fundamental principle of criminal
jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed
to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a
competent court of law. Secondly, the accused
having secured his acquittal, the presumption of
his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and
strengthened by the trial court.
(5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on
the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate
court should not disturb the finding of acquittal
recorded by the trial court."
( Emphasis Supplied)
19. In Murugesan Vs. State, (2012) 10 SCC 383,
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:
" 18. Before proceeding any further it will be
useful to recall the broad principles of law
governing the power of the High Court under
Section 378 CrPC, while hearing an appeal
against an order of acquittal passed by a trial
Judge.
19. An early but exhaustive consideration of the
law in this regard is to be found in the decision of
Sheo Swarup v. King Emperor [(1933-34) 61 IA
398 : AIR 1934 PC 227 (2)] wherein it was held
that the power of the High Court extends to a
review of the entire evidence on the basis of
which the order of acquittal had been passed by
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025

the trial court and thereafter to reach the necessary
conclusion as to whether order of acquittal is
required to be maintained or not. In the opinion of
the Privy Council no limitation on the exercise of
power of the High Court in this regard has been
imposed by the Code though certain principles are
required to be kept in mind by the High Court
while exercising jurisdiction in an appeal against
an order of acquittal..................................
20. The principles of law laid down by the Privy
Council in Sheo Swarup(supra) have been
consistently followed by this Court in a series of
subsequent pronouncements ......................
21. A concise statement of the law on the issue
that had emerged after over half a century of
evolution since Sheo Swarup ( Supra) is to be
found in para 42 of the Report in Chandrappa v.
State of Karnataka [(2007) 4 SCC 415
............................................................
32. In the above facts can it be said that the view
taken by the trial court is not a possible view? If
the answer is in the affirmative, the jurisdiction of
the High Court to interfere with the acquittal of
the appellant-accused, on the principles of law
referred to earlier, ought not to have been
exercised. In other words, the reversal of the
acquittal could have been made by the High Court
only if the conclusions recorded by the learned
trial court did not reflect a possible view. It must
be emphasised that the inhibition to interfere must
be perceived only in a situation where the view
taken by the trial court is not a possible view. The
use of the expression "possible view" is conscious
and not without good reasons. The said expression
is in contra23. Having dealt with the principles of
law that ought to be kept in mind while
considering an appeal against an order of acquittal
passed by the trial court, we may now proceed to
examine the reasons recorded by the trial court for
acquitting the accused in the present case and
those that prevailed with the High Court in
reversing the said conclusion and in convicting
and sentencing the appellant-accused.
33. The expressions "erroneous", "wrong" and
"possible" are defined in Oxford English
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 11
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
13/16
Dictionary in the following terms:
"erroneous.-- wrong; incorrect.
wrong.--(1) not correct or true, mistaken.
(2) unjust, dishonest, or immoral.
possible.--(1) capable of existing, happening, or
being achieved.
(2) that may exist or happen, but that is not certain
or probable."
34. It will be necessary for us to emphasise that a
possible view denotes an opinion which can exist
or be formed irrespective of the correctness or
otherwise of such an opinion. A view taken by a
court lower in the hierarchical structure may be
termed as erroneous or wrong by a superior court
upon a mere disagreement. But such a conclusion
of the higher court would not take the view
rendered by the subordinate court outside the
arena of a possible view. The correctness or
otherwise of any conclusion reached by a court
has to be tested on the basis of what the superior
judicial authority perceives to be the correct
conclusion. A possible view, on the other hand,
denotes a conclusion which can reasonably be
arrived at regardless of the fact where it is agreed
upon or not by the higher court. The fundamental
distinction between the two situations have to be
kept in mind. So long as the view taken by the
trial court can be reasonably formed, regardless of
whether the High Court agrees with the same or
not, the view taken by the trial court cannot be
interdicted and that of the High Court supplanted
over and above the view of the trial court.
35. A consideration on the basis on which the
learned trial court had founded its order of
acquittal in the present case clearly reflects a
possible view. There may, however, be
disagreement on the correctness of the same. But
that is not the test. So long as the view taken is not
impossible to be arrived at and reasons therefor,
relatable to the evidence and materials on record,
are disclosed any further scrutiny in exercise of
the power under Section 378 CrPC was not called
for."

Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.3294 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
14/16
SCC 719 , Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:
" 9 [Ed. : Para 9 corrected vide Official
Corrigendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./29/2017 dated 13-7-
2017.] . Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties, we are of the view that the trial court's
judgment is more than just a possible view for
arriving at the conclusion of acquittal, and that it
would not be safe to convict seventeen persons
accused of the crime of murder i.e. under Section
302 read with Section 149 of the Penal Code...."

21. In Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar Vs. State
of Karnataka, 2024 SCC Online SC 561, Hon'ble Supreme
Court, after referring to relevant precedents, has observed as
follows:
"39. Thus, it is beyond the pale of doubt that the scope
of interference by an appellate Court for reversing the
judgment of acquittal recorded by the trial Court in favour
of the accused has to be exercised within the four corners
of the following principles:
(a) That the judgment of acquittal suffers from
patent perversity;
(b) That the same is based on a misreading/omission
to consider material evidence on record;
(c) That no two reasonable views are possible and
only the view consistent with the guilt of the
accused is possible from the evidence available on
record.
40. The appellate Court, in order to interfere with
the judgment of acquittal would have to record
pertinent findings on the above factors if it is
inclined to reverse the judgment of acquittal
rendered by the trial Court."

impugned judgment of acquittal, it is evident that prosecution
has examined altogether four witnesses. Out of the four
witnesses, PW-1and PW-2 have been declared hostile, PW-3 has
been declared tendered on the ground that he has not supported
the case of prosecution. PW-4 has given evidence before the
court but his evidence during cross-examination reflects that his
statement was not recorded by the police. It means that PW-4
has given evidence first time before the Court and therefore his
evidence is not reliable. Further, the evidence of PW-4 has not
been supported by any other witnesses who have been
examined. The contention of the learned counsel for the State is
quite relevant that the Investigating Officer and the informant of
the case have not been examined by the prosecution and on the
point of place of occurrence, there was none to support the
specific place of occurrence and in absence of Investigating
Officer the place of occurrence cannot be established and the
informant, who has set the prosecution into motion, has not been
examined. From perusal of the impugned judgment of acquittal,
it is evident that the trial Court has recorded the finding that
necessary process has been issued for producing prosecution
witnesses, but no evidence was produced by the prosecution
side.

23. Thus, in the opinion of this Court, the trial Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67911580/ 14
Arvind Mandal @ Arvind Kumar Mandal vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
has taken a plausible view based on the evidence available on
the record. The prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond
the shadow of reasonable doubt. The view taken by the trial
Court cannot be held to be bad or perverse. Under such
circumstances, no case for interference with the impugned
judgment is made out.
24. In the result, the present criminal appeal
preferred against the judgment of acquittal dated judgment dated
