3. The brief facts relevant for the present case are that the petitioner was appointed as Panchayat
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 2
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
Rojgar Sevak in 2010 and was working in that capacity. On December 21, 2022, he was transferred
to Block Headquarter, Harlakhi, and had joined on the same day. In the month of March in the year
2023, his mother suffered from a serious illness of the heart, for which the petitioner took her to
Darbhanga for better treatment. On 09.03.2023, the petitioner made an application before the
Programme Officer, Harlakhi stating therein that his mother is not well and consequently had
applied for leave from 10.03.2023 to 20.03.2023. The said application was received in the office of
the Programme Officer, Block Harlakhi on 10.03.2023, after which the petitioner proceeded with
the treatment of his mother.
4. The petitioner was issued a show cause vide Memo No. 42 dated 25.03.2023 issued by the
Programme Officer, MGNREGA, Harlakhi, by which the petitioner was asked an explanation
regarding his absence from office for past 15 days and further alleging therein that no work has been
done by the Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 petitioner for last 4 months
and further the petitioner was directed to furnish his explanation within a period of 24 hours.
5. The petitioner in reply to the said show cause had informed the office through WhatsApp group
on the same day at 05:05 P.M. along with the photographs, showing that his mother was admitted in
City Hospital, Darbhanga. Subsequently, another Letter No. 50 dated 25.04.2023 was issued for his
absenteeism from the weekly meeting and show cause explanation was asked by the Programme
Officer, MGNREGA, Harlakhi. Thereafter, another Memo No. 1165 dated 28.04.2023 was issued by
the Deputy Development Commissioner-cum-Additional District Programme Coordinator,
MGNREGA, Madhubani to the petitioner regarding non-furnishing his explanation to the show
cause issued by the Programme Officer, Harlakhi dated 25.03.2023 and 25.04.2023, and
accordingly 3 days' time was given to the petitioner to furnish his explanation for the same as to why
the contract should not be terminated. The petitioner, in compliance to the Memo No. 1165 dated
28.04.2023, furnished his reply on 30.04.2023, stating therein that owing to the ill health of the
mother of the petitioner from past three months, the petitioner was not in a position to attend office
and further prayed to exonerate Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 him from
the explanation and made a request to transfer him to some nearest block.
6. Subsequently, the Deputy Development Commissioner -cum-Additional District Programme
Coordinator, MGNREGA, Madhubani, issued an office order vide Memo No. 1639 dated 22.06.2023
by which as per sub-clause 6 of clause 1 of the letter no. 196 dated 25.03.2022, the contract of the
petitioner was terminated.
7. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submits that after a series of treatment, the
petitioner took his mother to the Cribs Hospital, Madhubani on 17.03.2023 from where the mother
of the petitioner was discharged on 21.03.2023. Thereafter, the mother of the petitioner was
operated for pacemaker surgery in City Hospital, Darbhanga and was discharged on 28.03.2023. A
certificate dated 23.03.2023 was also issued stating that the mother of the petitioner requires
intensive care.
8. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submits that while passing the order, an incorrect
finding was recorded by the D.D.C., Madhubani, that the petitioner had himself accepted that he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 3
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
was absent from the office for the last 3 months without any information which is totally an
incorrect finding as it is evident from the earlier show cause dated 25.03.2023 in which the Patna
High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 Programme Officer has himself specifically
mentioned that the petitioner was absent for last 15 days without any information.
However, the petitioner while leaving for the treatment of his mother had submitted an application
for leave which was duly received by the office of the Programme Officer, Harlakhi on 10.03.2023.
9. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner further submits that the D.D.C., Madhubani has
wrongly interpreted the explanation furnished by the petitioner dated 30.03.2023, that the
petitioner was not coming to office from the past 3 months.
Furthermore, another error was committed by the D.D.C. Madhubani to the extent of recording a
finding that the petitioner was absent from office since 21.12.2022 which is incorrect as the
petitioner was duly working and had received his due salary till February 2023,in support of which
the petitioner had furnished the payslips along with the explanation.
10. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that the petitioner had
preferred an appeal against the order of termination/cancellation before the District Magistrate,
Madhubani and a revision against the order dated 16.08.2023, before the Secretary, Rural Works
Department and a second revision before the Deputy Secretary, Rural Works Patna High Court
CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 Department in which the appellate as well as the revisional
authority has affirmed the order of termination/cancellation.
11. It is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that due to ill health of his mother
from the past 3 months, he was not able to come to office from 10.03.2023 to 30.04.2023.
12. The petitioner has filed supplementary affidavits wherein it has been categorically submitted
that vide Letter No. 428 dated 08.04.2021, the service of the petitioner was extended up to 60 years
or the retirement age or project period and from the perusal of the aforesaid order, it is evident that
the appointment of the petitioner was initially meant for two years and was subsequently extended
till the age of 60 years. Advocating to the aforesaid order, the learned Senior counsel for the
petitioner submits that the respondents are taking away the vested right created in favour of the
petitioner without following the due procedure under law.
13. It is submitted by the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner that the respondents through
Letter No. 196 dated 25.03.2022 had issued guidelines for disciplinary action against the officers
and the staff of Bihar Rural Development Society, MGNREGA and the conditions as enumerated in
the agreement is Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 no more applicable for
the purpose of taking any disciplinary action or rescinding the agreement.
14. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that the DDC, Madhubani in
its order of termination/cancellation has relied upon sub-clause (6) of Clause 1 and Clause 3(da) of
the guidelines dated 25.03.2022 without following the procedure prescribed in terms of Clause
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 4
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
3(gha) of the guidelines and has also not followed the guidelines dated 25.03.2022 for initiating
disciplinary action against the employees of the BRDS. In terms of Clause 3(gha) of the guidelines,
the disciplinary authority has to issue show cause and when the show cause is found unsatisfactory
then as per the principle of natural justice an opportunity of hearing is required to be given to the
delinquent employee. However, in the present case, the DDC, Madhubani has passed the order of
termination/cancellation against the petitioner without giving him any opportunity of hearing as
required in terms of Clause 3(gha) of the guidelines dated 25.03.2022. Similar infirmity has been
followed in the appellate orders and the appellate authority without considering the fact has wrongly
affirmed the order dated 22.06.2023 passed by the D.D.C., Madhubani.
Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025
15. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has next submitted that the Order dated
22.06.2023 the D.D.C., Madhubani has stated that the action of the petitioner is contrary to the
Clause 3 and 11 of the Agreement, however the said Clause is no more applicable in the case of the
petitioner as the same has been modified through the guidelines dated 25.03.2022. It is further
submitted that as per Clause 3(gha) of the guidelines dated 25.03.2022, there is a provision of
second show cause to be issued to the petitioner before rescinding the contract, which has not been
followed in the present case as no show cause had been issued to the petitioner after rejecting the
explanation and therefore, the order has been passed in violation of the guidelines dated
25.03.2022.
16. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner further submits that the order dated 23.01.2024,
16.08.2023, and 22.06.2023 are arbitrary, illegal, and fit to be quashed, on the ground that in all the
three orders, the authorities have not considered the fact that the petitioner was not absent from last
3 months. i.e. since 21.12.2022, but in fact an incorrect interpretation was given by the DDC
Madhubani, to the reply of the petitioner in which he was trying to convey that her mother is not
keeping well from last 3 months, due to which he could not Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of
2024 dt.07-10-2025 come to office. Further, while passing the order, the respondent authorities
have not recorded any reason on the fact as to how the petitioner has been paid salary for 3 months
if he was absent from 21.12.2022 as recorded by the DDC Madhubani in its order dated 22.06.2023.
17. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that even, the DDC
Madhubani has not recorded any finding to the fact that in response to the show cause dated
25.03.2023, the petitioner had informed on the WhatsApp group, on the same day that he was
unable to attend office due to ill health of his mother and due to the fact that his mother was
admitted in the hospital. Also, in the termination/cancellation order dated 22.06.2023, information
about the leave application dated 10.03.2023 submitted by the petitioner in the office of Programme
Officer, has not been taken into consideration nor any finding has been recorded by the authorities.
18. Lastly, the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the show cause issued by the
Programme Officer, Harlakhi is arbitrary, illegal and based on incorrect facts as when the petitioner
had already submitted his leave application dated 10.03.2023, and it was duly received in the office
of Programme Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 Officer, then there was no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 5
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
occasion for the Programme Officer to issue any show cause to the petitioner
19. Learned counsel for the respondents opposes the argument raised by the learned Senior Counsel
for the petitioner and submits that the reply of show cause submitted by the petitioner was duly
considered by the respondent-authority and upon careful scrutiny of the facts and reply submitted
by the petitioner, the order of termination/cancellation was passed.
20. I have heard and considered the submissions of the parties.
21. It is relevant here to quote a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Krushnakant
B. Parmar v. Union of India, reported as (2012) 3 SCC 178, the relevant paragraphs of which read as
under: -
"16. In the case of the appellant referring to unauthorised absence the disciplinary
authority alleged that he failed to maintain devotion to duty and his behaviour was
unbecoming of a government servant. The question whether "unauthorised absence
from duty" amounts to failure of devotion to duty or behaviour unbecoming of a
government servant cannot be decided without deciding the question whether
absence is wilful or because of compelling circumstances.
17. If the absence is the result of compelling circumstances under which it was not
possible to report or perform duty, such Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024
dt.07-10-2025 absence cannot be held to be wilful. Absence from duty without any
application or prior permission may amount to unauthorised absence, but it does not
always mean wilful. There may be different eventualities due to which an employee
may abstain from duty, including compelling circumstances beyond his control like
illness, accident, hospitalisation, etc., but in such case the employee cannot be held
guilty of failure of devotion to duty or behaviour unbecoming of a government
servant.
18. In a departmental proceeding, if allegation of unauthorised absence from duty is
made, the disciplinary authority is required to prove that the absence is wilful, in the
absence of such finding, the absence will not amount to misconduct."
22. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M.V. Bijlani v. Union of India reported as [(2006) 5
SCC 88: 2006 SCC (L&S) 919] in paragraph 25 has held thus: -
"25. It is true that the jurisdiction of the court in judicial review is limited.
Disciplinary proceedings, however, being quasi-criminal in nature, there should be
some evidence to prove the charge. Although the charges in a departmental
proceeding are not required to be proved like a criminal trial i.e. beyond all
reasonable doubt, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the enquiry officer performs a
quasi-judicial function, who upon analysing the documents must arrive at a
conclusion that there had been a preponderance of probability to prove the Patna
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 6
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 charges on the basis of materials
on record. While doing so, he cannot take into consideration any irrelevant fact. He
cannot refuse to consider the relevant facts. He cannot shift the burden of proof. He
cannot reject the relevant testimony of the witnesses only on the basis of surmises
and conjectures. He cannot enquire into the allegations with which the delinquent
officer had not been charged with."
23. The doctrine of audi alteram partem has three basic essentials. Firstly, a person against whom
an order is required to be passed or whose rights are likely to be affected adversely, must be granted
an opportunity of being heard.
Secondly, the authority concerned should provide a fair and transparent procedure and lastly, the
authority concerned must apply its mind and dispose of the matter by a reasoned or speaking order.
A disciplinary authority acting in a quasi-
judicial capacity, arriving at an adverse finding to impose a punishment must support the same with
cogent reasons. The orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon
which the administrative agency acted, be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained. The
importance of passing a reasoned order by such an authority is sine qua non and numerous judicial
precedents have time and again underscored the imperative and fundamental importance of Patna
High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 recording the reasons. It may be gainful to refer
to the authoritative pronouncements from the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which have cemented and
crystallized the position of law on this aspect.
24. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.N. Mukherjee v. Union of
India, reported as (1990) 4 SCC 594, while considering one of the questions, whether there is a
general principle of law which requires an administrative authority to record the reasons for its
decision, had held as under: -
36. Reasons, when recorded by an administrative authority in an order passed by it
while exercising quasi-
judicial functions, would no doubt facilitate the exercise of its jurisdiction by the appellate or
supervisory authority. But the other considerations, referred to above, which have also weighed with
this Court in holding that an administrative authority must record reasons for its decision, are of no
less significance.
These considerations show that the recording of reasons by an administrative authority serves a
salutary purpose, namely, it excludes chances of arbitrariness and ensures a degree of fairness in the
process of decision making. The said purpose would apply equally to all decisions and its application
cannot be confined to decisions which are subject to appeal, revision or judicial Patna High Court
CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 review. In our opinion, therefore, the requirement that
reasons be recorded should govern the decisions of an administrative authority exercising
quasi-judicial functions irrespective of the fact whether the decision is subject to appeal, revision or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 7
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
judicial review. It may, however, be added that it is not required that the reasons should be as
elaborate as in the decision of a court of law. The extent and nature of the reasons would depend on
particular facts and circumstances. What is necessary is that the reasons are clear and explicit so as
to indicate that the authority has given due consideration to the points in controversy. The need for
recording of reasons is greater in a case where the order is passed at the original stage. The appellate
or revisional authority, if it affirms such an order, need not give separate reasons if the appellate or
revisional authority agrees with the reasons contained in the order under challenge.
37. Having considered the rationale for the requirement to record the reasons for the decision of an
administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial functions we may now examine the legal basis for
imposing this obligation. While considering this aspect the Donoughmore Committee observed that
it may well be argued that there is a third principle of natural justice, namely, that a party is entitled
to know the reason for the decision, be it judicial or quasi-judicial. The Committee expressed the
opinion that "there are some cases where the refusal to Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024
dt.07-10-2025 give grounds for a decision may be plainly unfair; and this may be so, even when the
decision is final and no further proceedings are open to the disappointed party by way of appeal or
otherwise" and that "where further proceedings are open to a disappointed party, it is contrary to
natural justice that the silence of the Minister or the Ministerial Tribunal should deprive them of the
opportunity". (p. 80) Prof. H.W.R. Wade has also expressed the view that "natural justice may
provide the best rubric for it, since the giving of reasons is required by the ordinary man's sense of
justice". (See Wade, Administrative Law, 6th edn. p.
548.) In Siemens Engineering Co. case [(1976) 2 SCC 981 : 1976 Supp SCR 489] this Court has taken
the same view when it observed that "the rule requiring reasons to be given in support of an order is,
like the principles of audi alteram partem, a basic principle of natural justice which must inform
every quasi-judicial process". This decision proceeds on the basis that the two well known principles
of natural justice, namely (i) that no man should be a judge in his own cause, and (ii) that no person
should be judged without a hearing, are not exhaustive and that in addition to these two principles
there may be rules which seek to ensure fairness in the process of decision-making and can be
regarded as part of the principles of natural justice. This view is in consonance with the law laid
down by this Court in A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India [(1969) 2 SCC 262 : (1970) 1 SCR 457] wherein
it Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 has been held : (SCR pp. 468-69 : SCC p.
272, para 20) "The concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years.
In the past it was thought that it included just two rules namely : (i) no one shall be a judge in his
own cause (nemo debet esse judex propria causa), and (ii) no decision shall be given against a party
without affording him a reasonable hearing (audi alteram partem). Very soon thereafter a third rule
was envisaged and that is that quasi-
judicial enquiries must he held in good faith, without bias and not arbitrarily or unreasonably. But
in the course of years many more subsidiary rules came to be added to the rules of natural justice."
38. A similar trend is discernible in the decisions of English courts wherein it has been held that
natural justice demands that the decision should be based on some evidence of probative value. (See
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 8
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
: R. v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner ex p. Moore [(1965) 1 QB 456 : (1965) 1 All ER 81] ;
Mahon v. Air New Zealand Ltd. [1984 AC 648 : (1984) 3 All ER 201] )
39. The object underlying the rules of natural justice "is to prevent miscarriage of justice" and secure
"fair play in action". As pointed out earlier the requirement about recording of reasons for its
decision by an administrative authority exercising quasi- judicial functions achieves this object by
excluding chances of arbitrariness and ensuring a degree of fairness in the process Patna High Court
CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 of decision-making. Keeping in view the expanding horizon
of the principles of natural justice, we are of the opinion, that the requirement to record reason can
be regarded as one of the principles of natural justice which govern exercise of power by
administrative authorities. The rules of natural justice are not embodied rules. The extent of their
application depends upon the particular statutory framework whereunder jurisdiction has been
conferred on the administrative authority. With regard to the exercise of a particular power by an
administrative authority including exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial functions the legislature,
while conferring the said power, may feel that it would not be in the larger public interest that the
reasons for the order passed by the administrative authority be recorded in the order and be
communicated to the aggrieved party and it may dispense with such a requirement. It may do so by
making an express provision to that effect as those contained in the Administrative Procedure Act,
1946 of U.S.A. and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, 1977 of Australia whereby
the orders passed by certain specified authorities are excluded from the ambit of the enactment.
Such an exclusion can also arise by necessary implication from the nature of the subject matter, the
scheme and the provisions of the enactment. The public interest underly-ing such a provision would
outweigh the salutary purpose served by the requirement to record the reasons. The said
requirement cannot, therefore, be insisted upon in such a case.
40. For the reasons aforesaid, it must be concluded that except in cases where Patna High Court
CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 the requirement has been dispensed with expressly or by
necessary implication, an administrative authority exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions is
required to record the reasons for its decision.
25. Summarizing the principles of law, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kranti Associates
(P) Ltd. v. Masood Ahmed Khan, reported as (2010) 9 SCC 496, had held as under -
"46. The position in the United States has been indicated by this Court in S.N.
Mukherjee [(1990) 4 SCC 594 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 669 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 242 : (1991) 16
ATC 445 : AIR 1990 SC 1984] in SCC p. 602, para 11 : AIR para 11 at p. 1988 of the
judgment. This Court held that in the United States the courts have always insisted
on the recording of reasons by administrative authorities in exercise of their powers.
It was further held that such recording of reasons is required as "the courts cannot
exercise their duty of review unless they are advised of the considerations underlying
the action under review". In S.N. Mukherjee [(1990) 4 SCC 594 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 669 :
1991 SCC (L&S) 242 :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103405112/ 9
Manoj Kumar Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
(1991) 16 ATC 445 : AIR 1990 SC 1984] this Court relied on the decisions of the US
Court in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corpn. [87 L Ed 626 : 318
US 80 (1942)] and Dunlop v.
Bachowski [44 L Ed 2d 377 : 421 US 560 (1974)] in support of its opinion discussed above."
"47. Summarizing the above discussion, this Court holds:
(a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in
administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025
(b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions.
(c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of justice that justice
must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.
(d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible arbitrary exercise of
judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.
(e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision-maker on relevant grounds
and by disregarding extraneous considerations.
(f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a decision-making process as
observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-
judicial and even by administrative bodies.
(g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior courts.
(h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and constitutional
governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts.
This is virtually the lifeblood of judicial decision-making justifying the principle that reason is the
soul of justice.
(i) Judicial or even quasi-
judicial opinions these days can be Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 as
different as the judges and authorities who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common
purpose which is to demonstrate by reason that the relevant factors have been objectively
considered.

This is important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice delivery system.
(j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and transparency.
(k) If a judge or a quasi-
judicial authority is not candid enough about his/her decision-
making process then it is impossible to know whether the person deciding is faithful to the doctrine
of precedent or to principles of incrementalism.
(l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct. A pretence of reasons or
"rubber-stamp reasons" is not to be equated with a valid decision-
making process.
(m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial
powers. Transparency in decision-
making not only makes the judges and decision-makers less prone to errors but also makes them
subject to broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor [(1987) 100 Harvard
Law Review 731-37] .)
(n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of
2024 dt.07-10-2025 broad doctrine of fairness in decision-making, the said requirement is now
virtually a component of human rights and was considered part of Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See
Ruiz Torija v.
Spain [(1994) 19 EHRR 553] EHRR, at 562 para 29 and Anya v.
University of Oxford [2001 EWCA Civ 405 (CA)] , wherein the Court referred to Article 6 of the
European Convention of Human Rights which requires, "adequate and intelligent reasons must be
given for judicial decisions".
(o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting up precedents for the
future. Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the
essence and is virtually a part of "due process".
26. Considering the submissions of the learned counsels for the parties and the material available on
record, I am of the view that in the present case, the inquiry officer on appreciation of evidence
though held that the petitioner was unauthorisedly absent from duty but failed to hold that the
absence was wilful. The disciplinary authority as also the appellate authority, failed to consider the
fact that the petitioner was absent from duty due to compelling reasons i.e. ill health and heart
surgery of his mother, Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 as was also

mentioned in the explanation of the petitioner and subsequently wrongly terminated the petitioner.
Moreover, mere show cause notice, without following the guidelines prescribed vide Letter No. 196
dated 25.03.2022 and without hearing the petitioner would not suffice as the petitioner was facing
termination/cancellation and when on the face of the records it appears that procedure duly
prescribed have to be followed, has not been done in the present case then the writ petition is fit to
be allowed. No person can be terminated without following the Principles of Natural Justice and
without following the procedure prescribed under the guidelines. This is a case where the guidelines
prescribed have not been followed and the petitioner has not been heard.
27. In view of the discussions made above, the writ petition is allowed.
28. Accordingly, the order memo no. 1639 dated 22.06.2023 issued under the signature of the
Deputy Development Commissioner -cum- Additional District Programme Coordinator.
MGNREGA, Madhubani, the order dated 16.08.2023 passed in appeal case no. 2/2023 by which the
order of the Deputy Development Commissioner -cum- Additional District Programme Coordinator,
MGNREGA, Madhubani, the order dated Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025
23.01.2024 passed by the Secretary, Rural Development Department, Government of Bihar, the
order dated 07.02.2024 issued under the signature of the Deputy Secretary, Development Rural
Department, Government of Bihar, Patna are hereby quashed.
29. The respondents are directed to accept the joining of the petitioner forthwith. The petitioner
shall be entitled to all consequential benefits.
