3. Pursuant to Advertisement published in the
year 2021, the petitioner was appointed to the post of Constable

wherein at Column No. 12B, regarding antecedents of the petitioner, in which the petitioner had

Malbazar, West Bengal, an explanation was sought regarding the Character Verification Form of the
petitioner. After receipt of the report dated 27.05.2023, it was pointed out that a case i.e., Rahui P.S.
Case No. 125 of 2022 dated 08.03.2022 registered under Sections 147, 148, 149, 341, 323, 337, 504,
506 of the Indian Penal Code Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 and Sections
3(i)(r)/(s) of the SC & SC Act and Section 27 of the Arms Act was instituted against the petitioner.
4. Learned counsel submits that the petitioner submitted an explanation on 08.08.2023 stating that
since petitioner was under the belief upon the wrong advise given by the Advocate that the
aforementioned criminal case is disposed based on a compromise. Subsequently, the Training
Officer, ATC SSB, Shamshi, Himachal Pradesh vide memo dated 16.08.2023 directed to the
petitioner to submit all relevant documents, in compliance thereof, the younger brother of the
petitioner on 08.09.2023 submitted all the relevant documents related to aforesaid Rahui P.S. Case
No. 125 of 2022.
5. The petitioner joined as Constable (GD), 46 Bn SSB, Malbazar on 18.12.2023.

SSB, Falakata wherein the petitioner was directed to submit his response within 30 days for
furnishing wrong information in Column No. 12B of his verification form. On 29.01.2024, the
petitioner submitted his reply to the show cause wherein the petitioner had categorically submitted
that the error was owing to the wrong advise giving by his Advocate that the criminal case has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175966389/ 2
Dhannajay Kumar vs The Union Of India on 13 October, 2025
disposed based Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 on a compromise.
Subsequently, another show case notice dated 25.11.2024 was issued by the Commandant 46th Bn
SSB Malbazar directed the petitioner to submit his reply as to why his services be not terminated.
An application dated 23.12.2024, including all relevant documents related to the criminal case, was
submitted by the petitioner explaining the facts and the reasons and the bona fide mistakes
committed on his part. On 17.01.2025, the order of termination was issused by the Commandant 46
Bn SSB Malbazar terminating the petitioner from the service under Rule 18 read with Rule 23 of the
SSB Rules, 2009 and he was consequently struck off from the strenght of 46 Bn SSB Malbazar on
the ground of furnishing wrong information in his verification form. The petitioner preferred an
appeal under Rule 29 SSB Rules, 2009 before the Deputy Inspector General, SHQ, SSB, Jalpaiguri
which was rejected vide order dated 28.03.2025.
7. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that at the time of filling up the
Character Verification Form the petitioner had inadvertently and under bona fide mistake of fact
had not disclosed the pending criminal case i.e. Rahui P.S. Case No. 125 of 2022. Moreover, the
petitioner has been discharged by the learned trial Court vide Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of
2025 dt.13-10-2025 order dated 08.01.2024.
8. It has also been submitted by learned counsel that the aforesaid criminal case was instituted by
one Saheb Paswan, co-villager of the petitioner owing to some internal village dispute and there was
no involvement of the petitioner.
9. It has also been argued that the finding of the Enquiry Officer is based on conjectures and
surmises as he has observed that the delinquent employee should have filled up the Character
Verification Form only after ascertaining full facts when it is the categorical submission of the
petitioner that he had no knowledge about his involvement in any case.
10. Lastly, it has been submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that though the error of not
disclosing the pending criminal case was on account of bona fide error and the petitioner was
discharged by the learned trial Court yet the respondents vide impugned order dated 17.01.2025,
had imposed the punishment of termination from the service which is too harsh and
disproportionate to the alleged charge, more so, in light of the fact that the aforesaid criminal case
was instituted at the behest of a co-villager and the learned trial Court had discharged the petitioner.
11. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025
dt.13-10-2025 upon the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in the case of Avtar Singh
vs. Union of India & Ors. reported as (2016) 8 SCC 471; Pawan Kumar vs. Union of India & Anr.
reported as (2023) 12 SCC 317 and Ravindra Kumar vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. reported
as (2024) 5 SCC 264. The learned counsel has also placed reliance on a decision by this Court in
Sunil Kumar vs. State of Bihar & Ors. in C.W.J.C. No. 10563 of 2020.
12. In this case, the respondents has filed its counter affidavit and opposed the arguments of the
petitioner. The stand of the respondents is that Column 12B of the verification roll categorically
stated whether any case is pending against the candidate in any Court of law, however, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175966389/ 3
Dhannajay Kumar vs The Union Of India on 13 October, 2025
petitioner knowing fully well did not disclose the pending criminal case against him particularly
when he was enlarged on bail at the time of appointment. Further, the petitioner while replying to
the memo dated 15.07.2023 had stated that he was granted bail from the Court of Special Judge,
SC/ST, Nalanda, Biharshari and subsequently, a joint compromise petition was filed. Learned
counsel for the respondents submits that this clearly illustrates that the petitioner was fully aware
about the pending criminal case. Lastly, it is submitted that since the Patna High Court CWJC
No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 petitioner was appointed to the disciplined services, therefore his
continuance is improper.
13. Considered the submissions of the parties and perused the materials on record.
14. In the present case, a departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner for the charge
that he has suppressed the material fact regarding his involvement in the criminal case while filling
up the Character Verification Form and in the said departmental proceeding he has been found
guilty and has been awarded the punishment thereby terminating the services of the petitioner,
which has been upheld by the appellate authority.
15. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down the law that how the authorities should proceed in the
matter when implication of the applicant in criminal case was suppressed and when the nature of
offence was trivial.
16. In Avatar Singh vs. Union of India (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
"34. No doubt about it that verification of character and antecedents is one of the
important criteria to assess suitability and it is open to employer to adjudge
antecedents of the incumbent, but ultimate action should be based upon Patna High
Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 objective criteria on due consideration
of all relevant aspects.
35. Suppression of "material" information presupposes that what is suppressed that
"matters" not every technical or trivial matter. The employer has to act on due
consideration of rules/instructions, if any, in exercise of powers in order to cancel
candidature or for terminating the services of employee. Though a person who has
suppressed the material information cannot claim unfettered right for appointment
or continuity in service but he has a right not to be dealt with arbitrarily and exercise
of power has to be in reasonable manner with objectivity having due regard to facts of
cases.
36. What yardstick is to be applied has to depend upon the nature of post, higher post
would involve more rigorous criteria for all services, not only to uniformed service.
For lower posts which are not sensitive, nature of duties, impact of suppression on
suitability has to be considered by authorities concerned considering post / nature of
duties / services and power has to be exercised on due consideration of various
aspects. 38.10. For determining suppression or false information
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175966389/ 4
Dhannajay Kumar vs The Union Of India on 13 October, 2025
attestation/verification form has to be specific, not vague. Only such Patna High
Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 information which was required to be
specifically mentioned has to be disclosed. If information not asked for but is relevant
comes to knowledge of the employer the same can be considered in an objective
manner while addressing the question of fitness. However, in such cases action
cannot be taken on basis of suppression or submitting false information as to a fact
which was not even asked for." (emphasis supplied)
17. In the case of Pawan Kumar vs. Union of India & Anr. (supra) it has been held as under :-
"13. What emerges from the exposition as laid down by this Court is that by mere
suppression of material / false information regardless of the fact whether there is a
conviction or acquittal has been recorded, the employee/recruit is not to be
discharged/terminated axiomatically from service just by a stroke of pen. At the same
time, the effect of suppression of material / false information involving in a criminal
case, if any, is left for the employer to consider all the relevant facts and
circumstances available as to antecedents and keeping in view the objective criteria
and the relevant service rules into consideration, while taking appropriate Patna
High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 decision regarding continuance /
suitability of the employee into service. What has been noticed by this Court is that
mere suppression of material / false information in a given case does not mean that
the employer can arbitrarily discharge/terminate the employee from service."
(emphasis supplied)
18. In the case of Ravindra Kumar vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. (supra), it has been held as
under: -
"34. On the facts of the case and in the backdrop of the special circumstances set out
hereinabove, where does the non- disclosure of the unfortunate criminal case, (which
too ended in acquittal), stand in the scheme of things? In our opinion on the peculiar
facts of the case, we do not think it can be deemed fatal for the appellant.
Broad-brushing every non-disclosure as a disqualification, will be unjust and the
same will tantamount to being completely oblivious to the ground realities obtaining
in this great, vast and diverse country. Each case will depend on the facts and
circumstances that prevail thereon, and the court will have to take a holistic view,
based on objective criteria, with the available precedents serving as a guide. It can
never be a one Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 size fits all
scenario." (emphasis supplied).
19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Commr. of Police v. Sandeep Kumar, reported as
(2011) 4 SCC
8. We respectfully agree with the Delhi High Court that the cancellation of his candidature was
illegal, but we wish to give our own opinion in the matter. When the incident happened the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175966389/ 5
Dhannajay Kumar vs The Union Of India on 13 October, 2025
respondent must have been about 20 years of age.
At that age young people often commit indiscretions, and such indiscretions can often be condoned.
After all, youth will be youth. They are not expected to behave in as mature a manner as older
people. Hence, our approach should be to condone minor indiscretions made by young people
rather than to brand them as criminals for the rest of their lives.
9. In this connection, we may refer to the character "Jean Valjean" in Victor Hugo's novel Les
Miserables, in which for committing a minor offence of stealing a loaf of bread for his hungry family
Jean Valjean was branded as a thief for his whole life. The modern approach should be to reform a
person instead of branding him as a criminal all his life.
10. We may also here refer to the case of Welsh students mentioned by Lord Denning in his book
Due Process of Law. It appears that some students of Wales were very enthusiastic about the Welsh
language and they were upset because the radio Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025
dt.13-10-2025 programmes were being broadcast in the English language and not in Welsh. They
came up to London and invaded the High Court. They were found guilty of contempt of court and
sentenced to prison for three months by the High Court Judge. They filed an appeal before the Court
of Appeals. Allowing the appeal, Lord Denning observed:
"I come now to Mr Watkin Powell's third point. He says that the sentences were
excessive. I do not think they were excessive, at the time they were given and in the
circumstances then existing. Here was a deliberate interference with the course of
justice in a case which was no concern of theirs. It was necessary for the Judge to
show--and to show to all students everywhere--that this kind of thing cannot be
tolerated. Let students demonstrate, if they please, for the causes in which they
believe. Let them make their protests as they will. But they must do it by lawful
means and not by unlawful. If they strike at the course of justice in this land--and I
speak both for England and Wales--they strike at the roots of society itself, and they
bring down that which protects them. It is only by the maintenance of law and order
that they are privileged to be students and to study and live in peace. So let them
support the law and not strike it down. But now what is to be done? The law has been
vindicated by the sentences which the Judge passed on Wednesday of last week.
Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 He has shown that law and
order must be maintained, and will be maintained. But on this appeal, things are
changed. These students here no longer defy the law. They have appealed to this
Court and shown respect for it. They have already served a week in prison. I do not
think it necessary to keep them inside it any longer. These young people are no
ordinary criminals. There is no violence, dishonesty or vice in them. On the contrary,
there was much that we should applaud. They wish to do all they can to preserve the
Welsh language. Well may they be proud of it. It is the language of the bards--of the
poets and the singers--more melodious by far than our rough English tongue. On
high authority, it should be equal in Wales with English. They have done wrong--very
wrong--in going to the extreme they did. But, that having been shown, I think we can,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175966389/ 6
Dhannajay Kumar vs The Union Of India on 13 October, 2025
and should, show mercy on them. We should permit them to go back to their studies,
to their parents and continue the good course which they have so wrongly disturbed."
(Vide Morris v. Crown Office [(1970) 2 QB 114 : (1970) 2 WLR 792 :
(1970) 3 All ER 1079 (CA)] , QB at p.
125C-H.) In our opinion, we should display the same wisdom as displayed by Lord Denning.
11. As already observed above, youth often commits indiscretions, which are often Patna High Court
CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 condoned.
12. It is true that in the application form the respondent did not mention that he was involved in a
criminal case under Sections 325/34 IPC. Probably he did not mention this out of fear that if he did
so he would automatically be disqualified. At any event, it was not such a serious offence like
murder, dacoity or rape, and hence a more lenient view should be taken in the matter."
20. Admittedly, the petitioner was made accused in Rahui P.S. Case No. 125 of 2022 registered
under Sections 147, 148, 149, 341, 323, 337, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections
3(i)(r)/(s) of the SC & SC Act and Section 27 of the Arms Act, at the instance one of the co-villager of
the petitioner but during investigation the parties had filed a joint compromise petition and vide
order dated 08.01.2024, the learned trial Court had discharged the petitioner. The thrust of the
allegation is not of heinous nature. It appears that the petitioner had under bona fide impression
thought that the criminal case had been concluded. The petitioner thought that once compromise
petition was filed the case had ended but after joining of the petitioner into the services of the SSB,
while filling up his character verification form, the petitioner acting under wrong advise had
inadvertently not disclosed the aforesaid criminal case. In these circumstances, the declaration
Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 of the petitioner that there is no criminal
case pending against him is bona fide mistake. Further, the petitioner was appointed as Constable
(GD) in the SSB and the impact of such bona fide mistake of suppressing the pending criminal case
as well as the nature of allegation levelled in the criminal case which had ultimately been
compromised between the parties and the learned trial Court having consequently discharged the
petitioner, would not make much difference on the suitability of the petitioner for his service.
21. In view of the aforesaid peculiar facts of the present case and also the law laid down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Avatar Singh (supra), Pawan Kumar (supra) and Ravindra
Kumar (supra), I am of the view that the petitioner should not have been terminated because of the
pendency of criminal case filed by the co-villager, which was later on compromised and the
petitioner being discharged therefrom.
22. For the reasons discussed hereinabove, the impugned orders i.e. order dated 17.01.2025 passed
by the Commandant 46 Bn, SSB, Malbazar, Jalpaigudi, West Bengal whereby the service of the
petitioner was terminated from the post Constable (GD) and the order dated 28.03.2025 whereby
Patna High Court CWJC No.9540 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 the appellate authority had rejected the
appeal preferred by the petitioner are hereby set aside.

23. The Commandant 46 Bn SSB, Malbazar, West Bengal is directed to accept the joining of the
petitioner forthwith.
24. The petitioner shall be entitled to all consequential benefits, in accordance with law.
25. With the aforesaid observations and directions, this writ petition is allowed.
