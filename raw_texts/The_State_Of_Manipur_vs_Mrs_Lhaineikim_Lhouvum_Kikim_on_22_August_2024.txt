JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
JUSTICE SIDDHARTH MRIDUL, CJ:
[1] At the outset, it is considered appropriate to extract the relevant
portion of the order dated 19.07.2024 wherein this Court recorded as below:
"At the very outset, this Court informed Dr. Colin
Gonsalves, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents
that one of us (Justice A. Guneshwar Sharma) remanded the
accused when he was the then learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal
West, and enquired from him as to whether he has any objection
to this Bench in hearing these matters. He fairly concedes that he
does not have any objection."
In the circumstances, this Bench proceeded to hear the
connected appeals as well as the pending applications on the merits.
[2] Encapsulated briefly, the accused, Mr. Mark Haokip, was
arrested on 30.05.2022, in connection with FIR No. 129(05)2022 Imphal PS
under Sections 120B/121/121A/123/400 IPC and Sections 17/18 Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act [in short, UAPA] and was thereafter remanded to
judicial custody on the 09.06.2022. The accusations against him were for
waging war and attempting to wage war against India and for cessation and
creation of an independent "Government of the People's Democratic Republic
of Kukiland", in collusion with other co-accused. The accused allegedly had
started collecting funds towards this objective. Vide order dated 21.06.2022

in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 60 of 2022, the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal
West rejected the accused's bail application and the said order of rejection
was upheld by this Court, vide order dated 02.11.2022 in bail application BA
No. 11 of 2022.
[3] Thereafter, vide order dated 30.10.2022 passed in Cril. Misc.
Case No. 92 of 2022, the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West, extended
the period of investigation in relation to the subject FIR for a further period
of 90 days, in terms of the proviso to Section 43D(2) of UAPA. Finally, on
25.11.2022, the prosecution submitted the subject chargesheet against the
accused under Sections 120B/121/121A/123/400 IPC and Sections 17/18
UAPA however, with a rider that the supplementary chargesheet would be
submitted after obtaining prosecution sanction order from the competent
authority. On 28.11.2022, the Special Court registered the case as Spl. Trial
No. 10 of 2022. The competent authority granted the requisite sanction vide
two orders dated 26.12.2022 and 17.03.2023. Thereafter, the supplementary
chargesheet was also filed on 17.03.2023 and duly received by the court on
20.03.2023.
[4] On the 17.01.2023, the accused instituted the second regular
bail application, being Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 3 of 2023; and on 18.03.2023,
a default bail application, being Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 45 of 2023, under the

to be filed.
[5] Vide the common impugned order dated 28.03.2023 passed in
Cril. Misc. (B) Case Nos. 3 of 2023 and 45 of 2023, the learned Special Judge

The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
(NIA), Imphal West, was pleased to grant bail to the accused, premised solely
on the ground that, the subject chargesheet filed without obtaining the
prosecution sanction order is incomplete and the accused was consequently
entitled to default bail. The State moved applications being Cril. Misc. Case
Nos. 42 of 2023 and 43 of 2023 under Section 439(2) CrPC before learned
Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West for setting aside the common impugned
order dated 28.03.2023. Vide order dated 29.03.2023, learned Special Court
kept in abeyance the common bail order dated 28.03.2023 until further order.
The accused thereafter moved an application under Section 362 CrPC being
Cril. Misc. Case No. 61 of 2023 raising the issue of maintainability of the
aforesaid two applications filed by the State under Section 439(2) CrPC.
[6] On 29.03.2023, the State also challenged the common impugned
order dated 28.03.2023 before this Court by way of a criminal revision, being
Cril. Rev. P. No. 7 of 2023 and the same was disposed of vide order dated
22.12.2023 with a direction to the learned Special Court to decide the pending
applications filed by the State under Section 439(2) CrPC seeking cancellation
of bail on merit expeditiously within a period of 6 weeks. Consequently, vide

and 61 of 2023 holding that the applications under Section 439(2) CrPC filed
by the State for cancellation of bail granted to the accused were not
maintainable, being barred by the provisions of Section 362 CrPC. Vide order
dated 21.05.2023 in Spl. Trial No. 10 of 2022, the learned Special Judge

[7] The State approached this Court on 22.05.2024 by way of
petitions under Section 439(2) read with Section 482 CrPC being Crl. Petn.
Nos. 33 of 2024 and 34 of 2024 respectively, challenging the common
impugned order dated 28.03.2023 passed by learned Special Judge (NIA),
Imphal West in Cril. Misc. (B) Case Nos. 3 of 2023 and 45 of 2023, mainly on
the ground that the applications under Section 439(2) CrPC were
maintainable and the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West had failed to
appreciate the order dated 02.11.2022 passed by this Court, rejecting the
bail application being BA No. 11 of 2022, filed by the accused. The learned
Single Judge, vide common order dated 27.06.2024 in the said Crl. Petn. Nos.
33 of 2024 and 34 of 2024, held that the applications under Section 439(2)
read with Section 482 CrPC filed by the State were not maintainable and
further that only appeals under Section 21(4) of National Investigation
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
5
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
Agency Act, 2008 (in short, NIA Act) lay against orders granting bail.
However, vide another order dated 27.06.2024 passed by the learned Single
Judge in the said Cril. Petn. No. 35 of 2024 and MC(Cril.Petn.) No. 31 of 2024,
the common impugned bail order dated 28.03.2023 was stayed till
05.07.2024, so as to enable the learned Advocate General to file the appeals,
thereagainst.
[8] In the above circumstances, on the 29.06.2024, the State filed
two appeals under Section 21 NIA Act, 2008 being Cril. Appeal Nos. 11 of
2024 and 12 of 2024 praying inter alia for setting aside the common
impugned order dated 28.03.2023 passed by learned Special Judge (NIA),
Imphal West in Cril. Misc. (B) Case Nos. 3 of 2023 and 45 of 2024 along with
applications being MC(Cril.Appeal) Nos. 23 of 2024 and 24 of 2024 praying
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 5
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
for stay of the common impugned bail order dated 28.03.2023; and the
subsequent order dated 21.05.2024 passed in Spl. Trial No. 10 of 2022
modifying the bail conditions laid down in the common impugned bail order
dated 28.03.2023.
[9] On 01.07.2024, this Court issued notice in both the appeals as
well as the applications for stay, and the respondents who entered
appearance, sought and were granted one day's time to file reply; which was
filed on the next day, i.e., 02.07.2023. In the said reply, the respondents
questioned the maintainability of the appeals, on the ground of being barred
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
6
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
by limitation. It is stated that the common impugned order was passed on
the 28.03.2023 and the appeals filed on 29.06.2024 are therefore, hopelessly
barred by time and further that there is no provision in the NIA Act for
condoning the gross delay in filing the appeals.
[10] In this behalf, it is pertinent to note that in memo of appeals, it
has been averred by the State that, the appeals have been filed within the
period of limitation as provided under the provision of Section 21(5) of NIA
Act read with Section 470(1) & (2) CrPC. The above asseveration qua the
appeals being instituted within the time provided, has been explained as
below:
Sl. No. Date Remarks
1. 28.03.2023 Accused was released on bail.
2. 29.03.2023 Special Court kept in abeyance bail order until
further order upon applications, being Cril. Misc.
Case Nos. 42 of 2023 and 43 of 2023 under
Section 439(2) filed by the State for cancellation
of bail.
3. 20.05.2024 Special Court held that applications under Section

maintainable under Section 362 CrPC.

down in order dated 28.03.2023.
5. 27.06.2024 Single Judge observed that appeal ought to be
filed and bail order was stayed till 05.07.2024 for
filing appeal.
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :

MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
It is stated that the appeals are, in view of the above calculation,
filed within time in terms of the provisions of Section 470(1)&(2) of CrPC. If
required, it is further asserted that, the State may be permitted to file
applications seeking condonation of delay, if so warranted.
[11] On the merits, it is urged that the learned Special Judge (NIA),
Imphal West, failed to appreciate that as the subject FIR is registered under
Section 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the grant
of bail is stringently regulated, in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of National Investigation Agency v. Zahoor Ahmad
Shah Watali: (2019) 5 SCC 1 @Para 26, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that the rigour of the provision of Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, will be applicable in a case falling under the
said provision; right from the stage of registration of FIR till the conclusion
of the trial. It is contended on behalf of the State that that while granting bail
under Section 167 (2) of the CrPC, the stipulation contained in Section 43D(5)
of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 have to be considered.
[12] It is also submitted that the chargesheet filed without attaching
the sanction order is not an 'incomplete chargesheet' and hence default bail
cannot be granted after the filing of such chargesheet; and also that if the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 7
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
accused is released on bail, there is every possibility of his fleeing to a
neighbouring country.
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
8
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
[13] The accused respondent as hereinabove mentioned filed their
counter affidavit, raising the issue of maintainability of the present appeals
on the basis of the question of being barred by limitation, as provided under
Section 21(5) of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008. It is stated that
an appeal is required to be instituted by the stipulation contained in the said
provision within 30 days and that the Court cannot, in any event, condone
the delay in filing the appeal beyond 90 days. It is also vehemently argued
that provisions of the Limitation Act are not applicable in a proceeding under
the NIA Act. It is urged that the common impugned order was passed on the
28.03.2023 and the present appeals have only been filed on 29.06.2024,
which render them ex-facie, hopelessly barred by time. It is also stated that
approaching the learned Single Judge and also the learned Special Judge
(NIA), Imphal West, against the impugned order cannot be construed as
proceedings instituted under a bonafide mistake in the wrong forum. It is
submitted that as against any order passed by Special Court (NIA), only an
appeal lies under Section 21 of the NIA Act.
[14] On merits, it is stated that the subject chargesheet filed without
obtaining the sanction order cannot be termed as a complete chargesheet
and hence, the accused is, ex-debito justiciae, entitled to default bail under
Section 167 (2) of CrPC and further that in an application seeking default bail,
the severity and the gravity of the offence cannot be examined and if the
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
9
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
complete chargesheet has not been filed within the statutory period, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 8
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
accused has resultantly an indefeasible right to be enlarged on bail.
[15] Dr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel appearing for the
respondents submits that the provisions of Limitation Act will not be
applicable in the proceeding initiated in a Special Court under NIA Act in terms
of the specific provisions of Section 21 which prescribes the period of
limitation for filing an appeal against an order passed by the Special Court as
30 days and statutorily within a further period of 90 days. Learned senior
counsel reiterates that when a specific period of limitation is provided in the
special Act, the general provision for condoning the delay under the
provisions of the Limitation Act will not be applicable. Accordingly, the
provisions of Section 470 CrPC will not be applicable in a proceeding before
a court under NIA Act and the State appellant cannot claim exclusions of time
spent bonafide in the court without jurisdiction.
[16] Learned senior counsel for the respondents further draws the
attention of this Court to the chronology of events for better appreciation of
the admitted facts. In the present case, the impugned order is dated
28.03.2023 and the appeal is filed before the Division Bench only on
29.06.2024, much beyond the outer limit of 90 days as provided under
Section 21(5). It is further pointed out that approaching the learned Special
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
10
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
Court as well as the learned Single Judge by various petitions cannot be said
to be proceedings under bonafide mistake before the wrong fora.
[17] It is also stated that the provision of Section 470 CrPC, being
related to limitation, shall not be applicable for consideration of condonation
of delay under Section 21 of the NIA Act, even though other provisions of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 9
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
CrPC may be applicable in a proceeding under UAPA. Dr. Colin Gonsalves,
learned senior counsel for the respondents, consequently prays that the
appeals ought to be dismissed on the ground of limitation alone.
[18] Dr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel, also submits that
assuming for the sake of argument that the appeals are within time, the
impugned order does not suffer from any irregularity as the accused is
entitled to default bail on failure of the prosecution to submit the complete
chargesheet within the statutory period. Learned senior counsel submits that
the decision of the Gauhati High Court in the case reported as Subra Jyoti
Bharali v. Director of Enforcement (Order dated 27.10.2022), relied upon
by the learned Special Judge in the impugned order, will be binding in the
present case, as the chargesheet without the sanction order is incomplete
entitling the accused as aforestated to default bail. Reliance is also placed on
a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bikramjit Singh v.
State of Punjab: (2020) 10 SCC 616 wherein it was held that, the right
to default bail has not only become an indefeasible right under Section 167(2)
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
11
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
CrPC read with Section 43D UAPA, it is also a fundamental right under Article
21 of the Constitution; once the complete chargesheet is not filed within the
stipulated time. It is contended that, since the chargesheet filed by the
prosecution is without the sanction order, the same is an incomplete
chargesheet and as such the accused is entitled to default bail.
[19] In the alternate, Dr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel for
the respondents, would urge that in the event this Court allows the appeals,
and sets aside the impugned order, releasing the accused on default bail, the
matter may be remanded back to the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal

West, for deciding the regular bail application being Cril. Misc. (B) Case No.
3 of 2023 on its own merits. Learned senior counsel has invited our attention
to the circumstance that, by the common impugned order dated 28.03.2023,
two bail applications being Cril Misc. (B) Case No. 3 of 2023 for regular bail
and Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 45 of 2023 for default bail were disposed of by
the learned Special Judge (NIA). By the said impugned order, however, the
accused was released only on default bail, without there being any
consideration of the merits of the application for regular bail. It is submitted
that, in case the appeals are to succeed, he may be permitted to agitate all
the points available under law before the learned Special Court (NIA), Imphal
West in the application for regular bail.
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :

MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
[20] Per contra, Mr. Lenin Hijam, the learned Advocate General,
Manipur, submits that the appeals have been filed within time. In this respect,
he draws the attention of this Court to the provision of Section 16(3) of the
NIA Act, 2008 wherein, it is provided that the Special Court shall have the
powers of the Sessions Court and further that as practicable, the procedure
of Code of Criminal Procedure shall be followed in a trial before the Special
Court. The learned Advocate General would urge that while applying the
provisions of CrPC, the provisions of Section 43D of Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act, 1967, which modify the applicability of the some of the
provisions of the CrPC with respect to the remand period and the grant of
bail, have to be considered. Learned Advocate General would argue that save
and except these modifications, the provisions of CrPC will be applicable in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 11
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
proceeding before a Special Court, NIA. Accordingly, it is asseverated that
the provision of Section 470 CrPC which provide for exclusion of certain time
periods such as, time taken in in litigating bonafidely before the wrong forum,
stay granted by the Court etc., have to be deducted while calculating the
period of limitation.
[21] Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General, Manipur, submits in
this regard that, the common impugned order is dated 28.03.2023, but the
same was kept in abeyance by the learned Special Court (NIA), Imphal West
vide order dated 29.03.2024, in the application filed by the State for

13
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
modification and cancelation of the said impugned order. It is only by the
order dated 20.05.2024 that the learned Special Judge (NIA) Imphal West,
finally vacated the earlier stay order dated 29.03.2023, whilst holding that it
has no jurisdiction to pass an order for recall of the impugned order dated
28.03.2023. Thereafter, on 22.05.2024, the impugned order dated
28.03.2023 was challenged before the learned Single Judge by filing Cril.
Petition Nos. 34 and 35 of 2024 and said petitions were only decided vide
order dated 27.06.2024; wherein the learned Single Judge held that the same
were not maintainable, as only appeals under Section 21 of the NIA Act may
be preferred against the impugned order granting bail passed by the NIA
Court. Accordingly, on 29.06.2024, the present appeals have been instituted
by the State appellant.
[22] Learned Advocate General, submits that the period from
27.03.2023 (the day, learned Special Judge, (NIA) Imphal West, kept the
matter in abeyance, i.e., stay of the impugned order) to 27.06.2024 (the day
criminal petitions were disposed of by learned Single Judge as not

Learned Advocate General, Manipur, has pointed out that the appeals filed
on 29.06.2024 are therefore, within time, within the meaning of Section 470
(1) and (2) of the CrPC, as the time spent in litigating before the wrong forum
as well as the time period during which the stay granted of the impugned
order by the Court obtained; are to be excluded.
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
14
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
[23] On the merits, learned Advocate General, Manipur, draws the
attention of this Court to the recent judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of Judgebir Singh and Ors. vs. National Investigation
Agency (01.05.2023 - SC) : MANU/SC/0501/2023: 2023 INSC 472,
where the Hon'ble Supreme Court clearly and categorically held that a
chargesheet filed without prosecution sanction cannot be termed as an
incomplete chargesheet and the accused cannot claim a right to be released
on default bail for want of sanction in this circumstance. It is highlighted that
Dr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel for the respondents herein,
canvassed this very issue, albeit unsuccessfully, before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Judgebir Singh (Supra) and therefore he cannot be heard to rely
on the aforementioned decision of Gauhati High Court. In terms of the
observation made in para 43 of Judgebir Singh (Supra), it is submitted
that the impugned order passed by learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West
granting default bail only on the ground of the chargesheet being incomplete
in the absence of the sanction order, cannot be sustained in law and as such
the impugned order is devoid of merit and deserves to be set aside.

counsel for the respondents, that default bail can be granted if the
chargesheet is without any valid sanction order; the rigours of Section 43D(5)

of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, still have to be considered by the
learned Special Judge, in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in National Investigation Agency v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali:
(2019) 5 SCC 1 @Para 26 (Supra) as Section 43D of UAPA Act will be
applicable from the moment of registration of FIR till the conclusion of the
trial. Relevant Para 26 is reproduced below:
26. Be it noted that the special provision, Section 43-D of the 1967
Act, applies right from the stage of registration of FIR for the
offences under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act until the
conclusion of the trial thereof. To wit, soon after the arrest of the
accused on the basis of the FIR registered against him, but before
filing of the charge-sheet by the investigating agency; after filing
of the first charge-sheet and before the filing of the supplementary
or final charge-sheet consequent to further investigation under
Section 173(8) CrPC, until framing of the charges or after framing
of the charges by the Court and recording of evidence of key
witnesses, etc. However, once charges are framed, it would be safe
to assume that a very strong suspicion was founded upon the
materials before the Court, which prompted the Court to form a
presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients
constituting the offence alleged against the accused, to justify the
framing of charge. In that situation, the accused may have to
undertake an arduous task to satisfy the Court that despite the
framing of charge, the materials presented along with the charge-
sheet (report under Section 173 CrPC), do not make out reasonable
grounds for believing that the accusation against him is prima facie
true. Similar opinion is required to be formed by the Court whilst
considering the prayer for bail, made after filing of the first report
made under Section 173 of the Code, as in the present case.
Learned Advocate General clarifies that default bail is available only
after registration of the FIR and prior to the conclusion of the trial and hence,

directory?
(b) Whether the appeals are barred by time within the
meaning of Section 21(5) of the National Investigation
Agency Act, 2008?
(c) Whether filing of charge sheet without
prosecution sanction order is an incomplete one and hence,
the accused is entitled to default bail or not?
(d) Whether while considering the default bail
application filed under Section 167(2) CrPC, the mandatory
provisions of Section 43D(5) of Unlawful Activities

(1) In computing the period of limitation, the time during which any person has been prosecuting
with due diligence another prosecution, whether in a Court of first instance or in a Court of appeal

then, in computing the period of limitation, the period of the continuance of the injunction or order,
the day on which it was issued or made, and the day on which it was withdrawn, shall be excluded.
(3) Where notice of prosecution for an offence has been given, or where, under any law for the time

consent or sanction shall be excluded.
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024 [27] On a plain reading of the
provisions of Section 21 of NIA Act, especially sub section (5) thereof, it is clear that
the stipulation for filing of the appeal within 30 days and in no case, beyond the
period of 90 days, in any circumstances, is mandatory and the appeal must be
instituted within this time period. However, we are in agreement with the submission
of the learned Advocate General to the effect that, the provisions of Section 470 CrPC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 19
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
as regards the exclusion of time taken, such as litigation in wrong forum and period
of stay granted by court, etc., ought to be excluded from calculating the period of
limitation. This view is fortified by the specific stipulation of Section 16(3) of NIA Act
which provides for applicability of the provisions of CrPC in a trial before NIA court.
[28] On perusal of the record, we find that the common impugned order dated
28.03.2023 was kept in abeyance by the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West
until further orders, vide order dated 29.03.2023. The State also filed a criminal
revision petition being Cril. Rev. P. No. 7 of 2023 before this Court on 29.03.2023
wherein vide order dated 22.12.2022, this Court directed the learned Special Judge
(NIA), Imphal West to decide on merit the pending applications filed by the State
under Section 439(2) CrPC, seeking cancellation of bail. Accordingly, vide order
dated 20.05.2024 the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West dismissed the said
applications, as not maintainable. Thereafter, vide order dated 21.05.2024 in Spl.

MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024 10 of 2022, the conditions of bail laid
down in impugned order dated 28.03.2023 were modified by learned Special Judge
(NIA), Imphal West. On 22.05.2024 the common impugned order dated 28.03.2023
again came to be challenged by the State, before this Court by way of the said
criminal petitions, being Cril Petn. Nos. 33 of 2024 and 34 of 2024 under Section
439(2) read with Section 482 CrPC, wherein, vide order dated 27.06.2024, learned
Single Judge held that appeals ought to be filed and that revision petitions were not
maintainable. However, the learned Single Judge, vide the said order, was pleased to
stay the impugned bail order till 05.07.2024, to enable the State to prefer appeals
[29] We are of the view that, the present appeals have been filed within the period of
limitation, as first petition being Cril.Rev. P. No. 7 of 2023 was filed before this Court
on 29.03.2023 (against the impugned order dated 28.03.2023). The common
impugned order dated 28.03.2023 came to be directed to be kept in abeyance by the
learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West, vide order dated 29.03.2023 and the said
stay order was vacated only on 20.05.2024. Then the State preferred petitions under
Section 439(2) read with Section 482 CrPC against the common impugned order
dated 28.03.2023 immediately thereafter on the 22.05.2024. In pursuance to the
directions of learned Single Judge to prefer appeals vide order dated 27.06.2024, the
present appeals were filed on 29.06.2024. Therefore, in CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF
2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024 terms of the provisions of Section
470(1)&(2) CrPC, providing for exclusion of the time spent in adjudicating before the
wrong forum and the period of stay granted by the learned Special Judge (NIA),
Imphal West as well as by learned Single Judge, we hold that the appeals filed on
29.06.2024 before this Court are within the stipulated period of limitation. [30] On a
bare perusal of the common impugned order dated 28.03.2023, it is seen that the bail
applications were allowed under the provisions of Section 167(2) CrPC by holding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 20
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
that the subject chargesheet was filed without obtaining prosecution sanction order
and as such, it is an incomplete chargesheet, and resultantly, the accused is entitled
to default bail.
[31] This issue is no longer res integra and has been settled in the case of Judgebir Singh and Ors.
vs. National Investigation Agency (01.05.2023 - SC) : MANU/SC/0501/2023: 2023 INSC 472,
where Hon'ble Supreme Court held that a chargesheet filed without the prosecution sanction order
cannot be termed as an incomplete chargesheet and the accused cannot claim right to be released on
default bail for want of sanction order. It was further held that obtaining prosecution sanction is not
a part of the investigation and the same is required only for taking cognizance by the court. Relevant
para are reproduced below for clarity.
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
43. We find no merit in the principal argument canvassed on behalf of the Appellants
that a chargesheet filed without sanction is an incomplete chargesheet which could be
termed as not in consonance with Sub-section (5) of Section 173 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. It was conceded by the learned Counsel appearing for the
Appellants that the chargesheet was filed well within the statutory time period i.e.,
180 days, however, the court concerned could not have taken cognizance of such
chargesheet in the absence of the orders of sanction not being a part of such
chargesheet. Whether the sanction is required or not under a statute, is a question
that has to be considered at the time of taking cognizance of the offence and not
during inquiry or investigation.
There is a marked distinction in the stage of investigation and prosecution. The prosecution starts
when the cognizance of offence is taken. It is also to be kept in mind that cognizance is taken of the
offence and not of the offender. It cannot be said that obtaining sanction from the competent
authorities or the authorities concerned is part of investigation. Sanction is required only to enable
the court to take cognizance of the offence. The court may take cognizance of the offence after the
sanction order was produced before the court, but the moment, the final report is filed along with
the documents that may be relied on by the prosecution, then the investigation will be deemed to
have been completed. Taking cognizance is entirely different from completing the investigation. To
complete the investigation and file a final report is a duty of the investigating agency, but taking
cognizance of the offence is the power of the court. The court in a given case, may not take
cognizance of the offence for a particular period of time even after filing of the final report. In such
circumstance, the Accused concerned cannot claim their indefeasible right Under Section 167(2) of
the Code of Criminal Procedure for being released on default bail. What is contemplated Under
Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that the Magistrate or designated Court (as the
case may be) has no powers to order detention of the Accused beyond the period of 180 days or 90
days or 60 days as the case may be. If the investigation is concluded within the prescribed period, no
right accrues to the Accused concerned to be released on bail under the proviso to Section 167(2) of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 21
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
the Code of Criminal Procedure.
CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024
44. Once a final report has been filed with all the documents on which the
prosecution proposes to rely, the investigation shall be deemed to have been
completed. After completing investigation and submitting a final report to the Court,
the investigating officer can send a copy of the final report along with the evidence
collected and other materials to the sanctioning authority to enable the sanctioning
authority to apply his mind to accord sanction.
According sanction is the duty of the sanctioning authority who is not connected with the
investigation at all. In case the sanctioning authority takes some time to accord sanction, that does
not vitiate the final report filed by the investigating agency before the Court. Section 173 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure does not speak about the sanction order at all. Section 167 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure also speaks only about investigation and not about cognizance by the
Magistrate. Therefore, once a final report has been filed, that is the proof of completion of
investigation and if final report is filed within the period of 180 days or 90 days or 60 days from the
initial date of remand of Accused concerned, he cannot claim that a right has accrued to him to be
released on bail for want of filing of sanction order.
45. Section 173(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, of course, requires all the documents or the
relevant extracts thereof on which the prosecution proposes to rely on, to accompany the final
report. Sanction order cannot be brought within the category of those documents contemplated
under Clause (5) to Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The grant of sanction is
altogether a different act to be performed by the Government concerned Under Section 45 of the
UAPA.
[32] From the ratio of the Judgebir Singh (supra), it is now a settled proposition of law that,
chargesheet filed without prosecution sanction order cannot be treated as an incomplete
chargesheet so as to enable the accused to claim an indefeasible to be released on default bail. We
are concomitantly of the view that, the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West erred grossly in
holding that the subject chargesheet filed without CRIL. APPEAL NOS. 11 OF 2024 & 12 OF 2024 :
MC(CRL.A.) NOS. 23 OF 2024 & 24 OF 2024 prosecution sanction order from the
competent authority is an incomplete chargesheet and the accused is entitled to be
released on bail. The decision of Gauhati High Court, as relied by the learned Speical
Court as well as Dr. Gonsalves, can no longer be a precedent in terms of Article 141 of
the Constitution of India as the same is patently contrary to the law propounded by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Judgebir Singh (supra). In the present case, the
chargesheet without sanction order was submitted on 25.11.2022 and the default bail
application was filed only on 18.03.2023. In the circumstances, the impugned order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2865921/ 22
The State Of Manipur vs Mrs. Lhaineikim Lhouvum @ Kikim on 22 August, 2024
dated 28.03.2023 in Cril. Misc. (B) Case Nos. 3 of 2023 and 45 of 2023 releasing the
accused on default bail is contrary to law and accordingly set aside. It is further our
considered view that the default bail application under Section 167 CrPC being Cril.
Misc. (B) case NO. 45 of 2023 is not maintainable as the same was filed only on
17.03.2023 that is much after submission of the chargesheet on 25.11.2022.
However, it is clarified that the regular bail application, i.e., Cril. Misc. (B) Case Nos. 3 of 2023 filed
by the accused was not considered at all by the learned Special Court and the same is therefore
remanded back for a decision on merit in terms of the mandatory provisions of Section 43D(5) of
UAPA.
The accused is permitted to place additional facts and documents relating to subsequent events, if
any, before the Special Judge (NIA) Imphal West, and the State is also permitted to file a reply to
such new facts and documents.

appeals are allowed. The pending applications are disposed of in terms of the above
observations and directions. The interim orders are merged with the final order.
However, the last issue framed above for consideration, i.e., applicability of the
proviso to Section 43D(5) of UAPA while deciding default bail application under
Section 167(2) CrPC, is kept open to be decided in an appropriate case.
Send a copy of this order to the learned Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West, for
information and compliance, and provide copies to learned counsel appearing for the
parties.
