ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA)
Date : 02-04-2019
The present Appeal emanates from the
decision of the learned Single Judge whereby the
writ application filed by the wife of the deceased-
employee to quash an order issued by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8327197/ 1
Most. Radha Devi And Anr vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 2 April, 2019
respondent-District Magistrate whereby the claim
for grant of Super Time Scale to the husband of the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019
2/18
writ petitioner father of petitioner no. 2 has been
rejected.
2. Aggrieved by the aforementioned
order, the writ petitioner - Most. Radha Devi and
Ratan Lal son of Banwari Lal have preferred this
Intra Court Appeal on the ground that the claim of
the employee had been arbitrarily rejected and is
wholly untenable on both facts and law.
3. The facts briefly stated are as
follows:-
(i) Husband of the Appellant No.1,
Banwari Lal was appointed to the
post of Clerk at Patna Collectorate in
the year, 1958 and belonged to the
Scheduled Caste category and was
subsequently promoted to the post
of Senior Assistant in the office of
the Collectorate of the District
Magistrate, Patna.
(ii) After rendering an unblemished
service of 35 years, he retired on
28.02.1993
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8327197/ 2
Most. Radha Devi And Anr vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 2 April, 2019
without any adverse Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 remarks.
(iii) Since Banwari Lal was an employee of State of Bihar, as per the conditions, he was entitled to
three promotions during the service tenure but despite having been in service for 35 years, he was
deprived of the third level of promotion, though he had acquired sufficient seniority for inclusion of
his name for consideration for promotion to the third super selection grade available to 2.5% of the
cadre strength.
Nevertheless, the same was not made available to the appellant's late husband in spite of having all
the qualifications for grant of the same.
(iv) Aggrieved by the aforementioned denial for grant of promotion, the appellant's late husband
filed a representation before the then Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019
Collector on 12.05.1992 during the service tenure upon which the Collector directed the A.D.M.,
Patna on 04.06.1992 (vide Annexure-1) that he be given the promotion to the super selection grade
available to 2.5% of the cadre strength and his name be added in the seniority list.
(v) However, the matter drifted and no action was taken on the same and late Banwari Lal was
denied of his third level promotion to the super selection grade post and he ultimately
superannuated on 28.02.1993.
(vi) The husband of the petitioner filed C.W.J.C. No. 8820 of 1999 for grant of retiral benefits which
was disposed of in the light of the general directions reported in 1996(2) PLJR
438. The late employee Banwari Lal Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 also
preferred C.W.J.C. No. 11222 of 1999 for grant of the above noted promotion which was however,
withdrawn on 18.01.2005 with liberty to make his claim before the appropriate authority.
(vii) However, when the claim of the petitioner was not considered by the authority, another writ
application bearing C.W.J.C. No. 13218 of 2005 was filed which was dismissed by this Court on
07.09.2010 but the employee preferred an Appeal bearing L.P.A. No. 1824 of 2011 which was
dismissed but thereafter, a modification petition had been filed bearing M.J.C. No. 4688 of 2007.
However, during the pendency of the modification application, the employee Banwari Lal died and
his legal heirs, being the Appellants herein were substituted and the Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 order dated 01.08.2011 passed in L.P.A. No. 1824 was recalled and
the modification petition was disposed of with a direction that the petitioner may file a
representation before the District Magistrate, Patna which shall be decided on merit in accordance
with law within two months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of the order
(Annexure-6).
(viii) The appellants in pursuance of the aforementioned order filed a representation before the
Collector- cum-District Magistrate, Patna clearly giving details of the case and enclosing all
documents relating to promotion which included documents relating to those juniors, who had been
promoted to the said after retirement/death as a notional promotion.

Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019
(ix) However, the claim of the petitioner was once again rejected vide order dated 11.07.2013
without considering the documents of the petitioners. The case of the late employee for promotion
to the super time scale/office superintendent was rejected and non-consideration of the documents
placed by the petitioners amounted to discrimination, as the same was rejected not on account of
the fact that the case of the late employee was wanting in merit but because he had superannuated,
even though it was only notional promotion which had been sought due to death/retirement of the
husband of the appellant no.1 and father of appellant no. 2. In this context, the appellants had also
brought before the Authorities an order passed by Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018
dt.02-04-2019 this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 3680 of 1999, wherein the case of Dr. Radhey Shyam
Sharma, had been decided that promotion can be given even after retirement (Annexure-9).
However, the authorities failed to consider the representation filed by the appellants nor was any
information supplied to them under the Right to Information Act but ultimately the
respondent-District Magistrate rejected the claim of promotion to the post of office
superintendent/super time scale even notionally since 1992 vide order dated 11.07.2013. In the said
order the claim for grant of super time scale to the husband of appellant no. 1 was rejected on the
basis of pay revision for 01.01.1996.
(x) The aforementioned order dated 11.07.2013 was again challenged in Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 the said writ application and claim of the appellants was again
rejected taking note of the fact that in the counter affidavit filed by the Collector, it had been averred
that the post of super time scale became vacant only after late Banwari Lal had retired from service
and, therefore, there arose no question of discrimination as those who had been granted the benefit
of super time scale had cleared the Departmental Accounts Examination.
(xi) Consequently, the writ court failed to consider the claim of the writ applicant and his case has
also been once again rejected leading to the filing of the present Intra Court Appeal.
4. Mrs. Nivedita Nirvikar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants has strenuously
urged before this Court that time and Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 again
the case of the late employee with regard to promotion of the super time scale/office superintendent
has been ignored without considering the documents of the Appellants/petitioners and there has
been a case of gross discrimination against the late employee for the reason that even though the
case of others have been considered, the late employees claim has been rejected firstly on the basis
of retirement and now a plea has been raised that the late employee had not passed the
Departmental Examination, which is wholly wrong.
5. Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that on the one hand while the
respondent-District Magistrate rejected the claim of the late employee for grant of super time scale
on the ground that the vacancy to the post of super time scale arose only when late Banwari Lal had
retired from service but on the other hand, it has been stated stated that only those similarly
situated employees got the benefit of super time scale, who had cleared the Departmental Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 Examination though Banwari Lal had also passed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8327197/ 4
Most. Radha Devi And Anr vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 2 April, 2019
the aforesaid examination. It was thus, submitted that the District Magistrate had clearly acted
against the mandate of law and thus, warranted interference by this Court in the light of the decision
rendered by this Court in the case of Dr. Radhey Shyam vide order dated 10.11.2000 passed in
C.W.J.C. No.3680 of 1999.
6. Learned counsel further contended that the learned Single Judge has failed to appreciate that the
office of the District Magistrate at Patna Collectorate has wrongly denied the claim of the late
employee, as this Court in M.J.C. No. 4668 of 2011 vide order dated 09.05.2012 had clearly directed
the District Magistrate to consider the claim in the super time scale.
7. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants at length. The only reason why the District
Magistrate came to reconsider the claim of the late employee was on account of the order passed in
M.J.C. No. 4668 of 2011, wherein liberty had been given in L.P.A. 1824 of 2010 to re-agitate Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 his grievance before the authority. The order
which followed came to be the subject matter of C.W.J.C. No. 1994 of 2015, but on the basis of the
counter affidavit filed, which was not responded by the appellants herein, the learned Single Judge
noted the fact that there was no case of discrimination and has rejected the claim of the appellant's
late husband for the reason that he had passed the departmental examination after two employees
who were granted the super time scale. The learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that since
the stand of the State was not controverted by the writ petitioners, no relief could be granted to the
late employee and thus, dismissed the writ application for want of merit.
8. We have however, noted that the authorities in order to negate the claim of the late employee
have offered two different reasons at two different stages of the proceedings. On the earlier occasion
when the writ petitioners approached this Court, the order impugned rejecting the case of the
appellants appears to be Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 that there was no
post available as 2.5 percent of promotional posts which were to be granted to employees for grant
of super time scale was not available till the time of his superannuation and therefore, such relief as
prayed for by the writ applicants was declined. This is also evident from the order dated 07.09.2003
passed in C.W.J.C. No. 13218 of 2005 which is extracted and is quoted hereinunder.
"Learned counsel for the State based on the averments made in the counter affidavit
has stated that the benefit of time bound promotion as well as the super time scale
can only be granted depending on the seniority of the persons based on the
percentage of post available at the relevant time to the extent 2.5% with regard to
super time scale, senior selection grade and junior selection grade. Since the
petitioner did not fit in mode, the benefit has been rejected. No interference is
warranted with the decision communicated to petitioner.
This writ application is dismissed"
9. Under such circumstances, the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 prayer of
the petitioner was declined. However, in the following writ, the same prayer came to be declined for
the following reasons which is indicated in paragraph-8 of the counter affidavit filed. The same is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8327197/ 5
Most. Radha Devi And Anr vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 2 April, 2019
quoted hereinunder.
"8. That it is further submitted that for the third level promotion (which is the subject
matter of the present petition) I) The third level promotion in super time scale is to
be given to only 2.5% of the total cadre strength.
(ii_Out of 14 posts available, 2 posts are earmarked for the scheduled caste while one post is for for
the scheduled tribe under the roster system.
iii) it was already granted to the eligible employees.
iv) as such there was no vacancy in the reserved category."
10. Furthermore, it has been indicated that since the husband of the appellant had retired on
28.02.1993, on the said date, there was no vacancy in the super time scale and so far as the
allegation of grant/extension of said benefits to the similarly situated employees/junior to him are
concerned, those juniors had cleared the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019
departmental accounts examination earlier than the petitioner and they were rightly granted such
benefits. We have however, noted that such pleas were not taken in the earlier round of litigation
and the question of availability of posts was also not raised. The only ground urged at the earlier
stage was that since the employee had superannuated, there was no question of granting him
promotion. The counter affidavit further indicates that the claim of the late employee was not
considered in preference to his juniors because he had passed the departmental examination after
his juniors. However, we must note that on the date of consideration, the appellants late husband
had in fact passed the aforementioned examination thus, such a criteria that he had passed after his
juniors, could not be a sole factor for rejecting his claim as in the earlier round, seniority was the
only criteria to be considered. We are also informed at the bar that since 1992 itself, on the basis of
Resolution No. 279 dated 18.05.1991, promotion to the post of super time scale was available for 2.5
percent of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 the cadre strength in which out of
14 posts, 2 posts of scheduled castes and 1 of scheduled tribes had been granted. If that be so, the
petitioner had been in service till 1993 and his case would well have been considered during his
service tenure itself. We find that the consideration for such promotion was made only after 1993
when the petitioner had already superannuated. Thus, in a nutshell, the only reason that can be
culled out for denying the claim to the late employee is that on the date of consideration though he
had passed the departmental examination, he was not considered as his date of passing such
examination was later than that of those juniors who had been granted promotion. Such
consideration does not seem to be legally tenable, as seniority can be the only criteria and no rule
has been brought before us to show that the date of passing of departmental examination would be a
relevant consideration rather than the seniority/date of joining of the employee
11. In the result, we find that the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 rationale
adopted by the District Administration for denying the claim appears to be in the abstract rather
than based on some actual rule which renders the decision wholly erroneous. The case of the
appellant's late husband Banwari Lal was admittedly not considered on account of the fact that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8327197/ 6
Most. Radha Devi And Anr vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 2 April, 2019
though 2 posts were available, the promotions were granted to other two employees for the reason
(i) that the petitioner's late husband had superannuated (ii) that he had passed the departmental
examination after the two employees so promoted.
12. We are thus of the considered opinion that to the limited extent as indicated above, the
authorities must re-examine the case of the late employee and in case it is found that such
consideration, as has been adopted, was available to the authorities as per any circular, the order
passed could sustain. However, in the event of there being no such circular, we are of the opinion
that the case of the late employee Banwari Lal for grant of super time scale deserves a Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1128 of 2018 dt.02-04-2019 reconsideration.
13. As such, we allow the Appeal and set aside the order dated 11.07.2013 passed by the District
Magistrate, Patna and also the decision of the learned Single Judge subject to the aforementioned
observations.
