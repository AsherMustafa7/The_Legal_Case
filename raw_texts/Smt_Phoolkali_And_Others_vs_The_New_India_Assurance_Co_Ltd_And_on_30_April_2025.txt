It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the accident was occurred on account of sole
negligence of driver of truck which was insured with respondent no. 1-insurance company and there
was no negligence on the part of the deceased. The Claims Tribunal has erred in deciding issue no. 1
holding 75% negligence of truck driver and 25% of the deceased, who was driving his motorcycle at
the time of accident. The finding of the Claims Tribunal in respect of contributory negligence of the
deceased is perverse and against the evidence and material which are available on record. P.W.-2,
who was an eye witness of the accident has fully proved the rash and negligent driving of truck
driver. The respondent had not adduced any evidence in rebuttal and even the driver of the truck
was not produced by the insurance company. It is further submitted that F.I.R was also lodged
against the driver of the truck and Investigating Officer after due investigation had submitted
charge-sheet against the truck driver which also proves the rash and negligent driving of the truck
driver. The the Claims Tribunal has erred in deducting 1/3rd towards personal expenses of the
deceased, ignoring the fact that there are four dependents and deduction would be 1/4th as per
judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sarla Verma vs. Delhi Road Transport Corporation
reported in 2009(2) TAC 677 (S.C.). Lastly, it is submitted that nothing has been awarded towards
future prospects and only Rs. 15,000/- has been awarded for non pecuniary damages, where as the
claimants-appellants are entitled for 25% future prospects and Rs. 70,000/- for non pecuniary
damages in view of law laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of National Insurance Company
Ltd. vs. Pranay Sethi reported in 2017(4) T.A.C. 673.reported in 2009(2) TAC 677 (S.C.). No other
ground has been pressed by learned counsel for the appellants.
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent-Insurance Company submits
that the finding recorded by Claims Tribunal in respect of contributory negligence of the deceased is
based on material and evidence which are available on record. It was the case of head on collision
between motor-cycle and truck and as per the site plan, the deceased came wrong side and collided
with truck. It is further submitted that the age of the deceased was 45 years at the time of accident
and the Claims Tribunal has erred in applying the multiplier of 15, whereas the appropriate
multiplier would be 14 as per the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sarla Verma
(supra).
Considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
The Claims Tribunal while deciding issue no.1 has recorded the finding of contributory negligence
after considering the site plan which shows that the deceased came wrong side and collided with the
truck. It is admitted fact that it was head on collusion between truck and motorcycle. The finding
recorded by the Claims Tribunal is based on evidence and the Claims Tribunal has rightly assessed
the negligence of the deceased to the extent of 25% and there is no illegality in any manner. So far as
multiplier is concerned the Claims Tribunal had wrongly applied the multiplier of 15 whereas
appropriate multiplier would be 14 as per the judgment of of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sarla
Verma (supra). The Claims Tribunal has also erred in deducting 1/3rd toward personal expenses of
the deceased ignoring the fact that there are 4 dependents and as such deduction would be 1/4th as
per the judgment of of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case Sarla Verma(supra). The claimants-appellants
are also entitled for 25% future prospects and Rs. 70,000/- for non pecuniary damages. In absence
of any evidence in respect of income of the deceased, the Claims Tribunal has rightly accepted

notional income of Rs. 3,000/- per month.
In view of above discussion, the compensation awarded by the Claims Tribunal is reassessed as
below:-
1) Monthly income = Rs.3,000/-
2) Annual income = Rs. 3,000/- X 12= Rs.36,000/-
3) Future prospects (25%) = Rs.9,000/-
4) Total annual income = Rs.36,000/- + Rs.9,000/- =Rs.45,000/-
5) Deduction towards personal expenses(1/4th)= Rs. 45,000/ - Rs. 11,250/-= Rs.
33,750/-
6) Multiplier applicable (14) =Rs.33,750/- x 14 = Rs. 4,72,500/-
7)Deduction towards contributory negligence (25%)=Rs.4,72,500/- - Rs1,18,125/-
=Rs.3,54,375/-
8) Non pecuniary damages= Rs. 70,000/-
Total = Rs.3,54,375/- + Rs.70,000/- = Rs.4,24,375/-
The first appeal from order filed by claimants is hereby partly allowed and compensation awarded
by the Claims Tribunal is enhanced from Rs.2,85,000/- to Rs.4,24,375/-. The claimants-appellants
