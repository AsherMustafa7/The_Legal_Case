in Case Crime No. 75 of 2024 under section 376, 328, 506, I.P.C., & section 67 I.T.

that justice may be done.
And / or may be pleased to pass any other order or direction which this Hon'ble court

4. At the very outset, the learned A.G.A. submits that applicant has rushed to this Court by filing the
present application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. without availing statutory remedy available under
Section 227 Cr.P.C. Learned A.G.A. further submits that Court below can deal with the grounds
raised in support of this application threadbare at the first instance as it has the advantage of
original record. On the above premise, the learned A.G.A. submits that no interference is warranted
by this Court in present application under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
5. When confronted with above, the learned counsel for applicant could not overcome the same.
6. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State and upon perusal of
record, this Court finds that no useful purpose shall be served in keeping this application pending,
as the grounds raised by the learned counsel for applicant in support of this application can very
well be examined by Court below meticulously at the time of deciding the discharge application as
Court below has the advantage of having the original record.
7. Accordingly this application is disposed off finally with a direction to the applicant to approach
Court below by filing a discharge application in terms of Section 227 Cr.P.C. seeking his discharge in
above mentioned criminal case. In case, such a discharge application is filed by applicant within a
period of two weeks from today along with a certified copy of this order, the Court below shall
proceed to decide the same by a reasoned and speaking order within a period of two months
thereafter, provided there is no other legal impediment.
8. It goes without saying that till the disposal of discharge application as directed above, Court below
shall not proceed further with the matter.
