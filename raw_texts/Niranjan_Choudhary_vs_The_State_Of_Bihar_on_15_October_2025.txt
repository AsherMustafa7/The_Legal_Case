1. The present Writ petition is filed for the following reliefs:-
"I. To issue writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the part decision dated
14.02.2019 taken by the district selection committee in a meeting convened under the
chairmanship of the District Magistrate, Samastipur whereby Patna High Court

declared selected as public distribution system (in short PDS) dealer against the
vacancy marked for the unreserved category candidate in the Basantpur Ramani
Panchayat under the district of Samastipur. In furtherance of this it is humbly prayed
that respondents be directed to declare petitioner as selected on a vacancy in which
respondent no. 9 has been selected illegally and in dissonance to the terms of the
advertisement resulting into the deprivation of petitioner from his selection as
petitioner has been placed at serial no. 2.

II. It is further prayed that during the pendency of instant writ application the effect
and operation of decision taken by the district selection committee n its meeting date
14.02.2019 in respect of selection of PDS dealer in the unreserved category under the
panchayat Basantpur Ramani in the district Samastipur whereby respondent no. 9
has been selected be stayed.
III. To pass such other order(S) direction(S) for which petitioner is Patna High Court
CWJC No.12056 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025 entitled in the facts and circumstances of the
instant case."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision. Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the
license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of
the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the Patna High Court CWJC No.12056 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025 other party
under sub-clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12056 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4186037/ 2
Niranjan Choudhary vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within one month from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority
concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within three months from the date of filing of
the same. The authority shall also pass a Patna High Court CWJC No.12056 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
speaking order whether Rule 9(v) of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order,
2016 has been followed or not?
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
