need not be heard.
3. The instant writ petition has been filed questioning the judgment and order dated 14.05.2024
passed by the Board of Revenue, U.P. Circuit Court No. 1, Meerut in Second Appeal No. 01164 of
2019, judgment and order dated 13.05.2019 passed by the Additional Commissioner
(Administration), court no. 3, Meerut Division, Meerut in Appeal No. 02078 of 2018 as also the
judgment and order dated 30.08.2018 passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate/Assistant Collector,
1st class, District-Hapur in Suit No. RST/3475 of 2015 arising out of the proceedings under Section
176 of the U.P. Z.A.&L.R. Act.
4. It is the case of the writ petitioner that the dispute relates to partition of khasra no. 711 Minjumla
having an area of 1.1160 hectares contained in khata no. 286 situate in village Hafizpur-Ubarpur
Pargana, Tehsil and District-Hapur. The plot in question is the joint property of the petitioner and
the private respondents and they are the co-sharers. No partition has taken place and the status of
the parties is that of co-sharers. A suit no. 3475 of 2015 under Section 176 of the U.P. Z.A. & L.R. Act
was filed by Maya Devi/respondent no. 6 seeking partition of her share. In the plaint, it was alleged
that an area of 3-2-0 Bighas was purchased by the plaintiff/ respondent no. 6 vide sale deed. Like
wise, the petitioner/defendant no. 1 in the suit had purchased 1-6-10 Bighas also vide sale deed. The
plaintiff and the defendant no. 1 (petitioner herein) were in possession of the respective portions
purchased and was depicted in the plaint map by letters J, K, C, G, H, I having area 3-2-0 Bighas
and letters A, B, K, J having area 1-6-10 Bighas. The Railways acquired part of the land of khasra no.
711. According to the respondent no. 6, the acquired land by railways fell in the share purchased by
her as shown in the plaint map and the compensation for the land acquired was liable to be paid to
her, while the petitioner alleged that the land was recorded jointly in the name of the co-sharers, he
too was entitled to the compensation. It is also the case of the writ petitioner that the acquisition had
been done prior to the institution of the partition suit and in such view of the matter, the revenue
courts as also the civil court lacked the jurisdiction to deal with the partition suit. The partition suit
was initially registered as partition suit no. 76 of 2015 was dismissed vide judgment and decree on
05.08.2016. The Appeal filed against the order dated 05.08.2016 was allowed by the Commissioner
vide order dated 18.03.2017 passed in Appeal No. 61 of 2015-2016 and the matter was remitted to
the trial court for decision afresh. The trial court thereafter vide judgment and decree dated
30.08.2018 decree the suit declaring the shares of the parties. The petitioner aggrieved by the
judgment and order dated 30.08.2018 filed an appeal before the Commissioner, Meerut Division,
Meerut which was dismissed vide judgment and order dated 13.05.2019. Thereafter, the petitioner
preferred a Second Appeal before the Board of Revenue which too has been dismissed by the Board
of Revenue vide its order dated 14.05.2024.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently submitted that the impugned orders of the
revenue authorities are patently illegal inasmuch as the land in dispute had already been acquired
by the Railways and its proceedings before the Revenue Court were not maintainable. The Railways
who had acquired part of the land was necessary party but was not impleaded in the proceedings.
The impugned judgment and orders are not legally sustainable and are liable to be set aside.

6. Per contra, learned Standing Counsel as also learned counsel for the contesting respondent no. 6
submit that the impugned orders are just and proper and no fault can be found. The Authorities
have merely decided the share of the parties. Only preliminary decree was drawn determining the
shares. There is no error warranting any interference by this Court and the writ petition as framed
deserves to be dismissed.
7. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the records. From the records,
I find that the petitioner and the contesting respondents purchased parts of the khasra no. 711M
area 1.1160 hectares contained in khata no. 286 of the village concerned vide a common sale deed
dated 15.12.1989 from one Tej Pal Singh. The petitioner purchased an area of 1-6-10 (1 Bigha, 6
Biswa, 10 Biswansi) while the respondent no. 6 purchased an area (3-2-0) (3 Bighas and 2 Biswa).
The names of the petitioner and contesting respondent no. 6 was recorded in the revenue records as
joint owners. The Indian Railways vide Notification dated 11.09.2015 published in the official
Gazette of India on 16.09.2015 acquired an area of 0.2640 hectares of the gata no. 711 aforesaid
which stood recorded in the names of Mayawati (respondent no. 6), Yogendra Singh (petitioner),
Mahipal Singh and Bhagwat. The Notification has been brought on record by the petitioner by way
of supplementary affidavit. The suit for partition and determination of the shares was filed on
22.12.2015. Admittedly, the suit for partition and determination of the respective shares has been
instituted after the Notification dated 16.09.2015 acquiring part of the joint property for the
purposes of the Dedicated Fraight Corridor of the Railways. In the opinion of the Court, a partition
suit must include all joint family properties and if a portion is excluded due to acquisition the suit
may not be maintainable. All the co-sharers are liable to be included. Since the portion of land
acquired is to be excluded from the joint property pool, the partition suit must account for the
acquired land. The details of the acquired land is required to be mentioned in the partition suit as
also in what manner the compensation received or to be received for the acquired land shall be
distributed amongst the co-sharers must necessarily be stated. Further, in the opinion of the Court,
the co-ownership rights to the acquired land shall stand extinguished and consequently the suit for
partition would be barred. The compensation distribution amongst the co-owners would be
according to the respective ownership interest in the acquired land.
8. A perusal of the plaint of the partition suit filed as Annexure-6 to the writ petition in para 5 of the
plaint reveals that the petitioner had purchased an area of 1-6-10 Bighas areas of the land in dispute
while the respondent no. 6 purchased an area of 3-2-0 Bighas of the said land vide a common sale
deed. In para 6 of the plaint, it has been averred that the plaintiff and defendant no. 1 i.e. the
respondent no. 6 and petitioner had mutually partitioned the land purchased and were in
cultivatory possession over the same. The factum of mutual partition has been denied in the written
statement filed by the petitioner to the partition suit. The land in dispute is admittedly joint as is
evident from the khatauni extract brought on record as Annexure-4 to the writ petition. In para 7 of
the plaint an averment has been made that there is a proposal to acquire part of the land for laying
of Railway line which is stated to fall in the share of the respondent no. 6 (plaintiff) and the payment
of compensation is also proposed. In the opinion of the Court, the averment in the plaint appears to
be incorrect as the land for laying down the Railway Line had already been acquired prior to
institution of the partition suit, though compensation was yet to be paid.

9. A perusal of the judgment and order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Hapur dated 30.08.2018
reveals that the Sub Divisional Magistrate taking note of the fact that the plaintiff (respondent no. 6
herein) and the defendant no. 1 (petitioner herein) were not at variance to the respective shares in
the land in dispute declared the shares and directed for preparation of the preliminary decree. The
suit however was kept pending. The order has been upheld in Appeal by the Commissioner vide
order dated 13.05.2019 as also by the Board of Revenue vide order dated 14.05.2014. None of the
revenue authorities has addressed the core issue as to maintainability of the partition suit after
issuance of the Notification acquiring part of the suit land. In the opinion of the Court, the
impugned orders suffer from patent illegality for not addressing the core issue. For the reasons
recorded herein above the Court finds that the impugned orders are not sustainable and are
accordingly set aside.
10. The writ petition stands allowed.
11. Parties to bear their own cost.
