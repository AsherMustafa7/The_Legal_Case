ORDER
The petitioner has filed the present writ petition in the nature of mandamus to consider the
representation dated 27.09.2018.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner, Joseb Raj, Chief Operating
Officer, M/s.Oceanaa Biotek Industries Ltd.,Chennai, had stated that aquaculture is a thriving
industry which contributes extensively for this Nation's foreign exchange. Our Country's coastline,
which runs for more than 8000 Kms., has contributed immensely to the development of the
aquaculture industry. It is also stated that the Industry is supported by Marine Products Exports
Development Authority (MPEDA), Fist Farmers Development Agencies (FFDAs) and Brackish
Water Fish Farms Development Agencies (BFDAs). The said agencies promote freshwater and
coastal aquaculture respectively.
3. According to the petitioner, necessary suitable amendments to the Income Tax Act, 1961 are
required to be brought into effect to treat prawn hatchery and prawn farming (aquaculture) as an
agricultural activity, so that income derived from aquaculture can be exempted from levying tax.

4. In this regard, the petitioner had given a representation on 27.09.2018 to the respondents. Since
no action is forthcoming, the petitioner has come forward with the present Writ Petition.
5. The affidavit has been filed on behalf of the first respondent, wherein it has been stated that the
income derived from aquaculture does not qualify as agricultural income under the Act and it is
liable to be taxed.
1. Without going into the details mentioned in the counter affidavit, since the petitioner had sent a
representation, there is an obligation on the part of the State Officials, who have filed a counter
affidavit to pass appropriate orders on the representation made by the petitioner. Then only would
the petitioner be able to take up the issues further. Therefore, a direction is issued to the first
respondent to pass orders on the representation of the petitioner on or before 29.02.2020. The first
respondent or any other Officials deputed by the first respondent may also issue notice to the
petitioner to have a consultation with him and explain the aspects and may also examine the same.
At any rate, the first http://www.judis.nic.in respondent may consider the representation and pass
orders on merits with reasons on or before 29.02.2020.
