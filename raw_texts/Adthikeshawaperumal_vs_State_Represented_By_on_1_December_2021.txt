JUDGMENT
[Judgment of the Court was delivered by P.N.PRAKASH, J] This criminal appeal is directed against
the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 21.12.2016 passed by the learned Principal
Sessions Judge (Mahalir Court), Cuddalore, in S.C.No.143 of 2016.
2. The prosecution story runs thus:
2.1. The deceased in this case is Akash Varma, who was 4 years old at the time of his
death. Akash Varma was the son of Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] and Rajalakshmi [PW-2].
The family was living in North Street, Ramanathapuram, Virudhachalam.
Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] and Rajalakshmi [PW-2] were agricultural workers. The
appellant was the neighbour of Vaithiyalingam [PW-1]. In the evening of 07.05.2016,
Vaithiyalingam [PW-
1] did not find his son in the house and hence, he started searching for him. The news spread that
Akash Varma was missing and therefore, along with Vaithiyalingam [PW-1], Thirumal [PW-3],
Anjalai [PW-4], Muthulingam [PW-5] and Vasantha [PW-6] and other villagers started searching
for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018 child in the village.
2.2. Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] and other villagers found the appellant in a very suspicious
circumstance and when they started questioning him, he was not speaking coherently. This aroused
suspicion in their minds and therefore, they went to his house and started searching. During the
search, Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] and other villagers found a T-shirt [MO-4] of Akash Varma in the
pooja room of the appellant's house and therefore, they intensified the search. Vaithiyalingam
[PW-1] and other villagers found a stainless vessel, over which, a white dhoti [MO-2] was spread,
over which, the frame of a fan bearing the photograph of Ms.J.Jayalalithaa, the then Chief Minister
of Tamil Nadu [MO-3] was found. They opened the vessel and inside the vessel, they found the body
of Akash Varma. Therefore, Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] and others immediately took the child to the
Government Hospital, Virudhachalam, where Akash Varma was examined by Dr.Govindamurugan
[PW-8], who, in his evidence as well in the Accident Register [Ex.P4], has noted as under:

Cuddalore, Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] felt that he had died and therefore, Akash Varma
was brought back to the Government Hospital, Virudhachalam, where the body of
Akash Varma was kept in the mortuary. Thereafter, Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] gave a
written complaint [Ex.P1] narrating all these facts, based on which Paneerselvam

Adthikeshawaperumal vs State Represented By on 1 December, 2021
[PW-11], Sub-Inspector of Police, registered a case in Crime No.58 of 2016 for the
offences u/s.394, 302 and 201 IPC at 06.00 hours on 08.05.2016 and prepared the
printed First Information Report [Ex.P11], which reached the jurisdictional
Magistrate on the same day.
2.4. Investigation of the case was taken over by Tamilmaaran [PW-
12], Inspector of Police (hereinafter referred to as 'the Investigating Officer'), who went to the place
of occurrence and prepared the observation mahazar [Ex.P9] and rough sketch [Exs.P12 and P13].
From the place of occurrence, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018 the
Investigating Officer [PW-12] seized the following items under the cover of a mahazar [Ex.P10]:
(i) a round stainless vessel [MO-1]; (ii) a white dhoti [MO-2]; and (iii) a table fan
frame [MO-3].
2.5. The Investigating Officer [PW-12] went to the Government Hospital, Virudhachalam and
conducted inquest over the body of Akash Varma and the inquest report was marked as Ex.P14.
Thereafter, Dr.Rajkumar [PW-9], performed autopsy on the body of Akash Varma and issued the
postmortem certificate [Ex.P8], after receiving the Viscera Report [Ex.P6]. The injuries around the
neck showing strangulation were found during postmortem and they have been recorded in the
postmortem certificate [Ex.P8]. Dr.Rajkumar [PW-9] gave his final opinion as the cause of death,
which is as under:
'Final opinion : The deceased would appear to have died of asphyxia due to
strangulation and fracture of cervical spine.' 2.6. The appellant was arrested by the
Investigating Officer [PW-12] on 12.05.2016 and based on his confession, the police
recovered a silver https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018
waist band [MO-5] that was worn by Akash Varma.
2.7. After examining witnesses and collecting the various reports, the Investigating
Officer [PW-12] completed the investigation and filed a final report in P.R.C.No.7 of
2016 in the Court of Judicial Magistrate II, Virudhachalam, for the offences u/s.369,
379, 302 and 201 IPC, against the appellant.
2.8. On appearance of the appellant, the provisions of Section 207 Cr.P.C. were
complied with and the case was committed to the Court of Session in S.C.No.143 of
2016 and was made over to the Mahila Court (Sessions Level), Cuddalore, for trial.
The trial Court framed charges u/s.369, 379, 302 and 201 IPC against the appellant
and when questioned, the appellant pleaded 'not guilty'.
2.9. To prove the case, the prosecution examined 12 witnesses and marked 15 exhibits
and 5 material objects. When the appellant was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018 questioned u/s.313 Cr.P.C. on the incriminating
circumstances appearing against him, he denied the same, but, stated that he

returned from work only at 07.00 p.m. on that day and did not know how the body of
Akash Varma came to his house. None was examined from the side of the appellant
nor any exhibit marked.
2.10. After considering the evidence on record and hearing either side, the trial Court,
by judgment and order dated 21.12.2016 in S.C.No.143 of 2016, convicted and

the present appeal.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018
3. Heard Mr.B.Krishnamani Appukutti, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr.M.Babu Muthu
Meeran, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing for the respondent State.
4. The prosecution has proved beyond a peradventure the following facts:
(i) Akash Varma was aged 4 years at the time of his death and he was the son of
Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] and Rajalakshmi [PW-2] and the family was living in North
Street, Ramanathapuram, Virudhachalam;
(ii)the appellant was also living in the same street;
(iii)Akash Varma died on 07.05.2016 and the death was homicidal.
5. The short point that falls for consideration is, was the appellant involved in the offence.
6. The prosecution case rests on the testimonies of Vaithiyalingam [PW-1], Rajalakshmi [PW-2],
Thirumal [PW-3], Anjalai [PW-4], https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of
2018 Muthulingam [PW-5] and Vasantha [PW-6].
7. Vaithiyalingam [PW-1], in his testimony, has stated that the appellant was his neighbour, who
used to involve himself in small thefts for satisfying his liquor addiction; the appellant was involved
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189558703/ 4
Adthikeshawaperumal vs State Represented By on 1 December, 2021
in the murder of his father and was in jail for 1Â½ years and later, released; the appellant used to be
fed by everyone in the village now and then; on 07.05.2016, at 04.00 p.m., Akash Varma was
playing in front of the house of the appellant; thereafter, Akash Varma did not return home;
Muthulingam [PW-5], Vadivel [not examined] and Vasantha [PW-6] told him [PW-1] that they saw
the appellant carrying Akash Varma and going; therefore, all of them started searching for Akash
Varma; they confronted the appellant in the village and when he was questioned, he was giving
conflicting versions; therefore, they went to his house and started searching for Akash Varma;
during the search, they found the T.shirt [MO-4] of Akash Varma; near the pooja room, they found a
stainless vessel [Ftis] [MO-1], which was closed with a white dhoti, over which, a frame of a table fan
was placed; when they opened the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of
2018 dhoti, they found Akash Varma inside the vessel; he [PW-1] and others rushed Akash Varma to
the Government Hospital, Virudhachalam, where Akash Varma was examined by the doctor and was
referred for better treatment to the Government Hospital, Cuddalore; he [PW-1] has stated in the
complaint that the child was wearing a silver waist band and that was missing.
8. To a very large extent, the testimony of Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] has been corroborated by
Rajalakshmi [PW-2], Thirumal [PW-3], Anjalai [PW- 4], Muthulingam [PW-5] and Vasantha
[PW-6]. Muthulingam [PW-5] and Vasantha [PW-6] have further stated that they had seen the
appellant carrying Akash Varma and going.
9. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that had these witnesses really seen the
appellant carrying Akash Varma with him that would have been mentioned in the complaint
[Ex.P1]. The learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to the contradiction between Section
161(3) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018 Cr.P.C. statement and the
testimony of Vaithiyalingam [PW-1], inasmuch as Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] had not stated to the
police that Muthulingam [PW- 5] and Vasantha [PW-6] had seen Akash Varma being carried by the
appellant. The learned counsel also brought to the notice of this Court the copy of the Accident
Register [Ex.P4] wherein it is stated that the child was brought by his grandfather. Based on these,
learned counsel contended that Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] had not taken Akash Varma to hospital.
10. Coming to the first submission of the learned counsel with regard to the contradiction, at the
most, the testimony of Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] with regard to this aspect alone can become doubtful
and that, by itself, is not sufficient to completely disbelieve his testimony, just because, in the
complaint [Ex.P1], Vaithiyalingam [PW-1] had stated of the facts, including the fact that the
appellant was confronted by him and other villagers and when the appellant was prevaricating, they
suspected some foul play and therefore, they themselves went to the house of the appellant and
started searching. During the search of the appellant's house, the body of Akash
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018 Varma was found in a vessel
[MO-1] and his T-shirt [MO-2] was also found there.
11. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that when the appellant was not at home,
someone else would have placed the dead body of Akash Varma there. Though this argument may
superficially look appealing, yet, the appellant had not suggested to any of the witnesses that Akash
Varma was murdered by someone and the body was placed in his house. A mere explanation u/s.313
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/189558703/ 5
Adthikeshawaperumal vs State Represented By on 1 December, 2021
Cr.P.C. would not, by itself, negative the presumption u/s.106 of the Evidence Act, especially, in the
light of overwhelming evidence implicating the appellant in the offence.
12. The learned counsel also contended that the appellant had not run away but was beaten by the
villagers and was hospitalised. It is true that in the evidence of the Investigating Officer [PW-12], he
has admitted this fact. It is natural in the country side, for the villagers to get incensed when a
ghastly crime of this nature is committed and therefore, they would have
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2018 thrashed the appellant in anger,
after the body of Akash Varma was discovered in his house. This only fortifies the prosecution case
that the body of Akash Varma was found inside the house of the appellant and the appellant was not
able to satisfactorily explain as to how Akash Varma reached the vessel.
13. In view of the foregoing discussion, the impugned judgment and order of the trial Court
convicting and sentencing the appellant as stated in paragraph No.2.10 (supra), is upheld.
In the result, this Criminal Appeal is dismissed as being devoid of merits.
