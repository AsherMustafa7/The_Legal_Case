CORAM:
MR. JUSTICE D.DASH Date of Hearing : 04.01.2024 : Date of Judgment:
29.02.2024 D.Dash, J. The present Appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the A&C Act' 1996), has been filed
with the prayer to set aside the judgment dated 16.09.2019 passed by the learned
District Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar in Arbitration Petition No.38 of 2017 arising
out of the award passed by the sole Arbitrator-
{{ 2 }} Sri Bijayananda Das, Additional District Judge-cum-Special Judge, CBI,
(Retd.) in Arbitration Case No.01 of 2016.
2. Factual Matrix of the Case:-
The Respondent-Company is a private Limited Company which has a Sponge Iron
manufacturing plant in Angul. The Respondent-Company had purchased a D.G. set
for the purpose of being used in its factory. The D.G. set was insured with the
Appellant-Insurance Company. The D.G. set was carrying the insurance coverage for
one year with effect from 19.08.2013 to 18.08.2014. The policy was a "Machinery
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 1
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
Breakdown Insurance Policy". During subsistence of the policy, the D.G. set got
damaged and broke down on 05.06.2014. The Respondent-Company thus intimated
the fact to the Appellant-Insurance Company vide letter dated 06.06.2014. The
Appellant-Insurance Company instead of taking immediate action in the matter in
estimating the damages caused to the D.G. set, caused delay. On the consent of the
Appellant-Insurance Company, the Respondent-
Company took step for repairing the D.G. set with an anticipation to get the cost that would be
involved in repairing the D.G. set reimbursed from the Appellant-Insurance Company. The D.G. set
was accordingly entrusted for repairing to M/s. Garuda Power Private Ltd. at Asansol (West Bengal)
and that was within the knowledge of the Appellant- Insurance Company.
{{ 3 }} The Respondent-Company then furnished an estimate of Rs.22,11,973/- to the
Appellant-Insurance Company for payment. All required documents in support of the same were
placed with the Appellant-Insurance Company as and when they so required. The competent
Surveyor being deputed by the Appellant-Insurance Company came to inspect the damaged/broken
down D.G set in order to settle the cost/claim. The claim was, however, not settled and the
Appellant-Insurance Company went on causing delay. For such delay in settlement of the claim by
the Appellant- Insurance Company, the Respondent-Company sustained production loss. In order
to reduce the loss of production, attempt was made to complete the repairing work meeting the
expenditures by the Respondent-Company from its own funds. The Respondent-Company, however,
from time to time requested the Appellant-Insurance Company to release the claims incurred in
repairing the D.G. set, which, however, was not given immediate attention.
The Respondent-Company also incurred transportation cost to and fro for the D.G. set, travel
expenses of MSM and BLV for inspection and test over and above the cost of the repairing charges
raised by the repairing company. The Respondent-Company came to know from its Banker that a
sum of Rs.7,41,861/- has been credited to its account. The Respondent-Company then could not
follow as to how and {{ 4 }} when the Appellant-Insurance Company determined the claim with
such reduced amount and credited to the account of the Respondent-Company. The
Respondent-Company then by its letters dated 19.05.2015, 20.05.2015 and 21.05.2015 requested the
Appellant-Insurance Company to explain all the detail reasons for reduction of such huge amount
from the genuine claim advanced by the Respondent-Company. The Appellant- Insurance Company
remained silent and all those letters of the Appellant-Insurance Company were not responded to.
The Respondent-Company, therefore, finally served a reminder to the Appellant-Insurance
Company on 20.08.2015 requesting therein, at least to release the repairer's bill amount of
Rs.22,11,973/- as the repairer-Company was demanding hard to clear up its dues with interest. This
was not responded to by the Appellant-Insurance Company who sat silent over the matter. So it is
said that the Appellant-Insurance Company has violated the terms of the contract by not
discharging their contractual obligation in settling the claim of the Respondent- Company in time
and as such made the Respondent-Company suffer in various ways. The Respondent-Company,
therefore, stated that the Appellant-Insurance Company is liable to pay the damages in addition to
the claims raised. When such dispute arose between the parties, the Respondent-Company through
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 2
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
its Advocate issued notice on 19.12.2015 invoking the Clause-13 of the Conditions of Contract for
referring the {{ 5 }} matter to the sole Arbitrator for adjudication and determination of the claims of
the Respondent-Company. The Respondent-Company advanced the claims as under:-
1. Claim item No.1 For repairing charges Rs.14,70,112/-
2. Claim item No.2 For transportation cost Rs.1,10,320/-
to and fro, hiring of hydra for lifting and setting
3. Claim item No.3 For travelling expenses Rs.70,000/-
4. Claim item No.4 For hiring D.G. set Rs.31,50,000/-
from 1.9.2014 to
31.5.2015
5. Claim item No.5 For loss of profit and Rs.40,72,474/-
over head.
6. Claim item No.6 For miscellaneous Rs.75,917/-
purchases lubricant,
Engine oil and battery
Total Rs.89,49,096/-
3. On consent of the parties, Sri Bijayananda Das was appointed as the sole Arbitrator and he
entered upon the reference on 29th February, 2016 and issued notice fixing 12.03.2016 for
appearance of the parties.
4. The Appellant-Insurance Company while countering the claim advanced by the
Respondent-Company submitted that the claim statement is misconceived, untenable and liable to
be rejected. It is stated that the claims are not justified and in tune with the insurance policy and,
therefore, not arbitrable. It has been stated that the Respondent-Company as per the policy {{ 6 }}
condition is entitled to the cost incurred for repairing subject to the deductions etc. The
Respondent-Company took steps for repairing and its anticipation to the cost involved in repairing
the D.G. set is misconceived. The Appellant- Insurance Company was not aware as to where the D.G.
set had been sent for repair and no consent was sent for the purpose from M/s. Garuda Power
Private Ltd. It is stated that since there was no delay on the part of the Appellant- Insurance
Company in dealing the claims, the allegations on that score is unfounded and, therefore, the
Appellant- Insurance Company in no way responsible for the production loss, if any, suffered by the
Respondent-Company.
The Appellant-Insurance Company has stated that the sum insured for the D.G. set was
Rs.48,51,408/-, which is equal to the purchase price as per invoice dated 11.10.2008 inclusive of all
costs of transportation and other expenses. The Respondent-Company had raised a claim of
Rs.22,11,973/- and the other amounts now claimed were not the part of the claim. Lastly, as regards
the claim items, it is submitted that the claim of Rs.14,70,112/- is not payable since according to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 3
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
policy conditions, the previous amount had been paid. The transportation charges as claimed by the
Respondent- Company to the extent of Rs.1,10,320/- is not payable by the Appellant-Insurance
Company. The travelling expenses of Rs.70,000/- as per the claim laid by the Respondent-Company
{{ 7 }} is also not payable. In respect of claim amount of Rs.31,50,000/- towards hiring charges of
the D.G. set, it is said that the same is not justified. The claim towards loss and profit computed at
Rs.40,72,747/- is not known to the Appellant-Insurance Company and there is no nexus of the same
with the contract. The Appellant-Insurance Company denied its liability towards payment of
Rs.75,917/- stating it to be beyond the scope of the policy. It is thus stated that the claim raised by
the Respondent-Company for a sum of Rs.89,49,096/- is baseless.
It is further stated that the interest of Rs.13,23,976/-, litigation expenses of Rs.1,00,000/- along
with interest @18% per annum from 18.03.2016 till payment and cost etc. are not entertainable in
law. So, the Appellant-Insurance Company asserted that the claims raised by the
Respondent-Company deserve to be dismissed.
It is also stated that there is no dispute as such to refer the matter to the Arbitrator. The
Respondent-Company without any dispute much less arbitrable dispute has unnecessarily dragged
the Appellant-Insurance Company to the litigation. They state that soon after the loss was reported,
a Surveyor was deputed who visited the spot and inspected the machinery. After the repairs in the
approved workshop of the manufacturer as per the choice of Respondent-Company, the Surveyor
again examined the machinery in presence of the authorized agent of the Respondent-Company and
there was {{ 8 }} mutual assessment of the loss against the claim as payable. The report was
submitted. Thereafter, the Appellant-Insurance Company further examined the matter and making
necessary deductions as per the policy conditions such as, depreciation, policy expenses and others
and after seeking clarification from the Respondent-Company finally determined the amount
payable. Accordingly, the Appellant-Insurance Company has paid the amount as admissible strictly
in accordance with the policy conditions. The Respondent-Company did not raise any dispute at any
point of time. In the absence of any dispute as per the terms of the policy, the Appellant-Insurance
Company has stated that the Respondent-Company has frivolously filed the claim. It is further
stated that the entire claim of Rs.22,11,973/- towards the cost of repairing made by the authorized
repairer was fully and finally paid by deducting the admissible deduction as per the policy. After the
claim was settled and payment was made, the Respondent-Company out of greed sent a letter to
know the detail of the break up and thereafter issued notice to the Appellant-Insurance Company to
appoint an Arbitrator by invoking the clause in the policy as if there is a dispute when, in fact, there
is no disputes.
5. On the above case and counter case of the parties, the sole Arbitrator settled the following issues:-
(1) Whether the claims as lodged by the Claimant are arbitrable as per the policy
conditions?
{{ 9 }} (2) Whether the Claimant is entitled to the claims as per its claim statement?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 4
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
(3) Whether the claim Item Nos.2,3,4 and 7 as lodged are excepted matters to the policy agreement?
(4) Whether the Claimant is entitled to interest, if so, at what rate and from which period?
(5) Whether the Claimant is entitled to interest, if so, at what rate and from which period?
(6) Whether the Claimant is estopped from raising any claim as per claim Item No.1?
(7) Whether the Claimant is entitled to cost of arbitration and litigation expenses?
(8) Whether the Claimant is entitled to any other relief/reliefs?
6. Issue No.1 has been decided in favour of the Respondent-Company that the claims raised are
arbitrable. Rest of the issues being taken up together, after discussion of evidence, both oral and
documentary, let in by the parties and in the backdrop of the rival case/claims, the sole Arbitrator
has awarded claim of Rs.14,17,112/- for repairing charges, Rs.1,10,320/- for transportation cost etc.,
Rs.31,50,000/- for hiring charges of the D.G. set, Rs.75,970/- for cost of the lubricant, engine oil
and battery. Thus, in total the sole Arbitrator has passed the award for payment of Rs.48,06,349/-
to be paid by the Appellant-Insurance Company to the {{ 10 }} Respondent-Company. The claim on
the other heads towards the loss and profit and travelling expenses etc. have been declined. Finally,
the award runs as under:-
"In the result, I hereby direct the Respondent No.1-Insurance Company to pay an
amount of Rs.48,06,349/- (Rupees Forty-eight lacs Six thousand three hundred
forty-nine) only with 8 (eight) percent interest per annum from the date of
commencement of the present proceeding till the date of award and 12 (televe)
percent interest per annum from the date of the award till payment. The aforesaid
amount should be paid by the Respondent No.1-Insurance Company within three
months hence, failing which the Claimant Company can recover the same by taking
appropriate recourse of law."
7. The Appellant-Insurance Company then filed an application under section 34 of the A & C Act
before the learned District Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar, which came to be numbered as Arb (B)
No.238 of 2017.
The learned District Judge, upon hearing the parties and on goring through the award having
examined the same, within the scope and ambit of the provision contained under section 34 of the
Act and the settled law on the subject has dismissed the said application.
8. Hence the present Appeal under section 37 of the A & C Act is at the instance of the
Appellant-Insurance Company.

United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
9. Learned counsel for the Appellant-Insurance Company- Shree Jayasankar Mishra, submitted that
the learned Arbitrator has travelled beyond the arena of agreement by awarding Rs.31,50,000/-
towards hire charges of another D.G. set for the period by taking an erroneous view that the
agreement nowhere excludes such a course to be adopted by the Respondent-Company so as to
manage the situation till repairing of the D.G. set is made in order to prevent the loss in the
manufacturing unit. He submitted that when hiring charges is not indicated anywhere in the policy
condition and when it has been mentioned that consequential loss would not be paid, the learned
Arbitrator has committed illegality in directing for payment of hiring charges. In support of the
same, he placed reliance upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Life Insurance Corporation
of India & Another Vrs. Sunita, (2022) 1 SCC 68.
10. Next, it was submitted that when the Respondent- Company had claimed only a sum of
Rs.14,70,112/-, the learned Arbitrator has awarded far beyond that which was not permissible. The
award on the head of transportation cost and miscellaneous expenses, which is said to have been
based on the basis of the evidence available on record, is untenable.
11. Learned Arbitrator has committed grave illegality in not examining the Surveyor's report without
having said as to {{ 12 }} whether it is genuine or not in either accepting the said report on rejecting
the same. The learned Arbitrator has simply deducted the amount from the claim estimate of
Rs.22,11,973 - Rs.7,41,861= Rs.14,70,112/- on the head of repairing charges. The learned Arbitrator
when has not accepted the survey report, two courses were open, either to depute second Surveyor
or to award based on non-standard method which has not been made. In support of such
submission, he relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in Shivram Chandra Jagarnath Cold
Storage Vrs. The New India Assurance Company Ltd., (2022) 4 SCC 539.
Furthermore, it was submitted that the Respondent- Company admittedly received the amount of
Rs.7,41,861/- from the Appellant-Insurance Company. So, once the payment has been made by the
Appellant-Insurance Company and it has been utilized by the Respondent-Company that has ended
the dispute and the learned Arbitrator ought to have treated the same as full and final settlement of
the claim of the Respondent-Company.
Respondent-Company's Submission
12. Learned counsel for the Respondent-Company Mr. Amit Pattnaik submitted that this Court in
seisin of an Appeal under section 37 of the A & C Act is not permitted to undertake independent
assessment on the merit of the award by delving into the claims reappreciating the evidence on {{ 13
}} record duly evaluated by the learned Arbitrator and thereby substitute the view taken by the
learned Arbitrator by evaluating or probing the mental process by which the learned Arbitrator has
reached its conclusion. According to him, the award would show that the learned Arbitrator has
gone through the statements of the claim and counter in detail and having perused the evidence,
both oral and documentary, let in by the parties has arrived at a final view by assigning the reasons
at its level. So, the same does not fall within the grounds of challenge as made under section 44(2) of
the A & C Act. Reliance was placed on Haryana Tourism Ltd. Vrs. Kandhari Beverages Limited,
(2022) 3 SCC 237 and MMTC Vrs. Vedanta Limited, (2019) 4 SCC 163.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 6
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
13. It was next submitted that the claim awarded by the learned Arbitrator are all supported with
good reasons and when the view appears to be plausible, in the facts and circumstances of the case,
the learned Arbitrator can be said to have acted well within the scope of the agreement. Reliance was
placed on the case of Associate Builders Vrs. Delhi Development Authority, (2015) 3 SCC 49.
Furthermore the submission was made that the claim with respect to hiring charges when was not
excluded or barred or excepted under the agreement, the learned Arbitrator did commit no error at
all in allowing the claim on that head basing upon the evidence available on record as that is
consequential. The {{ 14 }} decision of the Apex Court in case of Atlanta Vrs. Union of India, (2022)
3 SCC 739 was relied upon.
14. It was submitted that the unilateral transfer of the amount by the Appellant-Insurance Company
to the account of the Respondent-Company would not tantamount to discharge of liability towards
full and final settlement of the claim under the Insurance Contract.
According to him, the decision cited by the learned counsel for the Appellant-Insurance Company in
case of Bhagabati Prasad Pawan Kumar (supra) is distinguishable since that was a case where the
cheque being given, the Company had encashed the same and utilized the money without any demur
and thereafter objection had been raised.
15. It was also submitted that the report of the Surveyor of the Insurance Company is not the
conclusive proof or evidence of unimpeachable character so to form the sole basis of the claim and,
therefore, the learned Arbitrator having given anxious, thoughts and consideration over the case and
counter case of the parties as also the evidence on record keeping in view the Surveyor's report has
undertaken the exercise of passing the award. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble
Apex Court in case of New India Assurance Company Ltd., Vrs. Pradeep Kumar, (2009) 7 SCC 787
and also a decision of this Court in case of Suryo Udyog Vrs. New India Assurance Company Ltd.,
rendered in ARBP {{ 15 }} Nos.39 and 41 of 2018, which has been refused to be interfered by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP (C) No.7688-89 of 2023.
Issues for consideration
16. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the award and materials available
on record, this Court is called upon to determine the following issues:-
(a) What is the scope of this Court's power under section 37 of the A & C Act and
additionally whether the arbitral award is in contravention of public policy of the
State under section 34(2) (b) (ii) as alleged by the Appellant-Insurance Company?
(b) Whether the Respondent-Company was precluded/estopped from raising any dispute after
having accepted the payment of the nature of so- called full and final settlement.
17. The scope of this Court's power under section 37 of the A & C Act and whether the Arbitral award
is in contravention of the public policy of the State under section 34(2)(b) (ii) of the A & C Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 7
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
1. In the present case, we are only concerned with Section 37(1)(c) which states that an appeal lies
under Section 37 from an order setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section
34 of the A& C Act.
2. It may be noted that the law laid down by the Supreme Court constricts the supervisory role of the
courts while {{ 16 }} testing the validity of an Arbitration Award. In the case of Mcdermott
International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. 1 , the Supreme Court has held as under:--
"The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the
arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few
circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the Ld. Arbitral Tribunals,
violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the Ld. Arbitral
Tribunals. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the
arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the
supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to
the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting
for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it."
18. It is now a settled position that while exercising a power under Section 34 of the A&C Act, the
arbitral award can only be confirmed or set aside, but not modified. To buttress the said position of
law, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court's recent judgment and order in NHAI v.
M. Hakeem 2, wherein the Supreme Court held that:
(2006) 11SCC 181 2021 SCC Online SC 473 {{ 17 }} "16. What is important to note is
that, far from Section 34 being in the nature of an appellate provision, it provides
only for setting aside awards on very limited grounds, such grounds being contained
in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 34. Secondly, as the marginal note of Section 34
indicates, "recourse" to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an
application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-sections (2) and (3).
"Recourse" is defined by P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Edn.) as
the enforcement or method of enforcing a right. Where the right is itself truncated,
enforcement of such truncated right can also be only limited in nature. What is clear
from a reading of the said provisions is that, given the limited grounds of challenge
under sub-sections (2) and (3), an application can only be made to set aside an
award. This becomes even clearer when we see sub-section (4) under which, on
receipt of an application under sub-section (1) of Section 34, the court may adjourn
the Section 34 proceedings and give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume
the arbitral proceedings or take such action as will eliminate the grounds for setting
aside the arbitral award. Here again, it is important to note that it is the opinion of
the Arbitral Tribunal which counts in order to eliminate the grounds for setting aside
the award, which may be indicated by the court hearing the Section 34 application.

31. Thus, there can be no doubt that given the law laid down by this Court, Section 34 of the
Arbitration Act, 1996 cannot be held to {{ 18 }} include within it a power to modify an award. The
sheet anchor of the argument of the respondents is the judgment of the learned Single Judge in
Gayatri Balaswamy [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad
6568 : (2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] . This matter arose out of a claim for damages by an employee on account
of sexual harassment at the workplace. The learned Single Judge referred to the power to modify or
correct an award under Section 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 in para 29 of the judgment.
Thereafter, a number of judgments of this Court were referred to in which awards were modified by
this Court, presumably under the powers of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
In para 34, the learned Single Judge referred to para 52 in McDermott case [McDermott
International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] and then concluded that since the
observations made in the said para were not given in answer to a pointed question as to whether the
court had the power under Section 34 to modify or vary an award, this judgment cannot be said to
have settled the answer to the question raised finally.
xxx
42. It can therefore be said that this question has now been settled finally by at least 3 decisions
[McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , [Kinnari Mullick v.
Ghanshyam Das Damani, (2018) 11 SCC 328 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 106] , [Dakshin Haryana Bijli
Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Navigant Technologies (P) Ltd., (2021) 7 SCC 657] of this Court. Even
otherwise, to state {{ 19 }} that the judicial trend appears to favour an interpretation that would read
into Section 34 a power to modify, revise or vary the award would be to ignore the previous law
contained in the 1940 Act; as also to ignore the fact that the 1996 Act was enacted based on the
Uncitral Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, 1985 which, as has been pointed out
in Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration, makes it clear that, given the limited judicial
interference on extremely limited grounds not dealing with the merits of an award, the "limited
remedy"
under Section 34 is coterminous with the "limited right", namely, either to set aside
an award or remand the matter under the circumstances mentioned in Section 34 of
the Arbitration Act, 1996.
xxx
48. Quite obviously if one were to include the power to modify an award in Section
34, one would be crossing the Lakshman Rekha and doing what, according to the
justice of a case, ought to be done. In interpreting a statutory provision, a Judge must
put himself in the shoes of Parliament and then ask whether Parliament intended this
result. Parliament very clearly intended that no power of modification of an award
exists in Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is only for Parliament to amend
the aforesaid provision in the light of the experience of the courts in the working of
the Arbitration Act, 1996, and bring it in line with other legislations the world over."

United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
Further, the Supreme Court also re-iterated the above position in National Highway {{ 20 }}
Authority of India vs. Sri P.Nagaraju @ Cheluvaiah & Anr as under:
"26. Under the scheme of the Act 1996 it would not be permissible to modify the
award passed by the learned Arbitrator to enhance or reduce the compensation based
on the material available on record in proceeding emanating from Section 34 of the
Act, 1996..."
19. It is thus amply clear that the extent of judicial scrutiny under Section 34 of the A&C Act is
limited and the scope of interference is narrow. Under Section 37, the extent of judicial scrutiny and
scope of interference is further narrower still. An appeal under Section 37 is akin to a second appeal,
the first appeal being by way of objections under Section 34. Where there are concurrent findings of
facts and law, first by the Learned Arbitral Tribunal which are then confirmed by the court while
dealing with objections under Section 34, in an appeal under Section 37, the Appellate Court should
be very cautious and loathe to interfere in the findings returned in the award by the Arbitral
Tribunal and confirmed by the court under Section
34. As laid down by the Apex Court, the supervisory role of the court in arbitration proceedings has
been kept at a minimal level and this is so because, the parties to the agreement make a conscious
decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as the parties prefer the
expediency and finality offered by it.
{{ 21 }}
20. Further, the Supreme Court in the case of UHL Power Co. Ltd. v. State of H.P.,1 recently held as
follows:
"16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on courts under Section 34 of the Arbitration
Act is fairly narrow, when it comes to the scope of an appeal under Section 37 of the
Arbitration Act, the jurisdiction of an appellate court in examining an order, setting
aside or refusing to set aside an award, is all the more circumscribed. In MMTC Ltd.
v. Vedanta Ltd. [MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd., (2019) 4 SCC 163 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ)
293] , the reasons for vesting such a limited jurisdiction on the High Court in exercise
of powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act have been explained in the
following words : (SCC pp. 166-67, para
11) "11. As far as Section 34 is concerned, the position is well-settled by now that the
Court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on
the limited ground provided under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the
public policy of India. As per the legal position clarified through decisions of this
Court prior to the amendments to the 1996 Act in 2015, a violation of Indian public
policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian law, a
violation of the interest of India, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of
patent illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the concept of the "fundamental
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 10
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
policy of Indian law" would cover compliance with statutes and judicial precedents,
adopting a judicial approach, ______________________________ 2022 SCC
Online SC 19 {{ 22 }} compliance with the principles of natural justice, and
Wednesbury [Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn.,
(1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] reasonableness. Furthermore, "patent illegality" itself has been
held to mean contravention of the substantive law of India, contravention of the 1996
Act, and contravention of the terms of the contract."
21. A similar view, as stated above, has been taken by the Supreme Court in K. Sugumar v.
Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.1, wherein it has been observed as follows:
"2. The contours of the power of the Court under Section 34 of the Act are too well
established to require any reiteration. Even a bare reading of Section 34 of the Act
indicates the highly constricted power of the civil court to interfere with an arbitral
award. The reason for this is obvious. When parties have chosen to avail an alternate
mechanism for dispute resolution, they must be left to reconcile themselves to the
wisdom of the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the court should be restricted
to the bare minimum. Interference will be justified only in cases of commission of
misconduct by the arbitrator which can find manifestation in different forms
including exercise of legal perversity by the arbitrator."
22. In the same vein, the Supreme Court in the case of Haryana Tourism Ltd. v. Kandhari Beverages
Ltd. 2 has held as follows:
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
______________________________ (2020) 12 SCC 539 2 (2020) 12 SCC 539
(2022) 3 SCC 237 {{ 23 }} "9. As per settled position of law laid down by this Court in
a catena of decisions, an award can be set aside only if the award is against the public
policy of India. The award can be set aside under Sections 34/37 of the Arbitration
Act, if the award is found to be contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality; or
(d) if it is patently illegal. None of the aforesaid exceptions shall be applicable to the
facts of the case on hand. The High Court has entered into the merits of the claim and
has decided the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act as if the High Court
was deciding the appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial
court. Thus, the High Court has exercised the jurisdiction not vested in it under
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. The impugned judgment and order [Kandhari
Beverages Ltd. v. Haryana Tourism Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine P&H 3233] passed by the
High Court is hence not sustainable."
23. More recently, the Supreme Court affirmed the above legal position in the case of Punjab State
Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd. v. Ramesh Kumar and Company 1 .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 11
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
24. In the light of the parameters, as laid down by the Apex Court, vis-a-vis the scope of judicial
intervention that the present appeal impugning the order dated 19.5.2018 passed by the learned
District Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar in Arbitration Petition No. 41 of 2016 arising
______________________________ 2021 SCC Online SC 1056 {{ 24 }} out of arbitration
award dated 8.7.2016 passed in Arbitration Case No. 1 of 2014 by the learned Ld. Arbitral Tribunal
has to be dealt with.
25. In the case of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Western Geco International Limited 1, the
Apex Court has observed that the award could be set aside if it is against the public policy of India,
that is to say, if it is contrary to:
a. fundamental policy of Indian law; or b. the interest of India; or c. justice or
morality; or d. if it is patently illegal.
After being subsequently discussed in Associate Builders v. Delhi Development
Authority the position of law was clarified and laid down succinctly by the Supreme
Court in the case of Sangyong Engg. & Construction Co.
Ltd. v. NHAI2, wherein the Apex Court has held that:
"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression "public policy of India", whether
contained in Section 34 or in Section 48, would now mean the "fundamental policy of
Indian law" as explained in paras 18 and 27 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders
v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] i.e. the fundamental policy of
Indian law would be relegated to "Renusagar"
understanding of this expression. This would necessarily mean that Western Geco [ONGC v.
Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9 ____________________________ (2014) 9 SCC 70
{{ 25 }} SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] expansion has been done away with. In short, Western
Geco [ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9 SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , as
explained in paras 28 and 29 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 :
(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , would no longer obtain, as under the guise of interfering with an award on
the ground that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the Court's intervention would
be on the merits of the award, which cannot be permitted post amendment.
However, insofar as principles of natural justice are concerned, as contained in Sections 18 and
34(2)(a)(iii) of the 1996 Act, these continue to be grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained
in para 30 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ)
204] .
35. It is important to notice that the ground for interference insofar as it concerns "interest of India"
has since been deleted, and therefore, no longer obtains. Equally, the ground for interference on the
basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be understood as a conflict with
the "most basic notions of morality or justice". This again would be in line with paras 36 to 39 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 12
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49: (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , as it is
only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the court that can be set aside on this ground.
36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic
award is contrary to the fundamental {{ 26 }} policy of Indian law, as understood in paras 18 and 27
of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , or
secondly, that such award is against basic notions of justice or morality as understood in paras 36 to
39 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] .
Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and Explanation 2 to Section 48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the
Amendment Act only so that Western Geco [ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9
SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , as understood in Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA,
(2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , and paras 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away
with.
37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are concerned, an additional ground is now available
under sub-section (2-A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015, to Section 34.
Here, there must be patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such
illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous application
of the law. In short, what is not subsumed within "the fundamental policy of Indian law", namely,
the contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by
the backdoor when it comes to setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality.
38. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation of evidence, which is what an appellate court
is permitted to do, cannot be {{ 27 }} permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on
the face of the award.
39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 :
(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , namely, a mere contravention of the substantive law of India, by itself, is
no longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. Para 42.2 of Associate Builders
[Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , however, would remain, for
if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes Section 31(3) of the 1996 Act, that
would certainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the award.
40. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amendment Act really follows what is stated in paras
42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49:
(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , namely, that the construction of the terms of a contract is
primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a
manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would; in short, that the
arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take. Also, if the arbitrator wanders
outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error
of jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground added
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 13
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
under Section 34(2-A).
41. What is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32
of Associate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] , while
no longer being a ground for challenge under "public policy of {{ 28 }} India", would certainly
amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no
evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse
and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Additionally, a finding based on
documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision
based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and
therefore, would also have to be characterised as perverse."
26. Furthermore, the law is no longer res integra and is settled that where the Ld. Arbitral Tribunal
has assessed the material and evidence placed before them in detail, the court while considering the
objections under Section 34 of the A&C Act does not sit as a court of appeal and is not expected to
re- appreciate the entire evidence and reassess the case of the parties. The jurisdiction under Section
34 is not appellate in nature and an award passed by an Arbitral Tribunal cannot be set aside on the
ground that it was erroneous. It is not open to the court to interfere with the award merely because
in the opinion of the court, another view is possible. The duty of the court in these circumstances is
to see whether the view taken by the Learned Arbitral Tribunal is a plausible view on the facts,
pleadings and evidence before the Learned Arbitral Tribunal. Even if on the assessment of material,
the court in seisin of an application under Section 34 is of the view that {{ 29 }} there are two views
possible and the Learned Arbitral Tribunal has taken one of the possible views, based on the
material before it, the court would be reluctant to interfere. The court is not to substitute its view
with that of the Learned Arbitral Tribunal, if the view taken by it is reasonable. The same has been
previously reiterated by this Court in the case of State of Orissa v. Bhagyadhar Dash1.
27. This Court has perused the statement of the claim and the counter and has carefully gone
through the arbitral award and thus would like to highlight certain facts or evidences that are placed
on record by the parties before the learned Arbitrator in course of hearing, which are as follows:-
"In view of the Machinery Breakdown Insurance Policy vide Ext.C/1, provisions have
been made for liability in case of breakdown of machineries. According to the
provision, it is the requirement of this insurance that the sum insured shall be equal
to the cost of replacement of the Insured property by new property of the same kind
and same capacity, which shall mean its replacement cost including freight, dues and
customs, duties, if any, and erection costs. From the evidence both documentary and
oral, it is clearly established that the D.G. set of the Claimant-Company has been
insured and the same was damaged during the subsistence of the said policy and
there is no dispute that the same was repaired by M/s. Garuda Power Limited,
Asansol.
As per the claim statement, the Claimant Company has claimed Rs.14,70,112/-
towards repairing charges after deducing the amount paid by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 14
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
____________________________ A.I.R 2011 S.C. 3409 {{ 30 }} the
Respondent-Insurance Company. Similarly, in Claim Item No.2, the
Claimant-Company has incurred an expenditure of Rs.1,10,320/- towards
transportation. For hiring of the D.G. set from 01.09.2014 to 31.05.2015, a sum of
Rs.31,50,000/- has been incurred by the Claimant Company. Since a new D.G. set to
fill-up the loss of the Company during absence of the original D.G. set which has been
sent for repairing. Besides the above amount, the Claimant Company has also
incurred a sum of Rs.75,917/- towards purchase of Lubricant, Engine oil and battery
which is liable for payment. In respect of Claim Item No.5, a sum of Rs.40,72,747.00
has been claimed towards loss of profit and overhead. When cost of Rs.31,50,000.00
has been claimed for hiring D.G. set from 01.09.2014 to 31.05.2015 then said amount
is not at all admissible. However, the Claimant Company has sustained loss for the
period from 05.06.2014 to 31.08.2014. As such, the claim amount of Rs.14,70,112/-
(rupees Fourteen lacs seventy thousand one hundred twelve) for Claim Item No.1,
Rs.1,10,320/- (rupees One lakh ten thousand three hundred twenty) for Claim Item
No.2, Rs.31,50,000/- (rupees Thirty-one lacs fifty thousand) for Claim Item No.4 and
Rs.75,917/- (rupees Seventy-five thousand nine hundred seventeen) for Claim Item
No.6 are justified in view of the evidence adduced both oral and documentary by both
the parties. As such the amount comes to Rs.48,06,349/- . As regards Claim amount
of Rs.40,72,747/- towards loss of profit and Rs.70,000/- towards travelling expenses,
the same are not justified and the said claims are rejected."
28. The policy is nomenclatured as 'Machinery Breakdown Insurance Policy'. It is not in dispute that
on 05.06.2014 the D.G. set got damaged around 11.10 p.m. which was {{ 31 }} immediately
intimated to the Appellant-Insurance Company on the next day, i.e., on 06.06.2014. The D.G. set
was sent to the authorized repairer M/s. Garuda Power Private Ltd., at Asansol, West Bengal on
22.06.2014. Initial payment of Rs.5,00,000/- was made and amount of Rs.22,11,973/- was quoted
towards repairing cost. On 10.08.2015, the Respondent- Company on its own paid the balance
outstanding of Rs.17,11,937/- and additional cost of Rs.60,000/- towards testing charges after which
it was allowed to take back the repaired D.G. set to the factory site. The Appellant-Insurance
Company has credited a sum of Rs.7,41,861/- to the account of the Respondent-Company.
It is the evidence of the witness examined on behalf of the Respondent-Company as C.W.1 that in
order to avoid huge production loss in between 01.09.2014 to 31.05.2015, another D.G. set was hired
from M/s. Kapany Engineering Company at Hathkhol, Bhilaai, Chhatisgarh during the period of
repair of their own D.G. set and an expenditure of Rs.31,50,000/- was incurred as also lubricant
Indian Oil etc. worth of Rs.75,917/- was used to run the said D.G. set and all these were because of
the negligence of the Appellant- Insurance Company in setting the claim. It is also his evidence that
a sum of Rs.23,320/- has been paid by the Respondent- Company towards the transportation of
damage D.G. set and {{ 32 }} an amount of Rs.60,000/- has been paid towards resting. Those have
been supported by the documents (Ext.C/1 to Ext.C/13).
29. The learned Arbitrator appears to have appreciated all those evidences, both oral and
documentary, making detail analysis of the same along with the Appellant-Insurance Company
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 15
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
defence in the light and backdrops of the terms of the agreement and has arrived at a conclusion
backed by good reasons.
It is not correct to hold that the Surveyor's report is final and binding on the learned Arbitrator. The
Apex Court very recently in case of National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Hareshwar Enterprises (P)
Ltd.1 reiterated the position that though the assessment of loss by an approved surveyor is a
prerequisite for payment or settlement of the claim, the surveyor report is not the last and final word
on the subject matter of loss. It is not that sacrosanct that it cannot be departed from. The surveyor's
report must take all details into consideration and cannot be based on surmises and conjectures.
The Arbitral Tribunal in any and all cases can apply its own mind to the material on record to arrive
at a reasonable conclusion. The same has also been observed by the High Court of Bombay in New
India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pyarelal Textile Limited2 Once it is found that the Learned Arbitrators
are not arbitrary or capricious, then they are deemed to be the last word on facts.
__________________________ 1 2021 SCC Online SC 628 2 (2013) 2 Bom CR 740 {{ 33 }}
30. It is seen in our given case that the learned Arbitrator has elaborately considered various
documents, submissions and evidence let in by the parties in respect of each head of the claim. The
learned Arbitrator has extensively gone to the evidence and evaluated the entire material before it
and has passed a reasoned and detailed speaking order. Despite the submissions advanced with
respect to the error committed by the learned Arbitrator in discarding the Surveyor's report no case
has been made to hold that the conclusion arrived at by the learned Arbitrator is perverse and illegal
rather it appears that the learned Arbitrator has taken a plausible view in this matter. The arbitral
award is not liable to be set aside on this ground especially having noted that the learned Arbitrator
has considered all the evidence put forth by the parties.
The Hon'ble Apex Court in case of P.R. Shah Shares & Stock Broker (P) Ltd. v. B.H.H. Securities (P)
Ltd.1 has held that a Court does not sit in appeal over the award of an Arbitrator by re-assessing or
re-appreciating the evidence. An award can be challenged only on the grounds mentioned in Section
34(2) of the Act and in absence of any such ground, it is not possible to re-examine the facts to find
out whether a different decision can be arrived at. This view was relied on by the High Court of Delhi
in M/S Pragya Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Cosmo Ferrites Ltd.2 and was re-iterated by Apex Court
____________________________ (2012) 1 SCC 594 2021 SCC OnLine Del 3428 {{ 34 }} in
Swan Gold Mining Ltd. v. Hindustan Copper Ltd.1.The Appellant-Insurer Company has merely
averred that the award is in violation of the public policy of India without specifically substantiating
the same. In light of the aforesaid facts, and the Appellant-Insurer Company's inability to
substantiate it's case, this Court is of the view that there is no apparent violation of any terms of
public policy in the present case, much less any patent illegality, given how it is quite evident for this
Court to follow the basis on which the Learned Arbitrator has arrived at its conclusions.
31. Coming to the attack of the Appellant-Insurance Company that the Respondent-Company is
estopped from raising any dispute after acceptance of the payment of the nature of so-called full and
final settlement, it is now the well settled law that the acceptance of such a payment is not a bar to
the Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate upon a dispute arising out of the quantum of such payment. It
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23123363/ 16
United India Insurance vs M/S. Ganesh Sponge Pvt. Ltd on 29 February, 2024
has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of National Insurance Company Vrs. Boghara
Polyfab Pvt. Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267 that even in the case of issuance of full and final
discharge/settlement voucher/no-dues certificate, the arbitrator or Court can go into the question
whether the liability has been satisfied or not. This principle has been consistently followed in
several decisions, including Chairman and Managing Director, NTPC Ltd. v. Reshmi Constructions,
Builders and Contract, R.L. __________________________ (2015)5 SCC 739 {{ 35 }} Kalathia
& Co. v. State of Gujarat2 and Ambica Construction v. Union of India.
32. The issue in the case at hand has been adequately dealt by the learned Arbitrator keeping in view
the evidence available on record. In the instant case, it was one unilateral transfer of funds to the
account of the Respondent-Company without their knowledge which has been subsequently
objected to and dispute has been raised.
Therefore, in the light of the forgoing discussions, keeping in view the settled principles of law and
for the reasons given above, this Court is of the considered view that the learned Arbitrator acted
well within its jurisdiction and in conformity with law and, therefore, the award passed is thus well
in order, which has rightly been refused to be set aside by the learned District Judge in seisin of an
application under section 34 of the A & C Act.
33. Resultantly, the award of Rs.48,063,49/- with pendente lite interest @ 8% per annum and post
award simple interest @ 12% per annum in favour of the Respondent -Company till actual payment
as held under the arbitral award dated 09.06.2017 is upheld. The Respondent-Company is directed
to make the payment without any further delay.
Accordingly, the Appeal (ARBA No.36 of 2019) stands dismissed. There shall, however, be no order
as to cost.
