Kathua vide which cognizance has been taken against the petitioner and proforma respondent No.2

of the court, as the said complaint has been filed by respondent No.1 to cause undue inconvenience
and harassment to the petitioner out of spite and ill will;

(vi) that a bare perusal of the Criminal Complaint transpires that petitioner did not
make any imputation against the respondent No.1 intending to harm his reputation,
petitioner did not use any defamatory words against the respondent No.1, petitioner
being the editor-in-chief of the "Alert India News House Private Limited" was only
discharging his professional duties, respondent No.2 spoke to the petitioner on his
portal ventilating his grievances against the lack of proper medical facilities in A.K.
Gupta Hospital Kathua due to which nephew of the respondent No.2 lost his life,
prima-facie there is no defamatory words used by respondent no.2, even the
ingredients of section 500 IPC remain unfulfilled, the allegations made in the
complaint are so absurd and mherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent
person can even draw a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding
against the petitioner;
(vii) that the mode and manner in which the impugned criminal proceedings are
initiated, method of encing 5 the petitioner Which i iS 'undoubtedly an n attack on
the "freedom of press" which is often referred to as the "fourth pillar" of democracy,:
and. freedom: of the press is vital for the functioning of any democratic country like
India, such 'criminal complaints against the repo: Tet iming his professional duty is ~
abuse of process of law. es ing the objections to the petition, has cord sought the
dismissal of the petition and confirmation/affirmation of impug ned order dated
11-08- 2021 rendered by the trial Court of Ld, CIM Anr" u/ss 500/504/506/34 nee
the arate order is speaking one which has been passed by the trial court after going
through the contents of criminal complaint, preliminary statement of complaint
(respondent No.1) and statements of his two (2) witnesses namely S. Mohinder Singh
& Jang Bahadur recorded on oath, alongwith documents and also the pen drive
containing defamatory video clip dated 14-05-2021. It is contended, that the trial
court after being prima-facie satisfied has issued process against the petitioner and
proforma respondent No.2 u/s 500/34 IPC which does not warrant any interference
from this court, petitioner who claims to be a journalist has lost sight of norms of
journalistic conduct (edition 2020) framed by the press Council of India for
regulating the working and conduct of the journalists, petitioner _aired_a news item
on 14-05-2021 in his news portal containing defamatory video leveling unfounded
allegations against respondent No.1 who is running a private Hospital at Kalibari
Kathua for the last 26 years, petitioner before airing the offending/defamatory video
was required to adhere to pre-publication verification and was also under_an
obligation to adhere to the guidelines on reporting of COVID-19 and all this was not
done intentionally/deliberately by the petitioner to tarnish the image of respondent
No.1 and his hospital. It is moreso contended, that the defamatory video spread like
wild fire not only in District Kathua but throughout the UT of J&K and other parts of
the country, proforma respondent No.2 used openly the defamatory words against
respondent No.1 like "...yeh sab fraud hai, yeh lootane ka hospital hai, ek raat ka 40
ya 45 hazaar humse liya gya, subah jawaab de diya, yeh loot nehi to aur kya hai, jitney

being: a Joumalist was under an respondent No'sng intentionally/ malafidely 'did not
as and completely one sided version was shared with the public which damaged the
reputation of the respondent No.1 beyond repair, after the airing of defamatory video
dated 14-05-2021 respondent No.1 even served a legal notice dated 25-06-2021 upon
the petitioner as well as proforma respondent No. 2 requiring them to compensate
him to the tune of Rs. 1 corer each, but after receipt of the said legal notice petitioner
did not deem it proper to seek clarification of respondent No.1 nor did he verify the
contents/allegations contained in the video from subjective experts, this
unprofessional approach/conduct of petitioner is "yellow journalism" on his part
which has tarnished the image of respondent No.1 as the petitioner has thorn to
winds the journalistic ethics and without verifying and ascertaining the facts, aired
the defamatory news in his news portal, as proforma respondent No.2 leveled
serious, unfounded, baseless, frivolous and defamatory allegations in his interview
recorded on the news portal of petitioner which was aired on 14.05.2021, the
defamatory news item has caused irresponsible loss to the respondent No.1, the
conduct of petitioner is unbecoming of member of fourth pillar of democracy. It is
contended, that for the purpose of preserving the Freedom of Press, Parliament has
enacted Press Council Act 1978 for maintaining and improving the Standards of
Newspapers and News Agencies in India, the Press Council of India has updated and
revised the addition of norms of Journalistic Conduct 2020 under the caption
"Caution Against Defamatory Writings" which clearly provide that the newspapers
should not publish anything which is manifestly defamatory or libelous against any
individual/organization unless after due care and verification and after obtaining the
version of by the Govt and its functionaries so long as he does not incite 'people to
violence against the Govt 4 sstablishment by law or 'itheintention of cr eating public
disorder, in the case in hand the aforesaid news item was aired on 14-
05-2021 on news portal of petitioner's Web News Channel, so far as it does not incite the people to
indulge in violence against the Govt., the airing of the said news item by the petitioner on his News
Portal is no offence. It is argued, that the application of mind by the Presiding Officer of the Court to
the relevant issue must be sufficiently indicated in the order, in the case in hand, the perusal of
impugned order dated 11-08-2021 passed by Ld. CJM Kathua taking cognizance of offence u/s
500/34 IPC against petitioner and respondent No.2 depicts that the trial Court has not even framed
an opinion as to whether the allegations in the complaint would constitute an offence, which
indicates that there are no satisfactory grounds for issuance of process against petitioner and
respondent No.2, Ld. CJM Kathua has not applied his mind to the facts of the case and the law
governing the issue, there must be sufficient indication in the order passed by the trial Court that he
is satisfied that the allegations in the complaint constitute the offence, the contents of complaint and
the statements of the complainant and his 2 witnesses recorded on oath u/s 200 Cr.pe do not
constitute any offence against petitioner and respondent No.2, therefore, the complaint as well as
the impugned order require it's outright rejection and dismissal. To support his arguments, Ld.
Counsel has relied upon the rulings reported in, @) 2021 Legal Eagle (SC) 292 [Vinod Dua Versus

contents of complaint and perusal of statements of complainant and his two
witnesses as well as the pen drive, has prima-facie come to the conclusion that the
allegations against petitioner and respondent No.2 come within the definition of
defamation u/s 499 IPC, and has accordingly taken cognizance of the matter. It is
moreso argued, that it is open for petitioner and respondent No.2 to raise all the
available contentions in their defense before the trial court to test the correctness of
the contents of defamatory article, at the stage of taking cognizance only application
of mind of the Magistrate is a relevant factor, although no formal or speaking or

for commission of offences u/ss 500/504/506 r/w 34 IPC for the allegations, "that
complamant Dr. Adeep Kumar Gupta is running a very prestigious Multi Specialty
Hospital at Kathua as proprietor thereof under the name and style of "M/S Gupta
Hospital & Research Centre Kalibari Kathua" which is catering to the ailing
community of Kathua, Udhampur, Samba and adjoining residents of District
Pathankot (Punjab) providing quality health care at modest rate; that on 12-05-2021
one Deepak Raj S/O Sh. Tarseem Lal R/O Chhan Lal Din Tehsil Marheen District
Kathua was admitted_as patient in a serious condition being Covid-19 patient in the
aforesaid Hospital but he expired in GMC Hospital Kathua and subsequently, on
14-05-2021 respondent No.2 spoke to the petitioner_on his portal Alert India News
defamatory words accusing the complainant (respondent No.1) of charging hefty
amount of Rs. 40-45 thousands and running a racket of selling kidneys/organs
trafficking'. The Ld. Trial Court of CJM Kathua on the complaint of respondent No.1
found prima-facie case against accused persons (petitioner & respondent No.2) and
therefore issued process against them for commission of offence of defamation u/s
500/34 IPC.
. Chapter XV Cr.PC deals with "COMPLAINTS TO MAGISTRATE". U/s 200 Cr.PC,

examination shall be reduced into writing and shall be signed by the complainant and

This question has arisen in the background of impugned order passed by Ld. CIM

9. According to Ld. Counsel for petitioner the complaint filed by first nctionaries, petitioner being a
journalist is entitled the protection, hence, the petitioner is not Hable | to be called by the trial court
to defend the criminal proceedings against him In 2021 Legal Eagle (SC) 292, [Vinod Dua Versus
Union of. India & rs. | relied by. Ld. Counsel for petitioner, Hon'ble Suprem 'Court while quashing
FIR No.5 dated. 06-05-2020 registered with police station Kunarsain District Shimla (Him.
Pradesh) against the petitioner a journalist by profession and observing that a Journalist is entitled
to protection so long his criticism/comment against the Govt. and it's functionaries does not incite
violence in paras 43,44,45& 67 of the judgment held as under:-
43. The Principles culled out in paragraph 33 hereinabove from the decision of Court
in Kedar Nath Singh show that a citizen has a right to criticize or comment upon the
measures undertaken by the Government and its functionaries, so long as he does not
incite people to violence against the Government established by law or with the
intention of creating public disorder; and that it is only when the words or
expressions have pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or
disturbance of law and order that Sections 124A and 505 of the [PC3 must step in.
In our view, the statements by the petitioner as mentioned hereinabove, if read in the light of the
principles emanating from the decision in Kedar Nath Singh2 and agaist the backdrop of the
circumstances when they were made, can at best be termed as expression of disapprobation of
actions of the Government and its functionaries so that prevailing situation could be addressed
quickly and efficiently. They were certainly not made with the intent to incite people or showed
tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. The petitioner was
within the permissible limits laid down in the decision of this Writ Petition (Criminal) No.154 of
2020 Vinod Dua vs. Union of India & Ors.
Court in Kedar Nath Singh. It may be that certain factual details in the 3rd statement regarding the
date when the ban came into effect were not completely correct. However, considering the drift of
the entire talk show and all the statements put together it cannot be said that the petitioner crossed
the limits set out in the decision of this Court in Kedar Nath Singh.

Arun Trishalage 50 Years vs S/O Chuni Lal R/O on 22 May, 2023
44, We are, therefore, of the firm view that the prosecution of the petitioner for the offences
punishable under Sections 124A and 505 (1) (b) of the IPC3 would be unjust. Those offences, going
by the allegations in the FIR and other attending circumstances, are not made out at all and | any
proseoution in respect thereof would be by the person aggrieved. Without in our view, there is
nothing Court rt only upon a comp going into such technica ities, defamatory in the statements
made by the petitioner. :
_ Farther, the statements of 'the. petitioner would be covered by the .$econd and
third exceptions to Section 499 of the [PC3.dn some of the cases Writ Petition. a Aina
No. 134 of 2020. Vinod | Du and S, eho .
ev Sy: Another 63, relying on exceptions to Section 499 of the "1PC3, the criminal
proceeding initiated against the accused were quashed. Thus, the instant
proceedings, in so far as Section 501 IPC3 is concerned, also deserve to be quashed.
67. As per the guidelines issued by this Court, the public servant can be arrested after
approval by the appointing authority and that of a non-public servant after the
approval of SSP. The reasons so recorded have to be considered by the Magistrate for
permitting further detention. In case of approval has not been granted, this exercise
has not been undertaken. When the offence is registered under the 1989 Act, the law
should take its course no additional fetters are Writ Petition (Criminal) No.154 of
2020 Vinod Dua vs. Union of India & Ors. called for on arrest whether in case of a
public servant or non-
public servant. Even otherwise, as we have not approved the approval of arrest by appointing
authority/SSP, the direction to record reasons and scrutiny by the Magistrate consequently stands
nullified.
Ratio of the judgment (Supra) makes the legal proposition abundantly clear, that mere criticism
upon the measures taken by the Govt. does not constitute an offence. In the case law (Supra)
petitioner was charged for commission of offences of sedition and spreading rumor u/ss 124A/505
IPC with intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order in his show namely
the Vinod Dua Show on YouTube dated 30 March 2020 telecasted only for 5 minutes & 9 seconds
video by stating unfounded and bizarre allegations against the Prime Minister Narinder Modi to the
effect that he has used death and terror attacks to garner votes. Hon'ble Supreme Court quashed
FIR No. 53 dated 06-05-2020 registered against petitioner Vinod Dua for the reasons that the
expression made by the petitioner against the actions of Govt. were not made with intention to incite
people to resort to violence. Ratio of the jadgment (Supra) is distinguishable and inapplicable to the
facts of the case in hand. In the case in hand, the allegations agains! private respondent No.1 'who |

under S. 482.
4, In the instant case, we are called upon to decide the scope of the 'opinion of
Magistrate' on sufficient ground for proceeding to issue process to the accused. The
question has arisen in the background of an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Srinagar on 03.04.2007 on a complaint filed by the first respondent
herein under Section 500 of Ranbir Penal Code, 1932 [Section 500 the Indian Penal
Code (45 of 1860)]. The operative portion of the order reads as follows:
"Perused the complaint, and the statements recorded. In the first instance of
proceedings, let bail warrant to the tune of Rs.15,000/- be issued against the alleged
accused persons, with direction to accused persons to cause their appearance before
this court on 22.4.07, to answer the material questions."
9, In Pepsi Foods Limited v. Special Judicial Magistrate and othersl, this Court has held that
exercise under Section 204 of Cr.PC of summoning an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter
and that the process of criminal law cannot be set into motion in a mechanical manner. It was also
held that the order of the Magistrate summoning the accused must reflect that he has applied his ore
to. the: facts: of the case and the law governing the J ust ref lect that he has applied his mind to the
facts. of the case and the law applicable thereto. He has to examine the nature of allegations made i
in the complaint | and the evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof and would that be
sufficient for the € complainant to succee di in n bringing questions to the ® complainant and his
witnesses | to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the allegations or otherwise and then
examine if any offence is prima facie committed by all or any of the accused."
16. In Jagdish Ram v. State of Rajasthan and another10, the law was restated holding that at the
stage of issuing process to the accused, the Magistrate is not required to record reasons. However,
he has to be satisfied that there is sufficient ground for proceeding and such satisfaction is not
whether there is sufficient ground for conviction. To quote: (SCC p. 436, para 10) "10. ... The taking
of cognizance of the offence is an area exclusively within the domain of a Magistrate. At this stage,
the Magistrate has to be satisfied whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether
there is sufficient ground for conviction. Whether the evidence is adequate for supporting the
conviction, can be determined only at the trial and not at the stage of inquiry. At the stage of issuing

the process to the accused, the Magistrate is not required to record reasons."
17. In Chief Enforcement Officer v. Videocon International Limited and others, this Court held that
taking cognizance has no esoteric or mystic significance in criminal law and it connotes that a
judicial notice is taken of an offence, after application of mind. To quote:
(SCC p. 499, paras 19-20) "19, The expression "cognizance" has not been defined in
the Code. But the word (cognizance) is of indefinite import. It has no esoteric or
mystic significance in criminal law. It merely means "become aware of" and when
used with reference to a court or a Judge, it connotes "to take notice of judicially". It
indicates the point when a court or a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence
with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of such offence said to have been
committed by someone.
20. "Taking cognizance" does not involve any formal action, of .anyekind..dt.occurs
as soon as a Magistrate plies his mung to the _Puspecigd commission of an "crithinal
proceedings. Taking of cognize ice is thus a sine quar non oF t Condition precedent
for r holding a valid circumstis application can be laid down as to when a Magistrate
can be said to have taken cognizance."

: and he is only to be prima meer whether there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the
accused."
20. The extensive reference to the case law would clearly show that cognizance of an offence on
complaint is taken for the purpose of issuing process to the accused. Since it is a process of taking
judicial notice of certain facts which constitute an offence, there has to be application of mind as to
whether the allegations in the complaint, when considered along with the statements recorded or
the inquiry conducted thereon, would constitute violation of law so as to call a person to appear
before the criminal court. It is not a mechanical process or matter of course. As held by this Court in
Pepsi Foods Limited (supra), to set in motion the process of criminal law against a person is a
Serious matter.
22. The steps taken by the Magistrate under Section 19001) (a) of Cr.PC followed by Section 204 of
Cr.PC should reflect that the Magistrate has applied his mind to the facts and the statements and he
is satisfied that there is ground for proceeding further in the matter by asking the person against
whom the violation of law is alleged, to appear before the court. The satisfaction on the ground for
proceeding would mean that the facts alleged in the complaint would constitute an offence, and
when considered along with the statements recorded, would, prima-facie, make the accused
answerable before the court. No doubt, no formal order or a speaking order is required to be passed
at that stage. The Code of Criminal Procedure requires speaking order to be passed under Section
203 of Cr.PC when the complaint is dismissed and that too the reasons need to be stated only

briefly. In other words, the Magistrate is not to act as a post office in taking cognizance of each and
every complaint filed before him and issue process as a matter of course. There must be sufficient
indication in the order passed by the Magistrate that he is satisfied that the allegations in the
complaint constitute an offence and when considered along with the statements recorded and the
result of inquiry or report of investigation under Section 202 of Cr. PC. if ADYscd answerable before

cannot be appreciated. The further contention that without application of mind, the process will not
be issued cannot also be appreciated. Though no formal or speaking or reasoned orders are required
at the stage of Section 190/204 Cr.PC, there must be sufficient indication on the application of mind
by the Magistrate to the facts constituting commission of an offence and the statements recorded
under Section 200 of Cr.PC so as to proceed against the offender. No doubt, the High Court is right
in holding that the veracity of the allegations is a question of evidence. Question is not about
veracity of the allegations; but whether the respondents are answerable at all before the criminal
court. There is no indication in that regard in the order passed by the learned Magistrate.

Allahabad & quashing the complaint filed against the petitioner u/s 7/16 of Prevention of Food
Alteration Act, in para 28 of the judgment held as under:-
28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter.
Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a matter of course. It is not that the complainant has to
bring only two witnesses to support his allegations in the complaint to have the criminal law set into
motion. The order of the Magistrate summoning the accused must reflect that he has applied his
mind to the facts of the case and law applicable thereto. He has examine the nature of allegations
made in the complaint and the evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof and would
that be sufficient for the complainant to succeed in bringing charge home to the accused. It is not
that the Magistrate is a silent spectator at the time of recording the preliminary evidence before
summoning of the accused. The Magistrate has to carefully scrutinize the evidence es f pa questions
to the charges 40-50 thousand per petitioner being a journalist was under an obligation to adhere
the norms of journalistic conduct however petitioner did not verify the content/allegations
contained in the video and aired the aforesaid defamatory news, the trial court has considered the
entire material and was satisfied about the prima- facie commission of offence by petitioner and

cognizance of the complaint filed by respondent No.1 and issuing process against petitioner and

"13. As regards the allegations made against the appellant in the complaint filed in
the Court of Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, at Nasik, on a reading of the complaint we
do not think that will be justified at this stage to quash that complaint. It is not the
province of this Court to appreciate at this stage the evidence or scope of and
meaning of the statement. Certain allegations came to be made but whether these
allegations do constitute defamation of the Marwari community as a business class
and whether the appellant had intention to cite as an instance of general feeling
among the community and whether the context in which the said statement came to
be made, as is sought t to > be argued d by the learned Senior Counsel for the

66. Let me make myself very clear that any observations, touching the merits of the
case are purely for the purpose of deciding the question whether the complaint and
the order of the process should be quashed at this stage and none of the observations
made by this Court on the merits if any be construed as an expression and the final
opinion in the main matter.

permissible defenses are open to be taken by the petitioners before the trial court and
short notice of even 10 to 15 hours for threatening the complainant to answer the
questionnaire failing which its defamatory material would be made public should not
be given.
Ratio of the judgment (Supra) relied by Ld. Counsel for respondent No.1 makes it
manifestly clear, that when a Magistrate prima facie comes to the conclusion that the
allegations in the complaint within the definition of defamation under Section 499
IPC are made out, he could take cognizance of the matter, and at the stage of writ
Jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the complaint of which
the Magistrate has taken cognizance should not be quashed.

offence u/s 500/34 IPC against petitioner and respondent No.2 in case titled Dr.
Adeep Kumar Gupta vs. Arun Trishal & Ors. for issuance of process for securing
attendance of petitioner and respondent No.2. I am of the considered opinion, that
the trial court after perusal of the complaint, statements of the complainant and his
two witnesses namely, S. Mohinder Singh and Jang Bahadur recorded on oath,
coupled with the pen-drive verified containing video clips dated 14-05-2021, has
applied it's mind, satisfied itself that the allegations in the complaint constitute an
offence indicating sufficient ground for taking cognizance of the offence of
defamation u/s 500/34 IPC against petitioner and respondent No.2. Therefore, the
Trial Court of Ld. CIM Kathua vide its impugned order dated 11-08-2021 has rightly
proceeded against the accused persons (petitioner & respondent No2) in terms of
Section 204(1) Cr.PC. I do not find any legal justification to interfere with the
reasoned order passed by the trial court which does not suffer from any illegality,
perversity or patient error. The arguments canvassed by Ld. Counsel for petitioner
seeking quashment of aforementioned criminal complaint alongwith impugned order
dated 11-08-2021, being legally unsustainable, are repelled, rejected and discarded.
The petition is, therefore, disallowed, rejected and out rightly dismissed.
12. Disposed off accordingly alongwith all connected CMPs.
