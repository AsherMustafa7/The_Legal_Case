Revenue Code, 2006, which is pending since 10.9.2024 and decide the same

declaration of rights should preferably be decided by the revenue court concerned within a period of
one year from the date of filing of the same, however, in the instant case, the suit of such nature is
pending since September, 2024 and on account of pendency of the same, the petitioner, as stated, is
suffering great hardship and mental agony, this Court is of the view that no fruitful purpose will be
served in keeping this petition pending.
Accordingly, this petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondent No. 1/Sub-Divisional
Magistrate (Judicial), Tahsil Rudauli, District Faizabad now Ayodhya to consider and decide
theCase No.T-202504230701775 (Chaitu Vs. Kuwara and others) most expeditiously after affording
full opportunity of hearing to the parties to the litigation and without granting unnecessary
adjournment to either party preferably within a period of one year from the next date fixed in the
case, if there is no other legal impediment in this regard.
It is made clear that the Court has not examined the case of either party on merits and the Authority
concerned shall be free to decide the matter strictly in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid, the petition is disposed of.
