the 'NOIDA') and also paid the GST @ 18%, which amounts to Rs.17,49,330/-, pursuant to which,

accepted by the NOIDA.

Section 73 (1) of the CGST Act was initiated to which the petitioner also submitted a detailed reply
supported by documentary evidence showing the payment of tax as well as acknowledgement receipt
issued by the NOIDA, but without considering the same, the impugned order has been passed
against which an appeal was filed, which was also dismissed without considering the material
available on record.
5. He further submits that in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of NOIDA, the fact with regard to
deposit of amount of tax by the petitioner has been accepted and same has been deposited in some
other head. He further submits that once the NOIDA accepts the payment of tax, the petitioner
cannot be penalized twice; once paying the tax to the NOIDA for depositing the same with GST
department as per the law and other by facing penal proceedings under Section 73 of the GST Act
whereby tax has again been imposed upon the petitioner of equal amount along with penalty of
Rs.19,22,778/-. He further submits that the amount of tax and penalty imposed by the impugned
order upon the petitioner may be directed to be paid/compensated by the NOIDA to the petitioner.
6. Per contra, learned Standing Counsel supports the impugned order by submitting that the
proceedings were rightly initiated against the petitioner as engaged in renting out the commercial

deposited.

petitioner towards the GST payment, but the same was deposited under some wrong head. He

rectified. He further submits that it's the mistake on the part of the petitioner in not informing the
respondent-NOIDA within time.

the authorities.
10. The paragraph nos. 3, 4, 5 & 6 of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the NOIDA would be
relevant, which reads as under:-
"3. That it is pertinent to submit here that on 21.09.2017 the petitioner had deposited
Rs. 97,18,500/- towards lump sum/one time lease rent amount of the plot situated at
F-16, Sector 18, Noida. The Petitioner also paid Rs. 17,49,330/-towards 18% GST for
the aforesaid plot with the respondent authority. Copy of the statement of accounts of
the petitioner for payment of one-time lease rent alongwith payment of applicable
GST and the copy of the payment challan dated 21.09.2017 are collectively filed
herewith as ANNEXURE No. SA1 (colly.).
4. That pertinently since the GST Act was recently enacted and due to non-clarity and
on the advise of the tax consultant of the Authority, the said tax was deposited by the
Respondent Authority in the head of B2C and subsequently the return was filed. If
the Petitioner had approached the Authority at that time, the Authority could have
filed the rectification application. But, this fact went unnoticed and resultantly the
same could not be rectified in time.
5. That on 18.10.2017, the Respondent Noida Authority deposited the aforesaid
payment of GST at 18% amounting to Rs. 17,49,330/- with the State GST Authorities
and as such filed its return in Form GSTR-3B dated 18.10.2017 for the Month of
September F.Y. 2017-18. Copy of the Return filed by the Noida Authority dated
18.10.2017 for the Month of September F.Y. 2017-18 is filed herewith as ANNEXURE
No. SA2.
6. That the Noida Authority vide its return filed in Form GSTR 3B dated 18.10.2017
for the Month of September F.Y. 2017-18 deposited Rs. 14,10,21,036/- towards CGST
and Rs. 14,10,21,036/ towards SGST. This amount included the amount of Rs.
8,74,665/- paid by the Petitioner towards CGST and Rs. 8,74,665/ towards SGST.
Therefore, as such the tax collected by the Respondent Noida Authority from the
Petitioner had been deposited by the Respondent Noida Authority on 18.10.2017
itself with the GST Authorities."
11. Perusal of the contents of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of NOIDA, show that the payment
of GST deposited by the petitioner was accepted by it. Further, they also admitted depositing of the
GST amount under the wrong head. The NOIDA had attributed its mistake upon tax consultant by
whom the advise was taken. In turn, the NOIDA accepts its mistake for non-deposit of the due tax so
paid by the petitioner under the proper heads.
12. In view of the above categorical statement of admission made in the counter affidavit filed by the
NOIDA/respondent no.4, the impugned orders cannot be said to be arbitrary or call for any
interference by this Court.

13. Before parting, it will be relevant to notice that the tax amount paid by the petitioner to the
NOIDA authorities was accepted, and deposited under the wrong head, hence the petitioner cannot
be permitted to suffer to the mistake committed on the part of NOIDA. The petitioner paid the
legitimate tax to NOIDA, which was not deposited under the proper head and therefore, on account
of that the petitioner has to face not only the proceedings of GST, but also imposition of penalty.
14. In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances, the Court is of the view that the petitioner must
be compensated by NOIDA.
15. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Batliboi Environmental Engineers Limited Vs. Hindustan
Petroleum Corporation Limited an Another, (2024) 2 Supreme Court cases 375, has held that
computation of compensation should not be whimsical and absurd resulting in a windfall and
bounty for one party at the expense of the other and the damages should be commensurate with the
loss sustained by the party.
16. Since the quantification against the petitioner along with penalty has been made of
Rs.19,22,778/-, which has been confirmed by the appellate authority, a Writ of Mandamus under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India is issued to the respondent no.4 i.e. NOIDA to
pay/compensate the amount of Rs.19,22,778/- to the petitioner within 15 days from today. After
making the said payment to the petitioner, the NOIDA shall intimate about the same to the District
Magistrate, Gautam Buddh Nagar within the said period.
17. The NOIDA is at liberty to recover the said amount from the erring officer of its department.
18. In the event of failure of payment of compensation to the petitioner by the NOIDA as mentioned
here-in-above, the District Magistrate, Gautam Buddh Nagar is directed to recover the said amount
from NOIDA and pay the same to the petitioner within 15 days thereafter.
19. Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed off.
20. An affidavit of compliance shall be filed by the NOIDA within a period of one month from today.
In the event of failure, the District Magistrate, Gautam Buddh Nagar is directed to file an affidavit of
compliance as stated above within a month.
21. List in Chamber on 15.05.2025.
22. The Registrar (Compliance) of this Court is directed to communicate this order to the NOIDA
and District Magistrate- Gautam Buddh Nagar, within 24 hours from today.
