ORDER
This is the petition by the petitioners for initiating contempt proceedings against the respondents
for willful disobedience and non-compliance of the interim order date 21.01.2020 passed in WP(C)
N. 163/2020 whereby the Single Bench of this court while issuing notice to the respondents for filing
objections also directed that the operation of the impugned Award dated 28.08.2019 qua the
petitioner shall remain stayed. On the allegation that despite there being interim directions in
operation, the respondents have tried to take over the possession of the land belonging to the
petitioner which was subject matter of the impugned Award dated 28.08.2019.
On being put on notice, respondent No.4 and the other respondents have filed their objections. In
the statement of facts/compliance report filed by Mr. Ajay Kapahi, Executive Engineer, PMGSY,
Division-I, Udhampur, it is categorically stated that in view of the interim directions passed by this
court, the respondents particularly the executing agency has not executed any work on the stretch of
the road where the land of the petitioners falls.
In view of the aforesaid categoric statement given by the Executive Engineer concerned, which is
supported by his personal affidavit, we are of the view that no case is made out for initiating any
contempt proceedings against the respondents. We, however, make it clear that so long as the
interim directions remain in operation, the respondents shall adhere to the directions in letter and
spirit.
