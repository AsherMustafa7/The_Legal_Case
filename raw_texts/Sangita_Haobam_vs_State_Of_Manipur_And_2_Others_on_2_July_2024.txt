Item No. 10
IN THE HIGH COURT OF MANIPUR
AT IMPHAL
PIL No. 20 of 2023
Sangita Haobam
Petitioner
Vs.
State of Manipur and 2 Others
Respondents
BEFORE
HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SIDDHARTH MRIDUL
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A. GUNESHWAR SHARMA
ORDER
02.07.2024 Siddharth Mridul, C.J.:
None appears on behalf of the petitioner. There was no appearance on behalf of the
petitioner on the 26th June, 2024, the previous date of hearing as well, when adverse
orders were deferred in the interest of justice.
Mr. M. Devananda, the learned Additional Advocate General, appearing on behalf of
the State of Manipur would contend that the present being a service matter, no public
interest litigation is maintainable in view of the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Pratap Singh Bist Vs. The Director, Directorate of Education, Govt. of NCT of Delhi
& Ors. wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows :
"4. In this view of the matter and having regard to the fact that the respondent nos.5
to 17 have already served for almost 15 years, we are not inclined to entertain these
special leave petitions against their selection or appointment. However, the second
reason assigned by the High Court, namely, that "PIL is not at all maintainable in
service matters" in view of the decision of this Court in Dr. Duryodhan Sahu and

Sangita Haobam vs State Of Manipur And 2 Others on 2 July, 2024
Others vs. Jintendra Kumar Mishra and Others, (1998) 7 SCC 273, is a debatable
issue and the said question of law is kept open, to be gone into an appropriate case."
And also in the case of Jagdish Prasad Vs. State of U.P. through Principal Secretary Basic Education
and 5 Others decided on 24.08.2020 in PIL No. 751 of 2020 by the Hon'ble Allahabad High Court
which reads as follows :
"15. In N.Veerasamy vs. Union of India, reported in (2005) 2 MLJ 564, while
considering a public interest litigation filed by a treasurer of a political party, praying
to take action again Mrs.Lakshmi Pranesh, IAS, the fifth respondent therein, under
the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969, for allegedly making
allegations against a leader of a political party, following the above judgments of the
Honourable Apex Court, a Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court held as follows:-
"It is settled law that no writ in the form of public interest litigation will lie under
Article 226 of the Constitution in service matters. The petitioner has no locus standi
to file the public interest litigation. The extraordinary powers of the High Court
under Art.226 of the Constitution in matters of this kind is required to be used
sparingly and only in extraordinary cases." "The service matters are essentially
between the employer and the employee and it would be for the State to take action
under the Service Rules and there is no question of any public interest involved in
such matters."
"The petition is not only not maintainable either in law of facts but also would
amount to abuse of the process of Court."
Be that as it may, since none appears on behalf of the petitioner, the present PIL is dismissed in
default for non-prosecution.
