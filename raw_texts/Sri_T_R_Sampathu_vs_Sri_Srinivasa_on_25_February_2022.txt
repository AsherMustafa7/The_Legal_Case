THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR JUDGMENT ON 16.02.2022, COMING ON FOR
'PRONOUNCEMENT JUDGMENT' THIS DAY, THE COURT
DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
Though this appeal is listed for admission, with the consent of the learned counsels appearing on
both sides, the same is taken up for final disposal.
2. The complainant/appellant has filed this appeal under Section 378(4) of Criminal Procedure
Code, 1973 ('Cr.P.C.' for short) challenging the judgment of acquittal dated 01.09.2017 passed by the
Civil Judge and JMFC, Holenarasipura ('trial Court' for short) in C.C. No.675/2013, whereby the
learned Magistrate has acquitted accused/respondent herein for the offence 138 of N.I. Act.
3. For the sake of convenience, the parties herein are referred with the original ranks occupied by
them before the trial Court.
4. The brief factual matrix leading to the case is that, the complainant and accused are acquainted
with each other and the respondent borrowed loan of Rs.3,00,000/- on 25.11.2013 for his legal
necessities. It is the further case of the complainant that, towards repayment of the said loan, the
accused has issued a cheque dated 28.03.2013 drawn on Post Office, Holenarasipura and when the
complainant has presented the said cheque, it was returned with an endorsement 'Insufficient
Funds'. Later on, the complainant has got issued a legal notice on 30.03.2013 demanding repayment
of the loan amount and to the said notice, the accused has given an evasive reply. Hence, he lodged a
complaint under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. alleging that, accused has committed an offence under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ( 'N.I. Act' for short).
5. Learned Magistrate after taking cognizance has recorded the sworn statement of the complainant
and issued process against the accused. The accused has appeared through his counsel and enlarged
on bail. The accusation was read-over and explained to accused and he pleaded not guilty and
claimed to be tried.
6. The complainant was got examined himself as PW.1 and placed reliance on five documents
marked at Ex.P1 to Ex.P5. After conclusion of evidence of the prosecution, the statement of accused
under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. was recorded to enable him to explain the incriminating evidence
appearing against him. The case of accused is of total denial. He did not choose to lead any oral or
documentary evidence in support of his defence.
7. After having heard the arguments and on perusing the records, the learned Magistrate has come
to a conclusion that, the complainant has failed to establish that accused has committed offence
under Section 138 of N.I. Act by issuing a cheque in respect of legally enforceable debt and thereby
acquitted the accused/respondent herein. Being aggrieved by he judgment of acquittal, complainant
has approached this Court by filing this appeal.

8. Heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for appellant and respondent. Perused the
records.
9. Learned counsel for the appellant would contend that the reasons assigned by the trial Court for
acquitting the accused are based on principles of law of equity and justice. He would further contend
that the trial Court has failed to note that, no rebuttal evidence is adduced by the accused and since
signature on the cheque is admitted, the presumption ought to have been drawn in favour of the
complainant and when presumption is not rebutted, the trial Court ought to have convicted the
accused. He would contend that, accused has not led any evidence to rebut the presumption and the
trial Court has ignored these material aspects and hence he would contend that the judgment of
acquittal is perverse and calls for interference by this Court. Hence, he would seek for allowing the
appeal by setting aside the impugned judgment of acquittal and sought for convicting the accused.
10. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent/accused would contend that the financial
capacity of the complainant to advance Rs.3,00,000/- itself is in dispute and the complainant has
not produced any material document to show his financial status. Further, he would also contend
that the postal intimation regarding endorsement on cheque was not placed on record and on
perusal of Ex.P1 and endorsement at Ex.P1(b) it is evident that the cheque was bounced on
19.02.2007. But, the postal seal was got obtained on 28.03.2013 and a false complaint came to be
lodged. He would also contend that the endorsement at Ex.P1(b) is again supported by the reply
notice-Ex.P5 and hence, he would contend that, presumption cannot be drawn in favour of the
complainant in view of the fact that his financial status itself is disputed.
11. Having heard the arguments of the learned counsels appearing on both sides and on perusing the
records, it is the contention of the complainant that, on 25.01.2013 , the accused has availed loan of
Rs.3,00,000/- and for repayment of the said amount, he has issued Ex.P1. It is further asserted that,
when the said cheque was presented for encashment, it was returned on 28.03.2013. This is a
specific case made out by the complainant. The cross-examination reveals that, the accused has not
denied his signature on the cheque. The disputed cheque is marked at Ex.P1 and the cheque is also
dated 28.03.2013. But, it is important to note here that, though there is a seal dated 28.03.2013 of
the Post Office, but regarding bouncing of the cheque on 28.03.2013, no endorsement was issued by
the Postal Department. On the contrary, on perusal of endorsement at Ex.P(1)(b), it is evident that
the said cheque was bounced for 'Insufficient Funds' on 19.02.2007 itself. When the cheque is dated
28.03.2013, why it was bounced on 19.02.2007 itself is not at all forthcoming and it is for the
complainant to explain these lacunas. The complainant could have produced an intimation of the
Post Office regarding bouncing of the cheque. On the contrary, considering these aspects, the
defence set-up by the accused in reply notice (Ex.P5) appears to be more probable, in view of the
fact that about five years back cheques were issued and they were being misused.
12. Further, all along, the complainant has contended that, he has advanced loan of Rs.3,00,000/-
to accused on 25.01.2013. In cross-examination though he claimed that, he is an agriculturist and he
possess three acres of land and from each acre, his annual income is Rs.50,000/-, but, no piece of
material is produced to show that he is possessing three acres of land and he is getting income from
that land. Further, he admits that, it is the dry land and as such, earning annual income of

Sri T R Sampathu vs Sri Srinivasa on 25 February, 2022
Rs.50,000/- from dry land is not acceptable, unless the complainant leads any material evidence. It
is hard to accept the contention of the complainant that he has advanced Rs.3,00,000/- without any
document and he has also not placed any material evidence to show his financial status. Even no
document is produced to show that the cheque was bounced on 28.08.2013. The postal
endorsement date at Ex.P1(b) is 19.02.2007. In that event, the cheque ought to have been issued
much earlier itself. The complainant has failed to establish existence of any legally enforceable debt
as on the date of issuance of cheque and material documents regarding dishonor of the cheque on a
particular date is also not established. Under such circumstances, the ingredients of Section 138 of
NI are not proved by the complainant. The learned Magistrate has considered all these aspects and
has appreciated the oral and documentary evidence in detail by analyzing them. Hence, it is evident
that the judgment of acquittal does not call for any interference by this Court, as it does not suffer
from any illegality or perversity. Under such circumstances, the appeal is devoid of any merits and
needs to be rejected. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following:-
ORDER The appeal is dismissed. The judgment of acquittal dated 01.09.2017 passed
by the trial Court viz., the Civil JMFC, Holenarasipura, in CC No. 675/2013, stands
confirmed.
