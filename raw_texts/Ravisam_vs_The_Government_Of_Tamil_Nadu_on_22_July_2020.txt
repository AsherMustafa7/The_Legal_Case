JUDGMENT
THE CHIEF JUSTICE The present appeal arises out of the judgment dated 24.6.2019 of the learned
Single Judge delivering a common judgment in two writ petitions, one of which W.P.No.3640 of
2001 was filed by the appellant challenging the acquisition proceedings under the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 (for brevity, “the 1894 Act”) with a prayer to quash notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of
the said Act, whereby land measuring 3.03 Acres of SF.Nos.411/1 and __________
http://www.judis.nic.in 411/2 in Vilankurichi Village, Coimbatore North Taluk, has been acquired.
This appeal is, therefore, confined only in relation to the said land that concerns the appellant, who
was the writ petitioner in W.P.No.3640 of 2001.
2. The land has been acquired for a Housing Scheme, namely, Ganapathy Neighbourhood Scheme
Phase 2 in Coimbatore. The notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act, that was published in the
gazette is dated 20.3.1991, and was also subsequently published in the newspapers as well as in the
locality, the dates whereof are different. The notification dated 26.5.1992 under Section 6 of the
1894 Act was published in the official gazette on 28.5.1992. The schedule appended to the said
declaration in relation to the plots in question are relevant, keeping in view the nature of the
controversy raised by the appellant. In the Section 4 gazette notification, the following description is
given with regard to the survey numbers, which includes Plot Nos.411/1 and 411/2:

4. The appellant alleges that undisputedly the original land owner was one Gopal Naidu, who had
three sons, namely, Purushothaman Naidu, Narayanasamy Naidu @ G.N.Sam and Krishnan Naidu.
It is stated that on 30.3.1955 an internal partition took place between Gopal Naidu and his sons.
5. The property passed on from Gopal Naidu, after his death, to his widow Chinnammal under a life
interest only available to her, with absolute ownership passing on to the three sons in equal shares.
Chinnammal, the widow, is also stated to have died in 1972. One of the sons of Gopal Naidu, namely,
Narayanasamy Naidu @ G.N.Sam, father of the appellant, had already died on 9.1.1961. Gopal
Naidu and his other two sons and their heirs had parted with their one-third share by executing sale
deeds, and the purchasers have also separately and unsuccessfully contested the acquisition
proceedings before this Court that would be shortly __________ http://www.judis.nic.in narrated
hereinafter. To understand the separate status of succession and consequential rights of the parties,
the following description in a bird's eye-view of the facts with regard to ownership as alleged by the
appellant:-
Gopal Naidu = Chinnammal (Died in 1972) | | | | Purushottam Naidu
G.Narayanasamy G.Krishnan Naidu (Dead) Naidu @ G.N.Sam | (Died on 9.1.1961) |
= | N.Savithiri | (wife) | | | | | Ravisam K.Vijayakumar (Son) (Son) J.Dhanalakshmi
(Married Daughter) P.Jayalakshmi (Married Daughter) B.Gajini (Married Dauther)
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in
6. The aforesaid pedigree is seriously disputed vis-a-vis the ownership of the land by
the respondent State and the Housing Board on the ground that the person reflected
as G.Narayanasamy Naidu in the present pedigree is son of Gopal Naidu, whereas,
according to the respondents, the land in dispute is recorded in the name of an
entirely different person, namely, Narayanasamy, Son of Subba Naidu, and grandson
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 4
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
of one Appaiah. These facts will be discussed later on in the judgment.
7. In the present case, the dispute is with regard to 3.03 Acres of land in Survey
Nos.411/1 and 411/2, as already indicated above, out of which 2.89 Acres is stated to
be retained by the appellant and 15 cents has been left out for a private road.
8. In so far as the rest of the land is concerned, the purchasers are said to have
acquired the lands through sale deeds stated to have been executed in the year 1988
from the other co-
owners. This fact is evident from the record of judgments in the litigation contested by the said
purchasers. __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
9. After the notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act was published, a registered partition deed
dated 15.5.1991 is said to have been executed in relation to the properties inherited by the heirs of
late Gopal Naidu, including the appellant, as also the purchasers who had fought their legal battle
separately as noted above, namely Mrs.Girija Janarthanan and others.
10. The acquisition proceeded with the names that were recorded in Sections 4 and 6 notifications
and ultimately an award was delivered on 23.5.1994. The award is also in relation to plots in
question and it records that during the enquiry under Section 5A of the 1894 Act, the required notice
under the 1894 Act was tendered on the notified persons, whereafter some of the tenure holders
raised their objections and after considering the same, the objections were rejected, followed by
notices under Sections 9(3) and 10 of 1894 Act. The award mentions that the notices were served on
the land owners and the interested persons and their acknowledgments were obtained. The notices
were published and a __________ http://www.judis.nic.in necessary certificate was also obtained.
This was followed by an award enquiry under Section 11 of the 1894 Act at the office of the Special
Tahsildar and after recording the specifics of the land acquired, the award was delivered. The
ownership was reflected through the names of the notified persons in respect of both the survey
numbers. The award, however, records P.S.G.Ganga Naidu and Sons Trust as having appeared
during the award enquiry, but he failed to produce any documentary evidence during the same. The
other notified person Krishna Naidu did not appear for award enquiry and, therefore, ownership
and apportionment could not be decided in respect of him. Accordingly, it was directed to deposit
the amount in the Civil Court. Proceeding further in respect of S.F.No.410/2, the name of
Narayanasamy is mentioned, and then it was indicated that since Narayanasamy Naidu, did not
appear for award enquiry, his ownership and apportionment also could not be decided, and the
amount was directed to be deposited in the Civil Court.
11. It is the case of the appellant that in spite of the fact that __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
the name of the appellant's father had been notified, who had died in 1961, in the notifications
issued under Sections 4 and 6 of the 1894 Act and was also mentioned in the award, but the award
proceeded as if Narayanasamy Naidu, in spite of notice did not appear in the proceedings. It is
stated by the respondents that the compensation amount was tendered and deposited on 8.7.1994
and the possession was taken on 9.12.1994, as per the certificate on which reliance has been placed,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 5
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
which documents have been highly disputed by the appellant.
12. The other tenure holders, who were purchasers from the other branches, as referred to above,
filed two writ petitions before the High Court being W.P.Nos.19925 and 19927 of 1994. The said writ
petitions were entertained and it is stated that interim orders had been passed therein in their
favour, whereafter on 22.9.2000, the said writ petitions were allowed and the impugned
notifications were quashed, which also covered Plot Nos.411/1 and 411/2. The appellant was not a
party to the said petitions, yet the notifications were quashed only on the ground that the
publication of the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the
1894 Act was not locally circulated and was allegedly published in unknown daily newspapers. It
was also accepted by the Court that they were not been given personal notice and, therefore, on
account of such violation, the petitioners therein were prevented from raising their objections
regarding the proposed acquisition of land in the enquiry under Section 5A of the 1894 Act. The
Court also deprecated the practice of publishing such notifications in local dailies which are
insignificant and not in circulation. There were other contentions also raised, namely that the
purchasers had purchased the land in 1988, even prior to the notification under Section 4 of 1894
Act in 1991 and that the notification under Section 6 of the 1894 Act had been published beyond the
period of one year. These facts have been disputed in the counter affidavit filed in those writ
petitions, but, as indicated above, it was on the first issue relating to an erroneous publication of the
notice that the writ petitions were allowed. It is useful to extract the operative part of the said
judgment only to reflect the issue which came to be decided by the Court in the case of those
purchasers in the first round of litigation. __________ http://www.judis.nic.in The same is
gainfully reproduced herein under:
“I accept the first contention raised by the learned senior counsel for the petitioners.
In such a circumstance, it is unnecessary for me to consider the other points raised by
the learned senior counsel for the petitioners.”
13. The Tamil Nadu Housing Board, Coimbatore, filed an appeal, being W.A.No.1946 of 2002,
assailing the aforesaid common judgment and the same was dismissed on 27.8.2002.
14. The appellant has urged that with regard to his land, the Housing Board was trying to interfere
with his possession and he came to know of the entire acquisition proceedings and the litigation for
the first time in November, 2000, whereafter he moved a representation on 4.11.2000 before the
Housing and Urban Development Department questioning their action of trying to take over the
property of the appellant. The appellant requested the Secretary of the Housing Department to
exempt the land from the acquisition proceedings. Having failed to get any reply, the __________
http://www.judis.nic.in appellant filed W.P.No.3640 of 2001 that has given rise to the present
appeal challenging the acquisition proceedings taking aid of the judgments that were delivered in
favour of the purchasers, referred to above. On 26.2.2001, an interim injunction was granted by a
learned Single Judge in favour of the appellant and later on vide order dated 5.2.2003, the
injunction was continued in respect of dispossession alone. The Court clarified that other
proceedings may go on.

Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
15. The Tamil Nadu Housing Board, through its Executive Engineer, filed Civil Appeal No.2660 of
2004 before the Apex Court against the judgment in W.A.No.1946 of 2002 arising out of
W.P.Nos.19925 and 19927 of 1994 in favour of the purchasers, referred to above, and the said appeal
was allowed on 19.4.2004 on the short question that the presumption by the High Court about no
opportunity having been given to the tenure holders was drawn on the basis of a bald statement in
the affidavit, without giving any opportunity to the Housing Board, only on the ground that the
publishing of the notices in insignificant newspapers resulted in __________
http://www.judis.nic.in alleged failure in complying with the provisions for publication under
Sections 4(1) and 6 of the 1894 Act. The Supreme Court, therefore, set aside the judgment of the
Division Bench dated 27.8.2002 as well as the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated
22.9.2000 and remanded the matter back to the learned Single Judge in relation to the issues raised
by the purchasers, who had filed their separate writ petitions.
16. It is during the pendency of these proceedings that the writ petition filed by the appellant,
namely W.P.No.3640 of 2001, giving rise to the present appeal, also came to be allowed on
24.12.2003 by a learned Single Judge following the decision rendered in the case of the purchasers.
This was prior to the judgment of the Apex Court, referred to above.
17. A review petition, being Review Petition No.44 of 2004, was filed by the Tamil Nadu Housing
Board contending therein that since the writ petition of the appellant had been allowed following the
decisions in favour of the purchasers from other co-owners, __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
which stood reversed by the Apex Court, this judgment also deserves to be reviewed.
18. The review petition remained pending and during the pendency of this review petition, the cases
relating to the purchasers that had been remanded by the Apex Court came to be heard by the
learned Single Judge and their writ petitions, being W.P.Nos.19925 and 19927 of 2004, were again
allowed on 21.12.2004 in their favour.
19. Against the said judgment of the learned Single Judge, two writ appeals, being W.A.Nos.1241 and
1242 of 2005, were preferred which came to be pending.
20. The aforesaid facts with regard to the litigations of purchasers was noticed by the learned Single
Judge in the Review Petition No.44 of 2004 and having considered the same, the review petition
was allowed on 15.2.2008 with a direction that the writ petition of the appellant would also be
posted for disposal along __________ http://www.judis.nic.in with the aforesaid two writ appeals
in the matter of the purchasers.
21. It appears that the appellant's writ petition remained pending and the two writ appeals of the
Housing Board that were filed against the judgment in favour of the purchasers were taken up for
hearing and were ultimately allowed on 25.11.2008. The respondents have also pressed the said
judgment as having become final and is one of the sheet anchor of their arguments.
22. It is thereafter that the writ petition giving rise to the present appeal came to be heard and was
dismissed on 24.6.2019 by the learned Single Judge following the judgment of the Division Bench
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 7
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
dated 25.11.2008. The Review Application No.155 of 2019 filed by the appellant was also dismissed
by the learned Single Judge on 26.8.2019, whereafter the present appeal has been filed.
23. Arguments on behalf of the appellant were advanced by Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior
Counsel, along with Mr.G.Sankaran, and the learned Advocate General has spearheaded
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in the arguments on behalf of the State and the Housing Board,
assisted by Dr.R.Gouri, on 9.7.2020.
24. It may be pointed out that the writ appeal had been entertained by a Division Bench and the
following order was passed on 4.12.2019.
“Heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for the respondents/State as well as
learned counsel for the respondent/ Housing Board.
2.The respondents' counsel pray for two weeks time to file a response, particularly with regard to the
primary argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that the entire proceedings including the
acquisition proceedings, the delivery of award and other consequential actions were undertaken
without notice to the appellant, who is the land owner and without any service of notice on the
recorded tenure holder.
3.The submission is that the recorded tenure holder is none else than the father of the appellant,
who died way back in 1961 and the proceedings were concluded as per the revenue records, which
contained the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in name of the father of the appellant, therefore,
any proceedings carried out against a dead person are a nullity. The affidavit to be filed may respond
to the same along with other particulars that may be warranted.
Put up on 23.01.2020.”
25. The matter was adjourned thereafter on a counter affidavit being filed on behalf of the State, to
which a rejoinder has also been filed in this appeal. It may, however, be put on record that no
counter affidavit had been filed on behalf of the respondents in the writ petition. This fact has been
noted in the judgment earlier rendered in the writ petition on 24.12.2003, which was reviewed on
15.2.2008, but even thereafter no counter affidavit appears to have been filed to the original writ
petition. The appellant petitioner also filed an additional affidavit before the learned Single Judge
raising specific pleas to substantiate what has been argued before us and it is urged that the learned
Single Judge did not adhere to those additional pleas in spite of the fact that no __________
http://www.judis.nic.in counter was filed to the said additional affidavit by the respondents. It is for
this reason that the Division Bench had called upon the respondents to file their counter along with
any particulars that may be warranted in terms of the order dated 4.12.2019 quoted herein above.
The affidavits have thereafter been exchanged in this writ appeal.
26. Advancing his submissions, Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior Counsel urged that the case of
the appellant on facts was clearly distinguishable and even the legal issues raised in the writ petition
filed by the appellant were not covered by the judgment of the Division Bench dated 25.11.2008, yet
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 8
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
the learned Single Judge only relying upon the same and without traversing the facts of the present
case on the issues raised has dismissed the writ petition and has also rejected the review application
and, hence, the impugned judgment and the consequential dismissal of the review application are
clearly vitiated and they deserve to be set aside.
27. To substantiate his submissions, he contends that the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
litigation that was fought by the purchasers resulting in the judgment dated 25.11.2008 has nowhere
decided any issue of a proceeding having been finalized against a dead person, which is the case
presently involved. His first contention is that, admittedly, according to the respondents, the
revenue records, the notification under Sections 4 and 6 of the 1894 Act, and the ultimate delivery of
the award in 1994, leave no room for doubt that the name of the appellant's father G.Narayanasamy
Naidu @ G.N.Sam had been mentioned, who died on 9.1.1961, almost 30 years prior to the initiation
of the acquisition proceedings. Thus, the recorded tenure holder being dead, there cannot be any
valid presumption of notice, or presumption of actual or implied service of notice on the appellant,
whose name was neither recorded, nor did the respondents undertake any exercise during the
enquiries to correct the revenue records and rectify the notifications, so as to enable them to serve a
notice on the appellant. The appellant has clearly set up a case in his writ petition, as well as the
additional affidavit filed by the appellant, and the additional grounds that were brought on record,
copy whereof was served on the respondents. He __________ http://www.judis.nic.in submits
that since no counter affidavit was filed to the writ petition, the said affidavits remained
uncontroverted and the aforesaid fact of the matter having proceeded against the dead person
without any notice having been served on his heirs, including the appellant, was totally overlooked
by the learned Single Judge. He submits that these peculiar facts in the present case were not the
issue that was either raised or decided in the case of the purchasers culminating in the judgment
dated 25.11.2008. The contention, therefore, is that the entire acquisition proceedings having been
carried out against a dead person is a nullity.
28. His second contention is that there is no evidence of any notice having been served on the
appellant. He further submits that there was no question of service of notice, even if it was issued to
the father of the appellant, who was dead way back in the year 1961. His contention, on the basis of
the pleadings made in the writ petition as well as the additional affidavit, is that no effort or enquiry
was ever made by the revenue officials or the acquiring authority either before the award or during
the time of the award to __________ http://www.judis.nic.in find out the legal heirs and then
proceed in the matter after serving of notice. He, therefore, submits that neither under Section 5A,
nor under Section 9(1) read with Section 9(3), nor in the proceedings under Section 11, nor at the
time of the alleged taking over of the possession any notice was ever given to the appellant. The
absence of any such material, which was not there through any counter affidavit before the learned
Single Judge, would clearly establish that this sine qua non of statutory requirements have not been
proved to have been followed, and hence the acquisition proceedings deserve to be struck down.
29. As a necessary corollary, he submits that the recital contained in the award about service of
notice to the notified persons is patently false, as the notified person is a dead person, namely, the
father of the appellant. The averments to the said effect contained in the counter affidavit filed in
this appeal by the respondents are not supported by any records and are unsubstantiated and,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 9
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
therefore, the averments contained are also equally a reflection of falsehood. He, therefore, submits
that the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in respondents having failed to establish any service of
notice, the averment contained in the award should be declared to be incorrect and the contention
raised in the counter affidavit deserves outright rejection.
30. He then supplements the above argument by contending that the appellant has clearly come out
with a case that he had no notice or knowledge of the entire acquisition proceedings till November,
2000, whereafter immediately he filed his writ petition. The contention, therefore, that the writ
petition could not be entertained after the award, that too even seven years thereafter, is not tenable,
in as much as, as already indicated above, on account of the orders passed in the writ petitions filed
by the purchasers, nothing had proceeded and the respondents had not been able to take over
possession of the property. Secondly, after the appellant filed the writ petition and interim
injunction was granted, which was clarified to the effect that the injunction shall operate only with
regard to dispossession, the said injunction order had continued throughout. He has also urged that
the plea of delay __________ http://www.judis.nic.in is not open to be taken by the respondents,
in as much as they did not file any counter affidavit at any stage in the writ petition since 2001 till
the final disposal, and it is only for the first time they have filed a counter affidavit and contested the
matter in this appeal. The delay, as alleged, therefore is not on account of any willful default on the
part of the appellant, and on the other hand, the entire default of not filing any counter affidavit
before the learned Single Judge disentitles the respondents from raising any such plea of delay in
the filing of the writ petition. In such circumstances, once it is established that the proceedings were
against the dead person and no notice whatsoever at any stage was served on the appellant, then the
filing of the writ petition by the appellant after seven years of the award was fully justified in the
background aforesaid, and was rightly entertained. It is, therefore, his contention that both on the
first issue relating to the proceedings against dead person and on the second ground relating to a
complete absence of service of notice, the acquisition proceedings deserve to be quashed.
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in
31. The third argument advanced by Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior Counsel is that there is no
valid proof of possession having been taken over by the respondents and the land, therefore, cannot
be said to have vested in the light of the Division bench judgment dated 25.11.2008. He submits that
there is no proof of possession or the existence of any panchanama to record such possession. To the
contrary, the possession certificate allegedly relied on by the respondents dated 9.12.1994 is the
handing over of possession through the said document by the Tahsildar, Coimbatore to the Tamil
Nadu Housing Board. The said document is no evidence of possession being taken from the tenure
holder, for which he has cited certain decisions that will be referred to herein after.
32. It is, therefore, urged that according to Section 16 of the 1894 Act, vesting can only take place
after possession is taken, which never took place, as the appellant had been throughout in
possession, which has also been protected by an interim order during the pendency of the writ
petition. He submits that the land __________ http://www.judis.nic.in in dispute is vacant as on
date.

Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
33. The fourth argument advanced by the learned Senior Counsel is that no deposit of the
compensation amount is established and what has been pleaded before the Court is of the tendering
of a cheque. He submits that it is only a counterfoil of the cheque which has been brought before the
Court, which is no deposit, much less a valid deposit in the eyes of law.
34. He has summed up contending that this entire exercise of depriving the appellant of his property
without following the due process of law is clearly violative of Article 300A of the Constitution of
India.
35. The following judgments have been relied on by Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan to substantiate his
submissions:
(i) Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Darius Shapur Chennai and others,
(2005) 7 SCC 627;
(ii) Patasi Devi v. State of Haryana and others, __________
http://www.judis.nic.in (2012) 9 SCC 503;
(iii) Banda Development Authority v. Motilal Agarwal and others, (2011) 5 SCC 394;
(iv) Raghbir Singh Sehrawat v. State of Haryana and others, (2012) 1 SCC 792;
(v) Tamil Nadu Housing Board and another v.
iGate Global Solutions Limited and another, 2016-2-LW 122;
(vi) The Chairman and Managing Director, Tamil Nadu Housing Board and another v.
Dhanalakshmi and others [Judgment dated 9.11.2017 in W.A.No.394 of 2014]
(vii) Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and others, 2020 SCC Online SC 316.
36. The aforesaid arguments were countered by the learned Advocate General contending that the
judgment dated 25.11.2008 by the Division Bench arising out of the same notification in the case of
the purchasers had already become final and, therefore, the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
acquisition having been upheld after having considered all the issues relating to acquisition, the
same would be binding on the appellant and this Court has not been apprised of any such argument
to persuade to take a different view.
37. He submits that the land has vested and possession had been validly taken free from all
encumbrances. He further submits that a small minuscule area is left in this litigation and,
therefore, keeping in view the nature of the entire huge project for housing that has been
undertaken, the same should not be forestalled at the instance of a person who was merely a
fence-sitter and is an inter- meddler without any semblance of title.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 11
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
38. He further submits that the deposit had been rightly tendered and possession had already been
effected in accordance with the provisions of the 1894 Act.
39. He submits, on the strength of the counter affidavit, that the allegation of no notice having been
issued or served at any __________ http://www.judis.nic.in stage is bald and without any basis.
He contends that public notice was also made by beat of drums/tom tom, which has been noticed by
the Division Bench in the judgment dated 25.11.2008.
40. His next contention is that the appellant claiming himself to be the son of Narayanasamy has not
explained anywhere that if his father has died in 1961 and he had received the property by way of a
partition deed, then why he did not take any steps to get his name mutated in the revenue records,
and the inaction on the part of the appellant cannot enure to his advantage, when he was claiming
possession over the land.
41. The learned Advocate General has then cited the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of
Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and others (supra), where in matters of land
acquisition, the issue of possession and the manner of vesting has been clearly explained and he has
taken the Court through various paragraphs to assert that the acquisition in the present case is
complete with the land having vested with the State free from all __________
http://www.judis.nic.in encumbrances.
42. He has referred to the Division Bench judgment dated 25.11.2008 [Executive Engineer and
others v. Girija Janarthanan and others, (2009) 2 MLJ 918] to point out that the said decision also
takes notice of the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Satendra Prasad Jain v. State of U.P.,
(1993) 4 SCC 369, as well as other judgments, where it has been held that the Courts have to weigh
larger public interest vis-a-vis the private interest and the acquisition proceedings have to be
upheld, where possession has been taken, leaving the issue of compensation only being claimed by a
person in accordance with law.
43. He has also relied on a Division Bench judgment in G.S.Gopalakrishnan and others v.
Government of Tamil Nadu and others, 2006 (4) CTC 757 to urge that notification under the 1894
Act will not per se be invalidated merely because a dead person's name has been notified. He,
therefore, submits that in the background aforesaid, the appellant is not entitled to any relief and
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in the learned Single Judge has rightly dismissed the writ
petition.
44. Since we had certain doubts about the incomplete information being tendered by the
respondents relating to the records, we had at the close of arguments on 9.7.2020 passed an order
reserving the judgment, but, at the same time, had also permitted the learned counsel for the
respondent Housing Board and the learned Advocate General to inform us about the availability of
any documents with regard to taking over of possession or such other document, after providing it
to the learned counsel for the appellant. The order dated 9.7.2020 is extracted herein under:
“Arguments concluded.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 12
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
Learned counsel for the Housing Board states that in the event of any document with
regard to taking over possession is available on record, the scanned copy thereof shall
be provided to the learned counsel for the petitioner and shall also be tendered before
this Court.
Learned counsel for the Housing Board may also supply copies of the notices which
are stated to have been __________ http://www.judis.nic.in issued and served on
the recorded land owners pursuant to the notifications issued under Sections 4(1)
and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
Judgment reserved.”
45. As a sequence to the aforesaid indulgence granted by us, an additional counter affidavit along
with additional typed set of papers came to be filed on behalf of the respondents and a mention was
made by the learned Advocate General as well as Dr.Gouri, learned counsel for the Housing Board,
to take the same on record. This mention was accepted on 15.7.2020 and we granted time to the
learned counsel for the appellant to file a reply as well as any other document that he would choose
to rely on in response to the additional counter affidavit and the documents relied on by the learned
counsel for the Housing Board. The order passed on 15.7.2020 is extracted herein under:
“We have reserved judgment in this case subject to furnishing of any further
information by the learned counsel for the State and the Housing Board in the
matter.
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in
2. Today, Sri.AR.L. Sundaresan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant
informs that he has been served with an affidavit to which, a re-
joinder is required to be filed as certain new documents are introduced.
3. Learned Advocate General has already made a mention in this regard and prayed for some time to
allow him to advance his submissions on these documents.
4. With the consent of the parties, we fix the date as 21.07.2020.
List the matter on 21.07.2020.”
46. When the arguments commenced again, as directed on 21.7.2020, the learned Advocate General
relying on the additional counter affidavit filed now had advanced an altogether new submission
denying the very identity of the appellant's father as being the true owner of Plot No.411/2 in
question. He has urged that there was another person by the name of Narayanasamy, Son
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in of Subba Naidu, who is the recorded tenure holder in the
revenue records and whose name was notified in the notifications issued under Section 4 and 6. This
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 13
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
person is not the father of the appellant and, therefore, the appellant has set up a totally false case of
being the owner of the land in dispute by claiming succession through his father, who was never the
recorded tenure holder of the land in question. For this, he has invited the attention of the Court to
various documents and revenue records that have been filed in support of the additional counter
affidavit filed by the second respondent through a typed set of papers. He, therefore, submits that
the person, whose name was mentioned in the revenue records and in the notifications under
Sections 4 and 6, was sought to be served with a notice and since he did not choose to appear either
during the enquiry proceedings under Section 5A or the award enquiry proceedings, the award was
delivered in his absence. For this, the learned Advocate General has urged that the real person, who
is the owner of the land in dispute, is Narayanasamy, Son of Subba Naidu, and for which he prays
that this Court may peruse the death certificate of S.Narayanasamy __________
http://www.judis.nic.in Naidu, son of Subba Naidu, indicating that he had different heirs as per the
legal heir certificate that has been placed on record now. The said Narayansamy is, therefore, not
the same person as the father of the appellant and hence while disputing the very parentage of the
appellant, the respondents have now come up with a case on the strength of the documents relating
to the despatch of the award papers to the Court for disbursement of the compensation and other
documents pertaining to revenue records, that the appellant not being the son of the notified person
named in the notifications, his entire claim as set up in the writ petition is false and the same
deserves to be dismissed.
47. Refuting the aforesaid submissions, Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior Counsel, with the help
of a rejoinder and an additional typed set of papers filed in reply, contended that this is a totally
false generated case now set up by the respondents after almost 19 years of the filing of the writ
petition without even a whisper about the same throughout the proceedings. __________
http://www.judis.nic.in
48. Learned Senior Counsel with the aid of the documents already filed on record, coupled with the
documents now filed in rejoinder along with the typed set of papers, contends that the procurement
of the death certificate or even the revenue records as alleged by the respondents appear to have
been manipulated and are not in relation to the subject matter in dispute. It is submitted that this
reversal of stand as against the counter affidavit filed earlier clearly demonstrates that the
respondents have been changing their stand with the aid of documents that have been procured
subsequently, that have no probative value. It is urged that this new case, which is now sought to be
developed by the respondents in this appeal, should be completely discarded and the appeal as well
as the writ petition deserve to be allowed.
49. Having considered all these submissions, since the case has taken a new turn with the
subsequent filing of additional counter affidavit and the response thereto by the appellant, to us it
appears that all these aspects were not even mentioned by the learned Single Judge, including the
legal issues that were advanced __________ http://www.judis.nic.in before him. The learned
Single Judge simply relied on the judgment of the Division Bench in the case of the purchasers from
the other co-others dated 25.11.2008 and dismissed the writ petition on the said ground. As noted
earlier, no counter affidavit had been filed by the respondents to the writ petition filed by the
appellant. The appellant petitioner had also filed an additional affidavit to substantiate his pleadings
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 14
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
before the learned Single Judge, which also went uncontroverted. This aspect has also been omitted
to be considered by the learned Single Judge. The aforesaid omission has, therefore, caused a
prejudice to the appellant petitioner, resulting in injustice and, hence, calls for an interference in
this intra-court appeal, as it would have a direct bearing on the plea of certiorari raised by the
appellant petitioner.
50. The learned Advocate General could not successfully contest this position that whatever material
they are now seeking to rely on was not placed before the learned Single Judge, nor the arguments
necessary in relation thereto could be pressed into service effectively. He contends that the
examination of the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in relevant material on record was required
to be gone into in order to establish as to whether the rightful claimant has come forward on the
basis of relevant documents or not. We are also clearly of the opinion that this sifting of facts was
necessary, as it is perversity which was alleged by the appellant and we find that the relevant
documents, which may have a bearing on the issues raised before us and were necessarily required
to be gone into for accepting the challenge of the appellant or otherwise, have not been considered at
all.
51. The question of appreciating bare minimum facts, which at times may be disputed, have to be
assessed once non consideration of relevant material is taken as a ground or any patent perversity is
pointed out. From this angle, we would like to extract the following paragraph from Halsbury's Laws
of England, which is extracted herein under:
“613. The distinction between law and fact. The distinction between what will be
treated as a question of law and what will be treated as a question of fact is one of
importance. In general, where a body makes an error of law in reaching a decision, it
will act without __________ http://www.judis.nic.in jurisdiction or power, and the
court may quash that decision on an application for judicial review. By contrast the
court will generally not intervene on the ground that a body has reached an
erroneous finding of fact unless the finding is manifestly unreasonable or a mistake
has been made as to an established and material fact that gives rise to unfairness or
the finding of fact was otherwise reached through an error of law or is a precedent
fact.
There is often difficulty in deciding whether a question should be classified as one of
law or as one of fact (or fact and degree). Determination of the primary facts is not a
matter of law, but to make a finding unsupported by any evidence is an error of law.
Drawing inferences from the facts fall within the ambit of a statutory description, are
potentially classifiable as questions of law, as questions of fact, or as questions of
mixed law and fact. The method of classification may be important, for judicial
review of findings of law may entail an independent determination of the matter
already decided, whereas a review of findings of fact is likely to be more limited. It
has been said that if the question is one which only a trained lawyer can be expected
to decide correctly, there is a presumption that it will be categorised as one of law.
Otherwise the question is usually treated as one of mixed law and fact, so that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 15
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
range of meanings that can reasonably be ascribed to a statutory expression is a
question of law; but whether the facts as found fall within the ambit of that
expression will be held to be a question of fact, on which the decision of the
competent authority will not be disturbed unless it is perverse (or is such that no
reasonable authority properly instructed in the law could have arrived at it), or is
erroneous because a wrong legal approach has been adopted.
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in A court will generally be reluctant to disturb
the findings of a tribunal with specialised knowledge of technical subject matter,
irrespective of whether these findings be classified as law or fact.”
52. As to what is the nature of the fact that deserves to be taken into consideration for the exercise of
a writ of certiorari would be a matter of assessment by the Court, when it is called upon to issue such
a writ. We may mention the following judgments that can be taken into account for the said
purpose.
53. At the outset it may be clarified that where there are disputed questions of fact, generally they
are not required to be investigated in a proceedings under Art.226 of the Constitution of India. The
Court should briefly refer to what the disputed questions of fact are so as to exercise restraint of
discretionary jurisdiction, but merely because there are some disputed questions of fact may not be
sufficient to dismiss the Writ Petition. It should be remembered that the issuance of a prerogative
Writ is a rule of discretion and not one exclusion of jurisdiction. The High Court is __________
http://www.judis.nic.in not incompetent to decide an issue of fact which can be determined from
the materials on record. Reference be had to the judgment in the case of CENTURY SPINNING
AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY LTD. AND ANOTHER v. THE ULHASNAGAR MUNICIPAL
COUNCIL AND ANOTHER, (1970) 1 SCC 582. However, a disputed question of fact should not be
adjudicated in the absence of sufficient pleadings.
54. The next question is as to what would be the scope of exercise of powers when a Writ of
Certiorari is prayed for. For this a little bit of history on the Writ of Certiorari may be gainfully
mentioned here as developed through caselaws both in the pre- constitutional colonial era and also
in the post-Constitutional decisions that have been followed till date.
55. The House of Lords while affirming the judgment of the Kings Bench reported in 1911 A.C. 179,
in the case of BOARD OF EDUCATION v. RICE AND OTHERS, where the Lord Chancellor Lord
Loreburn laid down the general concept of interference through __________
http://www.judis.nic.in a Writ of Mandamus and Certiorari even in decisions arising out of
administrative bodies where His Lordship ruled as follows:
“Comparatively recent statutes have extended, if they have not originated, the
practice of imposing upon departments or officers of State the duty of deciding or
determining questions of various kinds. In the present instance, as in many others,
what comes for determination is sometimes a matter to be settled by discretion,
involving no law. It will, I suppose, usually be of an administrative kind; but
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 16
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
sometimes it will involve matter of law as well as matter of fact, or even depend upon
matter of law alone. In such cases the Board of Education will have to ascertain the
law and also to ascertain the facts. I need not add that in doing either they must act in
good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who
decides anything. But I do not think they are bound to treat such a question as
though it were a trial. They have no power to administer on oath, and need not
examine witnesses. They can obtain information in any way they think best, always
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in giving a fair opportunity to those who are
parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement
prejudicial to their view. Provided this is done, there is no appeal from the
determination of the Board under s.7, sub-s.3, of this Act. The Board have, of course,
no jurisdiction to decide abstract questions of law, but only to determine actual
concrete differences that may arise, and as they arise, between the managers and the
local education authority. The Board is in the nature of the arbitral tribunal, and a
Court of law has no jurisdiction to hear appeals from the determination either upon
law or upon fact. But if the Court is satisfied either that the Board have not acted
judicially in the way I have described, or have not determined the question which
they are required by the Act to determine, then there is a remedy by mandamus and
certiorari.”
56. This concept in the context of the Presidencies of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta in India and
their jurisdiction to exercise such powers as were available to the Courts of Kings Bench was
considered by the Privy Council in the case of RYOTS OF __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
GARABANDHO, SARIYAPALLI AND RAMACHANDRAPURAM VILLAGES, GARABANDHO
GROUP, PARLAKIMEDI ESTATE v. THE ZAMINDAR OR PARLAKIMEDI AND THE BOARD OF
REVENUE, MADRAS, reported in (1944) I.L.R. 457 Madras.
57. With the advent of the Constitution in the post-colonial era, this issue came to be examined by a
Bench of 6-Judges of the Apex Court in the case of PROVINCE OF BOMBAY v. KHUSHALDAS S.
ADVANI AND OTHERS, reported in AIR 1950 SC 222, whereby a majority of 4:2 it was held that a
Writ of Certiorari cannot be issued against purely administrative action. The Court was considering
the provisions of Bombay Land Requisition Ordinance, 1947 where the judgment of the Bombay
High Court was reversed holding that such orders can be challenged by way of action at Common
Law and not by way of Writ of Certiorari. The said judgment, however, in its minority view as
expressed by Justice M.C. Mahajan and more extensively by Justice B.K. Mukherjea (as His
Lordship then was) held that in the performance of an executive action, the authority ought to apply
his __________ http://www.judis.nic.in mind to the materials before him and in that course it is
necessary that he should act in good faith and should not be influenced by any extraneous
consideration. The Hon’ble Judge then went on to explain the distinction between a judicial function
and an administrative function and then it was finally opined by the Hon’ble Judge that the High
Court was right in interfering by a Writ of Certiorari.
58. The said minority view, however, flowered later on with a little bit of expansion which came to
be considered by a 5-Judges Constitution Bench in the case of VEERAPPA PILLAI v. RAMAN &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 17
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
RAMAN LTD. AND OTHERS, AIR 1952 SC 192, as referred to in paragraph 20 of the said judgment.
59. The above said judgment was followed by the judgment in the case of ELECTION
COMMISSION, INDIA v. SAKA VENKATA SUBBA RAO AND OTHERS, AIR 1953 SC 210 where the
words “for any other purpose” occurring in Art.226 of Constitution of India was emphasized.
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in
60. The third decision that we would like to refer to is in the case of T.C. BASAPPA v. T. NAGAPPA
AND OTHERS, AIR 1954 SC 440 where the general principles as to when a Writ of Certiorari would
be available were explain in paragraphs 7 to 13 of the judgment. In that case the interference by the
High Court was reversed by the Apex Court.
61. Then came the 7-Judges Bench decision in the case of HARI VISHNU KAMATH v. SYED
AHMAD ISHAQUE AND OTHERS, AIR 1955 SC 233, where the scope of Certiorari was again
discussed in paragraphs 28 to 33 of the judgment.
62. In another Constitution Bench judgment in the case of SYED YAKOOB v. K.S.
RADHAKRISHNAN AND OTHERS, AIR 1964 SC 477, the Supreme Court has indicated in a matter
pertaining to the State Transport Appellate Tribunal that it had ignored material circumstance that
was germane to the question of public interest. It was further held that if the same had been placed
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in before the authorities concerned and if the same was ignored
or not investigated into by the said authorities then the High Court would have certainly had
jurisdiction under Art.226 of the Constitution of India to quash the order. This was described to be
an interference where an action is vitiated by an error of law on the face of the record.
63. As to what would be the scope of interference under Art.226 of the Constitution, a Full Bench of
the Allahabad High Court, while answering a reference, in the case of NANHA AND OTHERS v.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CONSOLIDATION, KANPUR AND OTHERS, AIR 1976 All. 91 held as
under:
“16. Since the High Court does not under Article 226 sit in appeal. It insists that the
inferior Court of Tribunal should consider all relevant aspects and evidence. If this is
not done, manifest error of law becomes apparent. The High Court then further
considers whether the omission by the inferior court is so blatant or palpable that
failure __________ http://www.judis.nic.in of justice has resulted.
17. Our answer to the question referred to us is-
“If it appears that a court of fact has in substance based its findings on no evidence or that its finding
is perverse in the sense that no reasonable person could possible come to that conclusion or that it
erroneously ignores a vital plea or material evidence which affects the result, a manifest error or law
apparent on the face of the record leading to failure of justice can be said to be established. But if a
court of a tribunal bases its finding on a consideration of all relevant evidence, but an appellate or a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 18
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
revisional court or tribunal while affirming the finding does not refer to some material or contrary
evidence in its order it cannot be said that it has been ignored from consideration so as to entitle the
High Court to interfere under Article 226 of the Constitution.” __________
http://www.judis.nic.in
64. The latest judgment that we could lay our hands on is by the Apex Court in the case of
GENERAL MANAGER, ELECTRICAL RENGALI HYDRO ELECTRIC PROJECT, ORISSA AND
OTHERS v. GIRIDHARI SAHU AND OTHERS, reported in (2019) 10 SCC 695 (Paragraph 28),
where the Apex Court, after tracing most of the judgments referred to hereinabove reaffirmed the
said principles and also held that a finding of fact which is not supported by any evidence would be
perverse and would constitute an error or law enabling a Writ Court to interfere in a Writ of
Certiorari.
65. There is a legal debate raised in this case about the issuance of a notice, which the appellant
alleges that even if it was issued, the same was in the name of a dead person, namely his father, who
had died in 1961.
66. Death brings about an extinction of human life. The same denotes lifelessness, which is an
inanimate state denoting the complete absence of life from a body. Once life terminates, the
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in person is no longer in physical existence.
67. It is in this context that we have to understand an intimation being given through a notice and
being despatched, contending that the notice had been issued and was served. A notice is an
information concerning a fact actually communicating to a party through an authorized person, or
received by a person from a proper source, or otherwise presumed in law to have been acquired by
him, which, in that case, would be recorded as equivalent to knowledge. The receipt of information
through a notice is the tendering of a fact about which the person concerned may have been
ignorant before. The purpose of a notice has diverse affects, as the notice to whom is tendered in
legal parlance is made subject to some action or charge or information to avoid any prejudice being
caused to him. In some cases, and according to the statute applicable, the notice also takes a certain
form containing descriptions that are required to be contained in a notice to enable a person to be
informed about such facts. Any inaccuracy __________ http://www.judis.nic.in in the notice can
also result in non-service, for example, the correct address having been not mentioned therein. Even
otherwise, the purpose of notice, if wrongly reflected, can cause prejudice to a person. The purpose
of a notice, therefore, is to enable the receiver to meet any encumbrance that might follow on no
response being given to a notice. In effect, a notice is a legal instrument to convey knowledge. It is,
therefore, a positive and express act.
68. A notice can be actual, constructive, implied, or if knowledge can be inferred from
circumstances, the same can also amount to a notice. It is, therefore, well known that the statutes
itself prescribe a mode of notice and a particular form of procedure. The tendering of a notice is not
a mere procedure, but it is one of the steps of compliance of the principles of natural justice that is
engrained in Article 14 of the constitution of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 19
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
69. At times, non service of notice and proceedings being taken ex-parte are declared to be non est
and a nullity, as the proceedings may have been conducted without any form of notice
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in or opportunity to enable the person affected to context the
notice. The issuance of a notice is, therefore, not an empty formality, but is a vital communicating
link in a legal process, where it ensures fairness. This fairness of procedure, particularly in matters
of deprivation of life, liberty and property, are well acknowledged and any prejudicial violation
thereof cannot be ignored. This is the underlying principle of audi alteram parterm to ensure
compliance of Principles of Natural Justice.
70. We may also point out that in matters of compulsory acquisition of land either for compensation
or even otherwise, a notice on a co-tenure holder may not amount to notice on all the co-tenure
holders unless it is established that the others had knowledge of the proceedings through a proper
procedure. Even if the other co-tenure holders, who are the purchasers, are treated to have been put
to valid notice or even if one of the co-tenure holders had appeared during the enquiry of the award
proceedings, the same cannot ipso facto establish that the aggrieved person was actually aware of
the proceedings and had knowledge of the same, __________ http://www.judis.nic.in yet he
deliberately absented to attend the proceedings.
71. In this regard, there are certain decisions which deserve to be taken notice of and are of
relevance in the event such a point is required to be decided, if the appellant's claim is found to
merit consideration.
72. A Full Bench of this Court in the case of P.C.Thanikavelu v. The Special Deputy Collector for
Land Acquisition, Madras and others, AIR 1989 Mad 222, considered the issue of the importance of
a notice under Section 5A of the 1894 Act. The Full Bench also noticed that in terms of Section 55 of
the 1894 Act, Rules were framed for the publication of notice. While considering the same, the Full
Bench also observed as under in paragraph (6):
“6. It is not in dispute that in all cases where emergency provisions are not invoked
and an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act is contemplated, the Collector causes
individual notices to be served on every person known or believed to be interested
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in in the land to be acquired. Normally, such
notices are sent to persons whose names are found recorded in the revenue records
as persons interested. But in several cases it may transpire that persons whose names
are found recorded in the revenue records as interested persons may cease to have
such interest by reason of transfers of the holding or otherwise. Nevertheless, no
mutation of names in the revenue records in favour of persons who have become
interested in the land might have been effected. The result is that the Collector may
cause individual notices to be served only on those persons whose names are found in
the revenue records, but who have ceased to be interested in the land. The result is
not far difficult to see. Such persons who have ceased to be interested in the land may
not respond to the notice, nor would they care to participate in the enquiry to be held
under Section 5A of the Act. In such cases, the statutory enquiry under Section 5A of
the Act which has not been dispensed with, would be completed without affording a

Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
reasonable opportunity to the persons who have an existing right in the land under
acquisition. Though it is incumbent upon the Revenue to keep their records up to
date by effecting mutation of __________ http://www.judis.nic.in names reflecting
the actual state of affairs by showing the persons really interested in the land in their
records, yet in a few cases it may so happen that the revenue records are not made up
to date and the person who is really interested in the land may not receive any notice
from the Collector for the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act. In such cases, if it is
brought to the notice of the Collector by the erstwhile land owner or by any other
person including the present owner thereof, of the names of interested persons, the
Collector as a statutory functionary cannot decline to afford an opportunity to the
person who is really interested in the land and, close the enquiry. When such
information is brought to the notice of the Collector, it is needless to say that the
principles of natural justice enjoin upon him an obligation to issue notice to the
person who is found to be really interested in the land even though his name may not
be found entered in the revenue records. It is true that the Government has the
prerogative to acquire lands belonging to individuals for a public purpose sanctioned
under the theory of 'eminent domain'. But the rule of law which governs and controls
the executive functions in the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in thread that
runs through the fabric of constitutional democracy, the rule of law behoves the
Government to act fairly and reasonably and the principles of natural justice are the
quintessence of such fair play and reasonableness. The decision reported in
Padmavathi v. State of Tamil Nadu (1978) 91 MLW 80 does not reflect the true
statement of law. The Supreme Court has held in Swadeshi Cotton Mills v.
Union of India, MANU/SC/0048/1981 : [1981]2SCR533 that even in the absence of
express reference to observance of principles of natural justice, such principles
should be followed whenever it affects the rights of parties. It cannot be gainsaid that
when the lands of an individual are acquired, albeit he may be paid compensation, his
civil rights may be affected. It is therefore elementary that, to be consistent with the
principles of natural justice, such a person should be put on notice before his lands
are acquired and his objection heard and considered. The enquiry contemplated
under Section 5A of the Act would be full and complete only when the person who is
really interested in the land is put on notice. But, at the same time, it is made clear
that individual notice is mandatory only to those persons whose names are found in
the revenue __________ http://www.judis.nic.in records or who are found by the
Collector as persons interested on information received through reliable source.”
73. A learned Single Judge in the case of Asiya Mariyan v. The Secretary to Government of Tamil
Nadu, 2000 (4) CTC 125, held as under:
“12. The perusal of both the Notifications show that the respondents have not applied
their mind and published the same hurriedly and mechanically.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 21
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
13. In a matter like this, particularly, when the Government wants to acquire the land
of citizen for public purpose, it is expected that details regarding ownership, extent.
Survey Number etc. are to be furnished in clear terms in all the notifications. I have
already demonstrated as to how the name of the petitioner is wrongly described both
in 4 (1) Notification and Section 6 Declaration.
14. I hold that misdescription of material particulars in the Notifications would go to
show that acquisition proceedings suffer from total non-application of mind
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in and the petitioner was denied her opportunity
to make effective objection as required.”
74. The principle of service of notice being the essence of the fairness of the acquisition proceedings
was reiterated by a learned Single Judge in the case of V.Devaraj and others v. The State of Tamil
Nadu and others, 2003 (4) CTC 134.
75. The Apex Court also took exception to proceedings being undertaken against a dead person in
the case of I.I.S.Employees' House Building Cooperative Society Limited v. State of Karnataka and
others, (2005) 12 SCC 483. The said judgment records that the notice had been issued to a dead
person and they went on to observe in paragraph (6) as follows:
“6. It is well established that a notification under S.4 of the Act is a preliminary
notification making it known to the landowners of the intention of the Government to
compulsorily acquire the land notified therein. The landowners can file objections
under S.5A of the Act __________ http://www.judis.nic.in (unless dispensed with
by invoking the provisions of S.17 of the Act) to the proposed acquisition. The
landowners are required to be given a personal hearing as well. After hearing the
landowners and considering the objections filed to the proposed acquisition, final
notification under S.6 of the Act is issued by the Government. While issuing the final
notification, the Government can leave a part of the land from the proposed
acquisition or acquire the entire land notified in the notification issued under S.4.
The land notified under S.6 of the Act would be the acquired land. In the notification
issued under S.4, the / 3 belonging to Respondent 2, whereas the same does not find
mention in the notification issued under S.6 of the Act. The contention of the
appellant is that Survey No. 91/3 instead of 90/3 has been mentioned due to a
typographical error or printing mistake. No corrigendum has been issued by the State
of Karnataka correcting the error or mistake, as alleged. This contention was raised
before the High Court as well which has been rejected by the High Court by giving
cogent reasons. We agree with the same.

76. Another Division Bench of this Court reiterated the same principle in the case of Savithiriammal
v. The State of Tamil Nadu and another, 2006 (3) MLJ 389.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 22
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
77. A learned Single Judge in the case of Goundathal and others v. Government of Tamil Nadu and
others, (2008) 3 MLJ 1339, following the aforesaid decisions held that the initial illegality in the
notification will result in an invalid award. In that case, the writ petitioner had appeared for the
award enquiry, but following the Full Bench decision, referred to herein above, the learned Single
Judge went on to hold that the acquisition proceedings were vitiated.
78. The same learned Single Judge reiterated the said position in Leelavathi v. The State of Tamil
Nadu, 2009 (3) CTC 490.
79. A Division Bench of this Court in the case of J.Doraibabu __________ http://www.judis.nic.in
and another v. State of Tamil Nadu and others, 2011 WLR 505, found that the notice sent to the
person concerned had been endorsed as left, whereas, as a matter of fact, he has died. The Court
commented upon it and held that the notice issued in the name of dead person is non est in law.
80. On the other hand, a Division Bench of this Court in Jayalakshmi v. The District Collector and
others [Judgment dated 29.7.2009 in W.A.No.550 of 2009] came to the conclusion that the normal
principle that the proceedings against the dead person is a nullity, cannot be imported in terms of
the 1894 Act, unless it is established that the factum of death was not brought to the notice of the
acquiring authority at the appropriate stage.
81. Another Division Bench decision in G.S.Gopalakrishnan and others v. Government of Tamil
Nadu and others, 2006 (4) CTC 757, which has been relied on by the learned counsel for the
respondents, also holds that the notice issued in the name of a __________
http://www.judis.nic.in dead person would not be a nullity and it observed in paragraphs (15) to
(17) as under:
“15. Thus, it could be seen from the law laid down by the Apex Court that a
distinction was always maintained between judicial/quasi-judicial proceedings and
other proceedings. In so far as the scheme of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is
concerned, it envisages various types of notices at various stages. Section 4(1)
notification is required to be gazetted followed by publication in two dailies having
circulation in the locality and a local publication. The opportunity provided under
Section 5-A is actually for 'persons interested' and not necessarily the land owners.
This enquiry is followed by a Section 6 declaration and the Act thus provides
innumerable opportunities to "persons interested" in objecting to the acquisition.
The Land Acquisition Act does not limit its reach to "owners of land", but enables any
person interested in the land to have a say. Moreover, the liability of the acquiring
authorities to serve a notice of enquiry is also restricted only to persons whose names
find a place in the revenue records. When the Act does not even make it obligatory for
the __________ http://www.judis.nic.in acquiring authorities to conduct a roving
enquiry to find out the actual owners, beyond the names reflected in the revenue
records, it cannot be expected of the acquiring authorities to find out if the patta
holder is alive or dead.

Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
16. In any event, in the case on hand, the Award itself was passed on 19.12.1991 and
as per the counter-affidavit filed by the respondents in the writ petition, the
possession was also taken on 13.8.1992. The appellants 1 to 3 herein purchased the
plots much after the Award enquiry under the sale deeds dated 26.10.1994, 28.9.1992
and 24.2.1993 respectively. Therefore, the appellants, who are subsequent
purchasers, are not entitled to maintain a challenge to the acquisition proceedings in
view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in U.P. Jal Nigam v. Kalra Properties
(P) Ltd.
MANU/SC/0310/1996 : [1996]1SCR683 .
17. Therefore in our considered opinion, the normal principle that proceedings against a dead
person are a nullity, cannot be imported to proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894,
unless it is established that the factum of death was brought to the notice of the acquiring
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in authorities at the appropriate stage. Hence, the order of the
learned Judge does not call for any interference and the writ appeal is dismissed without any order
as to costs. Consequently, connected WAMP is also dismissed.”
82. There are three other decisions of the Apex Court that need a reference. The first decision is in
the case of MAY GEORGE v. SPECIAL TAHSILDAR AND OTHERS, (2010) 13 SCC 98. In that case
on the facts that were traversed the Court held that non- compliance with Sec.9 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 was neither fatal nor did it visit any penalty and hence, it was held that it was
directory. However, in the case of J&K HOUSING BOARD AND ANOTHER v. KUNWAR SANJAY
KRISHAN KAUL AND OTHERS, (2011) 10 SCC 714, it was held, after noticing the above mentioned
judgment, that there was a mandatory nature of compliance with all three requirements of modes of
notice of acquisition as the consequences might end up in violation of Art.300-A of the Constitution.
The third decision that is worth noticing is that in the case of KULSUM R. NADIAWALA v. STATE
__________ http://www.judis.nic.in OF MAHARASHTRA AND OTHERS, (2012) 6 SCC 348. We
are mentioning the above said three cases for the sake of reference only as the same require
consideration in the even the matter is required to be examined from this point of view.
83. We are not entering into these questions, in as much as the matter is being remitted back to the
learned Single Judge for the reasons given herein before, particularly as mentioned in paragraphs
(49) and (50) of this judgment, and herein after, as also the law referred to herein above, and,
therefore, it will be open to the parties to contest this position on the basis of the said law in the
event the facts of the case require such an assessment.
84. In the light of what has been deliberated by us, we are of the considered opinion that the learned
Single Judge did not examine any of these factual or legal issues and now with the disclosure of
certain facts that have been placed before us, we find it expedient, and in the interest of justice, that
the same should be __________ http://www.judis.nic.in allowed to be contested before the
learned Single Judge with appropriate pleadings being placed on record. The learned single Judge,
while dismissing the Writ Petition does not appear to have appreciated the aforesaid principles and
non-adherence thereto vitiates the impugned judgment. Further, the respondents were also not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197433311/ 24
Ravisam vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 22 July, 2020
diligent in even filing a counter-affidavit before the learned single Judge which factor has also been
overlooked in the impugned judgment. The approach adopted by us is in order to uphold the
principles underlying the exercise of writ jurisdiction, which go to the extent of obliging us to
prevent any miscarriage of justice. Learned counsel appearing for all the parties agree that in the
light of the above, the matter deserves to be remitted back to the learned single Judge. Accordingly,
with their consent, we are proceeding to dispose of this Appeal.
85. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment dated 24.6.2019 as also
the order passed on the Review Application dated 26.8.2019, and restore the writ __________
http://www.judis.nic.in petition to its original number. Learned counsel for the parties agree that
the matter be disposed of within a reasonable time, as the acquisition of land is in relation to a
project which may be held up unnecessarily due to this long drawn litigation. We, therefore, request
the learned Single Judge to hear out the writ petition finally and if possible decide the same,
preferably within three months. Even though the learned Advocate General and the learned counsel
for the Housing Board have opposed the continuance of the stay order, we find it expedient that
since the appellant had an interim order in the writ petition since 26.2.2001, as modified on
5.2.2003 regarding possession, and which continued throughout the pendency of the writ petition,
the status quo as existing today should be maintained. We accordingly direct that the status quo as
exists today shall be maintained till the matter is disposed of finally by the learned single Judge. The
appellant as well as the respondents may file their composite set of affidavits and accompanying
documents before the learned Single Judge within ten days from today. The matter may be listed
before the learned Single Judge having the roster after 15 days. The learned Single __________
http://www.judis.nic.in Judge shall proceed to decide the matter afresh on the basis of whatever
material is placed before him independently. We should not be construed to have rendered any
opinion on the merits or otherwise of the claim of the appellant or the stand of the respondents. No
costs. Consequently, C.M.P.Nos.7390 of 2020 and 24418 of 2019 are closed.
