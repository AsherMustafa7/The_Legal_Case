Shri Jagdish Baheti, learned counsel for the applicant.

respondent No.1/State.

respondent No.2.

ORDER
(Passed on 20/06/2019) The applicant has preferred this petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
for quashment of FIR bearing Crime No. 156/2018 dated 03/08/2018 registered at
Police-station-Karhi, District-Khargone for the offence under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and
120(B) of the Cr.P.C.
2. Briefly stated facts of the case are that on 04/01/2018, respondent No.2-Jagdish Verma filed a
private complaint under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. against the applicant for the commission of
offence under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120(B) of the Cr.P.C. alleging that applicant was
posted as Chief Executive Officer, of Janpad Panchayat, Maheshwar and without getting any
sanction of construction work, he draw the amount from the Govt. funds and by preparing false
muster role, he show the payments to the labourer and got prepared forged M.Cr.C.33640/2018
Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
bill for purchasing building construction material. By doing this, he misused the Govt. money and
committed criminal breach of trust. After filing of the complaint, the learned Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Maheshwar directed to call the enquiry report from the police-station- Karhi and the
case was fixed on 27/01/2018 for receiving of the enquiry report. However, on 13/01/2018, an
application was filed by the respondent No.2 for early hearing of the case and the case was taken up
by the trial Court. He also filed an application under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. Learned
Magistrate taking a view that the respondent No..2 filed a complaint under Section 156(3) of the

Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
Cr.P.C., therefore, in the light of judgment of High Court passed in the Case of Papita Devi Vs.
Harish, 2012 Cr.L.J. 225, it will be appropriate to direct the police to initiate the enquiry under
Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. against the applicant and other co- accused persons. Therefore, earlier
order for calling the enquiry report was recalled and the police was directed to initiate enquiry in the
matter and submit its report or challan. On 03/02/2018 and 14/02/2018, respondent No.1
submitted that the enquiry will take time, therefore, the time was granted. However, on
28/07/2018, respondent No.2 has requested to the learned Magistrate to direct for registration of
the FIR against the applicant and the said request was accepted and on the direction of learned
Judicial Magistrate First Class, respondent No.1 has submitted the report on 03/08/2018 that FIR
has been registered. Thereafter, on the request of respondent No.2 matter was fixed on 22/09/2018
for monitoring the investigation. Meanwhile, M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. &
Ors.
applicant has preferred revision petition against the order dated 30/01/2018 passed by the JMFC,
whereby the police was directed to conduct investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C.,
however, said revision petition was dismissed, vide order dated 18/07/2018 by Additional District
Judge, Khargone (West Nimar). Being aggrieved with the aforesaid order, the applicant has
preferred this petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before this Court for quashment of FIR
bearing Crime No. 156/2018 dated 03/08/2018 registered at Police-station- Karhi,
District-Khargone for the offence under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120(B) of the Cr.P.C.
3. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Khargone is
having no jurisdiction to recalled its own order dated 04/01/2018, in which enquiry report was
directed to call from the respondent No.1. The Magistrate is having no authority or jurisdiction to
direct the police for registration of the FIR against the applicant and to make investigation in the
matter. Learned JMFC without conducting any preliminary enquiry in to the matter, directed the
police for registration of the FIR, which is contrary to the law. It is further submitted that the trial
Court has already directed the police for conducting the enquiry in the matter and the police was
requested for time to produce the enquiry report, therefore, the learned Magistrate has committed
error in directing the police for registration of the FIR against the applicant. It is further submitted
that the offence registered against the applicant is triable by Sessions Court, therefore, the
Magistrate should M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
have enquired the matter .
4. On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor supported the impugned order by submitting that
the learned Magistrate has not committed any error in directing the police for registration of the FIR
against the applicant. It is further submitted that for conducting the enquiry under Section 156(3) of
the Cr.P.C., FIR would be registered, but the police has not registered the FIR, therefore, the learned
Magistrate directed the Police for registration of the FIR by impugned order dated 28/07/2018.
Under these circumstances, he prayed for rejection of the petition.
5. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.

Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
6. The main contention raised by the learned counsel for the applicant is that the complaint was
filed by respondent No.2- Jagdish Verma for committing an offence under Sections under Sections
409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120(B) of the Cr.P.C., which is triable by Sessions Court, therefore, the
Magistrate has no power to direct the police to investigate the matter under Section 156(3) of the
Cr.P.C. For this purpose, learned counsel for the applicant has drawn attention of this Court to the
Proviso
(a) of Section 200 of the Cr.P.C., which reads as under:-
" Section 200 in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973
200. Examination of complainant. A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on
complaint shall examine upon oath the complainant and the witnesses present, if
any, and the substance of such examination shall be reduced to writing and shall be
signed by the complainant and the witnesses, and also by the Magistrate: Provided
that, when the complaint is made in writing, the Magistrate need not examine the
complainant and the witnesses-
(a) if a public servant acting or- purporting to act in the discharge of his official
M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
duties or a Court has made the complaint; or
(b) if the Magistrate makes over the case for inquiry or trial to another Magistrate
under section 192: Provided further that if the Magistrate makes over the case to
another Magistrate under section 192 after examining the complainant and the
witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re- examine them.
Section 202(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code is reproduced below:
"202. Postponement of issue of process.-- (1) Any Magistrate, on receipt of a
complaint of an offence of which he is authorised to take cognizance or which has
been made over to him under Section 192, may, if he thinks fit, and shall, in a case
where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he exercises his
jurisdiction, postpone the issue of process against the accused, and either inquire into
the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such
other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is
sufficient ground for proceeding:
Provided that no such direction for investigation shall be made,--
(a) where it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable
exclusively by the Court of Session; or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6941956/ 3
Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
(b) where the complaint has not been made by a Court, unless the complainant and
the witnesses present (if any) have been examined on oath under Section 200."
It may be pointed out that the words "and shall, in a case where the accused is residing at a place
beyond the area in which he exercises his jurisdiction" were inserted in the above section by way of
amendment by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005, with effect from 23 June
2006. The note for the above amendment in the Amending Bill read as follows:
"False complaints are filed against persons residing at far off places simply to harass
them. In order to see that innocent persons are not harassed by unscrupulous
persons, this clause seeks to amend sub-section (1) of Section 202 to make it
obligatory upon the Magistrate that before summoning the accused residing beyond
his jurisdiction he shall enquire into the case himself or direct investigation to be
made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, for finding out
whether or not there was sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused."
7. In the present case order passed by the Magistrate on 04/01/2018 while forwarding the complaint
to police to call the enquiry report on the matter and the case was fixed on 27/01/2018 for receiving
the enquiry report. On 13/01/2018, respondent No.1 moved an application for early hearing of the
case and the matter was taken up by the Magistrate on the same day. On this date complainant filed
an application under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. and the Court has forwarded the same to
M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
police for conducting an enquiry and submit its report . On 03/02/2018 and 14/02/2018,
respondent No.1 submitted that the enquiry will take time, therefore, the time was granted for
submitting the report. On 28/07/2018, on the request of respondent No.2, learned Magistrate
directed the police for registration of the FIR against the applicant and the case was fixed for
monitoring the investigation.
8. I have narrated the facts in detail as the present case, as I find exemplifies in enormous
magnitude to take recourse to Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., if it is a routine procedure.
9. The learned Magistrate, as I find, while exercising the power under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C.
has narrated the allegations and, thereafter, without application of mind, has passed an order to
register an FIR for the offence as mentioned in the application. The duty cast on the learned
Magistrate, while exercising power under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., cannot be marginalized. To
understand the real purport of the same, I think it apt to reproduce the said provision.
"156. Police officer's power to investigate congnizable case. -(1) Any officer in charge
of a police station may, without the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable
case which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such
station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.
(2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in
question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was no empowered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6941956/ 4
Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
under this section to investigate. (3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190
may order such an investigation as above-mentioned."
M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
10. The impugned order did not reflect that the learned Magistrate did apply the mind to the facts of
the case and the order passed is without any discussion and without giving any reason. It is clear
that the direction for registration of the FIR and investigation is without application of mind, hence,
it is invalid.
11. Dealing with the nature of power exercised by the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, a
three-Judge Bench in Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy and others v. V. Narayana Reddy and
others , 1976) 3 SCC 252 , had to express thus:
"It may be noted further that an order made under sub-section (3) of Section 156, is
in the nature of a peremptory reminder or intimation to the police to exercise their
plenary powers of investigation under Section 156(1). Such an investigation embraces
the entire continuous process which begins with the collection of evidence under
Section 156 and ends with a report or chargesheet under Section 173."
12 In Anil Kumar v. M.K. Aiyappa,(2013) 10 SCC 705 , the two- Judge Bench had to say this:
"The scope of Section 156(3) CrPC came up for consideration before this Court in
several cases. This Court in Maksud Saiyed [(2008) 5 SCC 668] examined the
requirement of the application of mind by the Magistrate before exercising
jurisdiction under Section 156(3) and held that where jurisdiction is exercised on a
complaint filed in terms of Section 156(3) or Section 200 CrPC, the Magistrate is
required to apply his mind, in such a case, the Special Judge/Magistrate cannot refer
the matter under Section 156(3) against a public servant without a valid sanction
order. The application of mind by the Magistrate should be reflected in the order. The
mere statement that he has gone through the complaint, documents and heard the
complainant, as such, as reflected in the order, will not be sufficient. After going
through the complaint, documents and hearing the complainant, what weighed with
the Magistrate to order investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC, should be reflected
in the order, though a detailed expression of his views is neither required nor
warranted. We have already extracted the order passed by the learned Special Judge
which, in our view, has stated no reasons for ordering investigation."
13. In Dilawar Singh v. State of Delhi,AIR 2007 S.C.3234 , this M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta
Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
Court ruled thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6941956/ 5
Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
"18. ...11. The clear position therefore is that any Judicial Magistrate, before taking
cognizance of the offence, can order investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code. If
he does so, he is not to examine the complainant on oath because he was not taking
cognizance of any offence therein. For the purpose of enabling the police to start
investigation it is open to the Magistrate to direct the police to register an FIR. There
is nothing illegal in doing so. After all registration of an FIR involves only the process
of entering the substance of the information relating to the commission of the
cognizable offence in a book kept by the officer in charge of the police station as
indicated in Section 154 of the Code. Even if a Magistrate does not say in so many
words while directing investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code that an FIR
should be registered, it is the duty of the officer in charge of the police station to
register the FIR regarding the cognizable offence disclosed by the complainant
because that police officer could take further steps contemplated in Chapter XII of
the Code only thereafter."
14. In CREF Finance Ltd. v. Shree Shanthi Homes (P) Ltd .,2005 (7) SCC 467 , the Court while
dealing with the power of Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences, has opined that having
considered the complaint, the Magistrate may consider it appropriate to send the complaint to the
police for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. And again:
"When a Magistrate receives a complaint he is not bound to take cognizance if the
facts alleged in the complaint disclose the commission of an offence. The Magistrate
has discretion in the matter. If on a reading of the complaint, he finds that the
allegations therein disclose a cognizable offence and the forwarding of the complaint
to the police for investigation under [pic]Section 156(3) will be conducive to justice
and save the valuable time of the Magistrate from being wasted in enquiring into a
matter which was primarily the duty of the police to investigate, he will be justified in
adopting that course as an alternative to taking cognizance of the offence itself. As
said earlier, in the case of a complaint regarding the commission of cognizable
offence, the power under Section 156(3) can be invoked by the Magistrate before he
takes cognizance of the offence under Section 190(1)(a). However, if he once takes
such cognizance and embarks upon the procedure embodied in Chapter XV, he is not
competent to revert back to the pre-cognizance stage and avail of
M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
Section 156(3)."
15 Recently, in Ramdev Food Products Private Limited v. State of Gujarat, 2015 (2) JBCJ 510 (SC),
while dealing with the exercise of power under Section 156(3) CrPC by the learned Magistrate, a
three-Judge Bench has held that:
".... the direction under Section 156(3) is to be issued, only after application of mind
by the Magistrate. When the Magistrate does not take cognizance and does not find it
necessary to postpone instance of process and finds a case made out to proceed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6941956/ 6
Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
forthwith, direction under the said provision is issued. In other words, where on
account of credibility of information available, or weighing the interest of justice it is
considered appropriate to straightaway direct investigation, such a direction is
issued. Cases where Magistrate takes cognizance and postpones issuance of process
are cases where the Magistrate has yet to determine "existence of sufficient ground to
proceed."
16. At this stage, I may usefully refer to what the Constitution Bench has to say in Lalita Kumari v.
Govt. of U.P., 2014(2) SCC 1 in this regard. The larger Bench had posed the following two
questions:-
"(i) Whether the immediate non-registration of FIR leads to scope for manipulation
by the police which affects the right of the victim/complainant to have a complaint
immediately investigated upon allegations being made; and
(ii) Whether in cases where the complaint/information does not clearly disclose the
commission of a cognizable offence but the FIR is compulsorily registered then does
it infringe the rights of an accused."
Answering the questions posed, the larger Bench opined thus: "49. Consequently, the condition that
is sine qua non for recording an FIR under Section 154 of the Code is that there must be information
and that information must disclose a cognizable offence. If any information disclosing a cognizable
offence is led before an officer in charge of the police station satisfying the requirement of Section
154(1), the said police officer has no other option except to enter the substance thereof in the
prescribed form, that is to say, to register a case on the basis of such information. The provision of
Section 154 of the Code is mandatory and the officer concerned is duty-bound to register the case on
the basis of information disclosing a cognizable [pic]offence. Thus, the plain words of Section 154(1)
of the Code have to be given their literal meaning. "Shall"
M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.
xxx xxx xxx xxx
72. It is thus unequivocally clear that registration of FIR is mandatory and also that it is to be
recorded in the FIR book by giving a unique annual number to each FIR to enable strict tracking of
each and every registered FIR by the superior police officers as well as by the competent court to
which copies of each FIR are required to be sent. "Information"
xxx xxx xxx xxx
111. The Code gives power to the police to close a matter both before and after investigation. A police
officer can foreclose an FIR before an investigation under Section 157 of the Code, if it appears to
him that there is no sufficient ground to investigate the same. The section itself states that a police
officer can start investigation when he has "reason to suspect the commission of an offence".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6941956/ 7
Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
Therefore, the requirements of launching an investigation under Section 157 of the Code are higher
than the requirement under Section 154 of the Code. The police officer can also, in a given case,
investigate the matter and then file a final report under Section 173 of the Code seeking closure of
the matter. Therefore, the police is not liable to launch an investigation in every FIR which is
mandatorily registered on receiving information relating to commission of a cognizable offence.
xxx xxx xxx xxx
115. Although, we, in unequivocal terms, hold that Section 154 of the Code postulates the mandatory
registration of FIRs on receipt of all cognizable offences, yet, there may be instances where
preliminary inquiry may be required owing to the change in genesis and novelty of crimes with the
passage of time. One such instance is in the case of allegations relating to medical negligence on the
part of doctors. It will be unfair and inequitable to prosecute a medical professional only on the
basis of the allegations in the complaint."
After so stating the constitution Bench proceeded to state that where a preliminary enquiry is
necessary, it is not for the purpose for verification or otherwise of the information received but only
to ascertain whether the information reveals any cognizable offence. After laying down so, the larger
Bench proceeded to state:-
"120.6. As to what type and in which cases preliminary inquiry is to be conducted will
depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The category of cases in which
preliminary inquiry may be made are as under:
(a) Matrimonial disputes/family disputes
(b) Commercial offences
(c) Medical negligence cases
(d) Corruption cases
(e) Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, for
example, over 3 months' delay in M.Cr.C.33640/2018 Sacchin Gupta Vs. State of
M.P. & Ors.
reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay. The aforesaid are only
illustrations and not exhaustive of all conditions which may warrant preliminary inquiry. 120.7.
While ensuring and protecting the rights of the accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry
should be made time-bound and in any case it should not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and
the causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary entry." I have referred to the aforesaid
pronouncement for the purpose that on certain circumstances the police is also required to hold a
preliminary enquiry whether any cognizable offence is made out or not.

Sachin Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 June, 2019
17. In the context of the aforesaid pronouncements and considering the totality of the facts and
circumstances of the case, this Court is of the view that this is a fit case for quashing the order
passed by the learned Magistrate for directing the police to register the FIR against the applicant
and investigate the matter. Resultantly, this petition is allowed and the impugned order is hereby
quashed. Case is remitted back to the learned Magistrate and he is directed to call the enquiry report
regarding the allegations made in the complaint as directed, vide order dated 04/01/2018 and
thereafter, passed an appropriate order in accordance with law.
18. Let a copy of this order be sent to the concerned Magistrate for information and necessary
compliance.
Certified copy as per rules.
