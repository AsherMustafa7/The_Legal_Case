IN LAW.
THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED
FOR ORDERS ON 09.11.2022, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
5
ORDER
The petitioners are before this Court calling in question order dated 08-07-2022 passed by the 2nd
respondent/Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies and District Registrar of Societies ('the
District Registrar' for short) and have sought several directions by issuance of a writ in the nature of
mandamus.
2. Heard Sri G.V.Chandrashekar, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners; Smt. Rashmi
Patel, learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for respondents 1 and 2; Sri Pawan
Shyam, learned counsel for respondent No.3; Sri K.V. Dhananjay, learned counsel appearing for
respondent No.4; Sri Sudarshan Suresh, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.5;
Sri Sushanth V.A., learned counsel appearing for respondents 6 to 9, 11 and 12 and Sri E.P.
Raghavendra, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.10.
3. Shorn of unnecessary details, the core facts required are as follows:
The 4th respondent is the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce ('Film Chamber'
for short). Elections to the said Film Chamber were to be conducted on 28-05-2022
for the tenure of 2022-23. The 1st petitioner was a contestant to the post of President
in the Producers Sector and the 2nd petitioner was a contestant to the post of
Treasurer and the 3rd petitioner was a contestant for the post of Secretary. The
elections were held on 28-05-2022. The petitioners alleging that the conduct of
election was illegal, improper and seeped in fraud on various grounds had registered
a complaint before the 2nd respondent/District Registrar.
The allegations, inter alia, included fraud played by the Returning Officer. This comes
to be rejected by the 2nd respondent in terms of his order dated 8-07-2022 and
rejection of the said complaint of the petitioners and consequent continuation of the
newly elected committee drove the petitioners to this Court in the subject petition.
The petitioners have also sought at the hands of this Court by way of a writ in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 4
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
nature mandamus to declare the elections held to be illegal and void with a
consequent direction to conduct fresh elections to the Film Chamber.
4. This Court, having entertained the petition, at the outset, had passed an interim order that the
Executive Committee constituted pursuant to the said elections shall not take major decisions
involving finances or policies till the next date of hearing.
The said interim order is in operation even as on date.
5. The learned senior counsel for the petitioners would give up the prayers with regard to validity,
veracity and conduct of elections and a direction that is sought for conduct of fresh elections. He
would restrict his prayer to the order that was passed by the District Registrar declining to accept
the complaint and initiate enquiry under Section 25 of the Karnataka Societies Registration Act,
1960 ('the Act' for short).
5.1. The learned counsel taking this Court to the averments made in the petition as also to the
documents appended to the petition seeks to contend that the conduct of elections was completely
contrary to law as there was non-display and disclosure of voters list as mandated in law on the
notice board. Disclosure of voters list was not made to the candidates, rigging of election was in
large scale, respondents 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12 got elected with the support of certain persons whose
identity cards have not been checked for them to be voters or otherwise, there was undue illegal
influence of certain powerful political members who are named in the petition and so on and so
forth. All these form part of a complaint before the District Registrar. The District Registrar ought to
have taken note of the said complaint and ought to have conducted an inquiry declaring the
elections to be null and void and ordered conduct of fresh elections. He would place reliance upon a
judgment of the co-ordinate Bench of this Court in ADVOCATES' ASSOCIATION, BANGALORE v.
THE DISTRICT REGISTRAR AND REGISTRAR OF SOCIETIES - (2006) 4 KLJ 526 to buttress his
submission that an inquiry under Section 25 of the Act can be made by the District Registrar by
entering into the veracity of the election as well.
6. On the other hand, the learned counsel Sri K.V. Dhananjay representing the 4th respondent
would contend with vehemence that the petition itself is not maintainable, as by, calling in question
the order of the 2nd respondent/District Registrar, what is called in question is the election itself.
These issues which are in the realm of disputed questions of fact would need evidence and therefore,
election petition ought to have been filed and not a writ petition and above all, the interim order has
rendered the Executive Committee appointed pursuant to the election spineless, as the interim
order takes away the functioning of the elected body. He would seek to place reliance upon the
judgment rendered by the Full Bench of the High Court of Madras interpreting Tamil Nadu Societies
Registration Act, 1975 which is in pari materia with the Act and the judgment of the Apex Court
noticing/affirming Full Bench judgment of the Madras High Court.
7. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
and have perused the material on record.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 5
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
8. Though several submissions are made on merits of the matter, consideration of those
submissions would arise only if the petition is held to be maintainable, as the issue of
maintainability, in the case at hand cuts at the root of the matter. If the petition is held to be
maintainable, all other submissions would be considered and if it is not, it would lead to a disposal
lock-stock and barrel.
Therefore, I deem it appropriate to consider the issue of maintainability at the threshold.
9. To consider whether the doors of this Court are closed, ajar or opened to the issue that is brought
before it, the link in the chain of events is required to be noticed qua the allegations. The afore-
narrated fact of conduct of elections to the posts of office bearers of Film Chamber is not in dispute.
The petitioners were the contestants in the said election to the posts narrated hereinabove is also
not in dispute. The allegation by the petitioners, as could be gathered from the pleadings in the
petition is that there were large scale irregularities in the conduct of elections. Therefore, it becomes
germane to notice the averments as to what the petitioner want at the hands of this Court.
Paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the petition read as follows:
3) That the very conduct of said elections to KFCC is improper, illegal, undemocratic
and fraudulent. There are ready references such as Non-display and disclosure of
voters list as mandated in the KFCC notice board, at the notice board of polling
station, disclosure of voter list not made to candidates and voters during the
elections, Non-obtainment of voters' signature in the counterfoil and counting votes
was done in the absence of candidates in spite of candidates, petitioners volunteering
to be the witness for counting the same was denied, evidence of huge election
malpractice and corrupt election processes that has taken place in the said elections.
4) That as against the use of authorized, sanctioned and procedural practice of voting
machines in this elections, the ballot papers method was used, this illegal act of
conducting elections is against the resolution passed by respondent No.5.
The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce - Executive Committee meeting dated 5.05.2022, even
the printing of ballot papers were done by concealing the place, quantity and time of printing the
ballot papers. (True copy of Executive Committee Resolution by respondent No.5 dated 5-05-2022
is annexed as Annexure-B).
5) That rigging has taken place in the elections in favour of the Respondent Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 & 12.
The identity cards were not checked for the voters to promote rigging of votes, the entire process of
conducting the said election is totally against the bye-laws of Karnataka Film Chamber of
Commerce, its object and vision, the said elections were conducted in arbitrary, biased and
undemocratic manner of conducting elections of a democratic society registered under 'The
Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960'.

Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
6) That there was undue illegal presence of politically powerful members of KFCC, Smt. Jayamala,
Sri S.A. Chinne Gowda, Sri Basanth Kumar Patil were at the venue of voting, they have influenced
voters to cast vote in favour of respondent Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 & 12 on the Election Day in the very
venue of elections for more than 1 hour 20 minutes. Politically motivated statements, assurances
and offers to the voters by the agents of respondents No.3 and 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 & 12 have unduly
influenced and illegally motivated voters to vote for their supported candidates against the very
basic principles of general model code of elections, it is also a matter of fact that respondent No.5.
Sri Ba.Ma.Harish who is present disputed president of KFCC who is elected with corrupt methods
and his brother were present inside the election venue on the election process of voting and were
continuously seeking votes and influencing the voters to vote in their favour which is unlawful of
procedure of election conduct, the ballot papers were mismanaged, visibly damaged torn in the said
venue of elections, additionally it is said that the highly influential political party who is in the power
of ruling Government, a sitting Minister in the State Government has illegally influenced and
remote controlled the said election. It is beyond any doubt the said elections were conducted in
highly suspicious and atrocious manner. "
(Emphasis added) The narration in the afore-quoted paragraphs, out of many, are
that there were large scale rigging in the elections and several illegalities and
irregularities. Voter list was not notified on the notice board as was required and
there were votes which were cast with undue influence and illegally motivated by
such persons and the President was elected by indulging in corrupt practices in the
election. Saying so, at paragraph 7 onwards the attack is on the Returning Officer
again in the conduct of elections. Therefore, the pleading of the petitioners is
shrouded with allegations of corrupt practices, rigging and all other traits that would
require a consideration for annulling the elections.
10. The petitioners, with the above allegations, go before the 2nd respondent/District
Registrar by registering a complaint and seeking enquiry to be held into the conduct
of election on 07-06- 2022. Based on the said complaint, a notice was issued on
14-06- 2022 directing appearance of the 4th respondent. The matter was taken up on
28-06-2022 and an interim order was passed directing that no major decisions shall
be taken by the Committee. The interim order reads as follows:

Finally, the District Registrar who had passed the interim order as aforementioned, in terms of his
final order dated 08-07-2022 rejects the complaint holding that the allegations made would become
an election petition and for consideration of an election petition, the District Registrar has no
jurisdiction and the matter has to be pursued before the competent civil Court. The order reads as
follows:

It is this order that drives the petitioners to this Court in the subject petition. Since there was an
interim order throughout the pendency of proceedings before the District Registrar, this Court
entertained the petition and granted interim order that is in subsistence at the outset.
11. As observed hereinabove, the senior learned counsel for the petitioners gives up the prayer with
regard to declaration of elections to be null and void and a prayer for re-election. He restricts his
submission to the complaint registered before the District Registrar and the impugned order where
he says that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition which is akin to election petition.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to notice Section 25 of the Act. Section 25 of the Act reads as
follows:
"25. Enquiry by the Registrar, etc. - (1) The Registrar may on his own motion and
shall on the application of the majority of the members of the governing body or of
not less than one-third of the members of the society, hold an enquiry or direct some
person authorised by him by order in writing in accordance with the rules made in
this behalf to hold an enquiry into the constitution, working and financial condition
of a registered society.
(2) The Registrar or the person authorised by him under sub-section (1) shall have
the following powers, namely,-
(a) he shall, at all reasonable times, have free access to the books, accounts,
documents, securities, cash and other properties belonging to or in the custody of the
society and may summon any person in possession or responsible for the custody of
any such books, accounts, documents securities, cash or other properties to produce
the same at any place at the headquarters of the society or any branch thereof;
(b) he may summon any person who, he has reason to believe, has knowledge of any
of the affairs of the society to appear before him at any place at the headquarters of
the society or any branch thereof and may examine such person on oath;
(c)(i) he may, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any rule or
regulation prescribing the period of notice for a general meeting of the society,
require the governing body of the society to call a general meeting at such time and
place at the headquarters of the society or any branch thereof and to determine such
matters as may be directed by him. If the governing body of the society refuses or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 10
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
fails to call a meeting, he shall have power to call it himself;
(ii) any meeting called under sub-clause (i) shall have all the powers of a general
meeting called under the rules or regulations of the society and its proceedings shall
be regulated by such rules or regulations;
(iii) when an enquiry is made under this section, the Registrar shall communicate the
result of the enquiry to the society concerned."
(Emphasis supplied) Section 25 deals with an inquiry by the Registrar on his own or on an
application by majority members of the Governing Body or not less than 1/3rd members of the
Society to hold an inquiry or direct some person to hold an inquiry with regard to constitution,
working and financial condition of the Society. It is seeking to conduct an inquiry in the conduct of
elections, the petitioners registered a complaint. The narration in the complaint is what is found in
the averments in the petition which are quoted hereinabove, all of which would undoubtedly require
evidence and considering the evidence of the kind that the petitioners had sought, in the considered
view of this Court, would not be within the realm or jurisdiction of the District Registrar, as it would
become a power akin to the civil Court in deciding an election petition after recording of evidence,
which power admittedly the District Registrar does not possess under the statute.
12. It is germane to notice the Full Bench judgment of the High Court of Madras in
C.M.S.EVANGELICAL SUVI DAVID MEMORIAL HIGHER SECONDARY SCHOOL COMMITTEE
v. THE DISTRICT REGITRAR CHERANMAHADEVI1. The High Court of Madras was interpreting
Section 36 of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act which is verbatim similar to Section 25 of
the Act quoted hereinabove. The Full Bench has held as follows:
"11. Chapter IV relates to Inspection, Inquiry, Cancellation, Winding up and appeal of
a society. Section 36 relates to the power of the Registrar to inquire into the affairs of
the registered society and the said Section reads thus:
36. Power of the Registrar to enquire into the affairs of registered society: (1) The
Registrar may, of his own motion or on the application of a majority of the members
of the committee of a registered society or on the application of not less than one
third of the members of that registered society, or if so moved by the District
Collector hold 2005(2) CTC 161 or direct some person authorized by the Registrar by
order in writing in this behalf to hold, an enquiry, into the constitution working and
financial condition of that registered society.
(2) An application to the Registrar under sub-section (2) shall be supported by such evidence as the
Registrar may require for the purpose of showing that the applicants have good reason for applying
for an inquiry.
(3) The Registrar may require the applicants under sub- section (1) to furnish such security as he
thinks fit for the costs of the proposed inquiry, before the inquiry is held.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 11
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
(4) All expenses of, and incidental or preliminary to, the inquiry shall, where such inquiry is held:
(a) on application, be defrayed by the applicants therefor or out of the assets of the
registered society or by the members or officers of the registered society, in such
proportions as the Registrar may, by order in writing, direct, and
(b) on the District Collector's or Registrars motion, be defrayed out of the assets of
the registered society, and shall be recoverable as an arrear of land revenue.
(5) An order made under sub-section (4) shall on application, be enforced by any
Civil Court having local jurisdiction in the same manner as a decree of such Court (6)
A person holding an inquiry under this Section shall at all reasonable times have free
access to all the books, accounts and documents of the registered society, and shall
have the power to call upon, the registered society and the officers of society to
produce such books, accounts and documents and furnish statements and other
information in relation to its business as he may direct.
(7) It shall be the duty of all persons who are or have been officers of the registered
society to furnish the inquiring officer with all the books, accounts and documents in
their custody or power relating to the registered society.
(8) A person holding an inquiry under this Section may summon any person, who he
has reason to believe, has knowledge of any of the affairs of the registered society and
may examine such person on oath and may summon any person to produce any
books, accounts or documents belonging to him or in his custody if the person
holding the inquiry has reason to believe that such books, accounts or documents
contain any entries relating to transactions of the registered society.
(9) The result of the inquiry shall be communicated to the registered society and to
the applicants, if any, and if the Registrar is satisfied that the result of the inquiry
does not warrant action under Section 37, he may issue such direction to the
registered society, or any member of the registered society, as the Registrar may
deem fit.
12. Rule 15 contemplates that the notice of the situation of a registered society and of any change
thereof shall be in form V and the same shall be filed with the Registrar within three months from
the date of registration of the society or after the date of change as the date may be. Rule 16
contemplates that the registered society register the members of specified in sub-section (1) of
Section 14 shall be in Form VI. Section 14(1) contemplates that every registered society shall
maintain a register containing the names, addresses and occupations of its members. By virtue of
the above Rules, Form V and Form VII are to be maintained by the registered society itself.
13. In terms of sub-rule (1) of Rule 17, the registered society shall file with the Registrar within one
month from the date of registration of the society, a copy of the register of members maintained by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 12
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
the society. In case any change among the members of the society or the committee in terms of sub-
rule (2) of Rule 17, notice of such change shall be filed in Form No. VII within three months from the
date of such change to the Registrar. The said notice of change shall be accompanied by the
resolution of the meeting effecting such change.
14. Form VII contains the name of the society, date of registration, the year of registration and the
details of change. Filing of the said Form is in order to ensure that such change in the committee or
the members is entered in the register maintained in the office of the Registrar as maintenance of
such record is compulsory.
15. For the purpose of such registration when Form No. VII is filed, the Registrar shall necessarily
satisfy himself as to whether the particulars furnished in Form No. VII are true and correct.
16. Under sub-section(1) of Section 36, the Registrar may of his own motion or on the application of
a majority of the members of the Committee of a registered society or on the application of not less
than one third of the members of that registered society or if so moved by the District Collector hold
or direct some person authorised by the Registrar by order in writing in this behalf to hold, an
inquiry into the constitution, working and financial condition of that registered society. It is argued
that in view of the word "into the constitution" employed in Section 36, the power of the Registrar to
inquire into the affairs of the society shall include the power to inquire into the election of members.
It is further argued that in terms of sub- section (9) of Section 36 of the Act, the power of the
Registrar to enquire into the affairs of the society shall also include such direction to hold fresh
election as well.
17. A conspicuous reading of the above mentioned provisions show that the Act is intended to
regulate the affairs of the society in accordance with the provisions contained therein and the rules
made thereunder and that the registration is made compulsory on certain contingency and for its
enforcement the provisions confer only the administrative power of the Registrar to ensure that the
registered society to function strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Act or the Rules made
thereunder, more particularly for maintenance of accounts for audit purpose; framing of bye-laws in
conformity with the object of the society for which it is formed and registered; in respect of
application of funds of the registered society, conduct of annual General Meetings and extraordinary
general meeting and amalgamation and division of registered societies. The Registrar has power to
direct the registered society to furnish in writing such information or explanation in respect of any
document which the registered society is required to file with him.
18. The power of the Registrar to enquire into the affairs of the society is only to hold a summary
inquiry for his own satisfaction. The said power cannot be construed as the power of appeal. Under
Section 36, the Registrar has not been empowered to adjudicate upon the conflicting claims to
represent the society based upon question of fact. A plain reading of Section 36 shows that the
Registrar could look only the provisions of the Act and the Rules and prima facie materials to arrive
at a conclusion either to believe or not to believe Form No. VII in order to effect change in the
register. The power of the Registrar to call for information and explanation under Section 34 does
not contemplate any power to examine witnesses or to allow opportunity for cross examination of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 13
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
witnesses. The power in our view is incidental and it is only for the purpose of maintaining correct
records. As the power to conduct inquiry is only limited in order to find out whether constitution of
members are valid, the inquiry is limited only for the purpose of making entries in the register.
However, the exercise of power must not be arbitrary as the orders passed or directions issued by
the Registrar is amenable to challenge in the Writ Jurisdiction.
19. In this context it could also be kept in mind the intention of the Legislature not to confer a power
of supersession of the Committee on the Registrar as by insertion of Tamil Nadu Act 16 of 1994, such
power is vested only in the Government and even when the Registrar is satisfied after enquiry under
Section 36 that the society which has contravened any of the provisions of the Act or the Rules made
thereunder or the society is insolvent or must necessarily become so or that the business of any such
registered society is conducted fraudulently or not in accordance with the bye-laws or the objects
specified in the memorandum filed with the Registrar, he may only cancel the registration.
20. As the power of the Registrar to hold enquiry is only to arrive at a prima facie conclusion as to
the correctness of the particulars given in Form VII, the provision of sub-section (9) of Section 36
should also be understood to mean that he could issue such directions to the registered society or
any of the member of the society only with reference to the details furnished in Form VII. It must
also be borne in mind that the enquiry under Section 36 is not only limited to the regular affairs of
the society and such affairs not only include the constitution of a registered society but also to the
working and financial condition, and hence the power of the Registrar to issue such direction under
sub-section (9) of Section 36 of the Act, in regard to the constitution of the registered society must
be understood in the context of Form VII. Section 14 obligates the registered society to maintain a
register containing the names, addresses and occupations of its members. Section 15 further
mandates such registered society shall file with the Registrar a copy of the register maintained by it
under Section 14 and from time to time file with the Registrar notice of any change among the
members of the committee. In the absence of failure to comply with Section 14, the Registrar could
only resort to to the power under Section 37 to cancel the registration. Hence, the power under
sub-section (9) of Section 36 cannot be stretched to a power on the Registrar to direct the registered
society to hold fresh election. A direction to hold fresh election would amount to indirectly setting
aside the earlier election and such power is not conferred on the Registrar under any of the
provisions of the Act. So long as the election is not declared invalid in the manner known to law, no
direction for fresh election could be ordered. Validity of the election could very well be decided only
by the competent Civil Court as the parties are entitled to let in their evidence to sustain their
respective claims. In the event the Registrar satisfies himself as to the particulars furnished in Form
VII as correct, he should enter the names in the register maintained for that purpose. In the event if
he does not satisfy as to the particulars and thereby does not accept Form VII, he has to issue a
direction relegating the parties to approach the Civil Court for appropriate orders and thereafter
shall act as per the orders of the Civil Court. Accordingly, the issue is answered. Post the Writ
Appeals for disposal accordingly."
(Emphasis supplied) The Full Bench clearly holds that the Registrar cannot hold an inquiry under
Section 36 of the Act therein to consider a petition which is akin to challenging the allegations. The
Court holds that the power of the Registrar therein cannot be stretched to annulling an election or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 14
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
giving a direction to hold fresh elections, as the Registrar therein had directed conduct of fresh
election which would amount to indirectly setting aside the earlier election and such power was not
conferred upon the Registrar. The Apex Court in a judgment rendered later, notices the full Bench
judgment (supra) with approval in S.DAVID STEPHEN AND OTHERS v.
C.M.S.E.S.D. MEMO.HR.SEC.SCHO.COMMT AND OTHERS2. The Apex Court has held as follows:
"We have heard Mr. R.Balasubramanian, learned senior counsel for the appellants,
and Mr.C.Selvaraju, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.1.
Civil Appeal No.5989-5991 of 2009 decided on 20-03-2012
2. The controversy in these appeals relates to Form-VII under the Tamil Nadu
Societies Registration Rules (for short, 'the 1978 Rules') submitted by the appellants
on the one hand and the respondent No.1 on the other. Rule 17(2) of the 1978 Rules
provides that notice of any change among the members of the society or of the
committee shall be filed in Form No.VII within three months of such change. From
1999 onwards the dispute between the appellants and the respondent No.1 pertaining
to the election of the members of the society and of the committee of the respondent
No.1 society has been going on. The matter has been considered by the single Judge,
Division Bench and Full Bench on different occasions. The present appeal arises from
the order dated October, 31,2008 passed by the Mudurai Bench, High Court of
Madras.
3. The Full Bench of the High Court in Writ Petition Nos.2969 of 2001, 331 of 2002,
170 and 217 of 2004 in C.M.S. Evangelical Suvi David Memorial Higher Secondary
School Committee Karisal v. The District Registrar, Cheranmahadevi, Tirunelveli
District and others, decided on March 23, 2005 case reported in (2005) 2 M.L.J. 335)
held as follows:
".....Validity of the election could very well be decided only by the competent Civil
Court as the parties are entitled to let in their evidence to sustain their respective
claims. In the event the Registrar satisfies himself as to the particulars furnished in
Form VII as correct, he should enter the names in the register maintained for that
purpose. In the event if he does not satisfy as to the particulars and thereby does not
accept Form VII, he has to issue a direction relegating the parties to approach the
Civil Court for appropriate orders and thereafter shall act as per the orders of the
Civil Court...."
4. So far there has been no adjudication of the validity of the election of the members of the society
or of the committee which took place in 1999, 2006 and 2009 by the civil court although no more
than one occasion the District Registrar has gone into the said question.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 15
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
5. The learned senior counsel for the appellants and the respondent No.1 and the learned counsel for
the State are ad idem that validity of the election of the members of the Society or of the Committee
can only be adjudicated by the competent civil Court and no other forum. They also do not dispute
the correctness of the exposition of the law by the Full Bench in C.M.S. Evangelical Suvi David
Memorial Higher Secondary School Committee Karisal (supra) as noted above.
6. We are informed by Mr. Balasubramanian, learned senior counsel for the appellants that the last
notice of change in Form VII of the 1978 Rules was submitted by the appellants in the month of
June, 2010 but in view of the pendency of the appeals before this Court, the Registrar has returned
Form VII to the appellants.
7. Mr. C.Selvaraju, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.1, submitted that the respondent
No.1 filed Form VII before the Registrar on January 23, 2012 which is pending and no decision has
been taken thereon so far.
8. After arguing the matter for some time, the learned senior counsel for the appellants and learned
senior counsel for the respondent No.1 agreed for the following order:
(i) The appellants may re-submit Form VII, which was returned to them, to the
District Registrar, Cheranmahadevi, Tirunelveli within two weeks from to-day.
(ii) The District Registrar, Cheranmahadevi, Tirunelveli shall then hold an enquiry
into the matter and satisfy himself as regards the particulars furnished in Form VII
(re re-submission) by the appellants and Form VII submitted on January 23, 2012 by
the respondent.
(iii) After the completion of the enquiry, if the District Registrar accepts one of such
Forms, the aggrieved party shall be at liberty to approach the civil Court for
appropriate orders.
(iv) In case the District Registrar is not satisfied with the particulars in Form VII
submitted by the appellants as well as the respondent No.1 and does not accept any of
these Forms, both the parties shall be at liberty to approach the civil Court for
redressal of their grievance.
(v) The District Registrar shall abide by the decree/ order that may be passed by the
civil Court in the matter.
9. Mr. B.Balaji, learned counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu, has no objection to the above agreed
order.
10. Consequently, the appeals are disposed of in terms of the above agreement. It is directed that the
District Education Officer, Cheranmahadevi at Tirunelveli shall manage and administer the society
(respondent No.1) and the Schools till decision of the civil Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 16
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
11. Interlocutory application Nos. 7-9 of 2009 stand disposed of.
12. Needless to say that the enquiry by the District Registrar and the adjudication by civil Court shall
be uninfluenced by the impugned judgment."
(Emphasis supplied) It is further germane to notice that the co-ordinate Bench of this Court in
MR.K.NARAYANA v. DISTRICT REGISTRAR (CIRCLE-
2) AND ANOTHER3 has held as follows:
"Petitioner is knocking at the doors of writ court for laying a challenge to the
endorsement dated 13-09-2022, issued by respondent No.1-District Registrar
(Circle-2), a copy whereof is at Annexure-A. It reads as under:
..... .....
W.P.No.19281 of 2022 decided on 26-09-2022
2. In more or less similar matters this Court has taken the view, as rightly contended
by learned HCGP appearing for the Registrar, that in matters of this nature involving
disputes to the validity of election to a Society which does not answer the description
of other authorities under Article 12 of the Constitution of India, have to be worked
out elsewhere, arguably before the Civil Court. This Court is in complete agreement
with the submission of learned HCGP and therefore, declines indulgence.
In the above circumstances, writ petition is disposed off. To facilitate availments of
alternate remedy, the official respondents are directed to preserve all the election
material including the ballot papers in question for a period of three months
reckoned from this day."
(Emphasis supplied)
13. On a coalesce of the judgments rendered by the Full Bench of High Court of Madras, the Apex
Court later affirming the judgment of the Full Bench and the judgment of the co-ordinate Bench,
what would unmistakably emerge is that the District Registrar cannot assume power of a civil Court
to consider the importance of evidence in election matters in the garb of conducting enquiry under
Section 25 of the Act. Conduct of elections or declaration of elected candidates or a direction seeking
holding of fresh election will have to be before the competent civil Court. It is further germane to
notice the judgment rendered by the co-
ordinate Bench in the case of AMIYA VILAS SWAMI AND OTHERS v. SHANKHA BRITA DAS AND
OTHERS4 wherein it is held as follows:-
"32. Section 25 of the Act reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 17
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
25. Enquiry by the Registrar, etc.--(1) The Registrar may on his own motion and shall
on the application of the majority of the members of the governing body or of not less
than one-third of the members of the society, hold an enquiry or direct some person
authorised by him by order in writing in accordance with the rules made in this
behalf to hold an enquiry into the Constitution, working and financial condition of a
registered society.
(2) The Registrar or the person authorised by him under sub-section (1) shall have the following
powers, namely.--
(a) he shall, at all reasonable times, have free access to the books, accounts, documents, securities,
cash and other properties belonging to or in the custody of the society and may summon any person
in possession or responsible for the custody of any such books, accounts, documents, securities, cash
or other properties to produce the same at any place at the headquarters of the society or any branch
thereof;
(b) he may summon any person who, he has reason to believe, has knowledge of any of the affairs of
the society to appear before him at any place at the headquarters of the society or any branch thereof
and may examine such person on oath;
(c)(i) he may, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any rule or regulation
prescribing the period of notice for a general meeting of the society, require the governing body of
the society to call a general meeting at (2008) 3 KLJ 16 such time and place at the headquarters of
the society or any branch thereof and to determine such matters as may be directed by him. If the
governing body of the society refuses or fails to call a meeting, he shall have power to call it himself;
(ii) any meeting called under sub-clause (i) shall have all the powers of a general meeting called
under the rules or regulations of the society and its proceedings shall be regulated by such rules or
regulations;
(iii) when an enquiry is made under this section, the Registrar shall communicate the result of the
enquiry to the society concerned.
33. Section 25 as extracted above clearly shows that, the Registrar can hold an enquiry in the matter
of Constitution, working and the finance. This power the Registrar can exercise either suo motu or
on application, whether such enquiry gives finality to the dispute, whether it provides for adequate
remedy to the parties to agitate their grievances.
34. Reading of provisions of Section 25 shows that, the Registrar can hold an enquiry and under
Section 25, sub-section (2), clause (c), sub-clause (iii), he can communicate the result of the enquiry
to the society concerned. Section is silent as to what happens to the report, or whether the Registrar
can take further decision on the basis of enquiry. If a society is to be communicated with the result
of the enquiry, whether such a society is bound by the report or whether the society in pursuance of
the said report could take action, all that is provided is only enquiry and submitting of report. Under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187181586/ 18
Sri Sa Ra Govindu vs The Government Of Karnataka on 16 November, 2022
Section 27-A of the Act, the Government can appoint an Administrator, if the society fails to hold an
election even after expiry of the term of the governing body and if there is long pendency of
litigation or is not able to hold the annual general meeting, in such circumstances, the power is
conferred on the State Government to appoint Administrator. This is again the discretion of the
State Government. It is not mandatory for the State Government to appoint Administrator based on
report or based on information. The appointment of an Administrator will not resolve the inter se
dispute between two groups claiming to constitute valid governing body or valid general body. In
this case, both the groups are claiming that they are in the management or they are in the governing
body. Provisions of Section 25 or 27-A do not provide for power to adjudicate, as to whether 'A'
group is in governing body or 'B' group is in governing body.
35. Section 9 of the CPC confers power on the Civil Court to try all the suits of civil nature, except
which are expressly or impliedly barred. It is nobody's case that, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is
expressly barred under the provisions of the Act. It is only by implication, the jurisdiction of the
Civil Court is sought to be ousted. Implication is an indirect method of ousting the jurisdiction of the
Civil Court. In such a case, the provisions which oust the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, must
provide for a mechanism to adjudicate such dispute. The cumulative effect of the statutory provision
should provide for adequate remedy on par with the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. In such
circumstances, it can be inferred that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is impliedly excluded.
36. In this regard, a decision is relied by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant in Dhulabhai's
case, the Apex Court has considered as to, what constitutes the ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil
Court by implication, and has observed that, the Civil Courts' jurisdiction must be held to be
excluded, if there is an adequate remedy to do, what the Civil Court would normally do in a suit.
This observation clearly indicates that the special statute, which provides for adjudication of the
dispute, must give finality and must provide a jurisdiction that is vested in the Civil Court vis-a-vis,
the enquiry that is contemplated under the special statute to be on par with the jurisdiction of the
Civil Court. Such provisions would impliedly exclude the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. The Apex
Court while interpreting Section 9 of the CPC has further observed that, sufficiency of the remedies
is one of the criteria. Further observed that, even the sufficiency of the remedies provided for by
statute may be relevant but a decisive, what is required to be seen is, that the remedies normally
associated with the actions in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said statute to infer the implied bar.
The exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court should not be normally inferred unless the statute
by implication provide for adequate remedies and complete mechanism for adjudication of the
dispute, this can be gathered from the intention of the legislation and scheme of the Act. If the entire
scheme provides for complete adjudication of the matter and gives finality and gives adequate or
sufficient remedies to the aggrieved party, it can be held that, by implication the jurisdiction of the
Civil Court is barred. It is useful to extract the conditions specified in para 32 of the Dhulabhai's
case. The Apex Court has laid down as many as seven conditions:
(1) Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special Tribunals the Civil
Courts' jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do
what the Civil Courts would normally do in a suit. Such provision, however, does not
exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied

with or the statutory Tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental
principles of judicial procedure.
(2) Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the Court, an examination of
the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the
remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of
the Civil Court.
Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the
particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be
decisive. In the later case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and
provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about
the said right and liability shall be determined by the Tribunals so constituted, and whether
remedies normally associated with actions in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said statute or not.
(3) Challenge to the provisions of the particular Act as ultra vires cannot be brought before
Tribunals constituted under that Act. Even the High Court cannot go into that question on a revision
or reference from the decision of the Tribunals.
(4) When a provision is already declared unconstitutional or the constitutionality of any provision is
to be challenged, a suit is open. A writ of certiorari may include a direction for refund if the claim is
clearly within the time prescribed by the Limitation Act but it is not a compulsory remedy to replace
a suit.
(5) Where the particular Act contains no machinery for refund of tax collected in excess of
constitutional limits or illegally collected a suit lies.
(6) Questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its constitutionality are for the
decision of the authorities and a civil suit does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to
be final or there is an express prohibition in the particular Act. In either case, the scheme of the
particular Act must be examined because it is a relevant enquiry.
(7) An exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not readily to be inferred unless the
conditions above set down apply.
37. It is clear from the above observation that, an examination of the scheme of the particular Act is
necessary to find out the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided.
38. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court is excluded without there is an express bar under law, where
there is adequate remedy available to the party to adjudicate their grievance under the special
statute. If the procedure of enquiry provided under the Civil Procedure is fulfilled otherwise under
the provisions of special statute, it is sufficient to infer the implied bar. The affording an opportunity
and holding an enquiry must be found under the special statute. In such circumstances, whether
expressly barred or not by implication, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is ousted.

39. In identical circumstances, the Apex Court in a decision in the case of Nagri Pracharini Sabha,
while interpreting Section 25 of the Societies Registration Act as amended in Uttar Pradesh has held
that, though Section 25 of the said Act provides for a remedy to challenge the election of the
members of the governing body, but it is subject to compliance with certain statutory requirement
and in case if a member who cannot comply with the requirement, he can still file a suit for
adjudication of the election dispute, even though the remedy is provided for adjudication of election
dispute, if the aggrieved party cannot invoke the said provision for want of compliance of the
statutory requirement, still he is not barred to challenge the same in common law Court, it is clear
that there must be remedy to the aggrieved party.
40. In this case, reading of Section 25 does not provide for raising any such dispute nor provide for
adjudication, hence it cannot be inferred or understood to mean that the dispute touching the
Constitution or a dispute between the members and the members and members and the society
could be adjudicated. What is not provided in law cannot be inferred."
(Emphasis supplied) If the facts obtaining in the case at hand are considered on the touchstone of
the principles laid down in the afore-quoted judgments, the unmistakable inference would be that
the petition would not be maintainable before this Court, as the petitioners have to knock the doors
of the competent civil Court seeking to annul the elections.
14. The indirect effort made to submit that petitioners are not seeking inquiry into the conduct of
elections is neither here nor there, as elections are over, the Executive Committee is in place and the
averments in the petition point at corrupt practice like large scale rigging and several other
illegalities and irregularities in the conduct of elections. It is, therefore, the petitioners have to
approach the competent civil Court for appropriate relief. This Court would not entertain the
petition after the elections are over, even for a direction to the District Registrar to enquire into the
conduct of elections. No fault can be found with the order of the District Registrar declining to
entertain the complaint, as it was in the realm of challenging the elections.
15. Insofar as judgment relied on by the learned senior counsel for the petitioners in the case of
ADVOCATES' ASSOCIATION (supra) the same would be inapplicable to the facts of the case at
hand. Even otherwise, interpreting Section 25 of the Act, there are plethora of judgments, a few of
them are quoted hereinabove, which clearly hold the enquiry akin to annulment of elections cannot
be the scope of Section 25 of the Act. Therefore, the said judgment would not lend any assistance to
the learned senior counsel for the petitioners.
16. In the result, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Writ Petition is dismissed.
(ii) Liberty is reserved to the petitioners to approach the competent civil Court for
redressal of their grievances, if any.
