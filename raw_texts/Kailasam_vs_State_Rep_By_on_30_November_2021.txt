This appeal has been filed against the order passed by the learned Principal Session Judge, Salem,
dismissing the application for bail in C.M.P.No.4442 of 2021 in Crime No.595 of 2021 on the file of
the respondent police.
2.The case of the prosecution is that on 04.11.2021, the defacto complainant one Arulmani and his
brother had gone to the shop of the 1st https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.A.No580 of 2021
accused for purchase of footwear. During that time, defacto complainant had bargained the price of
chappal and at that time, the 1st appellant had made enquiries about the native place of the defacto
complainant and after coming to know about the place of the defacto complainant, the first
appellant had abused the defacto complainant using his community name and assaulted him. The
2nd and 3rd appellant who were employees under the first appellant had also assaulted the defacto
complainant and used abusive language against him. During that time, two other ladies, who are
bystanders and 7 other persons also attacked the defacto complainant and his brother and thereby,
on the complaint given by the defacto complainant, a case in Crime No. 595 of 2021 was registered
for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 323, 324, 355 of IPC and Section 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s) and
3(2)(va) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015. The appellants/accused were
arrested and remanded to the Judicial Custody on 05.11.2021. The bail application filed by the
petitioners in Crl.M.P.No.4442 of 2021 was dismissed by the Principal Sessions Judge on 16.11.2021.
The petitioners have preferred the present appeal. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.A.No580 of
2021
3. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant would submit that the first appellant is running
footwear shop and the second and the third appellants are employed under him. On 04.11.2021, the
defacto complainant and his brother have come to the shop of the appellants and there was a wordy
quarrel between them. Admittedly, these appellants and the defacto complainant are strangers and
the appellants also do not know the community of the defacto complainant. In fact the defacto
complainant is the person who had assaulted the first appellant and his employees and in respect of
the incident, the first appellant had given a complaint and case has been registered against the
defacto complainant in Crime No. 596 of 2021 for the offences under 294(b), 323 and 506(ii)IPC,
and only as a counter blast, the present complaint has been given. Reading of the F.I.R would show
that only in order to escape from the counter case, the present complaint against the appellants has
been given. He would further submit that the appellants are suffering incarceration from 05.11.2021

4.The learned counsel for the respondents 1 and 2 has also filed a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.A.No580 of 2021 counter. Learned Government Advocate (crl.side) would submit that the
defacto complainant one Arulmani along with his brother had gone to the shop of the first appellant
for purchase of chappal and he had bargained the price. At that time, the first appellant along with
the 2nd and 3rd appellants have abused the defacto complainant by calling his community and
assaulted the defacto complainant and his brother, who had accompanied him. He would further
submit that apart from the appellants, two other ladies and seven other persons have also assaulted
the defacto complainant and his brother. The defacto complainant has sustained injuries in his hand
and thereafter, he was taken to the Government Hospital through 108 Ambulance. He would further
submit that investigation is pending and the injured have been discharged from the hospital.
5.In reply the counsel for the appellants would contend that infact the defacto complainant and his
brother had behaved in an unruly manner and the bystanders seeing the atrocity of the defacto
complainant and his brother have come to the rescue of the appellants.
