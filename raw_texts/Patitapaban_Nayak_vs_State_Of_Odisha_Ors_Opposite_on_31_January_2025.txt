similar to an order passed by the Tribunal on 19.06.2017 in O.A. No. 2259(C) of 2015, the writ
petition was disposed of vide order dt.21.12.2022 basing on the concession made by the learned

was fairly admitted by the State Counsel in the earlier writ petition that claim of the Petitioner is
covered by the order passed in O.A. No. 2259(C) of 2015 and the said order has been implemented
in the meantime vide order under Annexure-8, there was no occasion to reject the Petitioner's claim
vide the impugned order dtd.29.02.2024 under Annexure-10. It is accordingly contended that the
impugned order is not sustainable in the eye of law.
5. Mr. P.K. Panda, learned Addl. Standing Counsel on the other hand basing on the stand taken in
the counter affidavit contended that after receipt of the order in W.P.C.(OAC) No. 399 of 2017,
clarification was sought for from the Govt. for compliance of order dtd.21.12.2022. But Govt. issued
the clarification inter alia indicating therein that since claim of the Petitioner for RACP benefit has
already been rejected vide Department letter dtd.22.06.2017, it cannot be reopened. Such
instruction provided by the Govt. under Annexure-C/3 reads as follows:-
"To The District Education Officer Kandhamal Sub:- WPC (OAC) No. 3799/2017,
filed by Patitapaban Nayak Vrs State of Odisha & others.

suitable instruction in the matter. Now the Govt. have returned back the same in

In view of the above, your are therefore requested to consider the claim of the
petitiioenr perusing the observation of Finance section and comply accordingly under

5.1. It is contended that on the face of the order passed by this Court 21.12.2022, taking into account
the clarification issued by the Govt. under Annexure-C/3 on dtd.21.02.2024, claim of the Petitioner
has been rejected vide the impugned order dtd.29.02.2024 under Annexure-10.
6. Having heard learned counsel appearing for the Parties and considering the submissions made,
this Court finds that claiming benefit of Grade Pay Rs.5400/- in the shape of 3rd RACP, Petitioner
was before this Court in W.P.C.(OAC) No. 3799 of 2017. Placing reliance on an order passed by the
Tribunal on 19.06.2017 in O.A. No. 2259(C) of 2015, learned counsel for the Petitioner when

Patitapaban Nayak vs State Of Odisha & Ors. ..... Opposite ... on 31 January, 2025
contended that Petitioner is covered by the said order, opportunity was given to the learned State
Counsel to verify such nature of contention.
6.1. Basing on the submission made by the learned State Counsel that claim of the Petitioner is
covered by the order passed in O.A. No. 2259(C) of 2015, the writ petition was disposed of by this
Court vide order dtd.21.12.2022 under Annexure-9. As further found, order passed in O.A. No.
2259(C) of 2015 has already been implemented vide order dtd.07.08.2018 under Annexure-8.
6.2. In view of such position, it is the view of this Court that the ground on which Petitioner's claim
has been rejected is not sustainable in the eye of law. Therefore, this Court is inclined to quash order
dtd.29.02.2024 so passed by Opp. Party No. 3 under Annexure-10. While quashing the said order,
this Court directs Opp. Party No. 3 to extend the benefit in the light of the order passed in O.A. No.
2259(C) of 2015 in favour of the Petitioner, which has been implemented vide Annexure-8. This
Court directs Opp. Party No. 3 to extend the benefit as due and admissible with passing of an order
in that regard within a period of three (3) months from the date of receipt of this order.
7. The writ petition accordingly stands disposed of.
