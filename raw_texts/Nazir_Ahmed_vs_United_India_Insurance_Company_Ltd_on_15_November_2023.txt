Nazir Ahmed vs United India Insurance Company Ltd on 15 November, 2023
Bakshi Nagar, Jammu, on 01.05.2010 at 09.00 a.m. at Khair Din Morh near Dharmari, by rash and
negligent driving of the driver of the offending vehicle, namely, Jameel Ahmed, S/o Sh. Abdul Gaffar
Sheikh, R/o Village Bassan, Tehsil Mahore, District Reasi, one Nazir Ahmed, S/o Late Haji Noor
Mohd, R/o Village Thuroo, Reasi (being appellant in CCROS No.6/2018 and the respondent 1 in MA
No 268/2015) suffered grievous injuries rendering him permanently disabled (quadriplegia) besides
one Abdul Gani, S/o Late Roshan Din, R/o Village Thuroo Bassan, Tehsil Mahore now Tehsil
Thuroo, District Reasi (being appellant in Mac App No. 82/2019) who too suffered functional 100%
disability. Both above named injured Nazir Ahmed and Abdul Gani, filed claim petitions
independently before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Jammu (for short, the 'Tribunal'). Nazir
Ahmed claimant preferred the claim petition No. 194/2014 before the Tribunal on 15.05.2014
impleading the owner, the driver of the offending vehicle as party respondents 2 & 3, besides United
India Insurance Co. Ltd., Branch Office Main Road Gangyal, Jammu as the respondent 1, which
claim petition came to be decided in terms of award dated 22.09.2015, whereas, Abdul Gani
claimant preferred the claim petition No. 571/2014 on 18.12.2014 before the Tribunal impleading
the same respondents as were impleaded by above Nazir Ahmad and the said claim petition came to
be decided by the Tribunal in terms of award dated 04.08.2018.
04. The insurance company with which the offending vehicle was insured challenged the award
dated 22.9.2015 in MA No. 268/2015, whereas, the owner of the offending vehicle namely Mohan
Lal challenged the award dated 04.08.2018 in MA No. 208/2018.
05. Both claimants Nazir Ahmed as well as Abdul Gani preferred cross objection/appeal before this
Court being CCROS No. 6/2018 and Mac App No. 82/2019 respectively for enhancement of the
award amount granted to them in terms of the impugned award passed in their respective claim
petitions supra.

06. For the sake of convenience the appeals/cross objections are taken up and dealt with in the
following order:-
United India Insurance Co. (Appellant) Vs Nazir Ahmed and others (Respondents)
(I) In the instant appeal filed by the United India Insurance Co. Ltd., the
fundamental grounds urged against the award dated 22.09.2015 are:-
a. That the Tribunal committed a grave error while closing the evidence of the
Insurance Company-appellant herein without procuring the presence of the owner of
the driver of the offending vehicle as witnesses, though expenses for summoning for
them as witnesses were deposited. b. It is also urged in the grounds that the Tribunal
passed the impugned award on a higher side while accepting the claim petition of the
claimant without considering the case in its true and correct perspective. c. That the
impugned award passed by the Tribunal is perverse, arbitrary, illegal and bad in law
having been passed without application of mind and looking to the pleadings,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80623498/ 4
Nazir Ahmed vs United India Insurance Company Ltd on 15 November, 2023
evidence on record and the documents placed on the file as also being contrary to the
principles of law laid down by the Apex Court.
(II)The Tribunal in the instant case after entertaining the claim petition filed by the
respondent 1 herein summoned the respondents being the appellant herein as
respondent 1 as also respondents 2 & 3 being the owner and the driver of the
offending vehicle respectively. The respondent 1 appellant herein entered appearance
pursuant to the notice issued by the Tribunal and filed response to the claim petition
though controverted the assertions made in the claim petition yet, admitted the
offending vehicle to be under the cover of insurance on the date of accident. The
respondents 2 & 3 in the claim petition, however, did not chose to appear, as a
consequence whereof came to be set ex-parte on 23.07.2014 by the Tribunal.
(III)The Tribunal on the basis of the pleadings being the claim petition of the
claimant-respondent 1 herein and response filed thereto by the respondent 1
appellant herein framed following issues: -
CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No. 208/2018
Mac App No. 82/2019
1. Whether an accident took place on 01.05.2010 at about 9.00 A.M. at Khair Din
Mohr Near Dharmari by rash and negligent driving of the vehicle bearing No.
JK02K-9342 (Tempo-Traveller ( by its driver as a result of which petitioner Nazir
Ahmad received grievous injuries and has been disabled ? OPP
2. If issue No. 1 is proved in affirmative, whether petitioner is entitled to
compensation; if so to what amount and from whom ? OPP
3. Whether driver of offending vehicle at the time of accident was not holding a valid
and effective driving license and whether there was violation of terms and conditions
of policy of insurance and respondent insurance is not liable ? OPR-1
4. Relief ? O.P. Parties (IV)The claimant respondent 1 herein besides appearing
himself as his own witness also examined witnesses namely Parvez Ahmed, Ashok
Kumar Raina, Ramesh Chander and Dr. Kanav Padha, however, on the contrary the
respondent 1 appellant herein did not lead any evidence.
(V) Record reveals that the claimant respondent 1 herein upon leading his evidence for proving
issues 1 & 2 supra proved the fact of the vehicular accident having taken place on 01.05.2010 caused
by the offending vehicle bearing registration No. JK02K-9342 driven rashly and negligently by
respondent 3 as also by placing on record the copy of judgement passed by the Judicial Magistrate
Mohar in case arising out of FIR No. 47/2010 wherein the respondent 3 driver of the offending
vehicle came to be convicted qua the accident in question for commission of offences under Sections
279/337/338 RPC. The claimant respondent 1 also proved by leading credible and clenching
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80623498/ 5
Nazir Ahmed vs United India Insurance Company Ltd on 15 November, 2023
evidence of having suffered serious bodily injuries resulting into 100% disability of cervical spine
with quadriplegia with neurogenic bladder. The said fact of the claimant having sustained 100%
permanent disability came to be proved by him by way of a certificate issued by the competent
authority in this regard. Besides proving the fact of treatment received by him from various
hospitals the claimant also proved the expenses incurred, viz; medical attendance loss of earnings of
profits being pecuniary damages as well as non-pecuniary damages consisting of damage for mental
and physical shock, pain suffering present and future, CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w
MA No. 268/2015 MA No. 208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019 loss of amentias of life so on and so
forth. The claimant respondent 1 herein proved the issues 1 and 2 by leading and producing cogent
and credible evidence both orally as well as documentary without there being any evidence led or
produced by respondent 1 appellant herein in rebuttal thereto.
(VI) The ground urged in the memo of appeal by the insurance company appellant herein that the
Tribunal committed grave error while closing the evidence of the insurance company appellant
herein without procuring the presence of the owner and the driver of the offending vehicle as
witnesses though expenses thereof for summoning them were deposited, it gets revealed from the
perusal of the record that the insurance company appellant herein did not submit a list of witnesses
it intended to produce after framing of issues by the Tribunal on 23.07.2014 or else sought
assistance of the Tribunal for summoning of any witnesses. The insurance company appellant herein
however, filed an application for depositing of diet expanses qua summoning of the owner and
driver of the vehicle as witness only after the claimant respondent herein had led his evidence and
upon the closure of his evidence.
A bare perusal of the said application filed on 24.03.2015 by the insurance company appellant
herein would reveal that insurance company appellant herein had sought permission of the Tribunal
for depositing diet expenses of the witnesses being the owner and driver of the offending vehicle
which permission came to be accorded on the very same day by the Tribunal and consequently the
diet expenses of Rs. 200/- came to be deposited by the insurance company appellant herein on
01.04.2015.
Perusal of the record of the Tribunal would also reveal that a dasti summon was directed to be
served by the insurance company appellant herein as ordered by the Tribunal therein the said
application vide its order dated 24.03.2015 which, however, was not done by the insurance company
appellant herein and also thereafter whereupon on 21.05.2015 last and final opportunity was
granted to the insurance company appellant herein to serve the summon upon the witnesses for
their appearance and consequently after grant of two more opportunities by the Tribunal to the
insurance company CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No.
208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019 appellant herein for serving of summon upon witnesses and on its
failure to do so, the Tribunal closed the evidence of the insurance company appellant herein on
22.07.2015 which order came to be never ever challenged by the insurance company appellant
herein and instead it proceeded to argue the case finally resulting into passing of the impugned
award. The ground supra urged therefore, in this view of the matter pales into insignificance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80623498/ 6
Nazir Ahmed vs United India Insurance Company Ltd on 15 November, 2023
Perusal of the record would also reveal that the Tribunal being alive to the facts and circumstances
of the case, in particular the nature and magnitude of the injury and disability sustained and
suffered by the appellant-respondent 1 herein as also to the fact that the appellant-respondent 1
herein did not contradict the evidence led by the claimant respondent 1 or else produced any
evidence in rebuttal thereto held the claimant respondent 1 herein entitled to the compensation
calculated and worked out while having regard to the judgments of the Apex Court passed in case
titled as "Rajesh and Ors Vs. Rajbir Singh and ors reported in 2013 (3) SCC (Cri.) 817", "Sarla Verma
and Ors Vs. Dehli Transport Corporation and Anr., reported in 2009(3) Supreme 487" and
consequently passed the award under challenge in favour of the claimant respondent 1 herein. The
grounds urged by the insurance company appellant herein that the impugned award is perverse,
arbitrary, illegal, bad in law against pleadings and evidence on record as also contrary to the
principles of law laid down by the Apex Court inasmuch as on a higher side in view of the aforesaid
facts and circumstances of the case as noticed in the preceding paras cannot be accepted and as
such, are rejected. It is manifest that the Tribunal has rightly, fairly and justly dealt with the claim
petition filed by the claimant respondent 1 herein and passed the impugned award which award
cannot be found fault with in view of law laid down by the Apex Court in case Sarla Verma.
(VII) In view of what has been observed, considered and analyzed hereinabove, the instant appeal
fails and is, accordingly, dismissed. (VIII) Registry to return back the original record.
CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No. 208/2018 Mac App No.
82/2019 CCROS No. 6/2018:
Nazir Ahmed (Appellant) Vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd. and others
(Respondents) (I) In the instant cross-objections/appeal the claimant/appellant
herein seeks enhancement of compensation granted by the Tribunal in terms of
impugned award dated 22.9.2015 contending that the Tribunal did not grant to him
the compensation on account of earnings of Rs. 1.5 lakhs per annum from his
agricultural land as also did not award adequate compensation qua two attendants
hired by the claimant for looking after him on account of his quadriplegia health
condition as also the Tribunal awarded less amount of compensation under the heads
of "pain and suffering" and "loss of amenities of life" as also the amount of interest on
the award amount at the rate of 7.5% instead of 9% per annum besides awarding
lesser amount of compensation under the heads of "special diet"
and "future medical expenses".
(II) Perusal of the record in general and impugned award dated 22.9.2015 in particular manifestly
tends to show that the Tribunal while passing the impugned award has not been oblivious to the
facts and circumstances of the case pleaded by the claimant/appellant herein as also the evidence
led therein inasmuch as the position of law laid down by the Apex Court in a case wherein the
injured had become paraplegic, and consequently granted compensation to the claimant/appellant
herein in line and tune with the principles of law laid down by the Apex Court in case titled as R. D.
Hattangadi versus M/s Pest Control (India) Private Limited and others reported in AIR 1995 SC 755
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80623498/ 7
Nazir Ahmed vs United India Insurance Company Ltd on 15 November, 2023
as also by the Division Bench of this court in case titled as New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and
another vs. Imtiaz Bano reported in 2006 (2) JKJ 243 (HC) besides the judgment passed by the
Apex Court in case titled as Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others reported in (2013) 3
SCC (Cri) 817 and judgment passed by the Apex Court in case titled as Sarla Verma CCROS No.
06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No. 208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019
versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009 (3) Supreme 487.
The amount of compensation worked out by the Tribunal in the impugned award in view of the facts
and circumstances of the case as also the principles of law laid down by the Apex Court and this
court in the judgments supra ex facie cannot be found fault with. The amount of compensation
awarded to the claimant appellant herein by the Tribunal is fair, just and appropriate, therefore does
not call for any interference. (III) In view above backdrop, the cross objections/appeal fails and is
accordingly dismissed.
Mohan Lal (Appellant) Vs. United India Insurance Company and others (Respondents) (I) The
instant appeal is filed against award dated 04.08.2018 passed by the Tribunal in claim petition No.
571/2014 titled as "Abdul Gani Vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd & Ors"., by the appellant
being the owner of the offending vehicle bearing registration no. JK02K-9342 having been
impleaded as party respondent 2 in the said claim petition. (II)The Tribunal upon entertaining the
claim petition on 18.12.2014 and after issuing notice to the respondents in the claim petition being
insurance company/respondent 1 herein, the owner and the driver of the offending vehicle,
proceeded with the framing of the following issues after the respondents 2 and 3 in the claim
petition did not choose to appear and contest the claim petition and were proceeded ex parte on
11.5.2015 and after the insurance company/respondent 1 herein filed objections to the claim
petition:
1. Whether an accident took place on 01.05.2010 at 9.00 a.m at near Khair Din Morh
Dharmari by rash and negligent driving of the vehicle bearing No. JK02K-9342 by its
driver as a result of which petitioner received grievous injuries and has been disabled
? OPP CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No.
208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019
2. If issue No. 1 is proved in affirmative, whether petitioner is entitled to
compensation? if so, to what amount and from whom ? OPP
3. Whether the offending vehicle was being driven at the time of the accident in
violation of terms and conditions of policy of insurance and respondent insurance
company is not liable ? OPR-1
4. Relief ? O.P. Parties (III)The Tribunal upon disposal of the claim petition supra
passed impugned award dated 4.8.2018 in favour of the claimant respondent 2
herein payable by Insurance Company/respondent 1 herein with right to recover the
same from the respondent 2 in the claim petition being the appellant herein.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80623498/ 8
Nazir Ahmed vs United India Insurance Company Ltd on 15 November, 2023
(IV)The appellant herein has questioned the impugned award in the instant appeal inter alia on the
grounds that the Tribunal never summoned the appellant herein in ordinary mode and that the
summons were, in fact, never served upon the appellant except in the month of September 2017
requiring the appellant herein to appear in the claim petition as a witness of the insurance company
respondent/1 herein as the respondents 2 and 3 in the claim petition including the appellant herein
had been set ex parte on 11.5.2015 and that the Tribunal fastened the liability to pay the
compensation to the claimant upon the appellant herein despite the fact that the insurance
company/respondent 1 herein did not prove the violation of the terms and conditions of the
insurance policy or its exclusionary clause during the adjudication of the claim petition nor did the
insurance company/respondent 1 herein led any evidence in this regard and that though the
appellant herein appeared before the Tribunal as a witness of the insurance company/respondent 1
herein yet was never called upon either by the insurance company/respondent 1 herein or by the
Tribunal to produce the documents of the offending vehicle. (V) In order to prove issues 1 and 2
onus whereof was put on the claimant/respondent 2 herein, the claimant besides appearing himself
as a witness examined witnesses namely Nazir Ahmed son of Mohammad CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA
No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No. 208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019 Hussain resident of
Bassan, tehsil Thuroo district Reasi and Dr. Sushil Sharma, Orthopedic Surgeon, Accidental
Hospital Bijaypur, whereas on the contrary the insurance company/respondent 1 herein examined
the owner of the vehicle as its witness being appellant herein. (VI) Perusal of the record tends to
show that the claimant/respondent 2 herein after leading the evidence in support of issues 1 and 2
proved the fact of the vehicular accident caused on 1.5.2010 by the offending vehicle bearing
registration no. JK02K-9342 due to rash and negligent driving of the driver/respondent 3, on the
basis of credible and clinching evidence as also proved the fact that the claimant/respondent 2
herein suffered serious bodily injury and permanent disablement in the said accident being a case of
"fracture C4 sinus process, MRI proven C3, C4, C5, Cord-contusion with Quardriparesis of 75% of
permanent nature" besides proving that the treatment received by the claimant/respondent 2 herein
for said bodily injury/disability, the expenses incurred thereon, loss of earnings and profits besides
non-pecuniary damages comprising of damage for mental and physical shock, pain and suffering,
present and future loss of amenities of life, so on and so forth.
(VII) Perusal of the record also reveals that after the closure of the evidence of claimant/respondent
2 herein, the insurance company respondent 1 herein filed an application under section 170 of the
Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 for taking of defense of the owner and the driver of the offending vehicle
on its own and consequently sought assistance for summoning of the owner/appellant herein as well
as the driver of the vehicle/respondent 3 herein from the Tribunal.
(VIII)Perusal of the record of the Tribunal also reveals that in the application filed by the insurance
company/respondent 1 herein for seeking summoning of the owner as its witness did not plead in
the application the purpose for which the said witness was being summoned as also did not state in
the said application that the said witness be summoned for producing any of the documents of the
offending vehicle. Be that as it CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA
No. 208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019 may, the record further tends to show that the
owner/appellant herein appeared as witness of the insurance company/appellant herein on
11.10.2017, on which date the witness stated that at the time of the accident the vehicle was having
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80623498/ 9
Nazir Ahmed vs United India Insurance Company Ltd on 15 November, 2023
its registration certificate, route permit, fitness certificate, insurance policy and was being driven by
a driver having valid driving licence and that since the said vehicle had been sold by him to one
Vinood Kumar, as such, he did not have the documents of the said vehicle. The insurance company
respondent 1 herein, however, did not call upon the witness to produce the documents of the
offending vehicle or else made a prayer to the Tribunal for summoning of the documents of the
offending vehicle from the person who was possessed of the same being one Vinod Kumar to whom
the vehicle was stated to have been sold by the witness/appellant herein. The record also reveals
that the insurance company/respondent 1 herein did not examine the driver of the
vehicle/respondent 3 herein as its witness. The respondent insurance company as well neither filed
the insurer policy along with the terms and conditions set out therein before the Tribunal in order to
prove issue no. 3 nor did it examine any witness or lead any evidence to prove the violation of the
terms and conditions of the policy.
(IX)It also emerges from the record that the Tribunal has overlooked the aforesaid facts and
circumstances in general, and in particular that the insurance company/respondent 1 herein did not
lead any evidence to prove issue no. 3 and in the process misdirected itself while mis- appreciating
the judgment of the Apex Court passed in case titled as "Pappuu and Ors. vs. Vinod Kumar Lamba
and Anr., reported in 2018 (1) Supreme 137", besides having failed to appreciate that despite leading
no evidence to prove the violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and its
exclusionary clause, proceeded to provide a liberty to it to recover the amount of compensation
awarded by it to the claimant/ respondent 2 herein from the owner of the vehicle being appellant
herein. It is also significant to note here that the insurance CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015]
c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No. 208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019 company/respondent 1 herein in
response to the claim petition filed by respondent 2 herein had taken a preliminary objection to the
insurance policy and its terms and conditions essentially admitting that it would produce the
documents and prove the allegation.
(X) It is pertinent to note that the award impugned in the instant appeal indisputably has been
passed on 4.8.2018 which is after the award dated 22.9.2015 passed in claim petition no. 194/2014
titled as "Nazir Ahmed versus United India Insurance Company Ltd. and others", arising out of the
same vehicular accident with same parties/respondents wherein the insurance
company/respondent 1 herein had been fastened with the liability to pay compensation to the
claimant therein coupled with the fact that in the said claim petition as well neither the driver nor
the owner of the offending vehicle had contested the claim petition as in the instant case, but for the
appearance of the owner of the vehicle being appellant herein appeared as the witness of the
insurance company/respondent 1 herein without supporting the case of the insurance
company/respondent 1 herein.
(XI) Be that as it may the Tribunal seemingly has passed the impugned award validly and rightly
except to the extent it provided the right of recovery to the insurance company/respondent 1 herein
for recovering the award amount from the appellant herein.
(XII)Viewed thus, what has been observed, considered and analyzed hereinabove the impugned
award does not call for any interference except to the extent it provided the right of recovery to the

insurance company/respondent 1 herein. Resultantly, the appeal succeeds to the said extent and
consequently the impugned award is modified insofar as it provides the right of recovery to the
insurance company/respondent 1 herein as aforesaid.

CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No. 208/2018 Mac App No.
82/2019 Abdul Gani (Appellant) Vs. United India Insurance Company and others (Respondents) (I)
In the instant appeal the appellant has sought enhancement of compensation awarded to him by the
Tribunal in terms of award dated 4.8.2018 passed in claim petition No. 571/2014 titled as "Abdul
Gani Vs. United India Insurnace Company Ltd and Ors"., on the ground that the Tribunal slashed
down the income of the appellant from Rs.16,000/- per month to Rs. 6000/- per month in working
out the compensation, and also inadequately awarded compensation of Rs. 20,000 to the claimant
appellant herein under the head "special diet" besides inadequately awarding Rs. 1 lakh each under
the head "pain and suffering" and "loss of amenities of life" as also awarding a lump sum of Rs. 2
lakhs under the head wages for attendants instead of an amount of Rs. 13,44,000/- and further
inadequately awarded amount of Rs. 1 lakh under the head future treatment and future income
awarded amount of compensation to the claimant appellant herein against the cost of wheelchair for
present and future, for water, bed psychotherapy and catheterization. (II) Perusal of the record in
general and impugned award dated 4.8.2018 in particular manifestly tends to show that the
Tribunal while passing the impugned award has not been oblivious to the facts and circumstances of
the case pleaded by the claimant/appellant herein as also the evidence led therein inasmuch as the
position of law laid down by the Apex Court in case wherein the injured had become paraplegic, and
consequently granted compensation to the claimant/appellant herein in line and tune with the
principles of law laid down by the Apex Court in case titled as C. K. Subramonia Iyer vs. T.
Kunkikuttan Nair reported in AIR 1970 SC 376, case titled as R. D. Hattangadi versus M/s Pest
Control (India) Private Limited and others reported in AIR 1995 SC 755, case titled as Raj Kumar
versus Ajay Kumar and another reported in 2011 (1) SCC 343, besides in judgment passed by the
Supreme Court in case of CCROS No. 06/2018 [MA No. 268/2015] c/w MA No. 268/2015 MA No.
208/2018 Mac App No. 82/2019 Sarla Verma versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another
reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104, and case titled as National Insurance Co. Ltd. & others vs. Pranay
Sethi and others [Special Leave Petition (civil) no. 25590 of 2014] decided on 31.10.2017, and case
titled as Reshma Kumari and others vs. Madan Mohan and another reported in (2013) 9 SCC 54.
The amount of compensation worked out by the Tribunal in the impugned award in view of the facts
and circumstances of the case as also the principles of law laid down by the Apex Court and this
court in the judgments supra ex facie cannot be found fault with. The amount of compensation
awarded to the claimant appellant herein by the Tribunal is fair, just and appropriate, therefore does
not call for any interference. (III) In view above backdrop, the cross objections/appeal fails and is
accordingly dismissed.
(IV) Registry to return back the original record.
