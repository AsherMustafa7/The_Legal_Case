CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 27-03-2019 This writ application has been preferred challenging the decision of the
departmental tender committee as contained in Memo No. 992(C) dated 31.01.2019 of the Road
Construction Department, by which the financial bid of the petitioner has been declared as Non
Responsive and the bid of respondent no. 5 has been accepted for the work namely Long Term
Output & Performance Based Road Assets Maintenance Patna High Court CWJC No.2190 of 2019
dt.27-03-2019 work for roads under Package No. 49A/OPRMC-2/Nawada.
Initially the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner was that the petitioner has been
disqualified and declared Non Responsive by taking a very hyper technical ground that the
petitioner had quoted less rate than lower limit in ordinary maintenance work (OM) as fixed by the
department.

It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the overall rate quoted by the petitioner is 2.54%
below the estimated cost of the work i.e. Rs. 743061684.79 against the estimated cost of the work of
Rs. 762366536.00 but the Departmental Tender Committee has decided to allot the work to
respondent no. 5 on 3.06% above the estimated cost i.e. at Rs. 78,56,98,504.57, total difference
amount is Rs. 4,26,36,819.78 which according to the petitioner is a burden on the public exchequer.
The respondents appeared and filed a counter affidavit. In paragraphs 18 & 19 of the counter
affidavit following statements have been made:
"18. That from conjoint reading of Clause 27.5 of Instruction to Bidders and heading
"E" of Bid Date Sheet it will transpired that the bid of each of components, i.e. Initial
Rectification, Periodic Maintenance, Minor Improvement and Ordinary Maintenance
work shall not be lower than the threshold and lower limit of threshold has been
Patna High Court CWJC No.2190 of 2019 dt.27-03-2019 fixed as 10% of estimated
cost of each activity/price schedule.
19. That from conjoint reading of Clause 27.5 of Instruction to Bidders and heading
"E" of Bid Date Sheet it further transpires that accumulation of all four components
are not provided in the MBD rather individual quotation of rates of all four
components, i.e. Initial Rectification, Periodic Maintenance, Minor Improvement and
ordinary Maintenance work is required to be made by the bidders, hence the plea of
the petitioner that overall bid amount, quoted as
2.54%, is below of estimated cost completely goes against the Clause 27.5 of MBD and if the said
contention of petitioner is accepted it will go against the terms of MBD and will amount to dilute the
terms of MBD."
In the subsequent hearing finding the difficulties in responding to this stand of the respondents,
learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in any case by awarding the work to respondent
no. 5, the respondents will be wasting a sum of Rs. 4,26,36,819.78 which would be against the public
interest. At this stage, respondent no. 5 has come out with a supplementary affidavit stating as
follows in paragraph-3 thereof:
"3. That the answering respondents is willing to forgo amount of Rs. 4,26,36,819.78 in the interest
of work. The answering respondent is ready to execute the work at the amount which is 2.54% Patna
High Court CWJC No.2190 of 2019 dt.27-03-2019 below the estimated cost. Therefore, the
answering respondent is willing and prepared to work at Rs. 743061684.79 instead of Rs.
785698504.57."
In the aforesaid manner respondent no. 5 has now met the argument of learned counsel for the
petitioner.

In the given facts and circumstances, this court finds that now even the second ground is not
available to the petitioner so as to call upon this court to exercise it's discretionary jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. No arbitrariness could be noticed in the decision making
process of the respondents. The respondent no. 5 has already agreed to execute the work by
foregoing a sum of Rs. 4,26,36,819.78 which the official respondents shall take note of while signing
agreement and making payment to respondent no.
5. At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that respondents may be directed to
return the earnest money deposit of the petitioner. The court has been informed that the earnest
money deposit of the petitioner has not been forfeited and is liable to be returned. In these
circumstances the petitioner will be at liberty to request the respondents to return his earnest
money deposit which will be returned by the Patna High Court CWJC No.2190 of 2019
dt.27-03-2019 respondents within a period of 30 days from the date of such request.
This writ application is disposed of in terms stated hereinabove.
The respondents shall be at liberty to proceed ahead with the work.
