quash the appellate order as contained in Letter No. 1465 dated
28.09.2010
issued under the signature of the Deputy Secretary, Water Resources Department, State of Bihar
who has confirmed the punishment passed on 09.12.2009.
2. The facts leading rise to the present writ application can be briefly enumerated as follows:-
(a) The appellant-petitioner was appointed as Assistant Engineer in the Water
Resources Department, State of Bihar in the year 1979 and, was promoted to the post
of Executive Engineer on current charge basis vide Notification No. 4750 dated
29.06.2002 under the Water Resources Department and his services were made
available to the Flood Control Division, Naugachhia.
(b) That while the petitioner was posted as Executive Engineer, Current Charge at Flood Control
Division, Naugachhia, a proceeding was initiated against the appellant-petitioner under Rule 55(a)
of the Civil Services (Classification, Control Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019
and Appeal) Rules, 1956 vide charges leveled against the appellant-petitioner vide Letter No. 34
dated 03.02.2005.
(c) The charge leveled against the appellant- petitioner was that he had not relieved the transferred
Junior Engineer for about four (4) months. In response to the aforementioned charge, the
appellant- petitioner submitted his explanation vide his Letter No. 163 dated 04.03.2005, in which,
he clearly stated that the transfer order dated 11.02.2004 of Junior Engineer, namely Harendra
Narain as contained in Memo No. 546 was received in his office on 23.02.2004. Accordingly, the
appellant- petitioner vide his Letter No. 239 dated 27.02.2004 directed the concerned S.D.O. Flood
Control Sub Division No. 1, Naugachhia Camp Bihpur to relieve the transferred Junior Engineer. In
his reply, the appellant-petitioner had further stated that the concerned S.D.O. vide his Letter Patna
High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 dated 25.04.2004, Letter No. 64 dated 17.05.2004,
Letter No. 60 dated dated 15.06.2004 directed said Harendra Narain, Junior Engineer to handover
charge to Subhash Chandra Singh, Junior Engineer so that he may be relieved.
However, Harendra Naraian did not
handover charge.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98163069/ 2
Niranjan Kumar Dutta vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
(d) As such, the appellant-petitioner issued Letter No. 610 dated 28.05.2004 and Letter No. 731
dated 15.06.2004 to relieve the transferred Junior Engineer, in which, it was also stated by the
appellant-petitioner that in case, the said Harendra Narain had not handed over charge, then his
salary for the month of June, 2004 would be withheld and ultimately, the salary of the said
Harendra Narain was for the month of June, 2004 was withheld. It was reiterated by the
appellant-petitioner vide his Letter Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 No. 610
dated 28.05.2004 that he had also directed the transferred Junior Engineer to handover charge to
Subhash Chandr Singh, Junior Engineer.
(e) The concerned Sub Divisional Officer informed the appellant-petitioner that Harendra Narain
was not handing over charge even after several directions and as such, could not be relieved and,
therefore, the petitioner vide his Letter No. 773 dated 26.06.2004 himself directed the Transferred
Junior Engineer to handover charge immediately or he would be relieved unilaterally at the
divisional level itself and in the event of any difficulty being caused, the same will be his own dated
28.06.2004 was issued by the appellant-petitioner, by which the concerned S.D.O. was directed to
relieve the transferred Junior Engineer after handing over charge but in the event of his Patna High
Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 own handing over charge, he must be relieved on
30.06.2004.
(f) Ultimately, the concerned S.D.O. vide his Letter No. 79 dated 30.06.2004 informed that the
transferred Junior Engineer has been relieved vide his letter dated 03.07.2004.
(g) In the letter/explanation furnished by the appellant-petitioner to the explanation asked from
him with regard to relieving of the transferred Junior Engineer, the appellant-petitioner averred
that he was interested in relieving the transferred Junior Engineer after handing over charge
because, in case the handing over charge was not affected by the Junior Engineer, a lot of trouble
would be occasioned in future as it leads to damage in-
accountability of government's material and as a consequence thereof, in many cases, it has been
found that financial loss is also occasioned. In certain cases, the Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of
2018 dt.30-04-2019 transferred Junior Engineer, sometimes was also required to hand over charge
in presence of Magistrate, who prepared an inventory after obtaining permission from the higher
official. Such actions of non handing over charge on transfer, often led to financial loss and mental
trauma to the concerned officials and adverse affects on the departmental works.
(h) Another supplementary show cause was issued by the Water Resources Department dated
08.07.2006 (Annexure-8) calling upon the petitioner to show cause. In the said show cause, the
petitioner was asked to answer the charge that since there has been a delay of four months in the
handing over charge of Harendra Narain, Junior Engineer, the official records must not have been
maintained/updated and had the records been up-to-date, then it would not have taken four months
for the said Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 Harendra Narain to hand over
charge. As such, the appellant-petitioner was called upon to answer this charge also, which was duly
responded by him vide his Letter No. 719 dated 21.07.2006 (Annexure-9). In the said reply, the
appellant-petitioner stated that so far as the materials were concerned, there was no anomaly and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98163069/ 3
Niranjan Kumar Dutta vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
only some coal, drums and bricks were in the charge of the Junior Engineer which were found to be
in order. The only reason for the Junior Engineer not handing over charge was his own delaying
tendency though he had been given several reminders by the S.D.O. and ultimately, his salary had
been also stopped.
(i) However, the Water Resources Department vide his Letter No. 1081 dated 26.10.2006 issued a
show cause alleging that there is a contradiction in his second show cause which may be further
explained. The petitioner again painstakingly answered the Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018
dt.30-04-2019 third show cause vide Letter No. 1125 dated 24.12.2006 explaining clearly that it was
nothing but the delaying tendency of the transferred Junior Engineer which came to be the reason
for delay in handing over the charges for which his salary had been withheld. It was also
categorically asserted by the petitioner in his reply (Annexure-11) that after taking the necessary
steps by himself as well as by the S.D.O., the petitioner had taken the ultimate step by withholding
the salary of Junior Engineer, thereby compelling him to hand over the charge and relieving him of
the same. In the said reply, the appellant- petitioner had specifically stated that the only reason why
the delay had been occasioned, was because the appellant- petitioner wanted to ensure that under
all circumstances, the Junior Engineer himself handed over charge before being relieved so that in
future there may be no Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 complications and
thus, after having such explanations, the appellant-petitioner had prayed for a sympathetic
consideration of his explanation as there had been no violation by the appellant-petitioner of any
departmental instructions nor had been indulged in any act of violation of departmental instruction.
(j) However, the respondents sat tight over the matter of the appellant-petitioner and ultimately
vide Memo no. 1467 dated 09.12.2009, i.e after more than 2 years, the appellant-petitioner was
inflicted with the punishment of censure for the year 2004- 05 and also of withholding of two
increments with non-cumulative effect.
(k) Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant-petitioner preferred an Appeal against the
punishment order before the Water Resources Department, Government of Bihar, which was
dismissed vide Letter No. 1465 dated Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019
28.09.2010, affirming the punishment order passed against the appellant-
petitioner in departmental notification no. 1467 dated 09.12.2009 without assigning any reasons
which is evident from a bare perusal of the order dated 28.09.2010 (Annexure-14).
(l) Aggrieved by the aforementioned order passed by the authorities and faced to the situation
wherein the appellant-petitioner was likely to be reverted back from the post of Executive Engineer,
Current Charge to the post of Assistant Engineer, the appellant-petitioner preferred a writ
application contending that if he may be permitted to work as Executive Engineer, Current Charge,
as he was likely to superannuate in the month of July, 2011.
3. Learned counsel for the appellant-petitioner submitted that on account of the aforementioned
punishment order, the petitioner's promotion to the regular post of Executive Engineer was also
kept in abeyance due to the Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 pendency of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98163069/ 4
Niranjan Kumar Dutta vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
departmental proceedings. Thereafter, due to the order of punishment though several similarly
situated Junior Engineers had been promoted but his case was not considered.
4. Learned Single Judge after hearing the parties and on perusal of the counter affidavit filed on
behalf of the respondent no. 2 taking note of the fact that there was a contradiction in the two
explanations offered by the appellant- petitioner dismissed the writ application by noting that the
appellant-petitioner had tried to shift the blame completely upon the shoulders of the Junior
Engineers who had shown slackness in handing over charge. The learned Single Judge also recorded
finding to this effect that the view taken by the Disciplinary Authority could not be ignored in view
of different stands taken by the appellant-petitioner in his letters marked as Annexure-3 series. It
was thus, observed that the Disciplinary Authority had given finding that a contradictory stance had
been taken by the appellant-petitioner in his successive explanation before the Disciplinary
Authority and, therefore, the reply of the appellant-petitioner was rightly rejected holding him to be
responsible for the delay in handing over charge. The dispute with regard to the facts that the
records were not updated and, the materials in possession of the Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of
2018 dt.30-04-2019 concerned Junior Engineer, were not presumed to be the reason or hindrance
for not handing over charge. The learned Single Judge then proceeded to uphold the order of
punishment as in its opinion the Court would not sit in Appeal in the case of minor punishment.
5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials on record.
6. The challenge to the order of the learned Single Judge has been placed stating that the learned
Single Judge had failed to appreciate that the order of punishment did not disclose what
contradictions in the statement of the appellant-petitioner had been noticed and that there was no
contradiction in the consecutive replies filed by the appellant- petitioner. Learned counsel further
contended that the learned Single Judge has failed to appreciate that the appellant- petitioner had in
a bona fide manner tried to relieve the Junior Engineer as it was always in the interest of the
department that the Junior Engineer should handover full charge so as to prevent the future
complications and any inference drawn to the contrary was based on no evidence.
7. Learned counsel further contended that this apart, the learned Single Judge had failed to
appreciate that Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 there was no finding to the
effect that the record had not been maintained/updated and the anxiety expressed by the Sub
Divisional Officer, Birpur with regard to handing over charge was not unfounded. Learned counsel
for the appellant- petitioner further contended that the efforts of the appellant- petitioner to relieve
the recalcitrant Junior Engineer after proper handing over charge, did not necessarily indicate that
the records were in disarray and ought to have been appreciated and, therefore, the finding arrived
at that the appellant- petitioner was guilty of violation of departmental instructions and rules, is
wholly without any basis. Consequently, the punishment order inflicted upon the
appellant-petitioner was, fit to be set aside.
8. We have perused in depth the successive show cause notices issued by the Water Resources
Department. The first notice relates only to non-handing over charge but the charges as against the
appellant-petitioner appears to have been supplemented in the following charge issued to him. A
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98163069/ 5
Niranjan Kumar Dutta vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
bare perusal of Annexure -2 dated 03.02.2005 clearly indicates that the only charge leveled against
the appellant-petitioner was that he had not relieved the transferred Junior Engineer for about four
months. However, in the second charge contained in Letter Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018
dt.30-04-2019 No. 716 dated 08.07.2006 (Annexure-8), the further charge has been levelled stating
that since four months had been spent in handing over charge, the same clearly indicates that the
records were not updated. The reply submitted to the second charge clearly indicated that the mere
fact that the charge had been handed over by the Junior Engineer after four months, did not
indicate that the records were not in order was a mere presumption as the appellant-petitioner had
taken necessary steps to relieve the Junior Engineer and ultimately, had resorted to the stringent
measure of withholding his salary which was indicative of the bona fides of the petitioner. A perusal
of the same clearly indicates that the appellant-petitioner was trying to establish that there had been
no laches on his part but the Disciplinary Authority vide letter dated 09.12.2009 has come to the
finding that the appellant-petitioner was responsible for not handing over charge and as such, had
openly violated the departmental instructions.
9. We, however, do not find that there was any reason for the authorities to give such findings as the
appellant petitioner in his consecutive explanations has always averred that he had been instructing
the S.D.O. to take over charge forthwith from the Junior Engineer and having failed to get Patna
High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 response of an effective performance of his
instructions had ultimately, resorted to the stoppage of his salary for the month of June before
finally taking over charge from him. Thus, the deductions arrived at by the Disciplinary Authority
which also finds support in the order of the learned Single Judge appears to be hypothetical and
cannot form the basis of any order of punishment.
10. We are also conscious of the provisions of law being the Civil Services (Classification, Control
and Appeal) Rules, 1930 wherein it has been envisaged that while passing an order under this Rule,
it is of paramount importance that the authority passing the order himself should give a conscious
consideration to the representation filed by the employee after due application of mind as any
punishment which should follow would be marring future prospects of the employee. A mechanical
approach based on conjectures and surmises should be avoided and all considerations of the
representation should be on an objective basis. This reasoning finds support in the case of Md.
Mahmudul Hasan vs. The State of Bihar & Ors reported in 1997 (2) PLJR, 953.
11. Paragraph - 8 of the aforesaid decision is extracted herein under:-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 "In so far as the second point
is concerned, this court is of the view that while passing an order under Rule 55-A of
the said Rules, it is incumbent upon the authority concerned to consider the
representation made by the employees and such consideration means a conscious
application of mind and also a consideration of the explanation given by the
employees in an objective basis. This point is, no doubt, concluded by a Division
Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Dr. Rabindra Nath Singh vs. The State of
Bihar and others reported in 1983 P.L.J.R. page 92. In paragraph 10 of the said
judgment the learned Judges hold that as no reason has been assigned as to why the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98163069/ 6
Niranjan Kumar Dutta vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
show cause reply is un- satisfactory, the same was quashed and the learned Judges
held that giving reasons in support of the order which affects a persons is also the
basic need of the principles of natural justice. In coming to the said conclusion in the
case of Dr. Rabindra Nath Singh (supra) the learned Judges of the Division Bench
have considered various authorities of the Supreme Court. This Court is in respectful
agreement with the said judgment in Dr. Rabindra Nath Singh (supra) and holds that
in the instant case also the impugned order suffers from the same infirmity inasmuch
as the impugned order does not at all consider objectively Patna High Court L.P.A
No.175 of 2018 dt.30-04-2019 or otherwise the explanation given by the petitioner.
Therefore, the impugned order has to be quashed and this Court does quash it as
being wholly without jurisdiction."
12. In view of such categorical submissions by the petitioner the finding arrived at by the
Disciplinary Authority appears to be mechanical and based on no material and the punishment
order which came as a consequence thereof is rather excessive and has caused prejudice to the
petitioner inasmuch as he had been deprived of the increment for two consecutive years and further
on account of the fact of "censure" inflicted on him, his promotional avenue also appears to have
been scuttled, which in our opinion appears to be wholly unwarranted and calls for interference by
this Court.
13. In the result, for the reasons aforementioned and in the interest of justice, we allow the present
appeal and set aside the order dated 03.01.2018 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 2209 of 2011 by the learned
Single Judge as also the orders dated 09.12.2009 as contained in Memo No. 1467 and also letter no.
1465 dated 28.09.2010 issued under the signature of the Deputy Secretary, Water Resources
Department, Government of Bihar.
14. We accordingly direct that the department Patna High Court L.P.A No.175 of 2018
dt.30-04-2019 shall take necessary steps in furtherance of the prayer of the appellant-petitioner
with regard to the claim for promotion of the appellant-petitioner and pass appropriate orders in
accordance with law.
15. The Appeal is allowed with the direction as stated above.
