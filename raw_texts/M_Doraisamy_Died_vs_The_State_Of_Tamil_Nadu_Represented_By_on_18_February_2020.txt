ORDER
The writ petitioner was appointed as Foremen under the respondents on 28.05.1957. He was given
additional charge to look after the Footwear Unit shifted to Ambattur on 31.12.1987. He has
informed the Superior Officer that the building to which the Ambattur unit was shifted is not safe
and the doors, windows were not in a good condition and there is a hole in the back wall. In spite of
that the Superior Officer decided to shift the unit to that building. On 11.04.1998 when the petitioner
opened the office, he found that certain materials were missing.
2. On the instructions of the Regional Deputy Director and the Assistant Deputy Director, a police
complaint was lodged by him on 16.04.1998. The deficit stock to the tune of Rs.4,06,730.85/- was
found during https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the special audit, immediately on 24.05.1988 the
petitioner was put under suspension and a charge memo was issued on 04.03.1989 for the alleged
loss of stocks worth Rs.6,27,521/-. Originally on 30.09.1987, when verification of stock was made
the deficit was found as Rs.428.50/-. Suddenly within a period of six months, the deficit was
calculated at Rs.6,27,521/-. The order of recovery was also made against the petitioner, which he
challenged in W.P.No.12160 of 1989. This Hon'ble Court by its order dated 01.02.1990 set aside the
order of recovery on the ground of denial of opportunity. Thereafter, the Chief Executive Officer /
the 2nd respondent passed an order of termination dated 29.09.1995 relying on the statement given
by the watchmen. Against which, the petitioner filed an appeal to the Government which was
rejected in G.O.Ms.No.70 Handlooms, Handicrafts, Textiles and Khadi (F1) Department dated
08.02.1999. The petitioner challenged that order vide WP.No.6406/1999. The Hon'ble Court set
aside the punishment order and remanded the matter back on 27.06.2003. Thereafter, a fresh order
of punishment was passed in G.O.Ms.No.87 Handlooms, Handicrafts, Textiles and Kadhi (F1)
Department dated 08.06.2004 which is under challenge in the present writ petition.
3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would contend https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
that in spite of the remand order made by this Court, principles of natural justice was not afforded
the petitioner, and his requests were not at all considered and specifically the charge impugned who
made the statement was not examined as witness and opportunity of cross-examining him was not
afforded to the petitioner.
4. Controverting the allegations, the 1st respondent filed a detailed counter affidavit based on which
the learned counsel appearing for the respondents would submit his arguments. According to him,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13151617/ 3
M.Doraisamy (Died) vs The State Of Tamil Nadu Represented By on 18 February, 2020
the Development Officer has given a report as to the stability of the building and that the police have
closed the case as a mistake of fact. The petitioner being responsible for the entire affairs of the unit
had cooked up a false case and attempts to escape from the charges. The scene created by the
petitioner as there was a theft is falsified by virtue of investigation conducted by the police and
closure report as one mistake of fact. The watch man has given a clear statement that there was no
chances for theft and that he was available all the time and no theft had taken place. The larger
quantities of materials cannot be taken by hands and can only be transported by lorry. Based on that
statement, it is presumed that the petitioner would have removed the materials with the use of lorry.
Based on the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis statement given by the Officer on 30.12.1993, the
Regional Deputy Director made his remarks and held the charge proved in Na.Ka.No.10541/88/E1
dated 18.05.1994, based on which, the punishment of removal from service was imposed on the
petitioner. The petitioner had involved in similar misconduct, for which, he was imposed with a
punishment for stoppage of increment cumulatively for 3 years. It is the second instance and hence
such punishment was imposed which is justified, legal and does not require interference.
5. I heard the submission on both sides.
6. On perusal of the materials placed before this Court, it is clearly seen that the entire disciplinary
proceedings is based on the statements made by the Watchman, Development Officer, Regional
Deputy Manager. The charge memo came to be issued to the petitioner to which he submitted his
explanation denying all the charges. But relying on the written statement given by the watchman it
was held proved and punishment of removal was imposed. The said order was challenged before this
Court.
7. This Court by its order dated 27.06.2003 in W.P.No.6406 of 1999
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis set aside the punishment order, remanded the matter back to the
1st respondent giving opportunity to the petitioner to raise fresh grounds. The additional grounds
raised by the petitioner are as under:-
“(i) order of punishment has been passed by Chief Executive Officer instead of the Commissioner
and Secretary to Government and therefore the order is without jurisdiction;
(ii) non-supply of copy of the documents which were relied on by the Department inspite of the
order in W.P.No.12160/89 dated 1.2.90;
(iii) not providing certain Show Cause Notice as
required by amdended regualtion;
(iv) without holding oral enquiry in the prsence of
the delinquent but treated the statement of Watchman as evidence;
(v) denial of right of cross examining the watchman whose statement was considered as evidence;”
8. It is relevant to point out that the petitioner has raised the grievance that no oral enquiry was held
and the matter was decided on the basis of statement made by watchman and that the denial of right

M.Doraisamy (Died) vs The State Of Tamil Nadu Represented By on 18 February, 2020
to cross-examine the watchman would vitiate the order.
9. The grievance of the petitioner is that inspite of the orders of this
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Court, the respondents did not care to conduct any enquiry. In
reply the learned counsel for the respondent would submit that incident had taken place before
2000. At the relevant point of time no procedure for conducting any enquiry was contemplated the
Rules or bye-laws and hence no enquiry was conducted. The above stand taken by the respondent,
inspite of the orders of this Court to conduct oral enquiry and provide opportunity of
cross-examination would show they are not inclined to conduct enquiry and thereby are not willing
to follow the procedure in conformity with principles of natural justice. On the other hand, without
adopting a fair procedure, whatever statement made by the Development Officer and the remark
made by the Regional Deputy Manger were taken as gospel truth and punishment order was
imposed. To be precise, when the capital punishment was imposed, the respondent did not conduct
any personal hearing, did not examine any witnesses, who made the allegations, much less the
opportunity to cross examine such witness was not offered to the delinquent.
10. The overall circumstance would make it clear that respondents inspite of the directions of this
Court in the previous proceedings deliberately passed an order of removal in violation of principles
of natural justice and it https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appears to the Court that it is an attempt
to make the petitioner a scape goat to the stock deficit. As discussed above, denial of opportunity to
examine the watchman by itself would vitiate the entire proceedings. Another crucial point made out
by the petitioner is that during the previous stock verification on 30.09.1987 the deficit of stock was
found to be Rs.428.50/-. The said watchman would affirm that theft had not taken place. He also
did not state that the petitioner brought some lorry and removed the materials and his further
statement would clearly show that there is no chance of removing such big volume of materials by
hands. The petitioner without the knowledge of the watchman would not have removed so much of
materials by hands. If that be so, there is no explanation as to how the deficit of stock has taken
place. Without explaining as to how the stock deficit of Rs.428.50 rose to Rs.6,27,521/-, and without
explaining the instructions given to lodge a police complainant and without pinpointing the theft or
misconduct committed by petitioner, it can bot be held the petitioner is the culprit without proof.
Only because he was given charge of that office, he cannot be made a scape goat. In that view of the
matter, non examination of watchman is fatal to the prosecution case. The respondents appeared to
have fixed the petitioner in order to escape from the responsibility and to save their skin. So, in such
circumstances, it is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis very clear that the respondents had deliberate
intentions to avoid conduct of enquiry, taking shelter under the so called rules. Even if it is not
specified in the rules, principles of natural justice shall be read in to the rules. No person can be
condemned without an opportunity of hearing. In that view of the matter the respondents, in spite
of the directions given, have violated principles of natural justice. Hence, this Court is of the
considered opinion, the punishment order imposed in G.O.(D).No.87, (Handlooms, Handicrafts,
Textiles and Khadi (F1) Department on the file of the first respondent dated 08.06.2004, is illegal
and is liable to be set aside.
11. At the time of initiation of the proceedings, the petitioner was about to retire. At the time of filing
the writ petition, he was 75 years old. During the pendency of the writ appeal, he passed away and

his legal heir is substituted in his place now that the impugned order is set aside and consequently,
the terminal benefits due to the petitioner shall be disbursed to the legal heir substituted in this writ
petition. This exercise shall be completed within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order.
Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed. No costs. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 18.02.2020 bri
