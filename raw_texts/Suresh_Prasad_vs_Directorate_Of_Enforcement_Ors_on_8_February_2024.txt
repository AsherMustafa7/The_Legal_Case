Manager, Axis Bank, New Friends Colony Branch, New Delhi, ten accounts belonging to the present

Suresh Prasad vs Directorate Of Enforcement & Ors on 8 February, 2024
Under Section 8(3)(a) of the said Money Laundering Act, 2002, it is provided that any attachment of
property or freezing of account under Section 17 of the said Act shall continue for a period of only
365 (three hundred and sixty five) days during the period of investigation or for an indefinite period
of time, if there is pendency of proceeding in connection with the case. The learned counsel
submitted that in the present case, no such proceeding has been initiated or pending before the
Adjudicating Authority till today and as such, the period of freezing of the said accounts cannot
exceed the period of 365 days as provided under Section 8(3)(a) of the said Money Laundering Act.
It has been vehemently submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that since the period of
freezing of the accounts of the petitioner have already exceeded 365 days, the authority has no
power and jurisdiction to prolong the freezing of the said accounts and such action of the authorities
is ultra vires the provisions of Section (3)(a) of the said Money Laundering Act. The learned counsel,
accordingly, prays for passing an appropriate order for defreezing the aforesaid accounts of the
petitioner.
Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI appearing for the respondent No. 1 placed before this court a letter
dated 07-02-2024 from the Assistant Director stating, inter alia, that Prosecution Compliant (PC) in
the subject matter i.e., OA No. 604 of 2021 could not be filed on time owing to prevailing law and
order situation in Manipur and total shutdown of internet connectivity. The learned DSGI fairly
submitted that as of now, no proceeding relating to the said OA No. 604 of 2021 is pending, despite
the draft Prosecution Complaint being forwarded to the competent authority for legal vetting and
approval.
WP(C) No. 2 of 2022 Contd.../-
After considering the submission advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on
careful examination of the materials available on record as well as the provisions of the aforesaid
act, this court is of the considered view that since there is no proceeding pending before the
competent authority in connection with OA No. 604 of 2021, the freezing of accounts of the
petitioner as mentioned in the abovementioned letter dated 25-11-2021 is render illegal by operation
of the provision of Section 8(3)(a) of the said Money Laundering Act.
Accordingly, the respondents are directed to defreeze the said accounts of the petitioner as early as
possible, but not later than two months from today.
With the aforesaid direction, the present writ petition is disposed of.
