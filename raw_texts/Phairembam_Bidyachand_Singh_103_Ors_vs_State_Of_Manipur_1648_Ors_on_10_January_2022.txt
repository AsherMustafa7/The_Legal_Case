Phairembam Bidyachand Singh & 103 Ors.
.... Petitioner/s
- Versus -
State of Manipur & 1648 Ors.
.... Respondent/s
BEFORE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AHANTHEMBIMOL SINGH 10.01.2022 Heard Mr. HS.
Paonam, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners.
Issue notice, returnable within 4 (four) weeks. Mr. K. Jagat, learned GA accepts notice on behalf of
the respondents No. 1 & 2, hence, no formal notice is called for in respect of the said respondents.
It has been submitted by the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners that as the
petitioners cannot get the full address of the respondents No. 3 to 1649, the petitioners may be
permitted to serve notice upon the said respondents No. 3 to 1649 by substitute service by
publishing the notice in two well circulated local dailies (one in English/Sangai Express and one in
Vernacular/Poknapham) for two consecutive days.
Prayer is allowed.
Steps should be taken within a period of 1 (one) week. The learned senior counsel submitted that the
grievance of the petitioners is not against the absorption of the private respondents as Primary
Teacher in the Education (S) Department but giving such absorption retrospectively w.e.f. the date
of their initial appointment which amounts to denial of the rights of the petitioners for their

consideration for promotion to the next higher post.
Accordingly, the learned senior counsel has prayed for passing interim order for suspending the
offending portion of the impugned order.
List this case again on 14.02.2022 and the prayer for passing interim order will be considered on the
next date. In the meantime, it is hereby directed that no promotion should be given to the private
respondents without considering the case of the present petitioners.
