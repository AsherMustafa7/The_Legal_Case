S.Daniel Selvakumar vs State By The Inspector Of Police on 19 November, 2020
http://www.judis.nic.in The appeal is filed against the judgment of acquittal in S.C.No.339 of 2011,
dated 05.06.2014, rendered by the learned Sessions Judge, Mahalir Neethimandram (Fast Track
Mahila Court), Thanjavur.
2.The respondents 2 and 3, who are the accused were charged for the offence under Section 306
IPC. On conclusion of trial, they were acquitted from the charge levelled against them. Aggrieved
over the same, the appellant/defacto complainant/PW1 has filed the present appeal.
3(i)The case of the prosecution is that the appellant/defacto complainant/PW1 was working as
Senior Officer, Customer Care in HDFC Bank from the year 2005. During the year 2007, one
Sathura (deceased), daughter of the respondents 2 and 3, joined as Junior Officer in HDFC Bank.
Initially, both the appellant and the deceased Sathura were moving as friends. Later, their
relationship was blossomed into love affair, which was disclosed to PW13/Parameshwari, Aunt of
the deceased in Chennai. The love affair was not accepted by the respondents 2 and 3 and their
relatives, since appellant belongs to Christian Adi Dravidar Community, whereas, the deceased
belongs to Devar Community.
(ii)Further, the father of the deceased/2nd respondent was a known http://www.judis.nic.in
personality and leader of Dravidar Kazhagam Party in their Village viz., Vadacherry, Thanjavur
District. The deceased was determined in getting married to the appellant. The parents and family
members of the appellant accepted their relationship and both decided to get married during
January 2008. The respondents 2 and 3 along with PW13 met the deceased and asked her to come
to native. She opposed the same, due to which, a commotion arose in public, which was noticed by
Traffic Constable, who took them to Choolaimedu Police Station, where the deceased expressed her
willingness to go with the appellant and PW2/the mother of PW1. On 23.11.2008, the deceased and
the appellant met PW19/Pastor for their marriage.
(iii)On 24.11.2008, the deceased was converted to Christianity and the marriage was registered.
During January 2009, the 2 nd respondent invited his daughter for celebrating Pongal festival at
their native, the deceased insisted that her husband also to be invited, was not accepted by them.
Hence, she refused to visit her native place. The appellant made arrangements for a marriage
reception to be held in Vijaya Park, Vadapalani, Chennai on 12.04.2009. The proposed reception
was informed to PW13, which was conveyed to the parents of the http://www.judis.nic.in
deceased/respondents 2 and 3. On 03.03.2009, the 2 nd respondent contacted PW2, informed that
since he being a known personality in his Village, if the villagers come to know about his daughter's
marriage, he would be looked down in the village and in his community. Further, they have another
daughter, who is yet to get married and her marriage would get affected.
(iv)On 08.03.2009, the respondents 2 and 3 along with PW11, cousin brother of the 2nd respondent
and PW17/friend of the 2nd respondent met PW2 at Chennai and informed that the marriage would
be conducted at their native place Vadacherry on 23.03.2009. The deceased was taken to the house
of PW13, where she stayed for a day. On 16.03.2009, the respondents 2 and 3 came to Chennai,
purchased new dresses to PW1 for the marriage and handed over 100 marriage invitations to him.

S.Daniel Selvakumar vs State By The Inspector Of Police on 19 November, 2020
(v)On 18.03.2009, the deceased reached Vadacherry. After reaching, the deceased was in touch with
PW1. Later, the deceased realized that her father and relatives enacted a drama to take her to their
native and no marriage arrangements as promised were being made. Further, her parents attitude
towards her changed. On 22.03.2009, at http://www.judis.nic.in about 01.30 a.m., the deceased
sent a message to PW1 informing that her father is a person of dual personality and her life is in
danger and she would be done to death. Sensing fear for her life, she sent messages to PW1, who
consoled her. On the same day, at about 09.00 p.m., the deceased contacted PW1 and informed him
that her father was making arrangements to kill her. PW1 along with PW2 and another friend
immediately proceeded to Vadacherry, Thanjavur. While they were proceeding in bus, he received a
phone call from the deceased, informing that her father will not permit her marriage with PW1,
since PW1 belongs to different community and her father was forcing to end her life. At that time,
PW11 informed PW1 that he would pacify the respondents 2 and 3 and requested PW1 not to
approach the Police. At about 4.30 a.m., he received last message from the deceased stating that
they cannot be separated by anyone. At about 8.30 a.m., PW1 received phone call from his office
colleague that the deceased was dead. At that time, they were in Trichy, immediately PW1 and PW2
approached the Inspector General of Police, Central Zone and informed about the suspicious death
of his wife Sathura.
(vi)The Inspector General of Police instructed them to approach http://www.judis.nic.in PW30/the
Inspector of Police, Pappanadu. PW1 lodged a complaint to PW30. On receipt of the complaint
[Ex.P1], a case in Crime No.77 of 2009 [Ex.P13] under Section 174 Cr.P.C., was registered.
Thereafter PW30 informed PW31/the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Orathanadu and
PW27/Revenue Divisional Officer about the death of the deceased Sathura. PW31 and PW27
reached the residence of the deceased, conducted enquiry, examined the persons present in the
scene of occurrence, conducted inquest, prepared Observation Mahazar [Ex.P14] and sent the body
for postmortem. The autopsy was conducted by PW23 and PW24, which were videographed by
PW22. After postmortem, the body was handed over to the parents of the deceased/respondents 2
and 3. PW1 insisted that the body of his wife should be handed over to him. PW30 informed that
there is a tensed situation and the villagers are already agitated and he asked PW1 not to visit the
village and attend funeral, since his safety cannot be assured.
(vii)PW1 on coming to know that his wife Sathura was murdered by administrating poison through
her ears, he approached Mr.Rajendran, Additional Director General of Police and lodged a
complaint. The said Mr.Rajendran advised him to approach Mr.Chokkalingam, Superintendent
http://www.judis.nic.in of Police. There was no proper investigation and the local police were
making arrangement to close the case. Hence, PW1 filed a direction petition before this Court and
this Court directed CBCID to conduct investigation. The 1st respondent took up the investigation,
examined witnesses, collected reports from Forensic Science and Handwriting Expert and examined
the Forensic Surgeon for getting second opinion for cause of death. On collection of documents and
on examination of witnesses, charge sheet was filed against the respondents 2 and 3 under Section
306 IPC.
(viii)The prosecution, in this case, examined PW1 to PW32 and marked Exs.P1 to P18 and MO1 to
MO18. The Trial Court, on conclusion of the trial, acquitted the respondents 2 and 3, against which,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165596421/ 3
S.Daniel Selvakumar vs State By The Inspector Of Police on 19 November, 2020
the appellant/defacto complainant/PW1/husband of the deceased Sathura, filed the above appeal to
set aside the judgment of the trial Court.
4.The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the case is that of intercaste love marriage.
The appellant was working in HDFC Bank in Chennai. At that time, the deceased joined the bank
and they developed love affair between them. PW1 belongs to Christian Adi http://www.judis.nic.in
Dravidar Scheduled Caste community. The deceased belongs to Backward Class. They got married
and it was later registered. After the marriage, they were living in Chennai till 17.03.2009 as
husband and wife. Thereafter, the respondents 2 and 3, who are the parents of the deceased came to
Chennai and took the deceased to their native at Vadacherry, on the pretext that they would conduct
formal marriage in the presence of villagers in their native. Even invitation cards were printed and
handed over to the appellant. The marriage was to be held on 23.03.2009. On 22.03.2009, the
appellant received phone call from the deceased informing that all was not well at her residence and
she was pressurized to marry another person of her parents' choice and her life was in danger.
5.The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the appellant received several short
mail messages from his wife, which were handed over to the Investigating Officer. Sensing fear, the
appellant proceeded to the house of the deceased Sathura. On the way, when he was reaching
Trichy, he received a message from one Aneesa, friend of the deceased that the deceased had
committed suicide. Immediately, the appellant approached the Inspector General of Police, Trichy,
suspecting that his wife would have been done to death, as honour killing. The
http://www.judis.nic.in Inspector General of Police advised the appellant to approach the
Pappanadu Police Station. The appellant reached the Police Station by the middle of the day. In the
meanwhile, the Inspector General of Police informed the concerned Police Station about the
complaint of the appellant. Thereafter, the case was registered at about 01.45 p.m. The learned
counsel further submitted though the poison was found in the viscera, but the chemical combination
was not detected. From the second report, it is found that the poison is a pesticide. This report is in
favour of the respondents 2 and 3. Further, MO1 Dying Declaration creates suspicion and the
Handwriting Expert had not given proper opinion in this case.
6.All the witnesses including VAO had sided with the respondents, except the official witnesses PW1
to PW5, who are the appellant, his family members and friends. The other witnesses are from
Vadacherry, native of respondents 2 and 3. Hence, they have not supported the case of prosecution.
PW16 is the Manager of Marriage Hall, through him, Ex.P2, the marriage hall booking receipt was
marked. According to the appellant, this receipt is a got-up document to cover up the misdeeds of
the respondents 1 and 2. The said receipt is signed by PW16/T.Rajendran, http://www.judis.nic.in
who feigns ignorance about the person, who made booking and no marriage arrangement was made
till the last day. Despite investigation got transferred to CBCID, no substantial improvement was
made in the investigation and the truth has not come to open. The communal clannishness closed
the eyes of every one, even the persons in position.
7.It is further submitted that PW1 handed over the SMS received from the deceased Sathura
informing about the danger of her life and also produced the mobile phone. The copy of SMS
received is found in the case bundle, but it was not marked as exhibit and no evidence brought forth
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165596421/ 4
S.Daniel Selvakumar vs State By The Inspector Of Police on 19 November, 2020
in furtherance to the SMS produced. The appellant is not aware for what reason and why the SMS
were not marked as exhibits. In this case, from the scene of occurrence, MO17/the mobile phone,
MO18/Airtel Sim Card of the deceased were seized, no steps were taken to find out the call details
and also SMS particulars. The specific case of the appellant is that the toxic substances was induced
into the ear of the deceased. From the Postmortem Report [Ex.P4], it is observed that left ear lobe,
inner side of the ear, pinna appeared blueish in colour. On internal observation, it is found that the
lungs and heart were congested in bright red color, but no explanation or clarification was sought
for from the Doctor for such http://www.judis.nic.in deformities. It is also seen that the Postmortem
Doctors/PW23 and PW24 opined that only a qualified Police Surgeon can give opinion for the cause
of the death. It is seen from the Forensic Report [Ex.P8], the presence of Dichlorvos was found in
the bed sheet and pillow covers. PW26/Police Surgeon had given a report [Ex.P9], confirming the
death was occurred due to poisoning. The report of Handwriting Expert is not conclusive. The
Lower Court ignored the medical evidence against the accused on the fact that the death had taken
place in the house of the respondents 2 and 3 and no explanation whatsoever given by the
respondents 2 and 3 either through cross examination or during questioning under Section 313
Cr.P.C and acquitted the respondents 2 and 3. The trial Court elaborately discussed about the
marriage and relationship of PW1 with the deceased, which is not a fact in issue of the case. The trial
Court has not given any finding and reasons to the medical evidence against the respondents 2 and
3. Hence, the learned counsel for the appellant prayed to set aside the judgment of acquittal.
8.The learned Government Advocate [Crl. Side] appearing for the 1st respondent submitted that on
receipt of the complaint [Ex.P1] from PW1, a case in Crime No.77 of 2009 [Ex.P13] was registered by
http://www.judis.nic.in PW30/Investigating Officer. Thereafter, PW30 reached the scene of
occurrence, informed his superior officer and RDO, prepared Observation Mahazar [Ex.P14], Rough
Sketch [Ex.P15]. PW31/the Deputy Superintendent of Police and PW27/the Revenue Divisional
Officer were requested to conduct inquest and enquire, since the death took place within five month
of marriage of PW1 with the deceased. The collected materials from the scene of occurrence were
forwarded to the Court for scientific examination. The marriage between PW1 and deceased was
against the wish of respondents 2 and 3. Later, the respondents 2 and 3, in the guise of conducting
marriage, brought the deceased from Chennai to Vadacherry on 18.03.2009. On 22.03.2009, the
deceased consumed poison and ended her life. During the investigation, it was found that the
respondents 2 and 3 were abusing the deceased for marrying PW1, a low caste person. Expect PW1
to PW5, the other independent witnesses have not supported the case. PW26, the Revenue
Divisional Officer conducted inquest, examined PW1 and the respondents 2 and 3, recorded their
statements and gave finding that the deceased had committed suicide and the 2nd respondent is the
reason for the same.
9.PW23 and PW24, the Doctors conducted Postmortem, which was http://www.judis.nic.in video
graphed by PW22. In the Postmortem report, it is seen that a congestion was found in the lungs and
heart and also in the left ear lobe and the inner side of the ear turned blueish in colour, denoting the
presence of poison. From the Forensic report [Ex.P16], it is seen that there was no poison in the
viscera. The Investigating Officer unable to come to a conclusion, approached PW26/Police Surgeon
to get second opinion. PW26, in his opinion [Ex.P9] observed that the presence of ash color fluid
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165596421/ 5
S.Daniel Selvakumar vs State By The Inspector Of Police on 19 November, 2020
material in the stomach, sub pleural haemorrhages & congested viscera are consistent with OPC -
insecticide poisoning. The death was taken place in the house of respondents 2 and 3 and both of
them has not given any valid explanation except the denial.
10.The learned Government Advocate [Crl. Side] fairly submitted that the details of SMS are found
in the case bundle and submitted to the lower Court. The Investigating Officer did not take any steps
to probe into these aspects, as well on MO17 and MO18. This omission had no bearing in the out
come of investigation. In this case, the investigation was conducted by a special agency, who
produced all the evidence before the trial Court. The trial Court on appreciation of evidence and
materials, acquitted the respondents 2 and 3.
http://www.judis.nic.in
11.The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3 submitted that in this case, the daughter of the
respondents 2 and 3 Sathura/deceased joined HDFC Bank as Junior Officer. While she was working
there, the appellant/PW1 was working as Senior Officer, having been in a dominant position had
influenced their daughter Sathura. They have yet another daughter for whom marriage to be
conducted. The relationship between the appellant and the deceased was initially rejected, since it
would not be acceptable in their village. The respondents 2 and 3 reasoned out the same as parents
of the deceased. The deceased due to her young age was unable to understand the reality and to
agree with her parents. Thereafter, without informing her parents, the marriage was said to be
conducted by PW16 and the same was registered. On coming to know that the deceased was very
firm and determined in marrying the appellant, the respondents 2 and 3 agreed to conduct their
marriage in their native place. Therefore, they came to Chennai, met their daughter, convinced her
about marriage and took her to their native.
12.The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3 further http://www.judis.nic.in submitted that
the grievance of the parents was explained to their daughter and also the importance of the
community living. The 2nd respondent is running pesticide shop in the ground floor and residence
was in the first floor. The deceased Sathura being in a confused state of mind and probably
repenting for her impulsive action taken in Chennai, had committed suicide on her own, for which
the respondents 2 and 3 are not the reason. The appellant on a wrong premise and in impulsiveness,
gave a false complaint against the respondents 2 and 3. The respondents 2 and 3 were in a state of
shock on the sudden death of their daughter, who was brought up with all love and affection. The
deceased left a suicidal note, in which she has clearly stated that the respondents 2 and 3 are not the
reason for the extreme steps taken by her. The same was sent to the Handwriting Expert, who
confirmed the writing as that of the deceased. The medical evidence, Forensic Report does not point
towards the respondents 2 and 3. Apart from PW1 to PW5, none of the witnesses has spoken
anything against the respondents 2 and 3. Further, PW26/Revenue Divisional Officer, in his report
[Ex.P10], has indicated the 2nd respondent only. The 1st respondent Police for obvious reasons has
included the 3rd respondent in the case. The Trial Court, on analyzing the evidence and materials
adduced by the prosecution, gave a well reasoned judgment, acquitting the http://www.judis.nic.in
respondents 2 and 3, which need not be interfered. Thus, the appellant has preferred this appeal on
surmises and conjunctures without any supporting materials.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165596421/ 6
S.Daniel Selvakumar vs State By The Inspector Of Police on 19 November, 2020
13.In support of the arguments, the learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3 relied upon the
following citations:-
● Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke Versus State of Maharashtra and another reported in
(2018) 7 Supreme Court Cases 781, for the point that “if a situation is created
deliberately so as to drive a person to commit suicide, there would be room for
attracting Section 306 IPC.” ● M.Arjunan Versus State Represented by its Inspector
of Police reported in (2019) 3 Supreme Court Cases 315 and the relevant portion is
extracted as follows:-
“The essential ingredients of the offence under Section 306 I.P.C. are: (i) the
abetment; (ii) the intention of the accused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to
commit suicide. The act of the accused, however, insulting the deceased by using
abusive language will not, by itself, constitute the abetment of suicide.” ● Jagdishraj
Khatta Versus State of Himachal Pradesh reported in (2019) 9 Supreme Court Cases
248 for the point that “unless there http://www.judis.nic.in existed grave infirmity
finding of the trial Court to be interfered with.” ● State of West Bengal Versus
Indrajit Kundu and others reported in (2019) 10 Supreme Court Cases 188, for the
point that “there seems to be reasonable certainty to inside the consequence and the
deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide in which case an
instigation may have been inferred.”
14.Considering the rival submission and perusal of materials available on record, this Court finds as
follows:-
● The deceased Sathura and the appellant belonged to different community. Their
love affair was rejected and objected by the parents of the deceased/respondents 2
and 3 and their family.
● The deceased Sathura and the appellant were working in HDFC Bank, Chennai.
Both were in love with each other. Despite opposition from the respondents 2 and 3,
the deceased Sathura married the appellant with the support of the appellant's family
and the marriage was solemnized and registered. From the month of November
2008, they lived as husband and wife.
● The parents of the deceased Sathura took her to their native, Vadacherry on
18.03.20009 to conduct marriage in Vadacherry on http://www.judis.nic.in
25.03.2009. The deceased died unnaturally on 22.03.2008 – 23.03.2008 at her
parental home. The 3rd respondent first saw the body of Sathura and was dead on
23.03.2009 at 05.30 a.m., and informed the 2nd respondent at about 06.00 a.m.
Both of them failed to inform the appellant about the death.
● No Observation Mahazar was prepared in the bed room, where Sathura died. The Observation
Mahazar [Ex.P14] denotes the place where the body was kept later.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165596421/ 7
S.Daniel Selvakumar vs State By The Inspector Of Police on 19 November, 2020
● Ex.P12 is the Form 91 series. It is seen from Form 91 No.0250513, MO1, MO4, MO10 and MO18
are the articles, found at the place of death, which were seized by the Inspector of Police/PW30.
MO5 diary of the year 2006 in Form 91 No.0971458 seized by PW32, CBCID Inspector. From the
Toxicology Report [Ex.P8], it is seen that Dichlorovas is detected in the bed sheet, pillow and on the
dress of the deceased.
15.In this case, admittedly, PW1 is the husband of the deceased; PW2 is the mother of PW1; PW3 is
brother-in-law of PW1; PW4 and PW5 are the friends of PW1. The evidence of these witnesses is to
the effect that there was intercaste love marriage between PW1 and the deceased,
http://www.judis.nic.in which was not agreed by the respondents 2 and 3, who are the parents of
the deceased. PW1 and the deceased got married and living as husband and wife. The respondents 2
and 3 took the deceased to their native Vadacherry, Thanjavur on 18.03.2009 for formal marriage
ceremony to be held on 25.03.2009. The deceased death was unnatural at early hours on
23.03.2009. PW1 stated that the deceased informed him that her parents were not willing to
perform the marriage and her life was in danger and consoled her. Further, PW1 produced SMS
recorded messages, which is available in the case records. On perusal of the same, it is seen that the
message available is from 22.03.2009 01.23 hours to 23.03.2009 04.35 hours, in which the
deceased expressed her apprehension and fear about her life and safety to PW1. These messages
cannot be held against the respondents 2 and 3 without further materials. On the other hand, the
deceased had left a letter, which was marked as MO1. In that letter, it was written as follows:-
“vd; mg;ght[f;F vd;dhy; Vw;gl;l mtkhd';fs; fz;L vd;dhy; jh';f ,ayhky; ,e;j Koit ehd;
vLj;njd;/ ,jpy; vd; mg;ght[f;nfh. mk;kht[f;nfh ve;j rk;ke;jk; ,y;iy/ vd;Dila Ra
rpe;jidnahL ,e;j Koit vLj;Js;nsd;/”
16.PW25, the Hand Writing Expert gave report [Ex.P11]. From
http://www.judis.nic.in Ex.P11 it is seen that the questioned writings were marked as
Q1 and Q2 and the standard writings were marked as A1 to A27. The Hand Writing
Expert had given a finding that a person, who wrote A1 to A27 has also wrote the
writing and signature marked as Q1 and Q2. On perusal of MO1 letter, it is seen that
the deceased absolved her parents for the steps taken by her. This letter [MO1] was
seized through Form-91 on 29.03.2009, no reason was given for the delay in seizure.
17.As stated above, other than the official witnesses and PW1 to PW5, none others
supported the case of the prosecution. In such circumstances, the links are not
continuously interlinked and it is cut and broken. PW22 and PW23 are the
Postmortem Doctors, who had issued Postmortem report [Ex.P4] and Final Opinion
[Ex.P5]. From the Post-
Mortem report [Ex.P4] it is observed as follows:-
“Body of a female lie on back, arm close to sides of the body, symmatrical. RM passed
off in both upper limbs present in both lower limbs. Eyes closed, pupils dilated, lips

the question” whether the death is due to poisoning and the poisoning could not be deducted in
Chemical Analysis Report.

the stomach, sub pleural hemorrhages & congested viscera) are consistent with OPC
– insecticide poisoning.”
21.On combined analysis of the above documents and the witnesses, it is seen that the death had
occurred due to poisoning. It is to be seen that whether the poison was consumed by herself or
administered forcibly.
22.From the Postmortem report [Ex.P4], it is seen that there is no external injury, whatsoever
denoting violence and forceful administration of poison. It is an admitted case that the 2 nd
respondent is running a pesticide shop in ground floor and they are residing in the first floor of the
house. The deceased was sleeping in a separate bed room and the respondents 2 and 3 were sleeping
in another bed room. On the fateful http://www.judis.nic.in day, the deceased was sleeping alone.
On 23.09.2009, the 3 rd respondent is the first person, who saw the deceased at about 05.30 a.m.,
and found vomit spread on the dress of the deceased as well in pillow cover and bed sheet. Though
there is some dispute with regard to seizure of these articles and non preparation of Observation
Mahazar in the scene of occurrence, from the Toxicology Report, it is found that the dichlorvos in
bed sheet [MO10], pillow cover [MO11] and the dress of the deceased [MO6 & MO7] was present.
On what time the deceased consumed poison is not known. The non deduction of the poisonous
substance in the viscera report and the presence of blueish color in the ear might have been due to
effluence by the deceased after consuming the poison. From the Medical and Forensic Report, it can

be safely held that the poison is not administered through the ear. There are some suspicion
pointing towards the respondents 2 and 3 in this case. It is well settled principle that however, grave
the suspicion, the same cannot be a subsistence for evidence. There are missing links in the chain of
circumstances. Further, the occurrence has taken place in the year 2009.
23.The prosecution failed to establish circumstances by cogent evidence to complete the chain to
arrive at a irresistible conclusion to http://www.judis.nic.in bring home the charge levelled against
respondents 2 and 3. There are many missing links in chain of circumstances to prove guilt of
respondents 2 and 3 for offence under Section 306 IPC. Hence, the natural corollary is that the
respondents 2 and 3 have to get benefit of doubt and was acquitted by the trial Court and the same
cannot be interfered with by this Court.
24.In view of the above, the judgment of acquittal dated 05.06.2014, in S.C.No.339 of 2011, passed
by the learned Sessions Judge, Mahalir Neethimandram (Fast Track Mahila Court), Thanjavur is,
hereby, affirmed and the appeal stands dismissed.
