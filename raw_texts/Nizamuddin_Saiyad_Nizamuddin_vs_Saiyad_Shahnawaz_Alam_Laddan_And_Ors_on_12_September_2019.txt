Nizamuddin @ Saiyad Nizamuddin vs Saiyad Shahnawaz Alam @ Laddan And Ors on 12 September, 2019
Pre-litigation case, has been dismissed with cost.
The petitioner has further prayed for setting aside
the award dated 11.08.2004 passed in Pre-litigation case no. 205
of 2004, whereby and whereunder the same has been decreed by
Patna High Court CWJC No.20 of 2016 dt.12-09-2019
2/14
the Presiding Officer of Permanent Lok Adalat, Kaimur at
Bhabhua in terms of the compromise.
2. The brief facts of the case, according to the
petitioner is that the respondent no. 1 namely Saiyad Shahnawaz
Alam @ Laddan had filed a Pre-litigation case no. 205 of 2004
on 16.07.2004 before the Permanent Lok Adalat, Kaimur at
Bhabhua without impleading the petitioner herein as a defendant
and a prayer was made to confirm the right, title and possession
over the Scheduled 'K' land. In the said petition filed by the
respondent no. 1, it had been stated that Late Moinuddin,
husband of the respondent no. 2 herein, had died issueless and
on account of love and affection, he had orally gifted Schedule
'K' property to the respondent no. 1, whereafter the respondent
no. 1 had been coming into peaceful possession of the said
property. The respondent no. 2 herein had appeared in the said
Pre-litigation case and in collusion with the respondent no. 1,
had filed a compromise petition on 05.08.2004 with a prayer to
confirm the right, title and possession of the Schedule 'K' land
in favour of the petitioner no. 1, whereafter an award dated
11.08.2004
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63502696/ 2
Nizamuddin @ Saiyad Nizamuddin vs Saiyad Shahnawaz Alam @ Laddan And Ors on 12 September, 2019
was prepared in terms of the compromise and the learned Permanent Lok Adalat had declared the
right, title and possession of the Schedule 'K' property in favour of the Patna High Court CWJC
No.20 of 2016 dt.12-09-2019 respondent no. 1 and accordingly had disposed of the Pre-litigation
T.S. no. 205 of 2004. It is the further case of the petitioner that after he came to know of the
aforesaid award dated 11.08.2004, he had filed Miscellaneous case no. 36 of 2007 on 02.08.2007 for
setting aside the award dated 11.08.2004, however the said miscellaneous case has been dismissed
by the impugned order dated 20.12.2010.
3. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that both the award dated
11.08.2004 as well as the order dated 20.12.2010 passed by the Permanent Lok Adalat, Kaimur at
Bhabhua are illegal and without jurisdiction. It has been further submitted that the Lok Adalat can
only resolve dispute in relation to public utility service including such service, which the Central or
the State Government may declare, in the public interest, to be public utility services under Section
22-A(b) of Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 1987). It is
submitted that the dispute in question, does not fall within the ambit of the public utility service, as
defined under Section 22-A(b) of the Act, 1987. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has
further submitted that the order dated 20.12.2010 passed by the Permanent Lok Adalat, Kaimur at
Bhabhua is equally misconceived, illegal and Patna High Court CWJC No.20 of 2016 dt.12-09-2019
erroneous, inasmuch as the miscellaneous case filed by the petitioner herein, has been dismissed on
the ground that the petitioner has failed to state in his miscellaneous petition, as to what kind of
fraud was played by the parties in obtaining the award dated 11.08.2004, whereas the fact is that
fraud is writ large from the records of the case.
4. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has relied on a judgment rendered in the case of
Dhirendra Pratap Singh v. Ravi Kant Singh by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court reported in 2014(2)
PLJR 619, paragraphs 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16 whereof, are reproduced hereinbelow :-
" 5. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that award dated 20.12.2003 passed by 'Lok
Adalat' on the basis of compromise, attained finality in terks of Section 21 of the Act which was not
appelable before any Court. He further submitted that power of review is statutory in nature and in
the absence of such power "Permanent Lok Adalat" Kaimur at Bhabhua could not have reviewed the
award passed by 'Lok Adalat'.
6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents, defending the impugned order passed by
"Permanent Lok Adalat"
Kaimur at Bhabhua has contended that respondent No. 2 was intentionally not of
2003 and award passed by „Lok Adalat(cid:129) dated 20.12.2003 was collusive and in such
circumstance "Permanent Lok Adalat",taking into account entire facts and
circumstances rightly set aside the Patna High Court CWJC No.20 of 2016
dt.12-09-2019 award passed by 'Lok Adalat'.
9. From the conjoint reading of Section 22-A(a), 22B and22A(b), it would be evident
that "Permanent Lok Adalat" can be established only for exercising jurisdiction in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63502696/ 3
Nizamuddin @ Saiyad Nizamuddin vs Saiyad Shahnawaz Alam @ Laddan And Ors on 12 September, 2019
respect of one or more „public utility services(cid:129)as defined under Section 22-A.
10. A "Permanent Lok Adalat", in view of these provisions can have no jurisdiction
with respect to any matter other than public utility services as defined under Section
22 -A(b).
11. This is also to be noted that these provisions fall under Chapter VI A of the Act
which deals with pre-litigation, conciliation and settlement. From the heading of
Chapter VI-A, it will appear that a "Permanent Lok Adalat" shall have no jurisdiction
in respect of a matter which had been pending in a court of law. It can have
jurisdiction with respect to only such matters which have so far not travelled to the
court of law.
15.There are two aspects of the matter As has been noted above, none of the public
utility services within the meaning of Section 22A(b) was the subject matter of the
suit. The subject matter of the suit had no connection at all with the public utility
services for which Permanent Lok Adalats are established and only over which the
Permanent Lok Adalat can have jurisdiction. In the facts and circumstances of the
case, in my opinion, the "Permanent Lok Adalat" had no jurisdiction at all to
entertain the application filed by the Respondent No. 2 for any purpose whatsoever
with respect to the subject matter of the Title Suit No.283 of 2003. The impugned
order dated 10.06.2011 passed by "Permanent Lok Adalat"
Kaumur at Bhabhua ,in Miscellaneous Case No. 06 of 2004 cannot be sustained Patna High Court
CWJC No.20 of 2016 dt.12-09-2019 being absolutely without jurisdiction. Secondly; in any case, a
"Permanent Lok Adalat" could not have entertained any dispute which was brought before any
courtprior to parties approaching to "Permanent Lok Adalat". A "Permanent Lok Adalat" certainly
has the jurisdiction even to adjudicate upon the disputes between the parties but only with respect
to pre-litigation matters when the dispute relates to one of the public utility services. The
"Permanent Lok Adalat" cannot have any jurisdiction to deal with any dispute other than that
provided under Chapter IV- A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.
16. Submission made on behalf of the respondents cannot be accepted in view of the discussions as
above. Accordingly, this application is allowed. The impugned order dated 10.06.2011 passed by
'Permanent Lok Adalat', Kaimur at Bhabhua in Miscellaneous case no. 6 of 2004 is set aside."
5. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for respondents no. 1 and 2 has submitted that the fact
is that the land in question originally belonged to one Md. Aziz who had two sons namely Md.
Ameen and Mohammadin but they had got separated and partition had taken place in between them
pertaining to the property they had inherited from their father namely Md. Aziz. Md. Ameen had
two sons namely Sheikh Nizamuddin i.e. the petitioner herein and Md. Moinuddin. The said Md.
Ameen also died leaving behind his abovenamed two sons who came in joint possession over the
3.56 acres of land. It Patna High Court CWJC No.20 of 2016 dt.12-09-2019 is further submitted that
after the death of Md. Ameen, partition had taken place between Sheikh Nizamuddin and Md.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63502696/ 4
Nizamuddin @ Saiyad Nizamuddin vs Saiyad Shahnawaz Alam @ Laddan And Ors on 12 September, 2019
Moinuddin and both the brothers came in separate exclusive possession of their respective shares.
Since Md. Moinuddin had no issue, he had kept Md. Saiyed Shahnewaj Alam @ Laddan i.e. the
respondent no. 1 with him to look after him and his wife namely Aysa Begum i.e. the respondent no.
2 herein. The respondent no. 1 is stated to be the son of the brother-in-law of Md. Moinuddin. The
said Md.
Moinuddin, during his life time, had made a oral gift in presence of his wife and other relatives in
respect of his entire property to the respondent no. 1 on account of love and affection, whereafter the
respondent no. 1 had also accepted the said oral gift (hebba) and thereafter, the respondent no. 1
had come into exclusive possession over the land in question. After the death of Md. Moinuddin in
the year, 2003, the petitioner had turned dishonest and on account of his greedy and bad intentions
of grabbing the land of Md. Moinuddin, which had been gifted to the respondent no. 1, the
respondent no. 1 had filed a Pre-litigation case no. 205 of 2004 before the Permanent Lok Adalat,
Kaimur at Bhabhua, wherein the respondent no. 2 had appeared and a joint compromise petition
dated 05.08.2004 was Patna High Court CWJC No.20 of 2016 dt.12-09-2019 filed and the said case
was decreed in favour of the respondent no. 1 vide an award dated 11.08.2004. Thereafter, the
petitioner, in collusion with his daughter i.e. the respondent no. 3 herein, had filed a Miscellaneous
case no. 36 of 2007 before the Permanent Lok Adalat, Kaimur at Bhabhua for setting aside the
award dated 11.08.2004 on the ground of fraud, however the same has been dismissed by an order
dated 20.12.2010.
6. The learned counsel for the respondent no. 1 has relied upon the provisions contained in
Sub-clause (1) of Section 22-C of the Act, 1987, which is reproduced hereinbelow :-
" (1) Any party to a dispute may, before the dispute is brought before any Court, make
an application to the Permanent Lok Adalat for the settlement of dispute. "
Thus, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent no. 1 that the Permanent Lok Adalat,
in question has got jurisdiction to entertain the connected case and pass an award.
7. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the materials on record. At this
juncture, it would be relevant to reproduce Sections 22-A, 22-B and 22-C of the Legal Services
Authorities Act, 1987 hereinbelow :-

8. A bare perusal of Section 22-A(b), which defines Patna High Court CWJC No.20 of 2016
dt.12-09-2019 the public utility service and a collective reading of Section 22- A(a), Section 22-A(b),
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63502696/ 7
Nizamuddin @ Saiyad Nizamuddin vs Saiyad Shahnawaz Alam @ Laddan And Ors on 12 September, 2019
Section 22-B and Section 22-C would demonstrate that- "In Chapter VI-A of the Legal Services
Authorities Act, 1987", which deals with Pre-litigation, Conciliation and Settlement, the Permanent
Lok Adalats have been established only for exercising jurisdiction in respect of one or more public
utility services as defined under Section 22-A (b) of the Act. Thus, a Permanent Lok Adalat Court
has no jurisdiction with respect to any matter other than the public utility services.
9. In the instant case, the respondent no. 1 had filed a Pre-litigation case bearing case no. 205 of
2004 before the learned Court of Permanent Lok Adalat, Kaimur at Bhabhua interalia praying
therein to declare and confirm that the complainant/ plaintiff is the owner and has the possession
over the suit property which has been described in Schedule 'K'. It is apparent that the said
Pre-litigation T.S. case no. 205 of 2004 had no connection at all with the public utility services for
which Permanent Lok Adalats, as aforesaid, have been established and over which, the Permanent
Lok Adalat can have jurisdiction.
10. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the Patna High Court CWJC No.20 of 2016
dt.12-09-2019 case as also considering the aforesaid provisions of law, this Court is of the opinion
that the Permanent Lok Adalat has no jurisdiction at all to either entertain or deal with any dispute
other than those provided for, under Section 22-A(b) of the Act, 1987, inasmuch as the subject
matter of the said suit in question does not relate to any of the public utility services.
Consequently, this Court finds that the award dated 20.12.2010 passed by the Permanent Lok
Adalat, Kaimur at Bhabhua in Pre-litigation case no. 205 of 2004 is without jurisdiction, hence is set
aside. Resultantly, the order dated 20.12.2010 passed by the Permanent Lok Adalat in
Miscellaneous case no. 36 of 2007(arising out of the aforesaid order dated 11.08.2004) is bound to
fall having no legs to stand, on account of quashing of the award dated 11.08.2004 itself, thus the
same is also quashed.
11. The writ petition stands allowed.
