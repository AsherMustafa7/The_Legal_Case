JUDGMENT
This appeal under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act for
short) has been preferred by the assessee. The subject matter of the appeal pertains to the
Assessment year 2006-07. The appeal was admitted by a bench of this Court vide order dated
10.07.2013 on the following substantial question of law:
Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in applying the
provisions of Section 40A(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of cash payments made by the
assessee to the agriculturists/farmers for purchase of land?
2. The facts leading to filing of this appeal in a nut shell are that assessee is private limited company
registered under the Companies Act, 1956 engaged in the business of real estate development. The
assessee filed its return of income on 12-06-2007 declaring an income of Rs.3,48,240/-. A survey
was conducted under Section 133A of the Act in the business premises of the assessee. The case of
the assessee was selected for scrutiny and an order of assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act
was passed on 29-12-2008 by which the Assessing Officer disallowed business expenditure to the
tune of Rs.17,52,527/- holding that the payment towards purchased of land during the assessment
year was hit by Section 40A(3).
3. The assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), who by an order
dated 23-02-2011 confirmed the order of the Assessing Officer with regard to the disallowance of
business expenditure of the assessee. The assessee filed its cross objections against the aforesaid
order in the appeal preferred by the revenue before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The tribunal
by its order dated 05-10-2012 affirmed the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) with
regard to the disallowance of business expenditure. In the aforesaid factual background, the instant
appeal has been filed.
4. Learned counsel for the assessee submitted that the purpose and intent of Section 40A(3) is to
curb tax evasion by establishing the identity of the parties and the genuineness of the transaction. It
is further submitted that the Tribunal has erroneously invoked the provisions of Section 40A (3)
when the identity of the parties and the genuineness of the transaction were not in question. It is
also pointed out that it was not the defence of the assessee that transactions took place at the place
where there was no banking facility. However, the authorities have erroneously assumed the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193091989/ 2
M/S Nam Estates Pvt. Ltd. vs The Income Tax Officer on 7 September, 2020
aforesaid fact and have deprived the assessee of the benefit of Section 40A(3) of the Act. It is urged
that the Tribunal has failed to appreciate that the transactions were made in cash due to the
business expediency of the assessee, which exempts the expenditure incurred from the applicability
of Section 40A(3) as per the second proviso to Section 40A (3). In support of the aforesaid
submissions, reliance has been placed on COPY OF CIRCULAR No.6-P, DATED 06.07.1968, COPY

5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the revenue has submitted that Section 40A(3) provides
for disallowance of cash expenditure incurred in excess of Rs.20,000/- and that the aforesaid
provision cannot be made applicable only if the case of the assessee falls within the exceptions
provided under Rule 6DD of the Income Tax Rules. It is further submitted that the assessee has
failed to prove by any cogent evidence that it was covered by any exceptions provided under Section
40A(3) of the Act read with Rule 6DD of the Income Tax Rules. It is also submitted that no
substantial question of law arises in this appeal and that the order of the Tribunal is based on
meticulous appreciation of evidence and it is not open for this court in the exercise of its appellate
jurisdiction to interfere with the findings of fact made by the authorities. In support of the aforesaid
submissions reliance has been placed on 'VIJAY KUMAR TALWAR vs. COMMISSIONER OF
INCOME TAX', (2011) 330 ITR 0001.
6. We have considered the submissions made by learned counsel and have perused the record.
Before proceeding further, it is apposite to take note of Section 40A(3) of the Act and Rule 6DD of
the Rules, which read as under:

7. From perusal of the Circular dated 06.07.1998 issued by Finance Department, it is evident that
object of incorporation of Section 40A(3) was to make a provision to counter evasion of tax through
claims for expenditure shown to have been incurred in cash with a view to frustrating proper
investigation by the department as to the identity of the payee and the reasonableness of the
payment. The Supreme Court dealt with the ambit and scope of Section 40A(3) read with Rule 6DD
and held that Section 40A(3) only empowers the assessing officer to disallow the deduction claimed
as expenditure in respect of payments is made in cash. It was further held that consideration of
business expediency and other relevant factors are not excluded and genuine and bonafide
transactions are not taken out of the sweep of the Section and it is open for the assessee to furnish to
the satisfaction of the assessing officer the circumstances under which the payment in the manner
prescribed under Section 40A(3) was not practicable or would have caused genuine difficulty to the
payee. It is also open to the assessee to identify the person who has received the cash payment. Rule
6DD provides that an assessee can be exempted from requirement of payment by a crossed cheque
or a crossed bank draft in the circumstances specified in the Rule. It was further held that from
conjoint reading of Section40A(3) and Rule 6DD, it is evident that they are intended to regulate the
business transactions and to prevent the use of unaccounted money or reduce the chances to use
black money for business transactions.
8. In the aforesaid well settled legal principles, we may now examine whether the assessee in the
facts of the case has complied with the aforesaid requirement so as to enable him to claim
exemption from provisions of Section 40A(3) of the Act. The Assessing Officer in the order dated
29.12.2008 inter alia has held as under:
Cash payment on account of land
purchase:
It is noticed during he course of scrutiny assessment that the assessee has made payment in excess
of Rs.20,000/- in contravention to the provision of Section 40A(3) of the Income-Tax Act 1961,
while making payment towards purchase of land, during the year. The amount so paid is quantified
at Rs.87,92,635/-. This aspect was discussed with the assessee's authorized representative. Who in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193091989/ 6
M/S Nam Estates Pvt. Ltd. vs The Income Tax Officer on 7 September, 2020
his submission dated 18.12.2008 has filed the reason for the same as "Payments made at the place
which was not served with any banking facilities."
9. Thus, from the perusal of the relevant extract of the order passed by the assessing officer, it is
evident that the assessee's authorized representative in his written submission dated 18.12.2008 had
disclosed the reason for payment in cash on the ground that the payments were made at place which
was not served with any banking facility. The assessing officer has found that the place at which the
payment was made had banking facility and therefore, has held that the assessee failed to prove that
it was covered in the exception clause as provided under Section 40A(3) read with Rule 6DD. The
aforesaid finding has been affirmed by Commissioner of Income Tax (appeals) vide order dated
23.02.2011. The relevant extract reads as under:
Considering the various fats, I find that the appellant could not demonstrate with
cogent evidences that there was business expediency or sufficient cause for such cash
payments to various parties in the relevant assessment year. The explanation of the
appellant that the transaction has taken place in Devenahalli Taluk which lacked the
banking facilities in and around the place is not acceptable in the light of the fact that
these transactions have taken place in the vicinity of Bangalore District, Devenahalli
Taluk, which had umpteen number of banks and branches. Further, the contention of
the appellant that the recipients had insisted on cash payment is not acceptable.
Though the parties were identifiable and cash payments were genuine, these
payments were squarely hit by the provisions of Section 40A(3).
10. Thus, it is evident that the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) have also found that the
assessee has failed to prove the stand taken by him that the transaction took place at the place where
there were no banking facilities. The aforesaid finding has been affirmed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal. Therefore, the contention of the appellant that it had taken a defence before the
authorities that the parties were identifiable and the transactions were genuine cannot be accepted,
as the aforesaid contention is being raised for the first time in this appeal, which even otherwise is
contrary to the material on record, which has already been referred to supra. The aforesaid findings
are findings of fact and this court as a general rule would not interfere except in cases where the
parties have ignored material evidence or have acted on no evidence, or have drawn wrong inference
from proved facts by applying the law erroneously. The assessee has not been able to show that its
case falls in any of the aforesaid categories. In view of preceding analysis, the substantial question of
law framed by bench of this court vide order dated 10.07.2013 is answered in the negative and
against the assessee.
In the result, we do not find any merit in this appeal. The same fails and is hereby dismissed.
