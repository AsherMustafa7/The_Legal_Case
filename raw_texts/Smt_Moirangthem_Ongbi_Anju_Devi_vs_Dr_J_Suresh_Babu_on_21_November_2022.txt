With MC [CONT. CAS (C)] No. 157 of 2022 BEFORE HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SANJAY
KUMAR HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AHANTHEM BIMOL SINGH 21.11.2022 Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] This contempt case was instituted alleging willful disobedience to the order dated
06.08.2018 (wrongly shown as 08.08.2018) passed by a Division Bench of this Court
in W.P. (C) No. 706 of 2018. By the said order, the Division Bench directed the
authorities to consider the claim for payment of ex-gratia to the next of kin of late
Elangbam Kanto Singh in terms of the order dated 30.08.2014 revising the ex-gratia
amount and to pass appropriate orders as regards the claim for payment to the next
of kin of the deceased and to intimate to the petitioner the result of such
consideration by issuing a speaking order.
[2] The petitioner in the writ petition was the elder sister of late Elangbam Kanto Singh.
[3] Heard Mr. M. Rakesh, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Y. Nirmolchand, learned senior
counsel, appearing for respondents No. 1, 3 & 5; and Mr. K. Modhusudon, learned counsel for

5 seeking closure of the contempt case on the ground that the order of this Court was duly complied
with. He produced a copy of the order dated 31.08.2022 issued by the Deputy Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, recording that the Governor of Manipur had accorded administrative
approval for sanction of a sum (cid:128).5,00,000/- towards payment of ex-gratia to the next of kin of late
Elangbam Kanto Singh in compliance with the direction of this Court in W.P. (C) No. 706 of 2018.
The Deputy Commissioner, Thoubal District, Manipur, was directed to take necessary action for
verification of the next of kin, details of the bank account number etc. and to transfer the sanctioned
amount to the beneficiary.
[5] As the petitioner is the sister of the deceased and it is an admitted fact that he was married and
also had children at the time of his death, it would be necessary for proper ascertainment of who is
the next of kin who would be receiving the ex-gratia amount.
[6] That aspect would not arise for consideration before this Court in this contempt case. As the
direction of this Court to consider the claim for payment of ex-gratia has been duly complied with,
no cause is made out for exercise of contempt jurisdiction at this stage. It is for the petitioner or any
other person(s) claiming to be the next of kin of late Elangbam Kanto Singh to furnish sufficient
proof of their status so that they can receive the ex-gratia amount.
Reserving liberty to them to do so, CONT. CAS (C) No. 71 of 2019 is closed.
In consequence, MC [CONT. CAS (C)] No. 157 of 2022 is allowed. No order as to costs.
