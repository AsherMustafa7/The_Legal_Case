32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under

passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall

alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)

4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Patna High Court CWJC No.14680 of 2019
dt.14-10-2025 Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal. Therefore, the petitioner is
directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional Commissioner.

before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed

complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
