4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is not involved in any manner in
the alleged offence. The recovery of incriminating articles were made by the police from the house of
one Dukh Haran Panjiyar. The petitioner has got no concern with the said house. However, with
ulterior motive, the police have named the petitioner in the FIR as the persons occupying the house
of Dukh Haran Panjiyar.
5. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the State submitted that there is specific allegation in
the FIR that the petitioner is a tenant in the house of Dukh Haran Panjiyar. It was he who was
dealing in illicit liquor in spite of there being complete prohibition in the State. He contended that
the allegations made in the FIR were investigated by the police and the witnesses examined in
course of investigation have also supported that it was the petitioner who was occupying the house
of Dukh Haran Panjiyar as tenant. The police have completed the investigation and submitted
charge-sheet before the court.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.1249 of 2019 dt.02-09-2019
6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the FIR in question, as contained in
Annexure-1 to the present application, I find substance in the submission of learned counsel for the
State. There is specific allegation against the petitioner that he was a tenant in the house of Dukh
Haran Panjiyar and was carrying an illegal trade of liquor. When the police party raided the
premises occupied by the petitioner, huge quantity of illicit liquor of different brands were recovered
and seized. The witnesses examined in course of investigation whose statements were recorded
under Section 161(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure have also supported the allegations made in
the FIR. The police found the allegations made in the FIR to be true and they filed charge-sheet
before the court.
7. In my considered opinion, no case for quashing the FIR in question is made out.
8. The application is dismissed.
