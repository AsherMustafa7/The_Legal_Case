W.P. No.26602/2018 & 2821, 534, 22, 15, 14, 12546, 8457 of 2019
Gwalior, Dated :20/11/2019
Shri Prashant Sharma, Advocate for petitioners (in all
petitions).
Shri P.S. Raghuvanshi, Government Advocate for
respondents/State (in all petitions).
By this common order W.P. No.26602/2018 (Mano Bai and others Vs. State of M.P. and others),
W.P. No.2821/2019 (Smt. Asha and another Vs. State of M.P. and others), W.P. No.534/2019 (Shri

are being decided.
2. For the sake of convenience, the facts of Writ Petition No.26602/2018 (Mano Bai and others Vs.
State of M.P. and others) shall be considered.
3. The necessary facts for disposal of the present petition in short are that Tahsildar by order dated
28/7/2003 granted lease of the Government land to the petitioners as well as to other similarly
situated persons. In the month of August, 2011, a complaint was made to the Collector with regard
to the irregularities committed 2 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P.
No.26602/2018 & 2821, 534, 22, 15, 14, 12546, 8457 of 2019 while grant of lease to the petitioners
and some more similarly situated persons and accordingly, the SDO, Dabra by order dated
28/12/2011 directed the Naib Tahsildar, Circle Chhemak, Tahsil Dabra, District Gwalior to submit
its report. The Naib Tahsildar submitted its report dated 5/11/2011 and submitted that the land in
question was initially recorded as Charnoi land. On 7/7/2003 the then Tahsildar initiated
proceedings on the basis of the list of Beehad Bhumi submitted by the Patwari and an advertisement
was issued for inviting the applications for grant of Patta. On 28/7/2003, total 243 applications
were received and on the very same day, Patta of Beehad Bhumi was granted to 101 persons. It was
opined that the Patwari had not annexed the copy of the Khasra and the map alongwith the list,
whereas it was necessary for him to annex the copy of Khasra Panchshala to ensure that the land in

Smt. Kallo vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2019
question is recorded as Beehad land and thus, the Tahsildar has ignored this important aspect and
allotted the Pattas. It was further held that the notice of inviting applications was affixed on the
board of the Gram Panchayat, however, the copy of the same was not sent to each of the Gram
Panchayats and even the notice was not affixed on the board of the Court. As per the circular, the
Beehad Bhumi having the depth upto 2 meter can be given on lease, however, in the lease deed there
is no mention about the quality of the land and it is also not mentioned about the depth of Beehad
Bhumi. It was also mentioned that as per 3 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P.
No.26602/2018 & 2821, 534, 22, 15, 14, 12546, 8457 of 2019 the circular, the Tahsildar should have
prepared the list of eligible candidates and thereafter, should have forwarded the said list to the
Public Estate Committee for their selection and in case if the approval is not received within a period
of fifteen days, only then the Tahsildar could have allotted the land, but no such proceedings were
undertaken. Furthermore, by way of premium 20% of the market price of land, assessed on the basis
of sale deeds executed during the last three years should have been got deposited from the
candidates of general category, but that was not done and it was also held that 54 beneficiaries out
of 101 were having the land either in their name or in the name of their family members and
accordingly, opined that the Pattas have been distributed de hors the provisions of law.
4. Accordingly, the SDO, Dabra sent a proposal to the Collector, Gwalior for taking the matter in suo
moto revision.
5. On the basis of the recommendation made by the SDO, Dabra, the Collector, Gwalior took the
matter in suo moto revision and issued show-cause notices to the beneficiaries. Replies were filed.
In the meanwhile, one Nathuram Baghel, Mohan Baghel and Ramesh filed an application under
Order I Rule 10 CPC for impleading them as party. The Collector by order dated 11/3/2013 directed
to implead Nathuram as respondent no.2 against which beneficiaries filed a revision and the Board
of Revenue set aside the order dated 11/3/2013. Thereafter, the proceedings were initiated. The
counsel for 4 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P. No.26602/2018 & 2821, 534, 22,
15, 14, 12546, 8457 of 2019 the beneficiaries/petitioners appeared before the Collector and made a
submission that on 17/7/2003 the Additional Collector, Datia had declared Charnoi land as Beehad
Bhumi and accordingly, on 26/7/2003 the Patwari submitted the list of Beehad Bhumi. Accordingly,
a notice was issued to Tahsildar for production of record. A statement was made by the Tahsildar,
Dabra that the record is missing and in spite of intense search, the same could not be located and
accordingly, on the basis of the list of Beehad Bhumi submitted by the Patwari as well as the
argument of counsel, the case was heard by the Collector. It was submitted by the
petitioners/beneficiaries that the objectors are not the resident of the locality. The petitioners
belong to either OBC or Scheduled Caste and only Biharilal and Mohan belongs to the General
Category and the list submitted by the Patwari should be treated as correct.
6. The Collector after considering the material which was available before him came to the
conclusion that material illegality was committed by the Tahsildar by extending the benefit to
ineligible persons and accordingly, the Pattas dated 28/7/2003 granted by the Tahsildar to the
petitioners and similarly situated persons were cancelled and the Tahsildar was directed to correct
the revenue records and make the entries which were existing prior to 28/7/2003.

7. Being aggrieved by the order of the Collector, the petitioners filed an appeal, which too has been
dismissed by the Board of 5 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P. No.26602/2018 &
2821, 534, 22, 15, 14, 12546, 8457 of 2019 Revenue by order dated 12/9/2018 passed in case
No.2288- PBR/2016.
8. Challenging the order passed by the Board of Revenue, it is submitted by the counsel for the
petitioner that the Collector should not have cancelled the Patta because his own authorities had
failed to produce the record and in case if the record is not available, then the petitioners cannot be
made to suffer. Furthermore, it is submitted that merely because some of the beneficiaries are
having some land, would not be material because still they were covered by the definition of landless
persons and it cannot be said that the Patta was granted to ineligible persons. It is further submitted
that once the petitioners have made the land fit for cultivation, then the unscrupulous persons
started making allegations and the Patta was granted in the year 2003, whereas the suo moto action
was taken by the Collector in the year 2011 and it is well established principle of law that the
authorities must take the action within a reasonable time and, therefore, the suo moto proceedings
initiated by the Collector was barred by time.
9. Per contra, it is submitted by the counsel for the respondents that the case was registered by the
Tahsildar and by order dated 7/7/2003, he issued advertisement for allotment of Beehad land to the
persons, whereas according to the statement made by the counsel for the petitioners themselves, the
Additional Collector had converted 6 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P.
No.26602/2018 & 2821, 534, 22, 15, 14, 12546, 8457 of 2019 the Charnoi land as Beehad Bhumi by
order dated 17/7/2003 and the list of Beehad Bhumi was presented by the Patwari on 26/7/2003.
Thus, it is clear that on 7/7/2003 there was no material before the Tahsildar for issuing
advertisement. Even on the said date, the land in question was recorded as Charnoi land and thus, it
is clear that the entire exercise was done with a premeditated motive and on 28/7/2003 itself the
Pattas were granted.
10. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
11. It appears that on 7/7/2003 the Tahsildar issued a public advertisement for grant of Patta and
fixed the case for 28/7/2003. Undisputedly, on 7/7/2003 the land in question was recorded as
Charnoi land and the Additional Collector by order dated 17/7/2003 declared the Charnoi land as
Beehad land and the Patwari submitted the list of Beehad land to the Tahsildar on 26/7/2003. The
case was taken up by Tahsildar on 28/7/2003 and on the very same day, Pattas were granted to 101
persons. Thus, it is clear that on the day when the proceedings for allotment of Patta were initiated,
no land was available, because Charnoi land cannot be allotted on Patta. It is really surprising that
how the Tahsildar was aware on 7/7/2003 that the Charnoi land will be declared as Beehad Bhumi
and even without any list of Beehad Bhumi before him, he issued public advertisement on 7/7/2003
for allotment of Patta and fixed the case for 28/7/2003. On 28/7/2003 itself the entire exercise was
done by the Tahsildar and 7 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P. No.26602/2018 &

12. In the present case, by order dated 7/7/2003 the Tahsildar fixed the case for 28/7/2003 and on
the very same day, Pattas were granted to 101 persons, which clearly indicates that the procedure
meant for allotment of Beehad land was never followed.
13. So far as the question of limitation is concerned, it is the case of the petitioners that in the month
of August, 2011, some unscrupulous persons had made a complaint to the Collector and the 9 THE
HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P. No.26602/2018 & 2821, 534, 22, 15, 14, 12546, 8457
of 2019 Collector in its turn had directed the SDO, Dabra to get an equiry done and accordingly, the
enquiry report was submitted by the Tahsildar, Dabra, District Gwalior. It is submitted that since
there is a delay in initiating the proceedings of suo moto revision, therefore, the order of the
Collector is bad.
14. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
15. It is not the case of the petitioner that immediately after the allotment of the Patta, any
complaint was made to the Collector or the Collector was aware of the illegal activities of the
Tahsildar. According to the petitioners themselves, in the month of August, 2011 a complaint was
made by some unscrupulous persons and accordingly, the power of suo moto revision was exercised
by the Collector in the month of December, 2011. Thus, it is clear that when the complaint was made
with regard to the illegal grant of Patta, then immediately the Collector directed the SDO, Dabra,
District Gwalior to hold a preliminary enquiry into the allegations and after receiving the enquiry
report dated 15/11/2011 from the Naib Tahsildar, Tahsil Dabra, District Gwalior, on 3/12/2011 a
recommendation was made by the SDO, Dabra to the Collector for taking up the matter on suo moto
revision. Accordingly, without any delay, the power of suo moto was exercised. Thus, it is clear that
the Collector has quickly responded to the complaint of illegal allotment of Patta and, therefore, it
cannot be said that there was any delay on the part of the 10 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH W.P. No.26602/2018 & 2821, 534, 22, 15, 14, 12546, 8457 of 2019 Collector.
16. It appears that the Charnoi land was declared as Beehad Bhumi and within few days, the Patta of
the said Charnoi land was granted. The Naib Tahsildar in its report dated 15/11/2011 has also held
that the depth of the Beehad Bhumi has also not been considered by the Tahsildar while granting
Patta. Therefore, it is clear that in fact Patta was granted of Charnoi land, which is not permissible.
17. Under these circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion that the Collector and Board
of Revenue did not commit any mistake by passing an order dated 17/5/2016 in case
No.01/12-13/suo moto revision and order dated 12/9/2018 in case No.2288-PBR/2016 respectively
and have rightly cancelled the Pattas, which were granted to the petitioners on 28/7/2003.
18. Accordingly, this petition fails and is hereby dismissed.
