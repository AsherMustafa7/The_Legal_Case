O.Mu.No.2280/Aa2/2019 dated 21.11.2019 to quash the same and
consequently directing the respondents to approve the appointments of
Thiru.A.Kalaimaran and Tmt.B.Sridevi in the sanctioned post of Secondary
Grade Teacher in the Petitioner School from the date of appointment on

For Petitioner : Mr.G.Sankarran
For Respondents : Mrs.V.Annalakshmi
Government Advocate
ORDER
This writ petition has been filed challenging the proceedings of the 2nd respondent dated 21.11.2019
and for a direction to the respondents to approve the appointments of two Secondary Grade
Teachers who are working in the Petitioner School from the year 2014 and 2017 respectively.
2.The case of the petitioner is that a vacancy arose in the post of Secondary Grade Teacher in the
year 2013 and one A.Kalaimaran was appointed in the said vacancy on 28.04.2014. The petitioner
School also forwarded the proposal seeking for approval of the appointment and it was
http://www.judis.nic.in pending. Likewise, one more vacancy arose in the year 2017 due to
retirement and in the said vacancy one Tmt.B.Sridevi was appointed as a Secondary Grade Teacher
on 13.07.2017. A proposal was sent seeking for approval of appointment and said proposal was also
kept pending. Several representations were made to the respondents to grant the approval for the
appointments. Ultimately, the petitioner approached this Court and filed writ petitions and
pursuant to the orders passed by this Court, the 2nd respondent considered the representations
made by the petitioner and has issued the impugned proceedings returning the proposal on the
ground that there are surplus teachers who have to be accommodated in the petitioner School.
Aggrieved by the same, the present writ petition has been filed.
3.Mr.G.Sankaran, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the
reasoning given by the 2nd respondent to reject the approval, is totally unsustainable since, the
orders passed by the Division Bench of this Court cannot be given retrospective effect for vacancies
which had arisen in the year 2014 and 2017. The learned counsel further submitted that the

Thiruvavaduthurai Adheenam Middle ... vs The Director Of Elementary Education on 8 January, 2020
Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.165, dated 17.09.2019 has already been suspended by this Court
and an Appeal is pending before the Madurai Bench of this Court. The learned counsel submitted
that the 2nd respondent ought to have independently considered http://www.judis.nic.in the
proposal and granted approval and the delay on the part of the 2 nd respondent in keeping the file
pending cannot be ultimately justified by the 2nd respondent relying upon order passed in the year
2019 and try to apply the same to the facts of the present case. The learned counsel submitted that
the proceedings of the 2nd respondent requires interference and a direction must be given to the
2nd respondent to grant approval for the appointment of the Secondary Grade Teachers.
4.Per contra, Mrs.V.Annalakshmi, learned Government Advocate appearing on behalf of the
respondents submitted that the approval sought for by the petitioner School cannot be granted,
since, this Court had directed that the vacancies will have to be first filled up only with surplus
teachers. The learned counsel brought to the notice of this Court, the order passed by the Division
Bench of this Court to that effect. Therefore, the learned counsel submitted that there is no ground
to interfere with the impugned proceedings of the 2nd respondent.
5.This Court has carefully considered the submissions made on either side and also the materials
available on record.

6.It is an admitted case that the vacancies arose in the year 2014 and 2017 and the petitioner School
has proceeded to fill up the vacancy of Secondary Grade Teacher and had sent proposal seeking for
approval of the appointment and it was kept pending by the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent
ought to have independently considered the approval sought for by the petitioner since, the post in
question is a sanctioned post and it is a sanctioned vacancy. The 2nd respondent ought not to have
relied upon the order passed by the Division Bench of this Court in the year 2019 and should not
have given a retrospective effect for a sanctioned vacancy which arose in the year 2014 and 2017
respectively. That apart, the 2nd respondent failed to take note of the fact that the operation of
G.O.Ms.No.165, dated 17.09.2019 has already been suspended by this Court and the very validity of
the said Government order is now under consideration in the writ appeal which is pending before
the Madurai Bench of this Court.
7.In the considered view of this Court, the 2nd respondent ought to have independently considered
the approval for appointment sought for by the petitioner School. The 2nd respondent cannot rely
upon the subsequent order passed by this Court in the year 2019 and deny the approval.
8.In view of the above discussion, this Court has no hesitation to http://www.judis.nic.in interfere
with the impugned proceedings of the 2nd respondent dated 21.11.2019 and accordingly, the same is
hereby quashed. The petitioner is directed to resubmit the proposal to the 2nd respondent seeking
for approval for the appointment of two Secondary Grade Teachers made in the year 2014 and 2017
respectively and the 2nd respondent, on receipt of the proposal, is directed to process the file and
grant approval, if the appointment has fulfilled all the other requirements. This process shall be
completed within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
