Smt Vijay Laxmi And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 8 April, 2025
placed on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court dated 16.9.2022 in Criminal Misc. Writ
Petition No.8510 of 2022 (Anuj Pandey v. State of U.P. & Ors.) wherein it is observed that the High
Court has ample power under its inherent jurisdiction to quash the first information report in which
the parties have settled their disputes which are of private in nature and have no any grave impact
on the society. The time of courts as well as investigating agencies are very precious which should
not be wasted in any futile proceedings where the chance of conviction is bleak.
12. Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra) has held in para-61 that;
"the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences Under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or
victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not
private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like
Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while
working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
and pre-dominatingly civil favour stand on different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary
to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

13. Since petitioner nos.1 & 2 have solemnized their marriage with their own sweet will, they are
living together and also having a child from the said wedlock, pending proceedings would serve no
purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in the light of the aforesaid judgments.
14. The writ petition as well as the Application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. are allowed and the entire
criminal proceedings of Sessions Case No.672 of 2024 (State v. Shashank) including chargesheet
dated 23.08.2024 as well as cognizance and summoning order dated 08.10.2024 passed by Special
Judge (Exclusive Court), POCSO Act/Additional Sessions Judge, Etah arising out of Case Crime
No.30 of 2024, under Sections 363, 366, 376 IPC and Section 5/6 Act, P.S. Rijor, District Etah
pending before Special Judge (Exclusive Court), POCSO Act/Additional Sessions Judge, Etah are
hereby quashed.
