Jabalpur, Dated : 16-01-2019
Mr.I.S.Yadav, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Mr.Subodh Kathar, learned Government Advocate for the
respondent/State.
Mr.Rakesh Dwivedi, learned counsel for the intervener. Vide order dated 06.12.2018, this Court had
requested the respondent no.2 to decide the statutory appeal filed by the petitioner against the order
dated 26.11.2018 passed by the respondent no.4, the Chief Executive Officer of Zila Panchayat Sidhi,
District-Sidhi, whereby the petitioner was removed from the post of Surpanch on the basis of an
inquiry conducted by the respondent no.4 allegedly in relation to embezzlement fund. The petitioner
moved an appeal before the respondent no.2 against the said order. He had also prayed for interim
relief in the form of stay of the impugned order passed by the respondent no.4 during the pendency
of the appeal. The respondent no.2 dismissed the said application for interim stay on the ground
that as the allegations pertain to financial irregularities, the balance of inconvenience was not in
favour of the petitioner.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed before this Court the order of a co-ordinate Bench of
this Court passed in the case of Amritlal Jaiswal Vs. State of M.P. and Others, 2008 (III) MPWN
108. In that case, in near identical circumstances, where two surpanches were removed from the
post on ground of financial irregularities by the Collector and their appeal was pending before the
Commissioner and stay was refused. This Court in paragraph-6 of that case had observed that the
petitioners who have been democratically elected to the post and their removal therefrom cannot be
treated lightly. This Court further held in that case "the holding of a democratic office by a citizen is
not only the very foundation of the 2 WP-28122-2018 democracy but is also a constitutional right. "
As the order dated 06.12.2018 had requested the respondent no.2 to complete the
appellate proceedings within a period of three weeks and had listed the case for
today. This Court has been informed that the said appeal has not yet been disposed of
andd, therefore, the petition is allowed and the impugned order passed by the
respondent no.4 removing the petitioner from the post of Surpanch of Gram
Panchayat Mata vide order dated 26.11.2018 is stayed till the final disposal of the
appellate proceedings pending before the respondent no.2.
With the above, the petition is finally disposed of. C.C as per rules.
