C.W.J.C. No.13561 of 2017, whereby prayer of the writ petitioners
for directing the respondents to appoint their sons on the post of
Choukidar/Dafadar by virtue of notification dated 05.03.2014 has
been rejected.
2. Briefly stated, the facts which gave rise to the
aforesaid writ application is that petitioner No.1 worked as a
Dafadar and superannuated on 06.11.2014. Prior to his
superannuation, the said petitioner made an application for being
placed under voluntary retirement with a request to appoint his son
in his place. Original Petitioner No.2-Bhuneshwar Paswan, also a
Choukidar, made a similar application in favour of his son and
sought voluntary retirement, but retired on 30.11.2014, which was
his actual date of retirement. Petitioner No.3 also a Choukidar
retired on 11.11.2014 and Petitioner No.4 retired on 30.11.2015
while posted as Choukidar. These petitioners, too, made similar
applications for grant of voluntary retirement and had made
requests for appointing their wards in their place. The date of
application and date of retirement of the respective petitioners are
mentioned herein below:

4. It appears from Clause 3(gha) of the said notification that the application for such request should
be made one month prior to the date of retirement and, admittedly, all the applicants have made
their applications. By letters issued on various dates, the petitioners were called upon and directed
to deposit all relevant documents, but though the petitioners deposited their documents, it is the
case of the petitioners that no action was taken thereon and Patna High Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018
dt.03-09-2019 on an oral request of the authority, the petitioners continued to discharge their
duties and ultimately, on different dates they have superannuated from service, but the respondents
wilfully avoided to issue any appointment letter in favour of their wards.
5. Having received no response from the respondents, the petitioners ultimately filed an application
under the Right to Information Act, whereupon they received Letter/Memo No.02- 0871 dated
01.07.2017 informing them that as they have completed their service, they have no right to take
benefit of Annexure 1.
6. Constrained by the inaction of the authority in not issuing the letters of appointment in favour of
their sons, the petitioners had approached this Court, vide CWJC No.13561 of 2017, seeking a
mandamus on the basis of Annexure 1. The said writ application was heard and dismissed vide order
dated 23.04.2018, holding that no relief can be granted to the petitioners. The relevant portion of
the said order is quoted hereunder:
"According to the resolution of the State Government dated 05.03.2014, Annexure-1
to the petition, those Chaukidars who have attained the age of 55 years or more and
have completed 20 years of service, would be entitled for applying for voluntary
retirement and in case they are granted voluntary retirement, they would be entitled
to nominate one of their dependants for the purposes of appointment.
In the present case, admittedly the petitioners herein have superannuated from their
services upon attaining the age of retirement and they have neither taken Patna High
Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018 dt.03-09-2019 nor have been granted voluntary
retirement, hence there is no provision in the aforesaid scheme for appointment of
the sons of the petitioners herein in place of the petitioners.
In view of the aforesaid, no relief can be granted to the petitioners herein, hence the
writ petition is dismissed."
Hence the present appeal.
7. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the learned single Judge had clearly erred in
coming to the conclusion that the petitioners have neither taken nor have been granted voluntary
retirement. It was urged that the petitioners had made their applications well in time, seeking
voluntary retirement and it was the authority who ought to have taken necessary steps to either
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23054949/ 5
Hira Lal Srivastava And Ors vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 3 September, 2019
accept or reject the said applications before the date of retirement. However, the issue was delayed
at their own end and, therefore, they could not deprive the petitioners the benefit of Annexure 1. It
was further urged that the learned single Judge had presumed that they had voluntarily continued
to work and therefore their wards could not be granted any appointment letters. It is therefore also
urged that the respondents may be further directed to take appropriate steps in pursuance of
Annexure 1, as they are poor people and they have applied for appointment in the light of the
Circular (Annexure 1).
Patna High Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018 dt.03-09-2019
8. Learned counsel for the appellants has also drawn the attention of the Court to the judgment on
the same issue, bearing CWJC No.189 of 2017 and CWJC No.1142 of 2017, decided on 05th July,
2017 and also to an order dated 19th June, 2019 in MJC No.1713 of 2018, in which notices have been
issued upon the State as to why proceedings for contempt be not drawn up. It is thus submitted that
the Court may also call upon the State to answer the contention of the appellants.
9. This Court, while hearing the appeal on the contention that in similar circumstances Jharu Mahto
was granted relief, called upon the State-respondents to address itself to the decision of this Court
rendered on the issue.
10. A counter affidavit has been filed in this Appeal, in which it has been contended that pursuant to
the applications made by the respective petitioners in pursuance of Annexure 1 for appointment of
the wards of Choukidar/Dafadar who were completing 20 years of their service and their age was
not less than 55 years and who wanted to take voluntary retirement within a minimum period of one
month from the date of retirement, the authorities issued letters to the respective petitioners for
depositing their relevant documents.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018 dt.03-09-2019
11. The contention of respondent No.3 in his appeal further was that admittedly, the petitioners
continued to work and superannuated from the service upon attaining the age of retirement. It was
pointed out that petitioner No.1 Hira Lal Srivastava worked till the date of his retirement i.e.
06.11.2014 and for the entire period, he has received full payment of salary up to 30.11.2014. Thus,
his claim under the notification dated 05.03.2014 is not tenable. Moreover, the application so made
was also rejected by the competent authority on 12.06.2017, vide Memo No.02-0785/Sa. Buxar
(Annexure A to the counter affidavit) in the following terms :

12. Similarly, Bhuneshwar Paswan (appellant no.2) whose date of retirement was 30.11.2014 also
worked and received the full payment of salary up to 30.11.2014 and as such, his application for
appointment was also rejected by the competent authority and he was informed vide letter dated
12.06.2017. Similarly, Suchit Yadav, who was Choukidar in Buxar P.S., District-Buxar continued to
work till his date of retirement i.e. 11.11.2014 and he received full payment of salary up to 30.11.2014
and therefore his application was also rejected by a similar order dated 12.06.2017. A similar order
was also passed in the case of Appellant No.4.
13. Learned counsel for the appellants further contended that since the appellants did not inform
the intended date of retirement from service in their respective applications, the same was rejected
as being technically incorrect. Over and above, the respective appellants had continued to discharge
their duties as Dafadar/Choukidar in their respective places of postings till the Patna High Court
L.P.A No.785 of 2018 dt.03-09-2019 date of their retirement and had also drawn the full salary up
to the date of superannuation.
14. During the course of hearing of this application, learned counsel for the State also contended
that the case of those applicants who are sought to be considered to be similar to that of the
petitioners is, in fact, is at much variance for the reason that their applications had been rejected,
inter alia, on the ground that the date of voluntary retirement was not mentioned in their
applications and it had not been filed within a month before the expressed date of voluntary
retirement.
15. However, in the present case, it is contended by the appellants that the applicants' applications
were not rejected on account of the fact that they though they had not expressed their date of
voluntary retirement, but because they had continued to serve and draw their salary up to the date
of retirement and therefore the ratio of the decision as has been pointed out by the appellants could
not benefit them in any manner.
16. Shri P.K. Verma, learned Additional Advocate General No.3 has also drawn the attention of the
Court to a clarificatory letter issued by the Under Secretary, Department of Home (Police) dated
22nd June, 2018, wherein the State Government after considering the queries has given the
following Patna High Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018 dt.03-09-2019 clarifications at para (2) with
regard to the amended provisions of 2014. In the said clarification, the State Government has issued
directions in the following manner :

17. It was thus submitted that in view of the clarification in para 4(3), the appellants are not eligible
for availing the benefits of Annexure 1. It was thus contended that the appellants had no case and
the learned single Judge has rightly dismissed the application of the appellants.
18. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants and the learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the State and perused the materials on record.
19. The short point for consideration is as to whether the appellants-writ petitioners having made
their applications for voluntary retirement with a request for appointing their respective wards
ought to have been allowed by the respondents in the light of the then extant circular.
20. We have considered and find that admittedly their applications were well within time of the date
of superannuation, Patna High Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018 dt.03-09-2019 but for some reason or
the other, their applications could not be processed at the level of the District Magistrate who was
the authority under the Rules and accordingly, since no instructions were forwarded to the
concerned employees, they did not abandon their services and continued to function till the date of
their superannuation.
21. We further observe that the appellants had also forwarded the testimonials of their respective
wards on being called upon to do so and the respondents have not denied the same. Nevertheless,
their applications were not considered within their date of superannuation and therefore they
continued to function on their respective posts and had also drawn salary. The order of rejection was
also issued much after the date of superannuation, i.e., in the year 2017 and they could not be
faulted for any delay on their part. However, we find that their case does stand distinguished from
the case of the petitioners of CWJC No.189 of 2017 and CWJC No.1142 of 2017, wherein their cases
were rejected well within the date of their superannuation and not after as was the case of the

petitioners, who continued to work and draw their salary. Therefore, these appellants cannot draw a
parallel to the writ petitioners of the aforementioned cases. No doubt, the respondents took a long
time to determine the cases of the Patna High Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018 dt.03-09-2019
appellants, but the petitioners having worked and drawn salary without any demur on their part,
their applications were rendered infructuous with flux of time. Their cases could be appreciated had
they stopped working or had not received their salary up to the date of retirement.
22. However, noticing the clarificatory letter of 2018, we find that the respondents have delved into
the issue of those persons who continued to work and drew salary. We find at Clause 4(3) that when
any employee continues to work up to the date of retirement and also draws his salary, then such
application itself has become infructuous as the Finance Department had given a categorical note
against the grant of such facility of voluntary retirement to such employee.
23. In view of the aforementioned provisions in the clarificatory letter, we find and hold that the
respondents cannot be directed at this stage to re-consider the applications of the appellants for
grant of such benefit of employment of their wards in accordance with the provisions of Annexure 1.
24. In view of the aforementioned observations and considerations made by us in the light of the
stand taken by the respondents vis-a-vis each of the cases of the petitioners, we do not find any
reason to interfere with the order of the learned single Patna High Court L.P.A No.785 of 2018
dt.03-09-2019 Judge. The appeal is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.
