Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO
QUASH ANNEX-A THE IMPUGNED FINAL NOTICE DATED
23.04.2014 ISSUED BY THE R-3 IN FINAL NOTICE AND FINAL
SCRUTINY NOTE ISSUED BY THE R-4 MADE IN COMPLAINANT
NO.163/2008 DATED 23.08.2013.
THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING IN 'B' GROUP, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
The petitioners in this writ petition are assailing the Final notice dated 23/04/2014 bearing
No.Bangalore/LAQ/145/2014-15 vide Annexure - A issued by the 3rd respondent, whereby the 3rd
respondent-Special Land Acquisition Officer-2-KIADB directed the petitioners to deposit the entire
amount received by them with interest at the rate of 15% per annum with the Karnataka Industrial
Area Development Board ("KIADB") and final scrutiny note issued by the 4th
respondent/Lokayukta dated 23/08/2013 made in Complaint No.Lok.BCD.163/2008 vide
Annexure - J, whereby the 4th respondent-Lokayukta has issued a direction to the 3rd
respondent-KIADB to recover the compensation amount received by the petitioners and to disburse
the same to the plaintiffs in O.S.No.247/2001.
2. The proceedings arise on the basis of the complaint dated 19/04/2008 filed by respondents 5 to 9
to the Lokayukta. The case of the petitioners is that the petitioners are the owners of the land
bearing Sy.Nos.128/2B and 10/2, measuring 1 acre 31 guntas and 1 acre 11 guntas respectively
(hereinafter referred to as 'the petition property'). According to the petitioners, there was a family
partition entered into between the petitioners and respondents 5 to 9 and as per the partition
entered, the petition properties have fallen to the share of the petitioners. It is further stated that
respondents 5 to 9 filed O.S.No.247/2001 against the petitioners herein for partition and separate
possession seeking 1/5th share in the suit schedule properties and the suit came to be decreed.
Subsequently, challenging the judgment and decree dated 25/11/2009 in O.S.No.247/2001
(Annexure - D), the petitioners filed R.A.No.2/2010 before the IV Addl. District and Sessions Judge,
Doddaballapur and Appellate Court, by its order dated 10/03/2015 modified the judgment and
decree of the trial Court awarding 1/7th share in the suit schedule properties. Aggrieved by the
judgment and decree dated 10/03/2015 in R.A.No.02/2010, RSA.No.849/2015 has been preferred
before this Court pending consideration the further proceedings in FDP has been stayed.
3. It is stated that the complaint was lodged by respondents 5 to 9 against the officials of the KIADB
stating that the officers have disbursed the compensation amount in favour of the petitioners
without looking into the civil dispute which was pending consideration between the parties before
the Civil Court. It appears that the complaint was entertained by the 4th respondent-Lokayukta and
the Lokayukta held enquiry and passed a final scrutiny note on the Complaint
No.Lok.BCD.163/2008 vide Annexure - J directing the Land Acquisition Officer, KIADB to recover
the compensation amount received by the petitioners herein to the extent of the share of the
plaintiffs and to disburse the said amount in favour of the plaintiffs therein in the suit.

Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
4. It is the grievance of the petitioners that on the basis of the directions/final scrutiny note at
Annexure-J issued by the 4th respondent-Lokayukta, the Land Acquisition Officer-2-KIADB has
issued a final notice at Annexure-A directing the petitioners to redeposit the compensation amount
received with 15% interest per annum. According to the petitioners, the final scrutiny notice issued
by the 4th respondent- Lokayukta is one without jurisdiction and as such, the final notice issued by
the KIADB on the basis of the scrutiny note of the Lokayukta is arbitrary and contrary to law.
5. Per contra, 3rd respondent-the Special Land Acquisition Officer-2-KIADB has filed its statement
of objections and has stated that the said respondent had acquired the petition property by issuing
final notification dated 01/03/2006 and finding the name of the petitioners in the revenue records,
notice was issued under Section 28 (2), (6) and 29 (2) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas
Development Act, 1966. It is further stated that they were not aware about the interim order or
about the civil dispute between the petitioners and 5th to 9th respondent and consequently, the
compensation amount was reimbursed to the petitioners whose name was found in the revenue
records. It is further stated that consequent to the directions issued by the Lokayukta and taking
into consideration the order passed in Civil Proceedings, the said respondent has issued final notice
to the petitioners to refund the compensation amount with interest. It is stated that the release of
compensation amount in favour of the petitioners is due to the suppression of the pendency of O.S.
No.247/2001 and would further state that the Lokayukta, after hearing the complainant has issued
direction to the Land Acquisition Officer-2-KIADB to recover the compensation amount received by
the petitioners herein to the extent of the share of the plaintiff as per the judgment and decree made
in O.S.No.247/2001 and to disburse the same to the plaintiffs. According to 3rd respondent, the
direction issued by the Lokayukta is justifiable and accordingly, action has been taken. The
respondent would contend that the action on the part of 3rd respondent is in accordance with law
and sought to dismiss the writ petition.
6. The 4th respondent-Lokayukta has filed statement of objections denying the petition averments
and would justify the order passed at Annexure-J as being in accordance with law. Other than
denying the writ petition averments, no specific averments are made in their statement of objections
about the power empowered upon the Lokayukta to pass an order of direction to recover the
compensation amount. Accordingly, sought to dismiss the writ petition.
7. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners Sri Udhaya Kumar G.; learned High Court Government
Pleader Sri K.S.Arun for 1st respondent; learned counsel Ms. Nayanashree for Sri Ashok N. Nayak,
learned counsel for 2nd and 3rd respondents; Sri K.N.Puttegowda, learned counsel for 4th
respondent and Sri S.D. Manjunath, learned counsel for Sri M.S. Narayan learned counsel for
respondents 5 to 9 and perused the material on record.
8. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners while assailing the final notice at Annexure-A
issued by the 3rd respondent would contend that the final notice issued is based on Annexure-J the
final scrutiny note
- 10 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35443891/ 4
Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
issued by the 4th respondent-Lokayukta, who under the Act had no jurisdiction under the guise of
holding an enquiry against the public servants. According to the learned counsel the 4th
respondent-Lokayukta has over stepped in its jurisdiction and has issued a final scrutiny note
directing the 3rd respondent to recover the compensation amount from the petitioners in which the
petitioners are not parties too. According to the learned counsel when the Lokayukta had no
jurisdiction to issue such a direction in deciding the rights of the petitioners the final notice issued
by the 3rd respondent would not be sustainable and would contend that the final scrutiny note at
Annexure-J is one without jurisdiction and the final notice issued by the 3rd respondent is liable to
be quashed.
9. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the 3rd respondent-KIADB would contend that the final
notice issued is in consequent to the directions issued by the Lokayukta who inturn had taken into
consideration
- 11 -
the civil dispute between the parties and on holding enquiry had directed the 3rd respondent to
recover the amount from the petitioners. According to the learned counsel the Lokayukta has rightly
passed an order as the petitioners had suppressed the pendency of O.S. No.247/2001. Stating these
grounds, the learned counsel would contend that the petition needs to be dismissed as devoid of
merits.
10. Sri. Puttegowda K.N, learned counsel appearing for the 4th respondent-Lokayukta would
contend that the order passed by the Lokayukta is justifiable, which is based on the complaint
lodged by the respondents 5 to 9 and on an enquiry, it has been held that the officials of the KIADB
have colluded with the petitioners in releasing the compensation amount to the petitioners which
they are not exclusively entitled to. Stating these grounds, the learned counsel would contend that
the petition needs to be dismissed as devoid of merits.
- 12 -
11. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, the following points arise for consideration:
"i. Whether the Lokayukta under the Act has jurisdiction to direct the Special Land
Acquisition Officer-2-KIADB to recover the compensation amount and hold enquiry
in respect of dispute which is of a civil nature?
ii. Whether the 3rd respondent/Special Land Acquisition Officer-2-KIADB could
have issued a final notice at Annexure-A based on the directions issued by the 4th
respondent/Lokayukta?"
Point No.I
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35443891/ 5
Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
12. The administrative reforms committee had recommended the setting up of institution of
Lokayukta for the purpose of improving the standards of public administration, by looking into
complaints against the administrative actions, including the cases of corruptions, favoritism and
official indiscipline in administration machinery. It is for this reason and for making enquiries in the
aforesaid matters, the
- 13 -
Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984 ('the Act' for short) came to be enacted by the State Legislature.
13. The Lokayukta may investigate a complaint involving "allegations as mentioned in Section 2(2)"
and "grievance as mentioned in Section 2 (8)" of the Act in respect of any action which is taken by or
with the general or special approval of the public servant enumerated in sub-section (1) of Section 7.
14. The Act defines the words "action", "allegation" and "grievance" under Sections 2(1), 2(2) and
2(8), respectively, which read as under:
"2. Definitions.-In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires.-
(1) "Action" means administrative action taken by way of decision, recommendation
or finding or in any other manner and includes wilful failure or omission to act and
all other expressions relating to such action shall be construed accordingly.
- 14 -
(2) "Allegation" in relation to a public servant means any affirmation that such public servant-
a. has abused his position as such public servant to obtain any gain or favour to himself or to any
other person or to cause undue harm or hardship to any other person;
b. was actuated in the discharge of his
functions as such public servant by
personal interest or improper or
corrupt motives;
c. is guilty of corruption, favouritism,
nepotism, or lack of integrity in his capacity as such public servant;
OR d. has failed to act in accordance with the norms of integrity and conduct which ought to be
followed by public servants of the class to which he belongs."
x x x (8) "grievance" means a claim by a person that he sustained injustice or undue hardship in
consequence of maladministration;"
- 15 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35443891/ 6
Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
15. Therefore, under the scheme of the Act, the Lokayukta has been conferred with the power to
investigate into a complaint involving an allegation or a grievance against the public servant where a
public servant has abused his position to obtain any gain or favour to himself or to any other person
or to cause undue harm or hardship to any other person or he was actuated in discharge of his
function as such, public servant by personal interest or improper or corrupt motive or is guilty of
corruption, favoritism, nepotism or lack of integrity in his capacity as such public servant or has
failed to act in accordance with the norms of integrity or conduct which ought to be followed by the
public servants of the clause to which he belongs. The jurisdiction of the Lokayukta and the
Upalokayukta has contained in Section 7 of the Act and Section 7 of the Act deals as under:
"7. Matters which may be investigated by the Lokayukta and an Upalokayukta.-(1)
Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Lokayukta may investigate any
- 16 -
action which is taken by or with the general or special approval of.-
(a) (i) the Chief Minister;
(ii) a Minister;
(iii) a member of the State Legislature;
(iv) the Chairman and Vice-Chairman (by whatever name called) or a member of an
authority, board or a committee, a statutory or non-statutory body or a corporation
established by or under any law of the State Legislature including a society,
co-operative society or a Government company within the meaning of section 617 of
the Companies Act, 1956, nominated by the State Government;
in any case where a complaint involving a grievance or an allegation is made in respect of such
action.
(b) any other public servant holding a post or office carrying either a fixed pay, salary or
remuneration of more than rupees twenty thousand per month or a pay scale the minimum of which
is more than rupees twenty thousand, as may be revised from time to time in any case where a
complaint involving a grievance or an allegation is
- 17 -
made in respect of such action or such action can be or could have been, in the opinion of the
Lokayukta, recorded in writing, the subject of a grievance or an allegation.
(2) Subject to the provisions of the Act, an Upa-lokayukta may investigate any action which is taken
by or with the general or specific approval of, any public servant not being the Chief Minister,
Minister, Member of the Legislature, Secretary or other public servant refereed to in sub-section (1),
in any case where a complaint involving a grievance or an allegation is made in respect of such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35443891/ 7
Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
action or such action can be or could have been, in the opinion of the Upa-lokayukta, recorded in
writing. the subject of a grievance or an allegation.
(2-A) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-sections (1) and (2), the Lokayukta or an
Upa-lokayukta may investigate any action taken by or with the general or specific approval of a
public servant, if it is referred to him by the State Government.
(3) Where two or more Upa-lokayuktas are appointed under this Act, the Lokayukta may, by general
or special order, assign to each of
- 18 -
them matters which may be investigated by them under this Act.
Provided that no investigation made by an Upa-lokayukta under this Act, and no action taken or
things done by him in respect of such investigation shall be open to question on the ground only that
such investigation relates to a matter which is not assigned to him by such order.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-sections (1) to (3), when the office of a
Upa-lokayukta is vacant by reason of his death, resignation, retirement, removal or otherwise or
when an Upa-lokayukta is unable to discharge his functions owing to absence, illness or any other
cause, his function may be discharged by the other Upa-lokayukta, if any, and if there is no other
Upa-lokayukta by the Lokayukta."
16. The grievance or the allegation should be in respect of an action against a public servant as
defined under the Act and the jurisdiction of the Lokayukta and the Upalokayukta do not extend
beyond what is specifically contained in Section 7 of the Act. The
- 19 -
Lokayukta and the Upalokayukta have no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint against the person
other than the public servant as defined under the Act nor has been conferred any power to
investigate a grievance or an allegation against a private individual. The Lokayukta and
Upalokayukta have also not been conferred with the power to investigate into the title of the
property which are the matters exclusively falling within the jurisdiction of Civil Courts and the
Lokayukta cannot take over the power of the Civil Court under the guise of investigation under the
Act. The investigation to be conducted is only with reference to the action of the public servant, the
abuse of such office, allegation of corruption, nepotism, lack of integrity on the part of the public
servant and any illegal gains made by the public servant and action to be taken only against the
public servants.
17. Section 12 of the Act provides for submission of report after investigation by the Lokayukta,
which reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35443891/ 8
Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
- 20 -
"12. Reports of Lokayukta, etc.-If, after investigation of any action [x x x x x]
involving a grievance has been made, the Lokayukta or an Upa-lokayukta is satisfied
that such action has resulted in injustice or undue hardship to the complainant or to
any other person, the Lokayukta or an Upa-lokayukta shall, by a report in writing,
recommend to the competent Authority concerned that such injustice or hardship
shall be remedied or redressed in such manner and within such time as may be
specified in the report.
(2) The competent authority to whom a report is sent under sub-section (1) shall,
within one month of the expiry of the period specified in the report, intimate or cause
to be intimated to the Lokayukta or the Upa-
lokayukta the action taken on the report.
(3) If, after investigation of any action [x x x x x] involving an allegation has been made, the
Lokayukta or an Upa-lokayukta is satisfied that such allegation is substantiated either wholly or
partly, he shall by report in writing communicate his findings and recommendations along with the
relevant
- 21 -
documents, materials and other evidence to the competent authority.
(4) The Competent authority shall examine the report forwarded to it under sub- section (3) and
within three months of the date of receipt of the report, intimate or cause to be intimated to the
Lokayukta or the Upa- lokayukta the action taken or proposed to be taken on the basis of the report.
(5) If the Lokayukta or the Upa-
lokayukta is satisfied with the action taken or proposed to be taken on his recommendations or
findings referred to in sub-sections (1) and (3), he shall close the case under information to the
complainant, the public servant and the competent Authority concerned; but where he is not so
satisfied and if he considers that the case so deserves, he may make a special report upon the case to
the Governor and also inform the Competent Authority concerned and the Complainant.
(6) The Lokayukta shall present on or before 31st October of every year, a consolidated report on the
performance of his
- 22 -
functions and that of the Upa-lokayukta under this Act to the Governor.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35443891/ 9
Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
(7) On receipt of the special report under sub-section (5), or the annual report under sub-section (6),
the Governor shall cause a copy thereof together with an explanatory memorandum to be laid before
each House of the State Legislature.
(8) The Lokayukta or an Upa-lokayukta may at his discretion make available, from time to time, the
substances of cases closed or otherwise disposed of by him which may appear to him to be of
general, public, academic or professional interest in such manner and to such persons as he may
deem appropriate."
18. Sub-Section (1) of Section 12 deals with an investigation of any action involving a grievance and
if the Lokayukta is satisfied that such action has resulted in injustice or undue hardship to the
complainant or to any other person, the Lokayukta or Upalokayukta shall by report in writing,
recommend to the competent authority concerned that such injustice or hardship shall
- 23 -
be remedied or redressed in such manner and within such time as may be specified in the report.
19. Sub-Section (3) of Section 12 contemplates that after investigation of any action involving
allegations the Lokayukta or an Upalokayukta is satisfied that such allegation either wholly or partly
is substantiated, he shall by report in writing communicate his findings and recommendations along
with the relevant documents, materials and other evidence to the competent authority. Thus, a
condition precedent for submitting the said report is only when the allegation is substantiated and
not otherwise. Looking into the object behind the legislation and in view of the clear definitions
contained in the Act regarding action, allegations and grievance and the persons against whom the
Lokayukta and the Upalokayukta has jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of both of them is clearly defined.
Strictly speaking their jurisdictions extend to investigate any action taken by the public servant as
defined under
- 24 -
the Act and not otherwise. The Lokayukta or the Upalokayukta has no jurisdiction to go into the title
of the property, the nature of the property standing in the name of private individual.
20. The relevant portion of the complaint at Annexure-H dated 19/04/2008 reads as under:

21. It is in this background that the complaint filed, the investigation conducted by the Lokayukta,
the final scrutiny note submitted by the Lokayukta and the final notice issued by the 3rd respondent
needs to be considered.
22. The complaint is very clear wherein it is mentioned that the public servants have disbursed the
compensation amount in favour of the petitioners in spite of the objections raised by the
complainant and alleges that the public servants abusing their position and to obtain gain had
released the compensation amount. However, if the Lokayukta chooses to investigate the complaint
the said investigation could be only regarding the grievance or allegation as defined under the Act.
The grievance and the allegations though are made against the public servants the Lokayukta in the
course of investigations and while issuing a direction to the Special Land Acquisition
Officer-2-KIADB to recover the compensation amount ought to have taken
- 26 -
into consideration that the petitioners are not parties to the complaint. The Lokayukta knowing fully
well while dealing with the property which stands in the names of the petitioners ought to have
heard the petitioners and thus, the directions issued against the petitioners, who is not a public
servant, the Lokayukta had no jurisdiction to investigate and declare the civil rights of the parties.
Thus, the first direction issued by the Lokayukta at Annexure-J is one without jurisdiction and the
same is liable to be quashed and point No.i is answered accordingly.
Point No.ii
23. It is undisputed that O.S.No.247/2001 was filed by the respondents 5 to 9 seeking partition and
separate possession in respect of suit property which is the petition property herein. Accordingly,
plaintiffs and defendants were granted 1/5th share. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and
decree, the petitioners preferred R.A.No.2/2010, wherein Appellate Court

Mr Ashwath Narayanareddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 December, 2022
modified the judgment and decree of the Trial Court and held that the respondents 5 to 9/plaintiffs
are entitled for 1/7th share in the suit schedule properties. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioners
have preferred RSA No.849/2015 stating that it is exclusive property of the petitioners and the same
is pending consideration and an interim order has been passed directing that the final decree
proceedings shall not be proceeded. It is also not in dispute that the respondents had filed complaint
before the Lokayukta against the KIADB officials. Accordingly, after an enquiry the following
directions were issued by the Lokayukta:
"i) The Special Land Acquisition officer, International Air-port, KIADB, No.3, Kheni
Building, 1st cross, Gandhinagar, Bangalore may be directed to recover the
compensation amount received by the said Nanjundareddy, Rajagopala Reddy and
Ashwathanarayana Reddy to the extent of share of plaintiffs in O.S.247/2001 and to
disburse the same to the plaintiffs.

ii) Further, the Dy.Commissioner,
Doddaballapur and the Land Acquisition
Officer, KIADB, Bangalore, Respondent No.1, are directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings
against the officials responsible for not placing the objections filed by the complainant referring to
O.S.247/2001 in the concerned file, that leading to the paying entire compensation to only 3
sharers."
24. Learned counsel for the 3rd respondent- Special Land Acquisition Officer-2-KIADB would
contend that the action taken by the 3rd respondent is in pursuance of the final scrutiny note by the
Lokayukta. The complaint lodged would clearly depicts that it is an allegations against the public
servant and seeking directions of the Lokayukta to take action against the public servant. However,
the proceedings initiated by the Lokayukta is beyond the jurisdiction as stated while answering
point No.i and the final notice being initiated in pursuance to the final scrutiny note issued by the
Lokayukta the proceedings initiated by the 3rd respondent cannot be sustainable and is also liable to
be

and point No.ii is answered accordingly.
25. For the reasons stated supra, this Court pass the following:
