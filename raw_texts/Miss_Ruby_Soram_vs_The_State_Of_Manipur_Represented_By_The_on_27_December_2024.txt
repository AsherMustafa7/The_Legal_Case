JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
[1] Heard Mr. K. Roshan, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.
Th. Sukumar, learned G.A. for the State respondent and Mr. S. Suresh, learned counsel for
respondent No. 2. None appeared on behalf of the respondent No.6 at the time of hearing after filing
of counter affidavit. [2] The brief fact of the case is that the petitioner is the daughter of Shri Soram
Ranjit Singh and Soram Ongbi Surnalata Devi both resident of Uripok Sorbon Thingel, Imphal West
District. The petitioner's adopted mother, namely, late Soram Indubala Devi, the elder sister of Shri
Soram Ranjit Singh was unmarried and she died as a spinster. Further, Soram Indubala Devi was
physically handicap, suffering from "SLE affecting her whole body with Bil-THL" affecting mobility
and stability. During the lifetime of late Smt. Soram Indubala Devi, she worked as Technical
Assistant, in the Directorate of Employment, Lamphelpat, Imphal and she had never entered into
wedlock with anybody and as such, being handicap and having no one to look after her, she adopted
the present petitioner by performing adoption ceremony according to the Hindu Meitei customary
rites and rituals on 03.03.2007 in the presence of Sagei (Clan) elderly members and relatives
validating adoption. Since the adoption of the petitioner was not disputed, late Soram Indubala
Devi, in compliance of the requirements of law, registered the adoption in the year 2012 vide Deed
of Adoption dated 12.09.2012 in the office of the Sub-Registrar (HQ), Imphal, Manipur. The
petitioner has become the daughter of late Soram Indubala Devi for all intent WP(C) No. 315 of 2016
Page 2 and purposes by the execution of the adoption on 03.03.2007 and the Deed of adoption
dated 12.09.2012 and the adoption of the petitioner has been intimated to the authorities concerned
by submitting Form No. 3 as per the requirements of Rule 54 (12) (ii) of the Central Civil Services
(Pension) Rules, 1972.
[3] Due to physical conditions, the petitioner's mother i.e. Soram Indubala Devi sought voluntary
retirement and the Department concerned consented to her request for voluntary retirement and
she was allowed to retired voluntarily vide order dated 28.09.2012 with effect from 30.09.2012.
Vide letter dated 02.02.2013, the petitioner's adoptive mother submitted her pension papers to the
authorities concerned alongwith the required documents including Form No. 3 intimating the
authorities the petitioner as her daughter and on the basis of the submission of the pension papers,
process of pension was intimated. The petitioner's name was shown in Form No. 3 submitted for the
purpose of the pension as daughter. During the process, Ms. S. Indubala died unfortunately on
06.02.2013 and the Registrar Birth & Death, Imphal Municipal Council issued Death Certificate
dated 18.02.2013 to that effect and after the expiry of the petitioner's mother, she approached the
respondents for payment of the family pension of her late mother's service. However, the petitioner
came to know of a Letter dated 23.05.2013 communicated by the Accountants Officer to the Addl.
Director, Directorate of Employment Exchange, Lamphel, Imphal demanding for certain documents
to be furnished.

Miss Ruby Soram vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
23.05.2013, another letter dated 21.10.2013 was communicated to the Additional Director of
Employment, the Head of Office requesting inter-alia for taking actions to authorise
pension/gratuity. However, till date no actions have been taken for paying the pension of late Soram
Indubala to the petitioner. As such, the petitioner approached this Court by way of the present writ
petition.
[5] Respondent Nos. 1, 3 & 5 have filed counter affidavit stating that as per the letter of the Sr.
Accounts Officer (Pension) Office of the Accountant General (A & E), Manipur, it is intimated that
adoption took place on 03.03.2007 and if the present petitioner deemed to be the child of Ms.
Soram Indubala Devi for all purpose with effect from the date of adoption, the name of the her
adoptive mother in HSLC certificate should be Soram Indubala Devi (adoptive mother). However,
there was no name of the adoptive mother in the HSLC certificate except those of real parents name
i.e. Shri S. Ranjit Singh and S (O) Surnalata Devi. It is also stated that there is no official record
prior to 11.12.2012 which is the date of preparation of pension papers stating Ms. Ruby Soram was
adopted by (Late) Ms. Soram Indubala Devi, Ex-Technical Assistant in the Directorate and as such,
there is no question of payment of family pension to the petitioner. It is further stated that Form No.
3 was submitted at the time of pension preparation. However, controversy arose only when another
claimant Smt. AK. (O) Lairenmayum Roma Devi came to know that she is the only daughter of late
Ms. Indubala Devi. It is also stated that the HSLC certificate of the petitioner WP(C) No. 315 of 2016
Page 4 was issued in the year 2012, the adoptive mother's name was not there in spite of adoption
ceremony performed on 03.03.2007 and as such, the adoption was not effective till the issue of
HSLC certificate. [6] Respondent No. 6 also filed counter affidavit wherein it is stated that the two
certificates dated 21.02.2008 and 12.06.2013 annexed at Annexures - A/1 & A/2 in the writ petition
have all been fabricated and Annexure - A/2 regarding unmarried status of late Soram Indubala
Devi is unacceptable and not authentic for want of authority on the part of the SDC to issue any such
certificate. It is stated that respondent No. 6 i.e. Roma Devi is the only natural daughter of L.
Surendro Singh and (late) Soram Indubala Devi. It is stated that as on the date of execution and
registration of the deed of adoption dated 14.09.2012, the age of the petitioner i.e. Ruby Soram was
16 years and 8 months as the date of her birth recorded in the said HSLC Examination, 2012 i.e.
10.01.1996. Under Section 10(iv) of the said Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, the age of
the adoptee child (present petitioner) should have been below 15 years.
[7] Respondent No. 2 filed counter affidavit stating on 11.02.2013, the office of the Accountant
General (the respondent No. 2) received pension papers and application for commutation of S.
Indubala Devi together with a copy of Adoption Deed and other related documents furnished by the
Department of Personnel (Pension Cell), Government of Manipur vide letter dated 07.02.2013 and
on scrutiny of pension papers and Service Book, the name of the present petitioner (Ruby Soram)
was found recorded in Form-3 (List of family members) as adopted daughter, supported by
Adoption Deed WP(C) No. 315 of 2016 Page 5 dated 12.09.2012. However, one A.K. (O) Roma Devi
submitted an application to the Additional Director of Employment, Government of Manipur
requesting not to give any financial benefit to any other person without her knowledge by stating
therein that she is the only daughter of (late) Soram Indubala Devi. Vide letter dated 23.05.2013, the
respondent No. 2 requested the Additional Director, Directorate of Employment to furnish certain
documents/clarification so as to enable the office of the respondent No.2 to finalise the matter and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88040585/ 3
Miss Ruby Soram vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
in response thereof, the Additional Director of Employment, Government of Manipur, vide letter
dated 31.08.2013 furnished the documents sought for including an affidavit duly signed by one Shri
L. Surendro Singh declaring that S. Indubala Devi was his wife and in the said affidavit, Shri L.
Surendro Singh also stated that A.K (O) Roma Devi was the daughter of S. Indubala Devi. Vide letter
dated 21.10.2013, respondent No. 2 sought for further clarification from the Additional Director,
Directorate of Employment however no convincing reply is received till date. [8] Mr. K. Roshan,
learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there is a presumption of validity for registered
adoption deed under Section 16 of HAMA, unless it is disproved in a legal proceeding before a
competent court. It is pointed out that mere failure to record the name of the adoptive parents in the
school certificate will not automatically invalidate a duly registered adoption deed. Learned counsel
draws the attention of this Court to a suit for declaration filed by the respondent No.6 herein before
the Family Court, Manipur being Mat.(Decl.) Suit No. 16 of 2017, inter-alia, praying for declaring
her as the biological daughter of late S. Indubala Devi and for WP(C) No. 315 of 2016 Page 6
cancellation of the Adoption Deed dated 12.09.2012 in favour of the petitioner herein. Prior to the
suit filed by the respondent No.6, the petitioner herein also filed a suit being Mat.(Decl.) No. 92 of
2013 to declare her as the adopted daughter of late S. Indubala and the respondent No.6 also filed a
counter claim that she was the natural daughter of late S. Indubala. It is pointed out that vide
common order dated 02.11.2015, both the suit and counter claim were disposed of as not pressed
without any liberty to file fresh ones. In order dated 29.05.2023 passed by a Division Bench of this
Court in Mat. App. Case No. 2 of 2019, titled as Ms. Ruby Soram v. Smt. L. Roma Devi:
MANU/MN/0112/2023, the whole proceeding of Mat.(Decl.) Suit No. 16 of 2019 filed by the
respondent No.6 herein was closed as barred by the provisions of Order 23 Rule 1 Sub-Rules (3) &
(4) of CPC, as no liberty to filed fresh suit was granted when similar suits were withdrawn. Mr. K.
Roshan, learned counsel for the petitioner also relies on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Ram Shridhar Chimukar v. Union of India: (2023) 4 SCC 312 to the point that benefit of
family pension is restricted only to the child legally adopted by the government employee during
his/her lifetime. It is urged that the petitioner herein was adopted by the deceased government
employee during her life time. It is prayed that the respondents be directed to release family pension
of late S. Indubala in favour of the petitioner as per the provisions of Rule 54 of the Central Civil
Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 and in terms of intimation dated 02.02.2013 submitted by the Addl.
Director, Employment Exchange, Manipur to the Joint Secretary (Pension), Govt. of Manipur
nominating the petitioner as nominee.
WP(C) No. 315 of 2016 Page 7
[9] Mr. Th. Sukumar, learned GA has pointed out that the petitioner
did not use the name of her adoptive mother in the matriculation certificate and names of the
biological parents were shown in the certificate even after execution of the alleged adoption. This
issue has been raised by the office of the Principal Accountant General, Manipur vide letters dated
23.05.2013 and 21.10.2013 addressed to the Administrative Department. It is submitted that since
the presumption under Section 16 of HAMA is rebuttable, non- recording of name of adoptive
mother in the school certificate will raise a grave suspicion, when the respondent No.6 has also
claimed to be natural daughter of the deceased government employee. It is clarified that the
petitioner is not entitled to the family pension as prayed for. [10] Mr. S. Suresh, learned counsel for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88040585/ 4
Miss Ruby Soram vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
the Principal Accountant General, Manipur has pointed out that vide letters dated 23.05.2013 and
21.10.2013, clarification was called from the Administrative Department. Till the same is clarified,
the office of AG will not be able to do needful for the release of family pension of late S. Indubala in
favour of the petitioner. [11] In the counter affidavit of the respondent No.6, it is stated that she is
the daughter of late S. Indubala and her neighbour L. Surendro, born outside wedlock and denied
that the petitioner was the adopted daughter. The alleged adoption was done when the petitioner
was 16 years and 8 months in violation of Section 10(iv) of HAMA and the same is not valid. [12] It
is a settled proposition law that a registered adoption deed shall be presumed to be valid unless
disproved in a legal proceeding. In the WP(C) No. 315 of 2016 Page 8 case of Jai Singh vs.
Shakuntala: MANU/SC/0187/2002: (2002) 3 SCC 634, Hon'ble Supreme Court discussed the
statutory presumption of validity of a registered adoption deed under Section 16 of the Hindu
Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 and held that such presumption is rebuttable in a legal
proceeding before a competent court. Para 1 and 2 are reproduced for clarity.
"1. The matter under consideration pertains to the effect of statutory presumption as
envisaged under Section 16 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. For
convenience sake, it would be worthwhile to note the provision for its true purport.
Section 16 reads as below:
"16. Presumption as to registered documents relating to adoption. - Whenever any
document registered under any law for the time being in force is produced before any
Court purporting to record an adoption made and is signed by the person giving and
the person taking the child in adoption, the Court shall presume that the adoption
has been made in compliance with the provisions of this Act unless and until it is
disproved."
2. The Section thus envisages a statutory presumption that in the event of there being a registered
document pertaining to adoption there would be a presumption that adoption has been made in
accordance with law. Mandate of the Statute is rather definite since the Legislature has used "shall"
instead of any other word of lesser significance. Incidentally, however the inclusion of the words
"unless and until it is disproved"
appearing at the end of the statutory provision has made the situation not that rigid
but flexible enough to depend upon the evidence available on record in support of
adoption. It is a matter of grave significance by reason of the factum of adoption and
displacement of the person adopted from the natural succession - thus onus of proof
is rather heavy. Statute has allowed some amount of flexibility, lest it turns out to be
solely dependent on a registered adoption deed. The reason for inclusion of the words
"unless and until it is disproved" shall have to be ascertained in its proper perspective
and as such the presumption cannot but be said to be a rebuttable presumption.
Statutory intent thus stands out to be rather expressive depicting therein that the
presumption cannot be an irrebuttable presumption by reason of the inclusion of the
words just noticed above. On the wake of the aforesaid the observations of the
learned single Judge in Modan Singh v. Sham Kaur and Ors. MANU/PH/0171/1973
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88040585/ 5
Miss Ruby Soram vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 December, 2024
stands confirmed and we record our concurrence therewith."
WP(C) No. 315 of 2016 Page 9
[12] In a recent case, Hon'ble Supreme Court has examined the
presumption of validity of a registered adoption deed under Section 16 of HAMA in
the case of Moturu Nalini Kanth vs. Gainedi Kaliprasad (Dead) through L.Rs.:
MANU/SC/1240/2023. Para 45 is reproduced below.
"45. In Dhanno wd/o. Balbir Singh v. Tuhi Ram (Died) represented by his LRs.
MANU/PH/0035/1996 : AIR 1996 P & H 203, a learned Judge of the Punjab &
Haryana High Court, faced with the argument that Section 16 of the Act of 1956
required a registered adoption deed to be believed, held that the presumption
thereunder, if any, is rebuttable and by merely placing the document on record
without proving the ceremony of due adoption, it could not be said that there was a
valid adoption. The learned Judge rightly noted that the factum of adoption must be
proved in the same way as any other fact and such evidence in support of the
adoption must be sufficient to satisfy the heavy burden that rests upon any person
who seeks to displace the natural succession by alleging an adoption."
[13] The necessary corollary of the above decisions is that the statutory presumption of a valid
registered adoption deed under Section 16 HAMA is rebuttable, until disproved in a legal proceeding
before a competent court. This Court is of the view that mere failure to record names of adoptive
parents in the matriculation certificate will not, ipso facto, render the adoption as invalid without
any proper adjudication. It may also be clarified that the writ court is not a competent jurisdiction to
examine the validity of a registered adoption deed even when this issue arises as a collateral point.
As held by this Court in a previous case of Ruby Soram (supra) about the adoption of the petitioner
herein, the suit for declaration filed by the respondent No.6 herein challenging the adoption of the
petitioner was closed as not maintainable. It is admitted fact that no court has till date declared the
WP(C) No. 315 of 2016 Page 10 adoption of the petitioner as invalid. The presumption under Section
16 of HAMA will still operate and mere failure to record name of the adoptive parents in the
matriculation certificate cannot be consider as a rebuttal specially when no court of competent
jurisdiction has declared the adoption as invalid. Rather, the suit for declaring the adoption of the
petitioner as filed by the respondent No.6 was closed by this Court as barred by law in the case of
Ruby Soram (supra).
[14] In view of the above factual positions and settled proposition of law, the petitioner is deemed to
be adoptive daughter of late S. Indubala, as no court has declared the adoption as invalid.
Accordingly, she is entitled to receive family pension as prayed for. The Administrative Department
is directed to forward the necessary documents for preparation of the family pension of late
Indubala in favour of her adopted daughter Ms. Ruby Soram to the office of Principal Accountant
General Manipur, within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and
on receipt of the necessary papers, the office of Principal Accountant General, Manipur shall issue
family pension authority within further period of one month. [15] With the above observations and

directions, the writ petition is allowed. No cost. Send a copy of this order to the respondent Nos. 1 &
2 for doing needful.
