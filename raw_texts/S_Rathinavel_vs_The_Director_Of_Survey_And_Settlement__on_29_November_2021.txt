order in Rc.Y4/39766/2017 (Sy)(2) of the very same day dated
28.11.2017 are liable to be set aside and quash the same as illegal and
consequently, direct the first respondent to permit the petitioner to
retire from service with all monetary benefits.
For Petitioner : Mr.C.M.Arumugam
For Respondents : Mr.S.Shaji Bino,
Special Government Pleader
ORDER
This writ petition is filed as against the order of suspension and order of retention dated 28.11.2017
passed by the first respondent and also for a consequential direction to the first respondent to
permit the petitioner to retire from service with all monetary benefits.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner joined the service in the Survey
Department in the year 1982 and he rendered 35 years of unblemished service and he was due to
retire from service on 30.11.2017. While so, the first respondent, vide
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis order dated 28.11.2017, placed the petitioner under suspension
and retained him in service, pursuant to a criminal case registered against him in Cr.No.2 of 2018
on the file of the Inspector of Police, Vigilance and Anti Corruption, Madurai, for the offence under
Sections 468, 467 and 471 of IPC r/w. Sections 7, 13(2) r/w. 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988. Challenging the same, the present writ petition has been filed.
3. The main ground raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that though the petitioner has
been placed under suspension in the year 2017, no charge memo has been issued so far and
therefore, as per the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Ajay Kumar Choudhary vs. Union of
India, reported in 2015 7 SCC 291, the order of suspension and retention is liable to be revoked.
4. Mr.S.Shaji Bino, learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submits that
the petitioner, while working as Deputy Inspector of Survey and Land Records, in Madurai
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis South Taluk Office, was taken for preliminary enquiry by the
Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption, based on a complaint given by one
C.Muthumalaichamy, alleging that the petitioner demanded a sum of Rs.8,000/- for sub-division of
agriculture land in Survey Nos.6/3B, 7/1A2 and received Rs.6,000/- from him and thereafter, he
also demanded another sum of Rs.6,000/-. The preliminary enquiry also revealed that the
petitioner informed the complainant that Rs.4,000/- has to be paid for one sub division and hence,
for two sub divisions, he demanded Rs.8000/- and obtained Rs.2,000/- on 23.05.2017 and
Rs.3,000/- on 26.05.2017. He further submits that the petitioner is habitually receiving gratification
other than legal remuneration and that sub division patta was not issued till the date of lodging the
complaint, i.e. on 08.06.2017. Only thereafter, the petitioner seemed to have instructed the
complainant to apply again for sub-division on 27.06.2017 and hurriedly processed the application
by forging the signature of the Firka Surveyor, knowing that vigilance enquiry is pending and got an
order for the issuance of sub-division patta on 30.06.2017.

5. The learned Special Government Pleader further submits that based on the permission accorded
by the Vigilance Commissioner to register a case against the petitioner and based on the instructions
given by the Secretary to Government, Revenue and Disaster Management Department to the first
respondent, the petitioner was placed under suspension as per Rule 17 of the Tamil Nadu Civil
Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules and he was not allowed to retire from service. He further
submits that no charge memo has been issued, since the service particulars of the petitioner were
sent to the Investigating Agency, namely, the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption. He
further submits that since it is a case of trap, the petitioner is not entitled for any relief, as per the
dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Ajay Kumar Choudhary vs. Union of India, reported
in 2015 7 SCC
291. In support of his contention, he also relied upon the Judgment of this Court in W.A.No.599 of
2020, dated 02.09.2020.
6. This Court paid its anxious consideration to the rival https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
submissions made.
7. The petitioner was placed under suspension based on the permission accorded by the Vigilance
Commissioner to register a case against the petitioner and based on the instructions given by the
Secretary to Government, Revenue and Disaster Management Department to the first respondent.
However, no charge memo has been issued so far, since the service particulars of the petitioner have
been sent to the Investigating Agency.
8. In Ajay Kumar Choudhary vs. Union of India, reported in 2015 7 SCC 291, the Hon'ble Apex Court
has held that the currency of a Suspension Order should not extend beyond three months if within
this period the Memorandum of Charges/Chargesheet is not served on the delinquent
officer/employee; if the Memorandum of Charges/Chargesheet is served, a reasoned order must be
passed for the extension of the suspension.

9. A Division Bench of this Court in R.Elumalai v. District Collector, [2020 SCC online Mad 1472],
considered Ajay Kumar Choudhary's case and the judgment of the Delhi High Court in Government
of NCT of Delhi v. Dr.Rishi Anand [2017 SCC online Del 10506] and concluded that in cases relating
to suspension for alleged involvement in graft charges leading to a criminal trial, interference with
the suspension order on the basis that the suspension period exceeded three months is not
justifiable.
10. The First Bench of this Court, in W.A.No.599 of 2020, vide Judgment dated 02.09.2020, has
passed the following order:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84331649/ 3
S.Rathinavel vs The Director Of Survey And Settlement/ on 29 November, 2021
“11. Upon considering the law laid down in the judgments that have been discussed
herein above, it is clear that there is no absolute rule in respect of the validity of
suspension orders from the perspective of duration especially when such suspension
is in the context of a pending criminal proceeding. In other words, in these situations,
the law on suspension as laid down in paragraph 11 of R.P. Kapur v. Union of India,
AIR 1964 SC 787, by a Five Judge Bench upholding https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
suspension pending enquiry subject to payment of subsistence allowance as per
service conditions and that in Union of India v. Ashok Kumar Aggarwal (2013) 16
SCC 147, wherein it was held that the court does not sit in appeal and that such
orders would be interfered with only if the charges are patently baseless, mala fide or
vindictive would continue to hold the field. In this case, as stated earlier, there is a
pending criminal proceeding, wherein the Respondent is being prosecuted for
corruption. In these circumstances, the decision of the learned single Judge to direct
the Chief Judicial Magistrate to conclude the proceeding within four months is
justified and does not warrant interference. On the other hand, especially in light of
the above direction, the revocation of the suspension on the ground that it is
prolonged is clearly unsustainable. The consequential direction to post the
Respondent in a nonsensitive post is also not sustainable especially in view of the fact
that the Respondent is an Assistant Engineer and it is difficult to find a post that may
be termed non-sensitive in that cadre. Therefore, we allow the appeal in part insofar
as it directs the Appellants to revoke the suspension and to post the Respondent in a
non-sensitive post. On the other https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis hand, we affirm
the impugned order to the extent that the Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Thiruvannamalai, has been directed to conclude the criminal proceedings within a
period of four months, albeit with the qualification that the said period shall run from
the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment in this appeal”
11. In view of the Judgment of the First Division Bench of this Court in W.A.No.599 of 2020, dated
02.09.2020 (cited supra), this Court is not inclined to interfere with the order of the suspension.
Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.
12. It is always open to the respondents to get xerox copies of the service particulars of the petitioner
from the Investigating Agency, namely, the Department of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption and issue
a charge memo as directed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Ajay Kumar Choudhary vs. Union of India,
reported in 2015 7 SCC 291 and proceed with the enquiry and pass final orders as early as possible.
No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
