2. Aggrieved of and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment/award dated 13- 11-2014 passed by
respondent No.3, petitioner has assailed it's legality, proprietary and correctness, and has sought its
setting aside/quashment on the following counts:-
(i) that respondent-1 claimed himself to be the driver-cum-owner of vehicle bearing
registration No. JKN/8366 (Tata-1210-Make) which was under insurance coverage
with the branch of petitioner's company at Bari Brahmana Jammu vide Policy No.
352501/31/04/00531 covering the period w.e.f 28.06.2004 to 27.06.2005 against the
payment of premium of Rs.3605/- which included the Compulsory Personal Accident
Cover to owner and driver for an amount of Rs.2.00 lacs;
(ii) that during the currency of the insurance policy, the vehicle is alleged to have met with an
accident on 31.12.2004 regarding which FIR No. 2/2005 came to be registered in Police Station
Domana (Jammu) respondent No.1 being the driver-cum-owner of the insured vehicle sustained
injuries on his persons and suffered permanent disablement;
(iii) that the complaint was filed by respondent No.1 with respondent No.2-District Consumer
Forum Jammu on 27.11.2007 which was registered as case file No.441 claiming therein that
respondent No.1 has suffered permanent disablement during accident and became entitled on
account of the insurance coverage of having suffered permanent disablement, the act of the
insurance company in not settling the claim of the respondent No.1 amounted to unfair trade
practice and deficiency in service;
(iv) that the petitioner's company defended its case and filed detailed objections in the complaint
which was resisted on the grounds, that the complaint does not fall within the purview of Consumer
Protection Act and the disablement of 22% which was alleged to have been suffered by the
complainant/respondent No.1 does not fall within the purview of policy conditions issued by the
branch office of the petitioner's company under standard format of the Commercial Vehicle Package
Policy Personal Accident Cover for the owner and driver which specified that the insured/injured is
entitled to the claim in case there is death or loss of two limbs or sight of two eyes or one limb and
sight or one eye (100%) or loss of one limb or sight of one eye (50%) or permanent total disablement
from injuries other than named above provided always that (100%), but in the present case the
insured/respondent No.1 has only suffered permanent physical disability of 22% therefore he is not
entitled to the claim, that the complaint was hopelessly time barred, complainant/respondent No.1
never approached to the petitioner's company for settlement of his claim and had he approached the
company would have passed a reasonable order, the injuries suffered by R-1 do not fall within the
four corners of the policy clause of the insurance policy obtained by him therefore R-1 is not entitled
to compensation of Rs.2.00 lacs, complaint is not maintainable as was hit by delay and latches
having been filed beyond the period of limitation of two (2) years as provided under Section 18-A of
The Consumer Protection Act 1987, respondent No.1 took up the matter in an appeal filed before
respondent No.3 (J&K State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission) which was registered as
Appeal No. 3439 of 2012 inter-alia on the ground that respondent No.2 (District Consumer Forum
Jammu) has wrongly dismissed the complaint being time barred and not covered under the policy
moreso R-2 failed to appreciate the fact of disability suffered by respondent No.1 and wrongly

The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Through ... vs Dwarka Nath S/O Late Sh. Chajju Ram R/O ... on 31 January, 2023
concluded the claim to be time barred whereas the plea of limitation ought to have been liberally
construed by the respondent No.2 as the delay if any caused was only due to unavoidable
circumstances beyond the control of the complainant/respondent No.1 which could have been
condoned.
3. Sh. S. Rupinder Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner, while recapitulating the grounds
averred in the memo of petition for setting aside the impugned judgment/order dated 13-11-2014
rendered by respondent No.3 has vehemently canvassed arguments, that the injuries suffered by
complainant/respondent No.1 do not fall within the purview of policy conditions issued by the
branch office of petitioner's company under standard format of the Commercial Vehicle Package
Policy Personal Accident Cover for the owner and driver which specifies that the insured/injured is
entitled to the claim in case there is death or loss of two limbs or sight of two eyes or one limb and
sight or one eye (100%) or loss of one limb or sight of one eye (50%) or permanent total disablement
from injuries other than named above provided always that (100%), but in the present case the
insured/respondent No.1 has only suffered permanent physical disability of 22% therefore is not
entitled to the claim. It is argued, that the complaint filed by R-1 before R-2 was hopelessly time
barred, the injuries suffered by R-1 do not fall within the four corners of the policy clause of the
insurance policy obtained by him therefore R-1 is not entitled to compensation of Rs.2.00 lacs,
complaint is not maintainable as was hit by delay and latches having been filed beyond the period of
limitation of two (2) years as provided under Section 18-A of The Consumer Protection Act 1987. It
is moreso argued, that respondent No.3 has totally overlooked the policy conditions covering
Personal Accident Cover for owner/driver, the law of limitation has not been correctly applied and
without any legal justification R-3 has set aside the order of respondent No.2 District Consumer
Forum Jammu thereby allowing the complaint of respondent No.1 and awarding him claim of Rs.
2.10 lacs to be indemnified by the petitioner's company. In support of his arguments, learned
counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of Madras High Court rendered in "New
India Assurance Co. Ltd.--Appellant versus M. Subramanian--Respondent", [2012 (22) R.C.R (Civil)
841].
4. Sh. Govind Raina, learned counsel for respondent No.1, Per Contra, has strenuously argued, that
the claim preferred by complainant/respondent No.1 before R-2 is covered under the provisions of
Personal Accident Cover Policy as respondent No.1 has suffered 100% disability which is covered
under Section III of the Standard Forum For Commercial Vehicle Package Policy on account of
Personal Accident Cover for owner/driver as per schedule of the policy. It is argued, that
complainant/ R-1 has met with an accident on 31-12- 2014 which was covered by policy of insurance
covering the period w.e.f. 28- 06-2004 to 27-06-2005, the limitation of two (2) years as mandated
u/s 18-A of Consumer Protection Act 1987 has to be applied liberally and therefore complainant/R-1
is entitled to the claim of Rs. 2.10 lacs as awarded by R-3 and to be indemnified by petitioner's
company.
5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the impugned judgment/order passed by
respondent No.3 and the order of R-2 (Divisional Consumer Redressal Forum). We have also gone
through the case law referred by learned counsel for the petitioner.

6. In "New India Assurance Co. Ltd.--Appellant versus M. Subramanian--
Respondent", [2012 (22) R.C.R (Civil) 841] relied by Ld. Counsel for petitioner, Madras High Court
while appreciating the insurance claim policy in regard to Personal Accident Cover For
Owner-Driver and observing that the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation if injury
suffered by the injured does not fall within the four corners of the policy, in para 9 of the judgment
held as under:-
9. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the injuries sustained by the
claimant are not covered under any of the injuries specified under the policy and
therefore he is not entitled to make any claim for compensation; and in support of
their contention the following decisions are relied upon:-
i) Rakesh kumar vs. United India Insurance Company (FAO 3469 of 2008) The
contention raised was that the claimant himself was the owner-cum-driver of the
vehicle and as such, as he is not a 3rd party, the insurance company is not liable.
The injury suffered resulted in physical disability only to the extent of 10.7 % whereas, he did not
suffer any injury to the extent of (ii) loss of two limbs or sight of two eyes or one limb and sight of
one eye; (iii) loss of one limb or sight of one eye; (iv) permanent total disablement from injuries
other than named above. Thus the claimant is not covered by any of the categories of injuries as
mentioned in the conditions of the policy i.e. under the Private car package policy in which the
claimant had paid premium of Rs.100/- for compulsory personal accident cover to the owner /driver
up to the amount of Rs.2,00,000/-.
ii) United India Insurance vs. J.K.Raju @ Sakthi 2009 STPL (CL) 3747 NC In this case, the
complainant had been covered by Janatha Personal Accident Insurance Policy. His knee was
fractured resulting in shortening of lower limb by 0.7 inches. The contention was that the disability
alleged was not permanent, total and absolute disability. The state commission held that the
disability can be termed as 100% with reference to his employment opportunity but the national
commission did not agree with the state commission. The national commission held that the
claimant had not proved that he had been rendered permanently disabled from carrying out any
other profession. It was further held that policy condition was not proved.
Ratio of the judgments (Supra) relied by Ld. Counsel for the petitioner makes the legal proposition
abundantly clear, that if the injuries sustained by the claimant are not covered under any of the
injuries specified under the policy, the claimant is not entitled for any compensation. In the case
laws (Supra) the claimant had only suffered injury/physical disability to the extent of 10.7% and not
100% as is specified in the policy, therefore, the claimant was held not entitled for any
compensation. Ratios of the judgments (Supra) squarely apply to the fact of the case in hand. It is
admitted case of the parties that claimant/respondent No.1 driver-cum-owner of vehicle bearing
registration No. JKN 8366 (Tata-1210-Make) obtained insurance coverage from branch office of
petitioner's company vide police No. 352501/31/04/0053 covering the period w.e.f. 28.06.2004 to
27.06.2005 against payment of premium of Rs. 3605 which included the compulsory personal

accident cover to the owner- cum-driver for an amount of Rs. 2.00 lacs for which the insurance
premium of Rs. 100 was paid by R-1 in favour of petitioner's company. Section-III of the Standard
Form for Commercial Vehicle Package Policy on Account of Personal Accident Cover for
owner-driver for the sake of reference is referred as under:-
"Subject otherwise to the terms, exceptions, conditions and limitations of this policy,
the Company undertakes to pay compensation as per the following scale for bodily
injury/death sustained by the Owner-Driver of the vehicle in direct connect with the
vehicle insured whilst or mounting into/dismounting from or traveling in the insured
vehicle as a co-driver, caused by violent accidental external and visible means which
independent of any other cause shall within six calendar months of such injury result
in:
Nature of Injury Scale of compensation
i) Death 100.00%
ii) Loss of two limbs or sight of two eyes or 100.00%
one limb and sight of one eye
iii) Loss of one limb or sight of one eye 50.00%
iv) Permanent total disablement from injuries 100.00%
other than named above
The aforesaid table regarding the nature of injury and scale of compensation makes it
abundantly clear, that in case of injuries from S. No. (i) to (iv) in the table, the
corresponding scale of compensation is clearly specified. In the case in hand,
respondent No.1/claimant took the policy from the petitioner's company for an
amount of Rs. 2.00 lacs having insurance cover w.e.f 28.06.2004 to 27.06.2005.
Vehicle bearing registration No. JKN/8366 (Tata- 1210-Make) of respondent No.1
was under insurance cover with petitioner's company at the relevant time of accident
on 31.12.2004 in which accident respondent No1 suffered injuries to the extent of
22%. Dr. V.K.Sharma, Registrar Ortho IIIrd to the Medical Superintendent
Government Medical College Hospital Jammu, has furnished his opinion in the
certificate issued by him regarding the %age of injury suffered by R-1. The said
medical certificate (Annexure-C) to the record of respondent No.2-District Consumer
Forum reads as under:
"Govt. Medical College Hospital, Jammu Medical Records Department Medical

Certified that Mr. Dwarka Nath S/o Late Sh. Chajju Ram R/o 3/116 Indira Vihar Old
Janipur Jammu remained admitted under OU-IIIrd vie MRD No. 375411 and MLC
No. 7338 w.e.f 01.01.05 as a case of injury spine following RTA he was treated
conservatively by complete rest and discharged on 10.01.05 and advised regular
follow up in Ortho OPD. Presently on examination vide OPD No. 755, he is having
low backache (traumatic disc) with restricted range of movements of lumbosaceral
spine with painful movements with Sec. degenerative charges in lumbosaceral spine
radiologically. He is unable to souat and cannot perform any strenuous work. He is
permanently physically disabled and his overall permanent physically disability
amounts to 22% approximately (twenty two percent). Sd/-Dr. V.K.Sharma, Registrar
Ortho IIIrd."
The opinion rendered by Dr. V.K.Sharma, Registrar Ortho, IIIrd, Medical College Jammu clearly
depicts, that respondent No.1/claimant has suffered permanently physically disablement upto 22%.
As per the table appended aforesaid in regard to Personal Accident Cover for owner-driver, in terms
of the column of scale of compensation, R-1/claimant has not suffered 100% or 50% of disablement,
but only 22%, therefore, in view of the ratios of the judgments (Supra) R-1/claimant is not entitled
any compensation. Moreso, in terms of section 18-A of the J&K Consumer Protection Act 1987
District Forum or the State Commission may not admit a complaint unless it is filed within two
years from the date on which the cause of action arises. The occurrence/cause of action had accrued
to respondent No.1/claimant on the date of accident on 31-12-2004 but he has filed the complaint
before respondent No.2 on 27-11-2007 after the expiry of period of limitation of 2 years, therefore,
the complaint before respondent No.2 is time barred. Respondent No.2 (District Consumer
Redressal Forum Jammu) therefore has rightly rejected the claim of complainant/respondent No.2
as found not maintainable and time barred. Respondent No.3 (J&K State Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission Jammu) in appeal has wrongly and incorrectly applied the proposition of law
and has incorrectly assumed on factual position that R-1/claimant has suffered 100% disablement
instead of 22% as opined by the expert doctor and is entitled to compensation for 2 lacs alongwith
consolidated amount of Rs. 10000/- as compensation and litigation charges bringing the total
liability of Rs. 2.10 lacs to be paid by petitioner's company in favour of respondent no.1.
7. For the foregoing reasons and discussion, we are of the opinion, that respondent No.1/claimant is
not entitled to any compensation from petitioner's company. Respondent No.2 has rightly held by
its order dated 01- 10-2012 that the complaint of respondent No.1 is not maintainable. The
impugned judgment/order dated 13-11-2014 rendered by R-3 is held illegal and unsustainable in the
eyes of law. In the net result, we hold that the instant appeal succeeds and the order of R-2 (District
Consumer Redressal Forum Jammu) dated 01-10-2012 is affirmed, whereas, impugned order of R-3
(J&K State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Jammu) is hereby set aside/quashed.
8. Disposed off accordingly.
