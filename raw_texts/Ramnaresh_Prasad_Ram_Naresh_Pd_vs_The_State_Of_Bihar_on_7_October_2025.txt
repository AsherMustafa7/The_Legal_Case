number of shops in proportion to the population
and beneficiaries.
3. The brief facts as culled out from the
Writ petition is that the petitioner is a citizen of
India and he has no personal interest directly or
indirectly in this case. The petitioner himself is a
secretary of Raxaul Block Unit of PDS Dealers and
his grievance is only limited to ensure that the
appointment of PDS dealers shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of the Bihar
Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016, for which he has filed the present writ
petition
4. Pursuant to the advertisement issued by
the respondent, several persons applied for PDS
Dealership. After scrutiny, candidates were
selected by the District Magistrate-cum Chairman
Selection Committee, East Champaran, Motihari by
his order contained in Memo No. 112 directing to
issue license which necessitated the petitioner to
approach this Court.

5. The grievances of the petitioner pertains
to Raxaul Nagar Panchayat. As per the
advertisement, there are 22 vacancies, out of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19703616/ 3
Ramnaresh Prasad @ Ram Naresh Pd vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
which 5 were notified for general category, 2 for
unreserved females, 3 for the Backward Class, 2
for Backward Class Female, 3 for the Extremely
Backward Class, 1 for Extremely Backward Class
female, 5 for Scheduled Caste and 1 for Scheduled
Caste female.
6. As per the Bihar Targeted PDS (Control)
Order, 2016, the reservation shall be 16 % for
Scheduled Castes, 1% for Scheduled Tribes, 18%
for Extremely Backward Class, 12% for Backward
Class and 3% for Backward Class Female. However,
as per the advertisement 50% shops were
reserved for reserved categories and 50% shops
were available for the general category.
7. It is the specific contention of the
learned counsel for the petitioner that the
classification in the advertisement disclose that 15
posts have been reserved for the reserved
categories, which is contrary to the reservation
Patna High Court CWJC No.10748 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025

policy prescribed under Clause-6 of Bihar Targeted
(Control) Order 2016 and only 3% reservation has
been provided to Backward Class female and total
50% reservation has been provided to reserved
categories so, out of 22 vacancies, only one post

Ramnaresh Prasad @ Ram Naresh Pd vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
was provided to Backward Class female. Therefore,
the petitioner prayed to set aside the
advertisement dated 13.12.2017 and
consequential selection process including the order
dated 28.11.2018.
8. The contents of the Writ petition further
disclose that the petitioner had earlier filed CWJC
No. 6091 of 2019, which was disposed of on
28.03.2019
by the Division Bench of this Court.
9. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the Learned counsel for the respondents.
10. The order of the Division Bench of this Court passed in CWJC No. 6091 of 2019 dated
28.03.2019, which reads as follows:-
Heard.
The petitioner in garb of Patna High Court CWJC No.10748 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025
public interest, questions a public advertisement for initiating a selection process for
settlement of dealership. It is an individual interest litigation and cannot be projected
in public interest. No reason for indulgence is called for. The petitioner, if so
aggrieved, can raise his grievance before the proper forum.
The writ petition is
disposed of.
11. The record reveals that pursuant to the orders of this Court, the petitioner again
preferred a Writ petition challenging the same public advertisement for initiating the
selection process for settlement of dealership in his individual capacity. However, the
contents of the Writ petition clearly disclose that the petitioner has no personal
interest directly or indirectly in this case. On the other hand, the petitioner claims to
be the Secretary of Raxual Block Unit of PDS Dealers and on behalf of the
association, he preferred the Writ petition. But the cause title of the Writ petition
Patna High Court CWJC No.10748 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025 does not disclose that the
petitioner preferred this Writ petition on behalf of the PDS Dealers of Raxual Block

Ramnaresh Prasad @ Ram Naresh Pd vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
Unit though, the contents of Writ petition disclose. Moreover, the Vakalatnama filed
by the petitioner clearly disclose that it was filed in his individual capacity and not on
behalf of the PDS Dealers Association.
12. Article 226 of the Constitution of India envisages, any individual can file Writ
petition if his fundamental rights are infringed or principles of natural justice are
violated. In the present case, the petitioner himself claims that he has no personal
interest directly or indirectly, neither his fundamental rights are infringed nor the
principles of natural justice are violated.
13. In view of the above discussion, the Writ petition is dismissed as it is devoid of
merits.
