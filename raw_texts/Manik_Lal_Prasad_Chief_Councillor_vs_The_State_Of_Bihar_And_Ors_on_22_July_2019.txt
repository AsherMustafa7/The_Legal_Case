meeting for no confidence motion as against the

addressed to the petitioner but never served to the
petitioner and has directly been made to the
Executive Officer, Nagar Panchayat, Khusrupur,
and further for quashing the letter as contained in
letter no. 131 dated 25.02.2019 issued under the
signature of the Executive Officer, Nagar
Panchayat, Khusrupur, whereby and where under
the petitioner has been requested to give his
opinion with regard to no confidence motion

court from time to time.

not to take any action or create any impediment

The petitioner is the Chief Councillor of Nagar Panchayat,
Khusrupur, Patna. There are 10 Wards under the said Nagar
Panchayat. On 14.01.2019 some of the Councillors including
the respondent no. 6 who is the Deputy Chief Councillor
brought a requisition for calling a Special Meeting to discuss a

No Confidence Motion against the petitioner. It is stated that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180660075/ 2
Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
copy of the said requisition was sent to the Executive Officer,
Nagar Panchayat, Khusrupur which was sent to the petitioner
vide Memo No. 36 dated 14.01.2019 (Annexure '1'). The said
requisition was, however, withdrawn vide letter dated
04.02.2019
a copy of which has been enclosed as Annexure '2' to the writ application. It is the case of the
petitioner that after withdrawal of the requisition, there were General Meeting of the Nagar
Panchyat on 14.02.2019, 18.02.2019 and thereafter but in those Meetings there was no whisper from
any Ward Members against the petitioner. All of a sudden, it is stated that the petitioner came to
know through some reliable sources that vide Letter Dated 20.02.2019 issued under the signature of
the Deputy Chief Councillor a requisition has been made in writing addressed to the petitioner
requesting for calling a Special Meeting to discuss No Confidence Motion against him.
The petitioner claims that this was never served upon him as it was sent directly to the Executive
Officer, Nagar Panchayat, Khusrupur. The petitioner states that as soon as he came to know about
the requisition for No Confidence Motion, he represented before the Executive Officer vide her
Letter Dated 23.02.2019 (Annexure '3'). The petitioner was served Patna High Court CWJC No.5258
of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 thereafter vide Letter No. 131 dated 25.02.2019, the said requi- sition dated
22.02.2019 by which the petitioner was requested to give his opinion in writing on the issue.
The petitioner has moved this Court claiming that the impugned letter dated 20.02.2019 and letter
No. 131 dated 25.02.2019 are in violation of the statutory provisions as con- tained in Section 25(4)
of the Bihar Municipal Act, 2017 (here- inafter referred to as the 'Act of 2007). It is submitted that in
terms of Section 25(4) of the Act of 2007 No Confidence Mo- tion cannot be brought again within
one year of the first No Confidence Motion. According to the petitioner the requisition for first No
Confidence Motion was brought on 14.01.2019, the same was withdrawn on 04.02.2019, therefore
the subsequent requisition dated 20.02.2019 is against the statutory provisions.
During pendency of the writ petition since the Special Meeting was held on 18.03.2019, the
petitioner has filed I. A. No. 01 of 2019 for quashing of letter dated 13.03.2019 by which the
Executive Officer, Nagar Panchayat, Khusrupur had fixed the date of Special Meeting on 18.03.2019
to move the 'No Confidence Motion'. I. A. No. 01 of 2019 was allowed vide or- der dated 06.05.2019.
A counter affidavit has been filed in this case on behalf Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019
dt.22-07-2019 of respondent no. 5 who is the Executive Officer of the Nagar Panchayat, Khusrupur.
It is her stand that the requisition for No Confidence Motion has been brought by the Deputy
Chairman, Nagar Panchayat, Khusrupur along with signature of six other Ward Members as
contained in Letter Dated 20.02.2019 and soon thereafter, she vide letter No. 132 dated 25.02.2019
sent letter to the Principal Secretary, Urban Development and Hous- ing Department, Govt. of Bihar
seeking guidelines. She also sought guidelines from the Sub-Divisional officer, Patna City vide letter
No. 140 dated 01.03.2019 (Annexure 'B'). It is fur- ther stated that the respondent no. 5 informed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180660075/ 3
Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
the respondent no. 6 and other Ward Members that since the petitioner had ap- proached the
Hon'ble High Court by filing a writ application, any action shall be taken after outcome of the writ
application. On the same day the respondent no. 6 and six other Ward Coun- cillors vide their letter
dated 08.03.2019 informed respondent no. 5 that in exercise of their power under Section 25 (4) of
the Act of 2007 read with 2(iii) of the Bihar Municipal No Confi- dence Motion Process Rules, 2010
they had fixed 14.03.2019 to discuss the No Confidence Motion subsequently while respond- ing to
the stand of respondent no. 5, the respondent no. 6 and other Councillors vide their letter dated
13.03.2019 (Annexure Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 'G') fixed the date of
Special Meeting on 18.03.2019. Subse- quently Meeting was held but in view of the interim order of
this Court, result was not declared.
In this case respondent no. 6 has also appeared and filed Interlocutory Application No. 02 of 2019 in
which a prayer has been made for vacating the partial stay of the result of the Spe- cial Meeting held
on 18.03.2019. It is stated that in the Special Meeting the No Confidence Motion against the
petitioner has been put to secret voting.
It is the stand of respondent no. 6 that earlier vide their requisition dated 14.01.2019 respondent no.
6 and six other elected Ward Councillors requested the petitioner to fix a date for Special Meeting
for discussing 'No Confidence Motion' as also to issue notice for such Special Meeting. Copy of the
said application was forwarded to the other respondent authorities. The requisition was served upon
the petitioner on 14.01.2019 it- self and a copy to respondent no. 5 was also served upon her on the
same day. It is alleged that respondent no. 5 was acting in collusion with the writ petitioner and one
of the requisitionists namely, Ashok Kumar parted with the writ petitioner for reasons best known
to him, no Special Meeting of any sort was fixed by the petitioner. It is stated that on a blank paper
signatures of all Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 requisitionists were taken
under some false pretext and it was converted into an application for withdrawal of requisition
dated 14.01.2019. Neither respondent no. 6 nor other Ward Council- lors requisitionists signed any
such application for withdrawal of the requisition but in order to avoid any unnecessary contro-
versy they decided to draft a fresh requisition and accordingly it was drafted on 20.02.2019. On
20.02.2019 the requisition dated 20.02.2019 could not be served upon the petitioner or respon-
dent no. 5 as none of them could be approached on that date.
It is alleged that on 21.02.2019 the writ petitioner took the requisition, read it but refused to give
any receiving for the same, then further a copy of the said requisition was served upon respondent
no. 5. Photo copy of the requisition dated 20.20.2019 has been enclosed as Annexure 'R6-1'. The
copy of the requisition was also dispatched to this petitioner vide speed post on 23.02.2019.
According to respondent no. 6, it is only be- cause the petitioner came to know about the requisition
for 'No Confidence Motion' on 21.02.2019, he plotted a story by filing representation before the
respondent no. 5 alleging that the elected members are planning to file a fresh requisition against
her, he requested the respondent no. 5 not to act on such requisi- tion as earlier requisition has been
withdrawn. It is further stated Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 that copy of
the requisition was served upon respondent no. 5 on 21.02.2019 itself but for the reasons best
known to her, she chose to forward the said requisition to Chief Ward Councillor vide her letter
dated 25.02.2019 as contained in Annexure '4' to the writ petition. Since seven days period had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180660075/ 4
Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
elapsed and no ac- tion whatsoever has been taken by the petitioner, the respondent no. 6 claims
that he and other requisitionists exercising their power under the Section 48 (3) of the Act of 2007
and the Bihar Municipal No Confidence Motion Process Rules 2010 (here- inafter referred to as the
'No Confidence Motion Process Rules of 2010') chose to fix a date for Special Meeting on
14.03.2019, respondent no. 5 was informed in this regard and she was asked to issue notice for No
Confidence Motion. The respondent no. 5, however, after receiving the letter dated 08.03.2019 did
not fix the Special Meeting and informed respondent no. 6 that because the matter is pending before
the Hon'ble Court and a decision in this regard will be taken only after the judgment of the Hon'ble
Court. Since no notice was issued by respondent no. 5 for the meeting to be held on 14.03.2019, the
respondent no. 6 and other requisitionists members took a decision to conduct the Special Meeting
on 18.03.2019, accordingly, respondent no. 5 was informed about the date for issuing notice which
was ac- Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 cordingly done, the meeting was
held on 18.03.2019 in which it was decided to go for secret ballot. Minutes of the Special Meeting
held on 18.03.2019 is Annexure 'R6/4' to the interlocu- tory application. It is submitted that the
meeting was attended by the petitioner. The Councillors demanded secret voting, ac- cordingly, the
secret voting was allowed by the authorized offi- cer who was present in absence of the Executive
Officer.
In the aforementioned background of the facts, this case has been argued by learned counsel for the
parties solely on the ground that in terms of Section 25(4) of the Act of 2007 read with the
provisions of the No Confidence Motion Rules of 2010 the requisition dated 20.02.2019 cannot be
brought against the petitioner within one year of fist No Confidence Motion. It is submitted that
once the first requisition was withdrawn on 14.02.2019, the subsequent requisition would be wholly
barred and cannot be acted upon.
Before this Court proceeds to consider the aforesaid is- sue, it is made clear that although in the
pleadings certain dis- putes have been raised with regard to service of requisition but in course of
argument the parties have proceeded to argue the matter without raising any factual disputes. Even
otherwise this Court finds that the facts stated in the Interlocutory Application Patna High Court
CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 No. 02 of 2019 by respondent no. 6 have not been disputed /
denied by filing any counter affidavit thereto. The fact that the parties agreed at the Bar for hearing
of the writ application and disposal of the same based on legal construction of the second proviso to
sub-section (4) of Section 25 of the Act of 2007 is duly mentioned in this Court's order dated
06.05.2019.
The Bihar Municipal At, 2007 has been enacted with an object "to consolidate and amend the laws
relating to the mu- nicipal governments in the State of Bihar in conformity with the provisions of the
Constitution of India as amended by the Con- stitution (74th Amendment) Act 1992, based on the
principles of participation in, and decentralization, autonomy and account- ability of, urban self
government at various levels, to introduce the reforms and financial management and accounting
systems, internal resource generation capacity and an organizational de- sign of Municipalities, to
ensure professionalization of the Mu- nicipal personnel, and to provide for matters connected there-
with or incidental thereto."

For a better appreciation of the issues involved in the present writ application it would be necessary
to quote Section 25 of the Act of 2007 which reads as under:
"25. Removal of Chief Councillor/Deputy Chief Councillor .- (1) The Chief Patna High

conduct of business in the special meeting shall be such as may be prescribed:
"Provided that a no confidence motion shall not be brought against the Chief
Councillor/Deputy Chief Councillor within a period of two years of taking over the
charge of the post:
Provided further that a no confidence motion shall not be brought again within one

2007 against the Chief Councillor/Deputy Chief Councillor shall be considered and
disposed of as per the Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019
following process:-
(i) To remove the Chief Councillor/the Deputy Chief Councillor, a special meeting of
the elected Councillors shall be called for.

(ix) Where the posts of Chief Councillor/Deputy Chief Councillor fall vacant as a consequence of no
confidence motion, the process of electing new Chief Councillor or Deputy Chief Councillor shall be

This Court has taken note of the Object of the Act as it would help resolving the issues by construing
the words of the statute where the parties are contesting on two possible inter- pretations. This
would also require a simultaneous look at Sec- tion 44 (3) of the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 2006
(hereinafter re- ferred to as the 'Act of 2006'). Section 44 (3) of the Act of 2006 reads as under:
44. (3) (i) A Pramukh/Up-Pramukh of the Panchayat Samiti shall be deemed to have
vacated his office forthwith if a resolution expressing want of confidence in him is
passed by a majority of the total number of elected members of the Panchayat Samiti
at a meeting specially convened for the purpose.
The requisition for such a special meeting shall be pre- sented to the Pramukh in writing with a copy
to the Executive Officer of the Panchayat Samiti, by not less than one third of the total number of
members elected directly from the territorial constituencies of the Pan- chayat Samiti. The Executive
Officer shall immedi- ately bring the requisition to the notice of the Pra- mukh. The Pramukh shall
convene such meeting on a date falling within 15 days of such requisition. If the Patna High Court
CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 Pramukh fails to call the special meeting, the Up-Pra- mukh
or one third of the total number of directly elected members may fix a date for such meeting and
require the Executive Officer to give notice to the members and to take such action as may be
necessary to convene the meeting. The Executive Officer shall necessarily issue such notice in time
and convene the meeting. No such meeting shall be postponed once the notice for. the same has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180660075/ 8
Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
been issued. No quorum shall be required for the special meeting convened to dis- cuss no
confidence motion.
(ii) No confidence motion shall not be moved against the Pramukh or the Up-Pramukh within the
first two year period of their tenure. 1[Such a no confidence motion may be brought only once in the
whole tenure of Pramukh/Up-Pramukh.] [xxx]2 [(iii) No confidence motion against the Pramukh or
Up-Pramukh or both, as the case may be, shall not be brought during the last six months of the term
of the Panchayat Samiti as mentioned in section 39 (1) of this Act.
(iv) Such reasons/charges, on the basis of which no confidence motion has to be moved against the
Pra- mukh or Up-Pramukh, shall be clearly mentioned in the notice of meeting called to consider
the no confi- dence motion.
(v) As soon as the meeting called under this section begins, the presiding member of this meeting
shall read out the motion on which the meeting has been

the motion shall not be adjourned.
(vi) During discussion, opportunity shall be given to the Pramukh/Up-Pramukh against whom no
confi- dence motion has been moved for his defence before the Panchayat Samiti. The motion shall
be put to vote on the same day after discussion and shall take place by secret ballot in the prescribed
manner.
(vii) In case of no confidence motion against a Pra- mukh, the meeting shall be presided by the
Up-Pra- mukh; in case of motion against Up-Pramukh by the Pramukh and in case of motion
against both Pra- mukh and up Pramukh, by any member elected from among the members of the
Panchayat Samiti present in the meeting.
In case of the post of Up-Pramukh being vacant or his absence from the meeting convened for
discus- sion on no confidence motion against the Pramukh or the post of Pramukh being vacant or
his absence from the meeting convened for discussion on no confidence motion against the
Up-Pramukh, as the case may be, shall be presided over by any member elected from amongst the
directly elected members from the territorial constituency of the Panchayat Samiti present in the
meeting."
Mr. P. K. Sahi, learned Senior Counsel representing the petitioner has centered his arguments
submitting that a conjoint reading of second proviso to sub-section (4) of Section 25 of the Act of
2007 would show that a Chief Councillor may be re- Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180660075/ 9
Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
dt.22-07-2019 moved from his office by resolution carried by a majority of whole number of
Councillors holding office for the time being at a Special Meeting which is to be called for in the
given man- ner upon a requisition made in the writing by not less than 1/3 rd of total number of the
Councillors. The first proviso clearly stipulates that a No Confidence Motion shall not be brought
against the Chief Councillor / Deputy Chief Councillor within a period of 2 years from taking over
the charge of the post. Ac- cording to learned Senior Counsel, the moment a requisition is made in
writing by the given number of the Councillors, it amounts to bringing a 'No Confidence Motion',
therefore, by virtue of the first proviso to sub-section (4) of Section 25 of the Act of 2007 no
requisition for a 'No Confidence Motion' shall be brought within two years. Extending his argument,
learned Senior Counsel further submits that the second proviso should be read in consonance with
the entire scheme of sub-section 4 of Section 25 of the Act of 2007. According to the second proviso,
a No Confidence Motion shall not be brought again within one year of the first No Confidence
Motion. According to the learned Senior Counsel the cluster of words "first No Confi- dence Motion"
has to be understood as if once a requisition has been made for bringing a No Confidence Motion
after the re- Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 striction of two years ends, it
would amount to "the first No Confidence Motion" and therefore the moment the requisition was
withdrawn in this case on 14.02.2019, the consequences of the second proviso to sub-section (4) of
Section 25 of the Act of 2007 shall follow.
The submission of Mr. Sahi, learned Senior Counsel has been opposed with some confidence by Mr.
Ravi Ranjan, learned counsel representing respondent no. 6. He has relied upon the dictionary
meaning of word 'withdrawal' as provided in the Black's Law Dictionary 9th Edition which reads as
under:
withdrawal, n. (18c) 1. The act of taking back or away;removal<withdrawal of
consent>.2. The act of retreating from a place, position, or situa- tion<withdrawal
from the moot-court competi- tion>. 3. The removal of money from a deposi-
tory<withdrawal of funds from the checking ac- count>. 4 RENUNCIATION (3)
<withdrawal from the conspiracy to commit arson>. 5. RE- TRACTIOIN (4) 6.
Parliamentary law. A mo-
tion's removal from consideration by its mover. The mover controls a motion only
until the chair states the question, after which the motion be- longs to the assembly

According to him a No Confidence Motion takes place only when it is put before the
House and until the Chair states the question it would not be said to be a 'No
Confidence Mo- tion'. Learned counsel has submitted that the word "requisition" and
the word "No Confidence Motion" are not synonyms to each other. A No Confidence
Motion takes place only when a Special Meeting is convened to discuss on the
allegations made in the requisition and it is placed before the House for a consid-
eration. It is submitted that if the interpretation as is being sought to be given by

Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner is allowed to be accepted, it would result in
taking away a valu- able democratic right vested with the Councillors to remove the
Chief Councillors /Deputy Chief Councillor from his/her office. He has also
submitted that any such interpretation would allow a person like the petitioner to
indulge in getting a requisition for No Confidence Motion issued through his/her
favoured Coun- cillors at one point of time immediately after expiry of two years or
taking over the charge of the post and then by getting the requisition withdrawn he
may ensure that no second requisi- tion seeking holding of a Special Meeting to
discuss No Confi- dence Motion may be brought. Learned counsel submits that the
Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 required number for
bringing requisition is only 1/3 rd of total number of Councillors therefore, a Chief
Councillor / Deputy Chief Councillor who may have lost the confidence of the ma-
jority of the whole number of Councillors but is having confi- dence of only 1/3rd of
the total number of Councillors would immediately bring a requisition after expiry of
two years, will get it withdrawn and shall ensure thereby that despite not having
confidence of the majority of the whole number of Councillors, he/she continues in
his office. Learned counsel for respondent no. 6 submits that the writ petition is liable
to fail on a purpos- ing interpretation of Section 25(4) of the Act of 2007. It is also
submitted that petitioner has lost confidence of the majority of the Councillors is also
apparent from the fact that the requisition has been signed by the Deputy Chief
Councillor and six Coun- cillors. The six Councillors are necessary parties but they
have not been made party respondent and on this ground alone the writ is fit to be
dismissed.
Consideration Having heard learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and learned
counsel for the State and respondent no. 6, this Court is of the considered opinion
that second proviso to sub- section (4) of Section 25 must be harmonized with the
subject Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 of the enactment
and it's object which the Legislatures had in view must be kept in mind. Sometimes
strict grammatical mean- ing may give way to the object to be attained and the Court
may decline to be bound by the same if any such interpretation frus- trates the patent
purpose of the statute. Second proviso to sub- section (4) of Section 25 of the Act of
2007, in the opinion of this Court must be read in the light of the well settled Rule of
in- terpretation of statutes 'expressions used therein should ordinar- ily be
understood in a sense in which they posed harmonize with the object of the statute
and therefore when two interpreta- tions are feasible, the Court of laws always prefer
that which advances the remedy and suppresses the mischief. This Court would
therefore, in the present case adopt an object oriented ap- proach.

Chandrachud, former Chief Justice of India provides the dictionary meaning of the
word "requisition". Which reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180660075/ 11
Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
"Requisition .........the act of formally requiring one to perform some action, discharge
some duty etc.........."
Further the word "motion" has been defined in the con- Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019
dt.22-07-2019 text of Parliamentary law as under:
"MOTION (In parliamentary law.) A motion is a "proposition made to the house by a
member, which, if adopted, becomes the resolution, vote or order of the house."
"NOTICE OF MOTION. A notice of a motion is not a motion, and should not be so
treated". A motion is said to be a proposal or suggestion looking to, action a
deliberate assembly".
To this Court it appears that the Legislatures being fully aware of the different and distinct meaning
of the word 'requi- sition' and 'No Confidence Motion' used these two words at two different places
in the same section. In the main Section 4 the mode and manner of removal of the Chief Councillor/
Deputy Chief Councillor has been provided. The first step towards the same is a requisition to be
made in writing by not less than 1/3 rd of the total number of Councillors. By bringing the first
proviso, however, the Legislatures assured that even as a requisition may be made in writing by
1/3rd of the total number of Councillors the same would not result in a 'No Confidence Motion' if it
is within a period of two years of taking over the charge of the post. Thus, the Legislatures very
carefully being aware of the fact that they had conferred power upon 1/3rd of total number of
Councillors to bring a requisition for removal of the Chief Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019
dt.22-07-2019 Councillor / Deputy Chief Councillor imposed a bar on bringing a No Confidence
Motion. The Legislatures, thus, nullified any attempt on the part of the requisite number of
Councillors to ini- tiate a proposal for bringing a 'No Confidence Motion' within first two years.
Further in the second proviso the Legislatures ensured that once a 'No Confidence Motion' has been
brought, another No Confidence Motion cannot be brought within one year of the first No
Confidence Motion. The question is whether submission of a requisition by 1/3rd of the total
number of Coun- cillors proposing to convene a Special Meeting to discuss a No Confidence Motion
may be said to be a 'No Confidence Motion' brought. Whether bringing a requisition is the same and
one as 'No Confidence Motion' and if it is so then why the Legislatures used these two words in the
same section at two different places.
To this Court, it appears that to bring a requisition is not the same and one thing as a No Confidence
Motion. Bringing of requisition is a procedure alone to bring a 'No Confidence Motion' in a Special
Meeting to be convened for this purpose after giving notices to all the Councillors in accordance with
law. Unless the requisition results in convening and holding of a Special Meeting for moving of No
Confidence Motion before the House, it cannot be said that a 'No Confidence Motion' has Patna
High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 been brought against the Chief Councillor /
Deputy Chief Coun- cillor. 'Requisition' unless placed in the special meeting does not become
'Motion'.

Manik Lal Prasad, (Chief Councillor- ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 22 July, 2019
This Court finds strength in its interpretation of the sec- ond proviso to sub-section (4) of Section 25
of the Act of 2007 also from the fact that knowing fully well that under sub-section (4) power has
been conferred upon the Councillors to bring a requisition, the Legislatures imposed a ban that a No
Confi- dence Motion shall not be brought and thereafter, in the second proviso they use the word
'......no confidence motion shall not be brought again within one year of the first no confidence mo-
tion' meaning thereby that once a requisition results in conven- ing of a Special Meeting in which a
No Confidence Motion is moved / brought before the House, it has to be taken as first No
Confidence Motion and thereafter, the second No Confidence Motion cannot be brought within one
year from the date of bringing of the first No Confidence Motion.
This Court is of the opinion that if the Legislatures wanted to take a requisition itself as a No
Confidence Motion, there was no reason for them to choose a different word such as 'No Confidence
Motion' as they could have easily stated in the first and second proviso that a requisition shall not be
brought Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 against the Chief Councillor
/Deputy Chief Councillor again within one year of the first requisition. This is something what
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has attempted to argue before this Court.
A bare look at the provisions of sub-section 3 of Section 44 of the Act of 2006 would show that there
is some difference in the provisions of the Act of 2006 with that of the Act of 2007. By amending Act
15 of 2015 with effect from 01.01.2016 Clause (ii) of sub-section 3 of Section 44 of the Act of 2006
has been amended and by way of insertion a provision has been thereunder that a No Confidence
Motion may be brought only once in the whole tenure of Pramukh / Up Pra- mukh. Further it is
provided under Clause (iii) of sub-section 3 of Section 44 that No Confidence Motion against
Pramukh / Up Pramukh or both as the case may be shall not be brought during last six months of
the terms of the Panchayat Samiti as mentioned in Section 39 (i) of this Act. This Court has taken
note of the entire provisions of Section 44 of the Act of 2006 hereinabove.
In the context of the said provision, a learned co-ordi- nate Bench of this Court had occasion to
consider the earlier provision of Section 44 (3) (iii) as existing prior to it's deletion Patna High Court
CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 in the year 2016. There was a provision whereunder if the
mo- tion of No Confidence brought against the Pramukh or the Up Pramukh or both is once
rejected, no fresh motion of No Confi- dence against the Pramukh or the Up Pramukh or both as the
case may be could have been brought before the Panchayat Samiti within a period of one year from
the date of such requisi- tion of the motion.
In the context of the said provision, this Court in the case of Krishna Devi Vs. The State of Bihar and
Others (C.W.J.C. No. 15476 of 2010 disposed of on 28.09.2010) held that a mere withdrawal of
requisition cannot be taken as a rejec- tion and hence, there was no bar for the requisitionists to
send a fresh requisition for holding no confidence motion against the Pramukh.
In the present case, the Act of 2007 only states that a No Confidence Motion shall not be brought
again within one year of the first No Confidence Motion. It means the second No Con- fidence
Motion is bar within one year of the first No Confidence Motion whether rejected or otherwise
dropped. What is essential is that the No Confidence Motion have been moved. There may be a

situation where after the Special Meeting is fixed and the House assembles, the requisitionists place
the Motion, discuss Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 the same but then
decides to withdraw the No Confidence Mo- tion with the permission of the Chair. In the present
case, how- ever, situation is that even before convening of the Special Meeting the requisition itself
was withdrawn. Thus, there was no occasion to bring the No Confidence Motion before the House.
This Court agrees with the submission of learned coun- sel for respondent no. 6 that the Legislatures
have conferred a valuable right upon the Councillors to bring a 'No Confidence Motion'. If the
interpretation sought to be given by learned Se- nior Counsel for the petitioner is accepted then the
whole scheme of Section 25(4) shall get frustrated and any such inter- pretation would have a
tendency to do a mischief inasmuch as a Chief Councillor / Deputy Chief Councillor with support of
only 1/3rd of the total number of Councillors shall get a requisi- tion submitted immediately on the
next day of completion of 2 years period and then will get it withdrawn. Thereafter he will take a
plea that no requisition for a 'No Confidence Motion' may be brought.
This Court regrets it's inability to agree with the sub- missions of learned Senior Counsel that if his
interpretation is not accepted then sword of No Confidence Motion shall keep on Patna High Court
CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 hanging against a duly elected Chief Councillor /Deputy
Chief Councillor. This Court is of the view that unless a requisition for fixing a Special Meeting to
move No Confidence Motion re- sults in convening and holding of the Special Meeting it cannot be
said to be a 'No Confidence Motion' brought as envisaged under the second proviso to sub-section
(4) of Section 25 of the Act of 2007. The word 'brought again' as occurring in the sec- ond proviso is
a word of significance hence it must be given it's full meaning. Withdrawal of a requisition even
before it results in actual moving of the No Confidence Motion before the House cannot be said to be
a 'No Confidence Motion' brought. Rule 2(v) of the No Confidence Motion Process Rules, 2010 talks
of reading out the motion on which the Meeting has been called before the Members present and
declare it open for discussion.
A reading of the Rule further strengthen the view of this Court that a 'No Confidence Motion' takes
place and may be said to have been brought when it is placed in the Special meet- ing by reading out
the same before the members present. The Rule makes it obligatory to read out the Motion. In Rule
2(iv) it is provided that notice issued for considering No Confidence Motion against the Chief
Councillor/Deputy Chief Councilor shall clearly contain the reasons/allegations on which the No
Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019 dt.22-07-2019 Confidence Motion is to be brought
(emphasis supplied). The use of words 'to be brought' make it clear that up to this stage the 'No
Confidence Motion' cannot be said to have been brought.
In the light of the discussions made hereinabove, this Court is of the considered opinion that in the
present case, the withdrawal of requisition on 14.01.2019 cannot come in the way of respondent no.
6 and other six Ward Councillors to sub- mit another requisition which they decided to submit on
20.02.2019. The first requisition having been withdrawn even before convening much less holding
of the Special Meeting, it cannot be said that the same had culminated in the 'No Confi- dence
Motion' as envisaged under the second proviso to sub- section (4) of Section 35 of the Act, 2006.

In result, this Court finds no merit in the writ applica- tion. It is dismissed accordingly.
By virtue of the dismissal of the writ application now the effect of interim order dated 15.03.2019
would automati- cally come to an end. The result of the voting in the Special Meeting held on
18.03.2019 shall be declared forthwith and other consequences shall follow.
Before this Court parts with this judgment, it is required Patna High Court CWJC No.5258 of 2019
dt.22-07-2019 to be stated that after receipt of the requisition the kind of stand taken by the
Executive Officer, Nagar Panchayat, Khusrupur was not in accordance with law. She was required to
proceed as per law, instead she indulged in writing letters to the Principal Secretary and others as if
she was acting as their subordinates. The Executive Officer is a statutory authority under the Act of
2007 who has been conferred with certain powers, he/she must act independently and
dispassionately without wasting any time.
