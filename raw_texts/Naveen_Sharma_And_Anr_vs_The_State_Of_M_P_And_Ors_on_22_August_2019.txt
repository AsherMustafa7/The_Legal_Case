THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
Writ Petition No.4113/2005
(Naveen Sharma and another Vs. State of M.P. and others)
Gwalior, dated : 22.08.2019
Shri Pawan Kumar Dwivedi, learned counsel for the
petitioners.
Shri Rajkumar Mishra, learned Government Advocate for the
respondent/State.
The present petition has been filed by petitioners being crestfallen by the order dated 28.09.2019
passed by the Revenue Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh/respondent No.1 herein,
whereby the respondents No.4 to 6, who were allegedly placed below in the merit list of selection to
the post of Naib Tahsildar under the limited departmental examination have been given the benefit
of promotion leaving the petitioners aside.
2. Precisely stated facts of the case are that petitioners No.1 and were appointed on the post of
Assistant Grade III on 07.06.1995 and on 20.04.1993 respectively. It is pertinent to mention that the
State Government notified Madhya Pradesh Junior Administrative Service Recruitment Rules 1980
and in pursuance thereof, in year 2002, Madhya Pradesh Junior Prashashkiya Seva Se Sidhi Bharti
Dwara Naib-Tahsildar Ke Padon Ko Bharne Hetu Simit Pratiyogita Pariksha Sanchalan Niyam,
2002 were framed. The purpose of limited departmental examination was to give an opportunity to
the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Naveen Sharma and another Vs. State of M.P.
and others) ministerial cadre employees of revenue department, land record and settlement etc.,
who were otherwise eligible for appearing in the examination reflected in various provisions of
Rules of 1980 and Rules of 2002.
3. The advertisement for recruitment on the post of Naib Tahsildar through limited departmental
examination was issued on 13.11.2002 (Annexure P/4) and in pursuance thereof, examination held
on 29.12.2002. After examination by the Professional Examination Board, the merit list was issued
in which the person who scored 64.04 marks in the written examination out of total 100 marks, was
selected whereas according the petitioner No.2, he scored 64.60 marks over and above the marks
obtained by the respondents No.4 to 6.

4. Petitioners referred merit list attached by the respondents/State as Annexure R/1 to bring home
the submission that those persons who scored 64.04 marks (respondent No.5 herein) was selected
and if the marks of the petitioners especially petitioner No.2 would have been correctly assessed,
then petitioners were also qualified. Although the petitioner No.1 Naveen Sharma attained only
57.08 marks but the petitioner No.2 Mamun Khan THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
(Naveen Sharma and another Vs. State of M.P. and others) scored 64.60 marks in the written
examination. Beside written exam, respondents assessed the eligibility by way of taking into account
5 years Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) giving 20 marks to each year, totalling 100 marks.
Petitioner No.2 was awarded only 85 marks as confidential reports (CR marks) for the relevant
period (year 1996-97 to 2000-01), the mistakes allegedly committed by the respondents deliberately
to hampered the prospects of the petitioners for promotion, therefore, present petition has been
preferred.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners referred the rejoinder filed by him and to submit that in
written examination he scored 64.60 marks and confidential report ought to have been awarded him
100 marks instead of 85 marks and if his ACRs would have been properly assessed then his total
marks would have been 164.60 marks over and above respondents No.5 and 6 because respondent
No.5 scored 164 marks whereas respondent No.4 (Narendra Singh) scored 165.17 marks.
6. He referred the ACRs folder of the petitioner No.2 for the years 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99,
1999-2000, 2000-01, all 5 years of ACRs which were excellent as per the benchmark prescribed in
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Naveen Sharma and another Vs. State of M.P. and
others) the Scheduled V of Rules 1980. Outstanding or Very Good characters rolls fetches 20 marks.
Good remarks fetches 15 marks, whereas ordinary remarks carry 10 marks. Since the petitioners
received Very Good or Outstanding remarks through out in his ACRs for the relevant period
(1996-97 to 2000-01), therefore, his ACRs marks ought to be computed as 100 marks rather than 85
marks and authorities ignored this aspect and caused illegality.
7. He relied upon the fact that same mistake happened earlier and this Court in the bunch of
petitions bearing Writ Petition No.11836/2003 (Sharda Pathak Vs. State of M.P.) being the leading
case decided the controversy and respondents were directed to grant the relief to the then
petitioners. In pursuance to the said order, State Government vide its order dated 17.01.2008,
accepted the order and gave promotion to those persons who scored less because of wrong
reckoning of ACRs grading. He submits that his marks may be evaluated properly and he may be
permitted over and above the persons who ranked below him while granting promotion.
8. Learned Government Advocate opposed the prayer and through its return, tried to submit that on
the basis of marks obtained in written examination as well as last five years' THE HIGH COURT OF
MADHYA PRADESH (Naveen Sharma and another Vs. State of M.P. and others) performance,
select list was prepared, in which the petitioners were not found in merit, therefore, they were not
selected as cut of marks in the examination were 164.04 marks for man and 124.6 marks for women
and since the petitioners obtained less marks than the cut off marks therefore, petitioners were not
found selected, therefore, he prayed for dismissal of this petition.

9. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents appended thereto.
10. In the case in hand, most important aspect is to be seen that whether the petitioners were
eligible by acquiring requisite marks for promotion and they were ignored by the department.
11. Rules of 1980 has been framed to give chance to the clerical staff of the revenue department for
promotion, so that employees may have an incentive to perform better. Limited departmental
examination is devised to permit the clerical staffs of department of Revenue, Board of Renvue to
the post of Naib Tahsildar, which is an executive post. The said examination consists of two parts,
one is written exam and another is performance evaluation on the basis of ACRs' grading. Five years'
ACRs were distributed with 20 marks for each year, those totaling 100 marks for five years.
Similarly, THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Naveen Sharma and another Vs. State of
M.P. and others) written examination was also to be qualified by the parties and their respective
seniority had to be seen by taking marks obtained in examination alongwith five years of grading.
Method of grading has been prescribed in Scheduled V of Rules of 1980 in which, it has been
referred that each employee will be assigned marks out of total 20 marks for each years', character
roll on the following basis and the same is reproduced as under:-
9. So far as petitioner No.1 is concerned, he has not passed the benchmark and scored
147.08, therefore, he cannot get any relief in the present writ petition. Therefore,
petition so far as the petitioner No.1 Naveen Sharma is concerned, stands dismissed,
but so far as petitioner No.2 Mamun Khan is concerned, discussion is being made.
10. Perusal of the service folder of the petitioner No.2 obtained (under Right to
Information Act) reveals that in year 1997 (Service/Financial Year 1996-97)
petitioner received Outstanding A+ (awarded marks would be 20), in year 1998
(Service/Financial THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Naveen Sharma
and another Vs. State of M.P. and others) Year 1997-98) petitioner received
Outstanding A+ (awarded marks would be 20), in year 1999 (Service/Financial Year
1998-99) petitioner received Outstanding A+ (awarded marks would be 20), in year
2000 (Service/Financial Year 1999-2000) petitioner received Outstanding A+
(awarded marks would be 20) and in year 2001 (Service/Financial Year 2000-01)
petitioner received Outstanding A+ (awarded marks would be 20). If ACRs of these
years are seen in light of Rules of 1980, then it is established that the petitioner
obtained total 100 marks because in all these years, his ACRs were either
Outstanding/Excellent or Very Good, but certainly ACRs were of such Grading which
could have been fetched him 20 marks in each year.
11. If these marks would have been awarded objectively to the petitioner No.2, then
he would have received 100 marks and if these 100 marks would have been added in
64.60 marks which he obtained in written examination, then his total marks would
come to 164.60 marks and he would have stood over and above respondents No.5
and 6.

12. No argument has been advanced by the respondents to bring home the analogy
that the petitioners have concocted the documents THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH (Naveen Sharma and another Vs. State of M.P. and others) or have made
any misstatement. The ACRs folder of those years reveal the truth. Even the
Supervising Authorities in their appraisal affirmed the Grading of award of petitioner
No.2, therefore, it is the case of misinterpretation of grades of the petitioner No.2 or
perhaps the case of clerical mistake. Nevertheless, it is better late then never and
good performance of an employee and his forward marching (promotion, in the
present context) cannot lie at the mercy of casual approach or misinterpretation of
Grading. Even otherwise, valuable right of consideration for promotion was always
staring at the respondents and if the employee has performed better and is entitled
for promotion on all counts, then he cannot be discriminated or cannot be left out
without any valid reason.
13. In cumulative analysis, the petitioner No.2 was entitled to receive 100 marks for
Grading received in relevant 5 years and if it is added with the marks obtained in
written examination, then he was entitled to get promotion. Respondent erred in
ignoring this aspect and caused illegality. In reply, the respondents nowhere
submitted that ACRs from 1997 to 2001 were not the relevant ACRs. Even otherwise
examination was of year 2002, therefore, immediate preceding 5 years' ACRs as per
rules were required to be THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH (Naveen
Sharma and another Vs. State of M.P. and others) seen and Scheduled V of Clause
5(i) indicates that character rolls of last 5 years shall have to be appraised.
14. In the considered opinion of this Court, petitioner No.2 proved his case and
resultantly, petition is allowed so far as petitioner No.2 namely Mamun Khan is
concerned and respondents are directed to consider the case of the petitioner No.2
for promotion to the post of Naib-Tahsildar within two months from the date of
receipt of certified copy of this order, if the petitioner No.2 is otherwise eligible and
after considering the case of the petitioner No.2, if he would be found fit, he shall be
promoted to the post of Naib-Tahsildar and his seniority shall be placed over and
above respondents No.5 and 6. It is made clear that his seniority shall be reckoned
from the date when others have been promoted i.e. 28.09.2004 and this seniority
shall be counted for pensionary and other consequential benefits, but petitioner shall
not be entitled for arrears of salary on the basis of "No Work No Pay".
15. Petition stands partly allowed (in respect of petitioner No.2) and disposed of in
above terms.
