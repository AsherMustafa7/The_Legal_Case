COMMON ORDER
1.1 Petitioners in this batch of cases impugn the decision of the police to history-sheet them, though
the reliefs sought in the petitions are couched differently. They are an oft frequented category of
cases that visits this Court, and they rarely show any respite, despite a few http://www.judis.nic.in
WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases template judgments, (to which necessary reference
would be made at appropriate places) of this court on the point. The pith of the ratio in these
judgements primarily emphasizes that the decision to history-sheet a convict or a suspect should not
be arbitrarily resorted to. The principles they have laid down are informative study material for
guiding and educating the police in their approach to history-sheeting. Contextually, are not the
pronouncements of this Court adequate enough to sensitize the police officials on the manner of
exercise of their power to history-sheet an individual? The experience however, has been
disappointing, as the attitude of the police official to history-sheeting is seen varying from plain
ignorance to abject indifference in following the principles laid down. 1.2 Litigation-avoidance is
critical for eliminating the clogs that chokes the Court system, and its thematic significance and
contemporary relevance to our legal system cannot be ignored. One of the contributory factors that
diminishes the efficacy of the Courts to render justice in time is attributable to diverting the scarce
judicial time to address identical or similar causes repeatedly. Does it not reflect that Courts are
used with an inadequate sense of responsibility?
1.3 Any discourse on speedy justice invariably focuses on the exit points to the legal system, on the
disposal of cases, and there has been inadequate discussion on the nature of cases that
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases enter the system at its entry
points. Here lies the scope for litigation-avoidance. The importance of avoiding a litigation that can
be avoided cannot be over emphasized since it clogs and obstructs the free outflow of cases, and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 3
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
contributes to what has come to described as 'docket explosion'. Nothing explodes where there is a
responsibility to avoid it. A serious attempt is therefore made to ensure that the police officials are
sensitized in order the inflow of a particular category of cases is reduced.
2. This judgement is arranged in four parts: Part I deals with facts narration, or pleading of the
parties. Part II concerns with the arguments advanced. In Part III, this Court discusses the issues
and attempts to provide certain parameters that may minimize the arbitrariness. In Part IV the
conclusions/decision of this Court is made known. PART I - PLEADINGS:

PART II - THE ARGUMENTS
4. History Sheeting is a permitted means of achieving crime-prevention and in this State under the
provisions of the Police Standing Orders (henceforth the PSO) While there was a general agreement
among the counsel for the petitioners on the general utility of surveillance- policing, there was an
equal unanimity among them in describing surveillance http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040
of 2018 & etc. batch cases through history-sheeting as a crude and primitive policing tool, developed
during the days of colonial control, antiquated both in terms of time and technology. Mr. Henry
Tiphagne, the counsel for the petitioner in W.P(MD)7546/2019, also added that the PSO freely uses
expressions like 'Known Depredators' of law (KD), or 'Rowdies', when no penal law has prescribed
powers for any branding-exercise. Either one is convicted of committing an offence, or not
convicted. Still, if looked through the lens that the provisions of the PSO, they seem alike to the
policemen. It was outlined that history-sheeting through the PSO, conceals an issue of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 17
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
constitutionality that has managed to outmaneuver during forensic scrutiny undertaken earlier.
Though the constitutionality of the PSO itself was not pointedly raised, still this court was alerted to
examine it.
5. It was argued that if the history-sheeting through PSO is considered as a procedure established
within the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution, at the operational level the PSO leaves
enormous space for its arbitrary exercise, which the police officials exploit unfailingly. The only
provision in the PSO in which both the criterion for history sheeting and the duration for which it
would be in operation has been spelt with a degree of definiteness is PSO 747. In terms of PSO 747,
when once a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for the commission of certain
specific offences, a history sheet would be opened automatically against him, and it will be in force
during the term of the http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
sentence plus two years thereafter. This clarity and certainty is unavailable in providing the criterion
either for retaining a history sheeter as such as in PSO 748, or in opening a history sheet for suspects
and rowdies as in PSO 749. It was further argued:
● It could be gathered from PSO 748(2), a history sheet once opened can be in force
only for two years, and beyond that it can be annually extended on the orders of a
police official of a specified rank, on an objective appraisal of the materials gathered
against a history-sheeter. Notwithstanding the insistence of this Court that the police
officials shall be objective in their approach, and its condemnation that they shall not
arbitrarily deal with the fundamental rights of the citizens in several of its
judgements, most of which are catalogued and relied on in Sabari alias Sabarigiri Vs.
The Assistant Commissioner of Police, Annanagar (L & O), Madurai City [2018-2 LW
(Crl) 817], with primary thrust on the Order of this Court in Ganesan Vs. The District
Superintendent of Police & others [2010(6)CTC 507], the police personnel remain
what they have always been – without realizing a need for change.
● Under PSO 749(1) a history sheet can be opened for Suspects, but it presumes every person who is
convicted even once for any offence under the IPC as a suspect. Therefore, even if one is not history
sheeted under PSO 747, still he can be history sheeted as a suspect. And being a suspect, it can be
opened at any time of the policemen's choice. The second situations is that even without any
conviction, he can http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases still be
considered a suspect and can be believed to be addicted to crime. This is paradoxical since it
produces the same consequence which results from a conviction. The judgements hither to delivered
by this Court do not deal with the situations where both convicts and non-convicts are treated alike.
This goes against the justification for history sheeting a person, and consequently violates the
equality doctrine under Article 14 of the Constitution.
● History sheets are regularly opened even where cases are registered in connection with political
demonstration. Right to express a dissent, right to protest and right to be part of any demonstration
are integral to the democratic rights of the citizens, and resorting to history-sheeting therefore, is an
indignation to our Constitutionalism, since history sheeting can be justified only for prevention of a
crime and not for throttling the fundamental rights of the citizens to voice their protest. ● In
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 18
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
Ganesan Vs. The District Superintendent of Police & Others [2010(6)CTC 507], this Court has held
that an isolated act of commission of crime cannot be characterized as a habitual act or commission
involving breach of peace or law and order. However, a history-sheeter is still considered as a
habitual offender with more than one case, even (cid:131) When the FIR is closed as a mistake of fact and
further investigation is http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
dropped;
(cid:131) Where the investigation is not completed and final report is not laid within the period of limitation
provided in Sec.468 Cr.P.C.; (cid:131) Where the trial is pending for considerable number of years for no
fault of the history-sheeter;
(cid:131) After the Court has acquitted the history-sheeter.
In each of the cases, a history sheet once opened is kept alive for beyond the two years period
stipulated in PSO 748(1) ignoring the principles laid down by this Court.
● Registering a case for the purposes of Sec.109 Cr.P.C. and 110 Cr.P.C. continues to enable the
police to open a Rowdy Sheet under PSO 749(2), notwithstanding the deprecation of this practice by
this court in Sabari case [2018-2-LW 817]. ● What is not adequately appreciated is that
history-sheeting leaves civil consequences in that it becomes a barrier for obtaining anything from a
passport to securing an employment. For instance, in W.P.(MD)7546/2019 and
W.P.(MD)25185/2018, the petitioners are not in a position to enroll themselves as Advocates. In
fact, in both these cases the petitioners have participated in political demonstrations or have showed
their protest in social causes, and despite that their career and their right to http://www.judis.nic.in
WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases dignified life which their career would support, are
largely impaired by the concerned police to retain their names in the History sheet. And, worse, in
the case of the petitioner in W.P.(MD)7546/2019, the concerned police official Vide his report dated
06-01-2017 has recommended closing the history sheet opened against the petitioner, still he is
retained in the history sheet. What has become a casualty is the need for objectivity and
non-arbitrariness that the Courts have been tirelessly advocating. This petitioner in particular seeks
Rs.1,00,000/- as damages for the denial of his right to engage in an avocation of his choice.
● That even if one is history- sheeted at a certain point of time in the past, but was removed from the
same subsequently, and if he were to be included in the Register of History-Sheeter at a later point
of time, the original folio is opened as if he has been a history sheeter continuously since the time he
was first history sheeted. For instance, if one is assigned a history-sheeter number as H.S abc/1995,
no matter even if his name is removed from the history-sheet at some point of time, and thereafter
re- opened again at a later point of time, he will continue to be assigned the same H.S. abc/1995.
This leaves a psychological repercussion as it leaves an easy possibility for an adverse assessment as
if a person has been a history sheeter continuously since the date the history sheet was opened.

6. Given the nature of the arguments advanced, this Court appointed Thiru. V.Kathirvel, Senior
Advocate, as an amicus curiae to assist it. It also impleaded the Director of General of Police in
W.P.(MD)7546/2019. It then required the respondent to nominate any serving/retired police official
to assist the Court to enable it to harmonize any apparent space for arbitrariness in the PSO. None
however, was nominated.
7. In response, the learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) argued that the police personnel
who are entrusted with the power to history sheet have been meticulous in their assessment of the
characters against who they open the history sheet, and that they scrupulously follow Chapter XLII
of the PSO, besides PSO 367 and 368 (relating to Beats and Patrols) in Chapter XXI.

8. The learned Amicus curiae on his part has stated the law that this Court has declared in various
authorities. This court records its appreciation for his efforts. PART III THE DISCUSSION
9. The tone and tenor of the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners does not impugn
the Constitutionality of the entire Chapter XLII of the PSO which provides for the opening, closing,
or retention of a history sheet, or any other related provision specifically. They were more focused
on spotlighting the amorphousness of certain specific provisions in the PSO which encourage
short-circuiting the fairness and objectivity required in history sheeting a person. And, where
arbitrariness in administrative action does not find its correctives from within the principles settled
by the judgements of this Court, what steps in for justice is essentially an avoidable litigation,
something which those who had exercised the power to history sheet always had the opportunity to
avoid. How then to sensitize the police men in their approach to history-sheeting and to prevent an
avoidable litigation in that pursuit?
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
(a) History-Sheet: An Over view:
10.1 History-sheeting falls under the category of surveillance-policing, and it may have to be granted
its place for effective policing. To appreciate it, a distinction is required to be drawn between an
individual's right to dignified life, and the society's right to peaceful existence. It shall not be ignored
that at all times societal peace walks under the shadow of its opposite forces that threaten to defeat
it. Policing is all about securing the right to peaceful existence from these opposing forces. This
battle has been continuous in every society, since the possibility of a perfect society cannot be
considered either as a preferable hypothesis, or as a theoretical possibility, and consequently,
policing cannot rest in presuming a certain ideal. Given the tools that the police force currently has
for crime- prevention through preventive policing, significance of history-sheeting cannot be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 20
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
ignored. 10.2 The voices that decry history-sheeting as a legacy of the imperialism and opposed to
Constitutionalism, presume an ideal and the universal innocence of all. But policing is not about
believing in an ideal, and is about presuming its opposite. It is intended to protect those who seek
security for their lives under the Constitution from those who make their peaceful journey difficult.
Crime is not a choice that law offers, but is one that an individual makes, and hence preventive
policing (that which intends to prevent crime) through history- sheeting is not just commonsensical,
but also is Constitutionally relevant. http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch
cases
11. One of the first cases in surveillance policing was Kharak Singh vs The State of U. P. & Others
[AIR 1963 SC 1295 = 1964 SCR (1) 332]. Kharak Singh was arraigned in a case of dacoity in 1941.
However, he was released under Sec. 169, Cr.P.C., 1898 as there was no evidence against him. On
the basis of the accusation made against him, the police have opened a "history sheet" against him.
Therefore, he challenged the constitutional validity of Chapter XX of the U. P. Police Regulations as
violative of his right under Arts. 19(1)(d) and 21 of the Constitution of India. The Constitution Bench
struck down Regulation 236 (b) thereof on the ground that these regulations (contained in Chapter
XX therein) do not have statutory force, and that they are not relatable to Sec. 12 of the Indian
Police Act. It is noteworthy to mention that the entire Regulation was struck down by His Lordship
K. Subba Rao J. In his dissent, Justice K.Subba Rao declared his view as below:
“It is true our Constitution does not expressly declare a right to privacy as a
fundamental right, but the said right is an essential ingredient of personal liberty.
Every democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to give him rest,
physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In the last resort, a person's house,
where lie lives with his family, is his "castle" : it is his rampart against encroachment
on his personal liberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter J., in
Wolf v. Colorado, pointing out the importance of the security of one's privacy against
arbitrary intrusion by the police, could have no less application to an Indian home as
to an American one. If physical restraints on a person's movements affect his
personal liberty, physical encroachments on his private life would affect it in a larger
degree. Indeed, nothing is more deleterious to a man's physical happiness and health
than a calculated http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch
cases interference with his privacy. We would, therefore, define the right of personal
liberty in Art. 21 as a right of an individual to be free from restrictions or
encroachments on his person, whether those restrictions or encroachments are
directly imposed or indirectly brought about by calculated measures. If so
understood, all the acts of surveillance under, Regulation 236 infringe the
fundamental right of the petitioner under Art. 21 of the Constitution.” The majority
judgement in Kharak Singh case which held that the right to privacy is not protected
by the Constitution and this was overruled by a larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court Vide paragraph 652.2 in K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr Vs Union of India, [(2017)
10 SCC 1] and proceeded to approve the dissenting judgment of K.Subba Rao J., on
right to privacy.

Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
12. In Malak Singh Vs State of Punjab & Haryana & Others [AIR 1981 SC 760], the question which
engaged the Hon'ble Supreme Court was, if including the name of the petitioners in the Surveillance
Register maintained under the Punjab Police Rules affects their fundamental right under Article 21.
The issue was addressed as below:
“6. Prevention of crime is one of the prime purposes of the Constitution of a police
force. The preamble to the Police Act 1861 says:
“Whereas it is expedient to recognize the police to make it a more efficient
instrument for the prevention and detection of crime.” Section 23 of the Police Act
prescribes it as a duty of police officers “to collect and http://www.judis.nic.in
WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases communicate intelligence affecting the
public peace, to prevent the commission of offences and public nuisances”. In
connection with these duties it will be necessary to keep discreet surveillance over
reputed bad characters, habitual offenders and other potential offenders. Organised
crime cannot be successfully fought without close watch of suspects. But, surveillance
may be intrusive and it may so seriously encroach on the privacy of a citizen as to
infringe his fundamental right to personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution and freedom of movement guaranteed under Article 19(1)(d). That
cannot be permitted. This is recognised by the Punjab Police Rules themselves. Rule
23.7, which prescribes the mode of surveillance, permits the close watch over the
movements of the person under surveillance but without any illegal interference.
Permissible surveillance is only to the extent of a close watch over the movements of
the person under surveillance but without any illegal interference. Permissible
surveillance is only to the extent of close watch over the movements of the person
under surveillance and no more. So long as surveillance is for the purpose of
preventing crime and is confined to the limits prescribed by Rule,, we do not think a
person whose name is included in the surveillance Register can have a genuine
complaint......
7. As we said discreet surveillance of suspects, habitual and potential offenders, may
be necessary and so the maintenance of history sheet and surveillance register may
be necessary too, for the purpose of prevention of crime. History sheets and
surveillance Registers have to be and are confidential documents. Neither the person
whose name is entered in the register nor any other member of the public can have
access to the surveillance register. The nature and character of the function involved
in the making of an entry in the surveillance register is so utterly administrative and
non-judicial. ”(emphasis supplied) The above passage instantly brings to fore that (a)
maintenance of History sheet etc., is aims http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040
of 2018 & etc. batch cases at prevention of crime, and that it should not be
maintained beyond the point which is essential, lest it would invade the fundamental
rights of all those who are history sheeted.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 22
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
(b) That history-sheeting is only an administrative action and not a judicial action. See also S.
Jothilingam and others Vs. The State, represented by the Deputy Superintendent of Police & Others
[1995(1) MWN (Cr.) 165 : 1995 SCC Online Madras 190], N. George & another Vs.
V.R.Krishnaswami [1991(1) MWN (Cr.) 44], In Pandurangan Vs. State by Inspector of Police,
Thirukkazhukundram [1987 LW (Cr.) 400], where this Court has held that the PSO are no more
than a set of administrative instructions for internal use of the police and for policing.
13. The need for effective policing (through history-sheeting), and, the arbitrary and malafide
exercise of police power in history-sheeting (an individual), are conceptually different. Having
stated that history-sheeting has the potential to imperil the fundamental right of the person
history-sheeted under Article 21, then in terms of Article 21, any limitation on the right to life could
be attempted only as per the 'procedure established by law'. This court, being adorned with the duty
of being a Constitutional sentinel, has to balance between the right of an individual to his
fundamental rights as against the interests of the society in maintaining law and order through
effective preventive policing. In Menaka Gandhi Vs. Union of India [AIR 1978 SC 597], the Supreme
Court has telescoped http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
procedural due process into the phrase 'procedure established by law' to mean that such procedure
which the law prescribes must be a fair procedure. This would now signify that the power to surveil a
citizen can be done only by a fair procedure established by law, history-sheeting included.
14. If prevention of crime is the central theme that provides a justification for history- sheeting, and
if the decision to history sheet is only an administrative action, it then follows that whenever an
administrative action forsakes fairness and ignores objectivity, arbitrariness invites itself to hold the
action in contempt of the Constitutional doctrine of equality. Conversely, every action that violates
the fundamental rights cherished under Part III of the Constitution, proprio vigore will be arbitrary.
15.1(a) Can, therefore, a set of non-statutory administrative instructions such as the Police Standing
Order be termed as law, for satisfying the requirement of a 'procedure established by law' in Article
21, merely because Article 13(3) of the Constitution defines law to include “Ordinance, order,
bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of
law?” Here it needs to be noted that 'law' in Article 13 is set to a specific context where it makes a
declaratory statement that “the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridge the rights
conferred by” Part III. And, to enable an http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc.
batch cases understanding of what this law is, Article 13(3) has provided an inclusive definition, and
hence wide and expansive. (Even this was not free from debate, as for instance, whether uncodified
personal law can be considered law for the purpose of Article 13 has been seriously debated and
variously decided. Those however, are beyond the scope of the present litigations).
15.1(b) Having made this declaration in Article 13, the Constitution itself proceeds to enable the
State to make provision for providing exceptions to, or for limiting the exercise of the Fundamental
Rights such as in Articles 15, 16, 19(2) to 19(6), 21, 22(7), 25(2). It now requires to be understood if a
non-statutory circular, or a non-statutory Order will fall within the definition of law in Article 13(3)
(which will be relevant when they are tested for their constitutionality as being inconsistent with, or
abridging any of the rights in Part III), and by the same stroke will they become law to enable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 23
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
limiting, or carving an exception to, the Fundamental Rights under Part III (for which the
Constitution itself has made provisions) ? 15.2 The difference is well brought out in Union of India
Vs. Naveen Jindal & another [(2004) 2 SCC 510]. The issue before the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
about the citizen's right to fly a National Flag, and to understand if it is a part of citizen's
fundamental right? The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is part of citizen's fundamental right
under Article http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases 19(1)(a). One
ancillary issue which the Court was required to address is on the legal character of the Flag Code,
2002, under which few restrictions are imposed on the right of the citizen to fly his national flag.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Flag Code is only an Executive instruction of the
Government of India, and proceeded to declare that, “the Flag Code although is not a law within the
meaning of Article 13(3) (a) of the Constitution of India for the purpose of clause (2) of Article 19
thereof, it would not restrictively regulate the free exercise of the right of flying the national Flag .”

2262], where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a statutory rule which is constitutionally
invalid cannot be validated with the support of executive instructions. Though it is on a slightly
different footing, it highlights the ineffectiveness of Executive Instructions when they deal with the
Fundamental rights of the citizens. 15.3 It is now possible to deduce logically, that the Police
Standing Order, inasmuch as they embody a set of administrative instructions, to the extent it either
supports the preservation of any of the fundamental rights of the citizens, or operates in a neutral
zone, it may be granted a place in the Constitutional scheme. However, when it comes to limiting the
right to life under Article 21, its place within the phrase “procedure established by law”, appears
suspect. This may now mean that the State has to review the very process by which

history-sheet a citizen and it has to make the whole power and the process statutory.
16.1 It would be pertinent to recall the words of John Locke in his work Second Treatise on Civil
Government. The starts with Chapter IV titled “of Slavery” with the following words :
“The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to
be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for
his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but
that established, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any
will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the
trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A.
55. a liberty for everyone to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied
by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live
by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in
it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not
to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as
freedom of nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.
16.2 In a society that we live in, it is essential to balance the duty of the State to
maintain the law and order, and the interest of an individual’s right to be left alone.

http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases To strip the police of its power
to history-sheet with no reaction time will have greater ramification on the crime-prevention that
concerns the larger public interest. It may lead to a judiciary-engineered imbalance between right of
the public and the individual right of the citizens. Hence, there is a felt need to retain police power to
history sheet under the PSO as a transient arrangement.
(b) The PSO, History sheeting & Arbitrary space:
17.1 Where lies the fountain head of arbitrary exercise of the power to history-sheet?
History-sheeting essentially revolves around four provisions in Chapter XLII of the Police Standing
Order: PSO 746, 747, 748 and 749. They are reproduced:
PSO No. Contents
746. History Sheets Part V (Form No.111) shall contain the History Sheets of the persons resident
permanently or temporarily in their Station limits who are known or believed to be addicted to or to

receivers.
(G.O.Ms.No.364, Home, 15th Feb. 1943) Only sheets Nos.1,3,7 and 8 are to be maintained in the
History Sheet forms in use in Station. Sheet No.9 should also be maintained, if a photograph of the
criminal is available. Note : This sub-paragraph will not effect the History Sheets maintained in
Crime Records Bureau.
At the back of sheet No.1, below item 7, the following descriptive details should be shown:
Age, Height, Complexion and Particular marks of identification.

informative and useful based on the facts ascertained both by the Sub-Inspector and
his men since the date of last entry, shall be made month-wise for close watch bad
characters and quarterly for non- close watch bad characters. Anything of interest
coming to notice, in respect of a bad character during a month should be entered
then and there, without waiting for the end of the month of the quarter.
The entries in the various columns in the History Sheet should be checked by the
Sub-Inspector personally and brought upto-date once a year. The fact of such
verification should be certified by him in the column under the “Current-doings”.

(5) Inspectors and Divisional Officers when they visit the area should make their own independent
enquiries and not their findings in the History Sheets andn in inspection Reports, if any.
(6) All reports against notorious rowdies entered in the General Diary of the Station or matter
brought to light on enquiries in the petitions should be entered against them in the personal sheets
and should be dated.
(7) Rowdies are often employed for committing breaches of peace and of intimidating opponents in
times of political or communal tension. Inspectors of Police should take effective and timely action
to control their activities. The active ones among these should be dealt with appropriately under
Section 110 (a) and (f) of the Criminal Procedure Code or under Section 160 I.P.C or under Section
75 of the Madras City Police Act and Section 106 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
(8) Besides registered rowdies for whom separate sheets are maintained there are a set of anti-social
elements in every sheet and village who intimidate the local people and exploit them for their selfish
ends. They are often believed to be keeping brothel houses clandestinely for promoting prohibition
or offences under the Gaming Act. Sometimes they have political backing also. The activities of these
persons also require vigilant watch and check. For this purpose a register in Form No.112 shall be
maintained in all Police Stations. The categories of persons which should be entered into the
registers are :
(a) All persons for whom rowdy sheets are maintained under Order No.747.
(b)(i) Anti-social elements who intimidate people and exploit them for selfish ends,
or actively promote communal disharmony.
(ii) Persons believed to be keeping brothels or opium dens or promoting offences
under the Gaming Act.
(c) Persons bound over under Section 110(e) and (f) Criminal Procedure Code.
(d) Persons convicted under Section 294, I.P.C.
(e) Known drunkards.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases 17.2 The schematic analysis of
the Police Standing Order informs that history sheeting, at one level is the consequence of a penalty
– slapped during the term of conviction, and at another level, can visit those who are perceived to
exhibit a propensity for committing a crime after their term of sentence, and also includes those who
are believed to be addicted to crime, or habitually commit, or attempt to commit, or abet the
commission of offenses involving a breach of peace. The Order of this Court in Ganesan's case and
few other decisions, elaborate these provisions and the zone of their application, and they may be
beneficially referred to.

Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
18. Even a cursory glance of these provisions would instantly inform that the history- sheeting under
PSO 747 is relatively least troublesome, as the parameter it provides is straight forward:
A conviction by a Court for certain specified offenses. The provision itself is titled
'Automatic Opening of History Sheets', as it makes history-sheeting, a concomitant
fallout of a conviction.
In terms of PSO 747, a convict alone will be history-sheeted, and will remain a
history-sheeter during the term of his sentence plus two years. A citizen's right is
protected here, since the sine qua non for history-sheeting is a judgment of a Court.
This is akin to the National Registry of sexual offenders brought about under the
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2018. It has a legislative base with a judicial verdict as
its backing.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
(c) Definitional Uncertainty and Arbitrariness:
19. The instances, where the PSO fails to provide an objective criterion (in contrast to what is
provided for automatic-history-sheeting) are:
● History-sheeting a Suspect in terms of PSO 749. Under PSO 749(1)(a), a person
once convicted is presumed to be a suspect at all times; and, under PSO749(1)(b) a
non-
convict is equated to a convict. Both PSO 749(1) and (2) uses expressions like
'believed to be addicted to', or 'habitual' in its reference to commission of a crime that
leaves interpretative challenges.
● Where a history-sheeter is sought to be retained as a history sheeter under PSO
748(2) even after the expiry of two years after the term of sentence (as provided in
PSO 747) based on what is known as 'record of current-doings”, as explained in PSO
746(3).
20. A provision that enables the policeman to presume that every convict shall be 'considered to be
likely to commit a crime' is more an effort to amuse the spirit of Constitutionalism. This will be so,
even if the PSO were presumed to have a statutory status. The effect it instantly produces is that it
renders the reformation theory (the relevance of which the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, read
along with Sec.360 Cr.P.C. signify) which our criminal justice jurisprudence has not abandoned,
instantly meaningless.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 29
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
21. Due to want of a definitional objectivity, PSO 749(1)(b) provides an unwitting opportunity to the
police official to believe that, 'once an offender is always an offender'. There cannot be a greater
instance of arbitrary discrimination and insult to the Constitution than to prescribe a presumption
that a former convict is an eternal suspect. Preventive policing cannot extend to the extent of
treating the entire society as suspects, and hence it ought to filter those who are prone to commit a
crime from the rest on an objective criterion for a special-watch through history-sheeting. If the
need for involvement of a person in a crime after his initial conviction is eliminated from the line of
consideration, that is to mean, if a person is not convicted or where not even a FIR is registered
subsequent to his earlier conviction, it is difficult to conceive how a person is known to commit a
crime, or believes to have committed a crime, or considered likely to commit a crime. Shockingly,
PSO 749(1)
(b) does not even make pendency of a FIR a criterion or the least common requirement for history
sheeting for identifying a suspect.
22. Here it is necessary to bring in PSO 746 which is the opening provision of the Chapter on
History-Sheeting. PSO 746 is more of a general provision, with PSO 747 to 749 addressing specific
aspects of History-sheeting. PSO 746 (1) is reproduced again: 'Part V (Form No.111) shall contain the
History sheet of the persons resident permanently or http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of
2018 & etc. batch cases temporarily in their station limits who are known or believed to be addicted
to, or to aid and abet the commission of crime, whether convicted or not, or who are believed to be
habitual receivers.” The phrasal expressions like known or believe to be, considered likely, are but
adjectival phrases that go to qualify an act involving a commission of a crime, or abetting its
commission, or disturbing public peace in relation to which the PSO uses these expressions. What is
significant here is not the qualifying or the adjectival expressions, but the conduct involving
commission of crime or its abetment. In Ganesan's case this Court has held:
“51.....Belief, in the case on hand, means a degree of conviction of the truth something
especially based on a consideration or examination of evidence and authorities vested
with the discretion of opening and retaining history sheets should prove that on the
examination of the data that there is awareness on their part indicating their state of
mind that by probable reasoning, they come to a conclusion or infer, about the
conduct of person, for whom a history sheet is opened or retained..”
23. If a person were to be considered as one addicted to crime, then there should be more than one
FIR, for a single FIR cannot merit a classification as an addiction. The word addiction in PSO
749(1)(b), necessarily has to carry the same meaning as given to the expression 'habitually commit'
in PSO 749(2)(a), as given by this Court in Ganesan case [2010(6)CTC 507] where it said: “..An
isolated act or commission cannot be characterized as a habitual act...”. http://www.judis.nic.in
WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases 24.1 The next provision with inadequate definitional
clarity and objectivity can be found in PSO 748(2), which provides for retention of a history sheeter
in the history sheet. This is done on the basis of what the PSO refers to as 'current doings'. What this
term 'current doings' signifies is known from PSO 746(3). It reads:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 30
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
“In sheet 8 under the heading “Current doings” entries which are informative and
useful based on the facts ascertained both by the Sub- Inspector and his men since
the date of last entry, shall be made month-wise for close watch bad characters and
quarterly for non-close watch bad characters. Anything of interest coming to notice in
respect of a bad character during a month should be entered then and there, without
waiting for the end of the month or the quarter”.
The underscored expressions are: (i) facts ascertained; (ii) bad characters; and (iii)
anything of interest. The PSO generously uses these terms at several places such as in
PSO 366, 367 in chapter XXI, PSO 752, 754.
24.2 Who then, is a bad character? How to identify a person as a 'bad character? Is he
a person with a FIR pending against him but without a conviction, or should he be
one addicted to a crime as in PSO 749(1)(b), or, should be an habitual offender as in
PSO 749(2)
(a)? If he is a convict, then he may fall under PSO 749 (1)(a), but can he be continued
to be http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases believed
as a bad character after the expiry of the term of sentence plus two years under PSO
747, or in other cases for two years as provided in PSO 748(1)? In our criminal
jurisprudence, normally, where the statute has not stipulated otherwise, an accused
is presumed to be innocent even where a FIR is registered, how then to identify one
as a bad character for retaining him in the history sheet and support any such
retention? Secondly, what can be 'of interest' to the policeman? Can it be anything
except a conduct constituting a crime? Interestingly under PSO 367 which provides
for village beats and patrols, except for habitual offenders, for other categories of bad
characters there should not be any domiciliary visits. This would imply that all
habitual offenders are bad characters, but not all bad characters are habitual
offenders. What are the yardsticks to make that intelligent distinction within the
scheme of PSO? None. How then to position a suspect within the meaning of PSO
749(1)(b)?
24.3 There is another situation. Given the possibility that a person can be bad character without a
FIR, what is likely to happen, if it is not already happening, is to gather information about the
involvement of one in the commission of a cognizable offence, treat him not as an accused (which
during investigation is same as Suspect), but as a bad character for the purpose of history sheeting.
This is possible within the scheme of PSO, though it is impermissible.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases 24.4 It will be atrociously
outrageous to authorize a police personnel to be judgmental without basis, and to damnify one as a
bad character. Therefore, the phrase 'bad character' as found in PSO 746(3) has to be understood
only as Suspects or Rowdies within the meaning of PSO 749, which would now require that there
ought to be at least few FIRs filed against the person.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 31
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
(d) Of addicted and Habitual Offenders 25.1 The expression 'habitual' gains significance in the
context of Rowdy-sheeting a person under PSO 749(2)(a). The understanding of this expression by
this Court in Ganesan's case has already been referred to in one of the earlier paragraphs. And, this
need for a judicial understanding was necessitated due to want of a definition for the expression
'habitual' in the PSO. The word 'habitual' is used to qualify a person committing a crime and
attempting to commit a crime – That is to mean, a habitual offender. Now, it is necessary to
introduce here the Tamil Nadu Restriction of habitual Offenders Act, 1948 (henceforth Habitual
Offenders Act). Sec.2 (4) thereof defines a habitual offender:
“A habitual Offender means a person who, before or after the commencement of this
Act, has been sentenced to a substantive term of imprisonment, such sentence not
having been set aside in appeal or revision, on not less than three occasions, (Inserted
by section 22of the Tamil Nadu Restriction of Habitual Offenders (Amendment) Act,
1975 http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases (Tamil
Nadu Act 55 of 1975) [for any one or more of the scheduled offences] each of the
subsequent sentences having been passed in respect of an offence committed after
die passing of the sentence on the previous occasion;
Explanation " The passing of an order requiring a person to give security for good
behaviour with reference to section 110 of (Substituted by Tamil Nadu Adaptation
Oder 1950) [the Code of Criminal procedure, 1973] (Central Act 2 of 1974) shall be
deemed to amount to the passing of a sentence of substantive imprisonment within
the meaning of this clause.” It needs to be noted here that the expression 'habitual
offender' is narrowly defined in that Sec.2(4), as the provision uses the word 'means',
and not means and includes'. A statute which has penal or quasi penal consequences
or that leaves serious civil consequences or limits the fundamental right to dignified
life has to be read strictly.
25.2 Where a statutory definition is available to define a habitual offender, a body of
administrative instructions in the PSO cannot have a definition different from the
one which the statute provides. The Executive is bound by the definition laid down by
the legislature.
Accordingly, the expression 'habitually' as found in PSO(2)(a) for qualifying a commission of, or an
attempt to commit an offence has to be given the same meaning provided for an habitual offender
under Sec.2(4) of the Habitual Offenders Act. The justification can be further elaborated. If Sec.3 of
the Habitual Offenders Act is turned to, it reads:
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases “Power of
Government to notify habitual offenders- (1) The Government may, by notification, if
they are satisfied that any person is a habitual offender declare that he shall be
subject to the provisions of this Act to such extent and subject to such restrictions, if
any, as may be specified in the Notification.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 32
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
(2) Every notification issued under sub-section (1) shall be in force for a period of five
years from the date of the publication of such notification, but the Government may,
by notification, at any time before the expiry of the said period, cancel or modify any
notification issued under sub-
section (1).
(3) The cancellation of a notification or the expiry of the period of five years, under sub-section (2)
shall not be deemed to affect the power of the Government under sub-section (1) to issue a
notification in respect of a habitual offender as often as he is sentenced to a substantive term of
imprisonment such sentence not having been set aside in appeal or revision, for any one or more of
the scheduled offences at any time after such cancellation or expiry.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where a notified offender is sentenced to
a substantive term of imprisonment, such sentence not having been set aside in appeal or revision,
for any one or more of the schedule offences, the Government may direct that the notification issued
under sub-section (1) in respect of such notified offender shall be in force for a further period of five
years from the date of his release from such imprisonment.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases (5) Before any notification is
issued in respect of any person under sub-
section (1) or modified to his disadvantage under sub-section (2), or before any direction is issued in
respect of any notified offender under sub-section (4), a reasonable opportunity shall be given to
him to show cause against such issue, modification or direction, as the case may be.”
26. In terms of the above provision, a habitual offender is one who has undergone at least three
substantial sentences of imprisonment, and notified by the Government, and significantly only after
granting the one to be affected by the decision a right of hearing. In terms of the PSO no right of
pre-hearing is contemplated while Rowdy-sheeting a person as an habitual offender, whereas the
Habitual Offenders Act makes the process mandatory. The PSO pattern to brand a habitual offender
without a right of hearing can be justified in terms of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Malak Singh case [AIR 1981 SC 760] referred to supra, where it was held:
“8..........................the material provided by the history sheet whose contents, by their
very nature have to be confidential. It would be contrary to the public interest to
reveal the information in the history sheet, particularly the source of information.
Revelation of the source of information may put the informant in jeopardy. The
observance of the principle of natural justice, apart from not serving the ends of
justice may thus lead to undesirable results. We accordingly hold that the rule audi
alteram partem is not attracted.
However, since in this State there is a legislation to notify a habitual offender as in
Tamil Nadu Habitual Offenders Act, 1948, the right of hearing cannot be denied.

Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
Curiously http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
enough the draftsman of the PSO knew about the habitual Offenders Act and finds a
mention in PSO 764 in chapter XLIII titled 'Surveillance', but still it is seen as
overlooked for the purposes connected with PSO 749(2)(b). And, it needs to be
underscored that even de hors a statutory provision, Courts have the power to read
the principles of natural justice in every statutes or delegated legislations, unless it is
specifically excluded. See Union of India v. Col. J.N. Sinha and another [1971] 1
S.C.R. 791].
27. As noted in an earlier paragraph, a person addicted to crime in PSO 749 (1)(b) is sought to be
differentiated from a habitual offender under PSO 749(2)(a). And, elsewhere in PSO 368 uses a
term, 'known depredator'. How, a known depredator is different from one who is addicted to crime,
and how both are different from a habitual offender? In real terms, considering the substance and
the context in which they are randomly used, all shall mean the same. This is critical in the context
of the right of pre-hearing available under the Habitual Offenders Act. This Court is at a loss to
appreciate the multiple terms used in the PSO to understand the same category of persons. Is the
PSO, therefore a piece of deft drafting stratagem, a subterfuge, to deflect the statutory definition in
Habitual Offenders Act, of its operational course through the usage of near synonymous phrases to
avoid a pre- decisional hearing? http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch
cases 28.1 The definitional inadequacy in identifying a Suspect under PSO 749(1)(b) or a Rowdy
(2)(a) is glaring. And, it throws the citizen to the mercy of the police power. This also has relevance
in situations where the Court has acquitted a history-sheeter, but still grants to the SHO the luxury
to be in a transcendental state to consider him as known or believed to, or likely to commit a crime
and to believe what is not.
28.2 The free roaming space that the PSO has provided through its inaccurate and imprecise
drafting is an open ticket to arbitrary exercise of police power to history-sheet. The police personnel
is reminded that preventive-policing is not easy-policing. It is one thing to have a general watch on
the entire society for criminality, and it is entirely another thing to pick a person for special
branding as a suspect for surveillance. It is good to remember the words of Lord Atkin in Liversidge
vs. Anderson [1942 AC 206]. The eminent jurist opined:
“It has always been one of the pillars of freedom, one of the principles of liberty for
which on recent authority we are now fighting, that the judges are no respecters of
persons, and stand between the subject and any attempted encroachments on his
liberty by the executive, alert to see that any coercive action is justified in law.
I know of only one authority which might justify the suggested method of
construction.
"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just
what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less." "The question is," said Alice,
"whether you can make words mean so many different things." "The question is," said
Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be the master, that's all." After all this long discussion
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 34
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
the question http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases is
whether the words "If a man has" can mean "If a man thinks he has". I have an
opinion that they cannot and the case should be decided accordingly.”
29.1 In Ganesan's case, after referring to several authorities of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and also
the judgements of this Court, this Court emphasized the need for gathering materials on the basis of
which the police official empowered to history-sheet may consider it necessary to history sheet a
person, which in other words would mean that he should apply his mind to those materials. This
twin criteria would eschew the possibility of arbitrariness seeping into the decision-making process
involved in the history-sheeting. 29.2 An individual may suffer an intellectual aberration, and may
throw to wind the need for fairness in action, non-arbitrariness in decision making and objectivity in
application of mind. However, nothing that authorizes or empowers State actors to interfere with
the rights of the citizen such as the PSO, can breed intellectual dishonesty, or can provide for its
sustenance.
30. Another aspect that drew the attention of this Court, not very significant though, is that PSO
752(2) states that a bad character should be closely watched. However, PSO 752(1) provides that a
history-sheeter should be informally watched. PSO 746(1) provides that for http://www.judis.nic.in
WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases a bad character, history sheet could be opened, and
PSO 746(3) provides for a close watch of bad characters. Now, should a bad character be closely
watched, or informally watched? Operational aberrations:
31.1 Primarily, as can be gathered now, there are two areas where the power to history-sheet is
arbitrarily exercised: One while exercising power under PSO 749 and the other while retaining a
history sheeter under PSO 748(2). There is a mechanism within the police, by which the superior
officials are required to inspect the Police Station. Failure to inspect properly has also occasioned in
arbitrary exercise of police power to retain a history sheet. Then there are also instances of pure
malafide exercise of power. 31.2 It is noticeable that the fine act of preventive policing through
history-sheeting, has been marred by a high percentage of subjectivity and unimaginable lack of
application of mind. They instantly demonstrate that the principles settled by this Court in the
judgements/Orders up till now delivered on the manner of history-sheeting a person, have not even
been given the scantiest respect that they deserve. These can be illustrated with reference to few
cases in this batch.
batch:
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases
a) The first category of cases involve both allegations of history-sheeting for
participating in democratic protests and demonstrations and also inability to pursue
a profession.
● The petitioner in W.P.7546/2019 is a law graduate. He also has to his credit, a M.Phil. degree in
Economics. He introduces himself as a social activist and claims to have part taken in political
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 35
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
agitations and demonstrations. He had 4 cases to his credit, of which two are more likely to relate to
political demonstrations as they are registered under Sec.188 IPC. A history sheet was opened in
HS.898/2011 at the concerned police station. It was closed once in 2013 but reopened in 2017 when
he was booked in Cr.No:40/2017. In this case further action was dropped by the police, even in
2017. Still, he continues to be a history sheeter. He therefore moved the authorities to remove his
name from the history sheet. The Superintendent of Police has forwarded his request to the
assistant Superintendent of Police who in turn called for the report of the SHO of the concerned
station, based on whose report, the Assistant Superintendent of Police, Vide his proceedings dated
06-01-2017 had directed closure of the history-sheet opened against the petitioner, but it is yet to
happen. http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases Where has gone all
the judicial sermons that this court had painstakingly delivered through its judgements? Why were
the principles governing history- sheeting ignored? When no case was pending against him, where is
the legal justification for retaining him in the history sheet without recourse to Habitual Offenders
Act, or to Sec.107 or Sec. 110 Cr.P.C.? Where is the application of mind?
● The case of Bazeerudin, the petitioner in W.P.(MD) 25185/2018 falls under an identical category.
He is also a law graduate, and he too claims to be a social and a political activist, against whom 10
cases were registered. Given the fact that seven of those cases are registered under Sec.188 IPC they
could well relate to his participation in some demonstrations on political or social issues. Of them 6
six cases were quashed by this Court, all of which are registered in 2016 to 2018. He was acquitted in
one case in Cr.No:1159/2008. Two cases are pending investigation, one each in 2016 and 2017. After
2018, there are no cases registered against him. What this case high lights along with the earlier case
in W.P.(MD)7546/2019 is about using history-sheeting as a tool to choke the just voice of the citizen
to dissent and to protest democratically. http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc.
batch cases
b) The cases involved in Crl.O.P.(MD) 3541/2019 and in W.P.(MD)19657/2018 are examples of
judicial delay in disposing of the case which appeared to have provided a justification for retaining
the respective petitioners in the history sheet. ● Irudhayarajan is the petitioner in Crl.OP (MD)
3541/2019. He is stated to have lost his vision when the petition was filed, and this is admitted by
the concerned police. He is facing trial in S.C.69/2014. The counter says the petitioner is also
involved in Cr.No:102/2012 wherein the petitioner was acquitted. These cases apart the petitioner
was accused of committing cheating in Cr.No:122/2012 and Cr.No:93/2014. They both are pending
investigation. How long will the investigating agency require for completing the investigation is not
made clear. And, apparently there is delay in disposal of the case, and there is allegation that the
petitioner has contributed to it, which on the face of PSO 748(1) is irrelevant. What perplexes this
Court is, why should this 100% visually impaired person be forced to suffer an indignation of being
listed in the history sheet for the fault of the investigating agency. What threat does this visually
impaired person pose to the societal peace today? The police officials have been mindlessly retaining
him in the history-sheet well beyond the two years period stipulated in PSO 748(1) Cr.P.C.
(c) The cases in Crl.O.P.(MD) 4921/2019, 4904/2019, 4914/2019, 4915/2019, W.P.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases (MD) 21040/2018,
4716/2019, Crl.O.P.(MD)4725/2019, W.P.(MD) 6096/2019 are illustrative of how indifferent the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 36
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
police have been in retaining the respective petitioners in the history sheet. Of them three cases
stand out:
● The first is the case of one Jambunathan, the petitioner in W.P.(MD) 6096/2019.
He was involved in two cases. The first one was in C.C.2102/1978 in which he was
convicted for six months. The other case was in Cr.No:190/2003 and the counter
does not whisper about its present status. At any rate there was no case after 2003
there was no case. What can justify his continued retention in the history sheet.
● Muthukumar, the petitioner in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.4725 of 2019 also has similar
experience. He was history sheeted in HS 229/2006 when he faced a sessions trial
and after 2007 no fresh case there are no fresh case is shown to have been registered
against him.
● Rajkumar, the petitioner in W.P.(MD)194/1998 has been history sheeted in
HS194/1998. He was involved in two cases, and in S.C.3/1997 he was released on
22-08-2009 after serving a term in jail and was acquitted in Cr.No:536/1998.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases Still he
continues to be a history sheeter. Is he because he was a former convict and hence
presumed to be a suspect even without a fresh case, at least after 1998?
d) There are several other cases, where the police did not choose to close the history
sheet despite Court acquitting the accused persons. How to justify their continued
retention in the history-sheet?
PART D The Decision and the conclusion
32. Now, having spotted a definitional incongruity between the Habitual Offenders Act and the PSO,
to recognize its continuity will promote fraud on statute, an anathema, which our Constitutional
scheme may not accommodate. As indicated earlier these are the issues that require a reaction and
response from the legislature. See Bhavesh Jayanti Lakhani Vs State of Maharashtra [(2009) 9 SCC
551]. It is its exclusive domain. Still, as referred to earlier (see paragraph 16.2 above) some
continuity needs to be given till legislative alternatives are developed.
33.1 Before arriving at the concluding part of this judgement, it is necessary to reiterate that, the
pattern of history-sheeting also shows that it has inter alia, become the resultant effect of
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases the citizen's right to dissent
and protest democratically and within the bounds of law. Freedom which the Constitution grants is
not a delusion into which the citizens may levitate in the elixir of an unknown belief, but is an
experience in reality. This is but an amplification of what Justice Holmes tersely premised in his
work, 'The Common Law' that “the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience” 33.2
Besides the need for surveillance and crime-prevention, this Court is given to understand that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 37
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
history sheeting seemingly has a longer range to impact a citizen's fundamental right guaranteed
under Article 19(1)(g) while seeking employment or for pursuing a profession of his choice. Even,
obtaining a passport is made difficult for the one who is history-sheeted, this court was told.
Without getting into the advisability of extending the operational scope of a history-sheet for
purposes beyond crime-prevention, does it not signify the need for greater care when the power to
history-sheet is exercised?
34. Ideally where cases are registered against the citizens for participating in any demonstrations,
agitations or protest or the like, consistent with the freedom granted by the Constitution,
history-sheeting on that score can be resorted to only after an Order is passed against the concerned
person under Sec.107 Cr.P.C. or Sec.110 Cr.P.C. since it will enable to balance the need to safeguard
the citizens' right to protest without violence, and duty of the http://www.judis.nic.in
WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases police to maintain peace in the society. This balancing
act can be well achieved when an Executive magistrate, and not the police, takes a decision after
hearing the party to be affected by history-sheeting. This cannot be extended to non-citizens, as the
rights under Article 19 are confined only to the citizens under the Constitution of India. See Hans
Muller of Nurenburg Vs. Superintendent, Presidency Jail, Calcutta and others [AIR 1955 SC 367].
35.1 A Court on vigil, therefore, is under a Constitutional duty to ensure, that the freedom as an
experience which the Constitution serves to the citizens, is not defiled by a non-statutory
administrative action, and that a balance is required to be struck between the right of the citizen to
protest and dissent, and the need for preventive policing. This Court senses a duty to step in, and to
provide necessary correctives, without necessarily unsettling the present process and the procedure
involved in it (till an alternative found), where this Court is guided by the judgments of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Vishaka Vs. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 SCC 241] and Shayara Bano Vs. Union of
India &Ors., [(2017) 9 SCC 1]. To repeat, this is done as a temporary measure with a limited
shelf-value, till the statutory law, or any Executive Order having the force of law are made.
35.2 Having spotted certain vagueness and internal inconsistencies in the choice of expressions
which the PSO employ, and the constant threat they pose to the fundamental
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases right, that ultimately lead to
unnecessary and avoidable litigations before this Court, it is necessary to harmonize and iron out the
ambiguities they produce till legislative alternatives are found. The police personnel may have to be
provided with clear parameters for exercising their power to history sheet, for doing which this
Court draws strength from the ratio in Madhya Pradesh Special Police Establishment Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh [(2004)8 SCC 788] and B.C.Chaturvedi Vs. Union of India & another [(1995)6 SCC
750].
36. Accordingly, this Court issues the following directions. This is in addition to the principles or
directions given earlier namely: (a) The decision to history sheet, or retaining one in the history
sheet must be on tangible materials and on an objective basis as declared in Ganesan case
[2010(6)CTC 507] (b) and the ratio of this Court in Sabari case [2018-2- LW.(Crl.)817], wherein this
Court has held that mere registration of a FIR under Sec.109 and 110 Cr.P.C. cannot justify an action
of the police to retain the name in the history sheet. There should have been a concluded
proceedings.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156221879/ 38
Thirumagan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 3 July, 2020
A. In all the cases where a person has to be treated as an habitual offender, or one addicted to crime,
or a known deprecator of law without a case pending against them when the police propose to
history-sheet him, he should have been either notified as a habitual offender under the Tamil Nadu
Habitual Offenders Act,1948, or should have been one against whom an Order has been made under
Sec.110 http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases Cr.P.C.
http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases B. In all cases a person can be
history-sheeted only for two years as provided in PSO 748(1). Retaining a history sheeter beyond
that period is an exception and it must have an objective basis. Accordingly, history sheet cannot be
retained merely on the ground that (a) investigation agency has not filed any final report, or, (b)
where the case is pending trial beyond two years time as provided. C. There cannot be any retention
under PSO748 (2), unless (a) a fresh case is registered (which may be either under investigation or
pending) subsequent to the case/cases which necessitated the opening of the history-sheet, or, (b) a
history sheeter is notified as an habitual offender. This should be only for one year as in PSO 748(2).
Every subsequent decision to extend or retain a history sheeter in the history sheet should be made
only on the same basis as indicated. D. Where no subsequent case is registered, a former convict
should not be treated as a suspect.
E. In reckoning the number of cases for treating a person as addicted to or habitually given to
commit a crime, cases where (i) the investigation agency has dropped a case, or (ii) where the FIR
was closed under Sec.468 Cr.P.C, by the Court which is http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040
of 2018 & etc. batch cases empowered to take cognizance of an offence on a Police report, or (iii)
where a history sheeter has been discharged or acquitted by a competent Court, and/or (iv) quashed
by this Court or by the Hon'ble Supreme Court shall not be included. However, those cases where
the investigation or trial is pending, they can be reckoned. This direction has no application to
National Registry maintained under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2018.
F. Where cases are registered in connection with a citizen participating in any peaceful protests,
agitations, or demonstrations or the like, history sheet should not be opened unless an order is
passed by the Executive Magistrate under Sec.107 or 110 Cr.P.C., This is not available to
non-citizens. It is clarified that if any other offence alleging violence, or damage of property or threat
to personal safety or life of other citizens is also involved, the directions given herein is not
applicable. G. The Director General of Police is required to constitute a District wise committee
through appropriate police officials to examine all the cases of history-sheeting on the basis of
parameters hereinabove provided within a period of one year. H. The Director General of Police is
directed to take such necessary steps to automate the process of history sheeting to make the whole
exercise self-driven. http://www.judis.nic.in WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 & etc. batch cases I. The
Director General of Police shall submit a half yearly progress/compliance report the direction given
in G and H. J. The Director General of Police is required to issue a circular contained in A to F of this
paragraph along with those stated in Ganesan Vs The District Superintendent of Police & others
