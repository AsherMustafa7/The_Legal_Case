Ramji Alias Ramganesh vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 1 April, 2025
4. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 460 of 2024, under Sections 137(2), 65(1) B.N.S. and
3/4(2) POCSO Act, Police Station- Tirwa, District- Kannauj, during the pendency of trial.
5. As per prosecution story, the FIR was instituted by the informant mentioning the fact that the
person having mobile no.9118520278 has enticed away his minor daughter on 13.10.2024 at about
07:00 a.m.
6. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has
been falsely implicated in the present case. The FIR is delayed by about one day and there is no
explanation of the said delay caused. The victim is a consenting party as is but evident from her
statement recorded U/s 183 B.N.S.S., whereby she has stated that she had gone with the applicant
and had stayed with him for about ten days. The victim has not raised any alarm whatsoever.
7. Learned counsel for the applicant has further stated that although the victim has stated that
applicant had established corporeal relationship with her, but the said relations were out of consent.
The victim by her looks seems to be major, although as per the ossification test report her age has
come out to be between 14-16 years. As such, a leverage of two years may be granted to the applicant
on the upper side.
8. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of
the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false
implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal antecedent
of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 26.10.2024 and he is ready to cooperate
with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.
9. Learned State Law Officer has vehemently opposed the bail application.
10. The Supreme Court in Jaya Mala vs. State of J & K, (1982) 2 SCC 538 and Mohd. Imran Khan vs.
State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), (2011) 10 SCC 192 has opined that the radiologist cannot predict the
correct date of birth rather there is a long margin of 1 to 2 years on either side.
11. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs
Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed
examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party
should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is
needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.
12. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for
the parties, the evidence on record, and taking into consideration the settled law of the Supreme
Court passed in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690
and Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 and without expressing any
opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for
bail. The bail application is allowed.

the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the
Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in
accordance with law.
14. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.
15. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way

witnesses.
