application, she has submitted that on 06.03.2018 at about 04:00
AM in the morning, when she was going towards the maize field
to defecate, all of a sudden (1) Deepak Ray (this appellant) and (2)
Rohit Ray caught her, slammed her in the maize field and
committed rape on her one after another. Then the informant fell
unconscious and the two accused persons left her in the maize

10. Learned trial court, after analysing the evidences on record found that the evidences of the

PW-4 (Doctor) are reliable without any doubt.
11. Learned trial court after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case found that the

that the learned trial court has erred in convicting the appellant on the testimony of the victim.

Deepak Ray vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025
13. Learned counsel submits that the victim (PW-2) has stated that two persons had committed rape
on her in the maize field, however, the I.O. (PW-3) has not stated about the presence of any sign of
mark of trampling of the maize crops at the place of occurrence.
14. Learned counsel submits that the evidence of the victim (PW-2) alone cannot be taken as a
clinching evidence to sustain the conviction of the appellant. She is required to be corroborated in
material particulars but neither the evidence of the I.O. nor that of the Doctor are corroborating her
oral testimony.
15. It is submitted that the trustworthiness of PW-2 becomes doubtful and this coupled with the fact
that there is a delay of 36 hours in lodging of the FIR even as PW-1 has stated in her deposition in
paragraph '15' that only two hours after the occurrence the I.O. had reached at the place of
occurrence.
16. Learned counsel submits that the Medical Examination Report of the victim (Exhibit '4') shows
no sign of injury mark over her body even though she claims that she was subjected to forceful rape
in the maize field by two persons.
17. Learned counsel also submits that the FSL Report (Exhibit '6') is of no use because the appellant
was not subjected to medical examination, hence, neither his blood sample was Patna High Court
CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025 collected nor any semen matching was conducted to
connect him with the case.
Submissions of the State
18. Learned Special Public Prosecutor for the State has opposed the appeal. It is submitted that the
evidence of the victim (PW-2) has been supported by PW-1 and the minor inconsistencies would not
prove fatal to the prosecution case.
Consideration
19. Having heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned Special Public Prosecutor for the State
and upon perusal of the trial court's records, this Court finds that in this case, the victim (PW-2) is
not a sterling witness and it would not be safe to rely upon her sole testimony to convict the
appellant. From her written information, it would appear that with regard to the occurrence which
had taken place on 06.03.2018 at 04:00 AM, she got prepared a written information through a deed
writer Auqil Sharma who has not been examined in this case. The victim (PW-
2) is illiterate and has put her thumb impression on the written information which was submitted in
the police station only on 07.03.2018 and the FIR has been registered on 07.03.2018 at 16:30 hours.
Thus, there is a delay of over 36 hours in lodging of the first information report. This has to be
considered keeping in view the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176256628/ 5
Deepak Ray vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
evidence of the mother-in-law (PW-1) who has stated in her deposition in paragraph '15' that only
two hours after the occurrence, police had arrived at her house still her statement was recorded after
one day.
20. This Court has further noticed from the evidence of the mother-in-law (PW-1) that in her
examination-in-chief, she claims that she had also gone together with the victim (PW-2) in the
morning to defecate where PW-2 was subjected to rape by this appellant and one Rohit Rai. In her
own evidence, she has contradicted herself in paragraph '14' where she has stated that she reached
the place of occurrence after one hour of the occurrence and found that the victim (PW-2) was alone
there.
21. It is further noticed that according to PW-1, the place of occurrence is the maize field of one
Sakaldev Yadav in which the maize plants were there and those were of the height of one male
person. As regards the place of occurrence, PW-2 has stated that the said maize filed is situated only
after one plot from her house and there were house of number of persons in the neighbourhood. She
has stated that when she had gone to defecate in the said plot, there was no other female, therefore,
not only PW- 1 has contradicted herself, even PW-2 has not stated about the presence of PW-1 in the
maize field at the time of occurrence. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023
dt.09-10-2025
22. The I.O. Ashok Singh (PW-3) has stated that, he got the charge of investigation of this case on
07.03.2018 after receipt of the written application. He has proved the endorsement on the formal
FIR in his hand-writing and his signature as Exhibit '1'. He has stated that after taking over the
charge of investigation, he had recorded the statement of the informant and thereafter, he had
proceeded towards the place of occurrence. He has taken the victim to the court for recording her
statement under Section 164 CrPC and then took her for medical examination to Sadar Hospital,
Saharsa. From where he was sent to Bhagalpur for medical examination. PW-3 has stated that he
had seized the clothes of the victim and had sent the same to the FSL.
In his cross-examination, PW-3 has stated that he had not recorded the statement of the deed writer
Waqil Sharma in the case diary. He had, though, recorded the statement of PW-1 but has not
recorded the date and time of recording of her statement in the case diary. He had also not recorded
the statement of Sakaldev Yadav and he had not recorded the statement of any of the boundary
people, namely, Rambilas Sharma, Suresh Sharma and Hareram Sharma. He has stated that the
seized articles were not before him. In his further cross-examination, he has stated that he had not
seized any article from the place of occurrence. He had not Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375
of 2023 dt.09-10-2025 recorded that who had brought the victim to the police station. PW-3 has
stated that in course of investigation, he had arrested this appellant but had not taken him to
hospital for medical examination. He had also not recorded the statement of the Doctor or staff of
the hospital at Bhagalpur where he had taken the victim for medical examination. In course of his
further cross- examination, this witness has proved the 'saree' and 'petticoat' of the victim as
Material Exhibit 'A' and 'B' respectively and the blouse as Material Exhibit 'C'. He has stated in
paragraph '29' that all the clothes as per seizure list were produced by the mother-in- law (PW-1) of
the victim. This Court has noticed that the seizure list has not been brought on record in evidence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176256628/ 6
Deepak Ray vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
and the mother-in- law (PW-1) has categorically stated that she did not remember that of which
colour saree, she had handed over to police. PW-1 further categorically stated that except 'saree', she
had not given any other thing to police. It is, thus, evident that PW-1 does not say about handing
over of 'petticoat' and blouse of the victim to PW-3.
23. In this case, the victim (PW-2) has stated that two persons had committed rape on her in the
maize field, however, the I.O. has not stated about presence of any sign of mark of trampling of the
maize crops at the place of occurrence. The victim was taken to the Doctor for her medical
examination. The Medical Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025
Examination Report (Exhibit '4') has been proved by Dr. Archana Sneha (PW-4). In her deposition,
she has stated that on examination, no injury mark over face, back, chest, lower abdomen and upper
limbs. Perinium valva could be found and vagina is normal. The Urine pregnancy test report was
found positive and a single live intrauterine fetus of nine weeks and four days was found. The Doctor
has recorded that no sign of assault was there, although probability of sexual assault cannot be ruled
out. PW-2 has been assessed aged between 17-19 years. It is evident from the Medical Report
(Exhibit '4') that the Doctor had not found any injury mark over the body of the victim (PW-2) even
though she claims that she was subjected to forceful rape in the maize field by two persons.
24. We have found from the evidences on the record that one FSL report has been brought in
evidence which has been marked Exhibit '6'. It has not been proved through any expert from the
FSL. We have noticed from Exhibit '6' that the parcel carrying exhibits were sent to the FSL vide
Memo No. 774/18 dated 25.05.2018 i.e. after more than two and half months of the occurrence and
it was received through Special Messenger - Chowkidar-1/11 Naveen Kumar Paswan, only on
31.07.2018 i.e. after more than two months of the aforesaid memo. The said Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025 Chowkidar has not been examined. The description of the
articles in Exhibit '6' would show that a red-green-yellow printed old saree marked 'A', red colour
old dirty petticoat marked 'B' and red old dirty blouse marked 'C' which bore greyish stains. The
result of the examination would show that semen has been detected in the Exhibit marked 'B',
however, semen could not be detected in any of the exhibits marked 'A' and 'C'. It is evident from the
materials on the record that the appellant was not subjected to medical examination, hence, neither
his blood sample was collected nor any semen matching was conducted to connect him with the
case. In the case of Krishna Kumar Malik versus State of Haryana reported in (2011) 7 SCC 130, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered this aspect of the matter and has found that no matching of
the semen of the accused would prove fatal to the prosecution case. We quote paragraphs '43' and
'44' of the said judgment hereunder for a ready reference:-
"43. With regard to the matching of the semen, we find it from Taylor's Principles
and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence, 2nd Edn. (1965) as under:
"Spermatozoa may retain vitality (or free motion) in the body of a woman for a long
period, and movement should always be looked for in wet specimens. The actual time
that spermatozoa may remain alive after ejaculation cannot be precisely defined, but
is usually a matter of hours. Seymour claimed to have seen movement in a fluid as
much Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025 as 5 days old.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176256628/ 7
Deepak Ray vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
The detection of dead spermatozoa in stains may be made at long periods after
emission, when the fluid has been allowed to dry. Sharpe found identifiable
spermatozoa often after 12 months and once after a period of 5 years. Non- motile
spermatozoa were found in the vagina after a lapse of time which must have been 3
and could have been 4 months."
Had such a procedure been adopted by the prosecution, then it would have been a foolproof case for
it and against the appellant.
44. Now, after the incorporation of Section 53-A in the Criminal Procedure Code w.e.f. 23-6-2006,
brought to our notice by the learned counsel for the respondent State, it has become necessary for
the prosecution to go in for DNA test in such type of cases, facilitating the prosecution to prove its
case against the accused. Prior to 2006, even without the aforesaid specific provision in CrPC the
prosecution could have still resorted to this procedure of getting the DNA test or analysis and
matching of semen of the appellant with that found on the undergarments of the prosecutrix to
make it a foolproof case, but they did not do so, thus they must face the consequences."
25. We have found that the defence has suggested to PW-1 that the accused has been falsely
implicated in this case through PW-2 because she had taken Rs.5000/- from the father of the
accused. The village of PW-2 is the nanihal of the appellant and only when on demand money was
not returned, this false case has been lodged.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025
26. Having regard to the entire evidence on the record, we find that in this case, the only material
present for purpose of the prosecution is the statement of the victim (PW-2). No doubt conviction
may take place on the sole testimony of the victim but for that the victim has to come out as a
sterling witness. Who will be a sterling witness has been discussed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
elaborately in the case of Rai Sandeep @ Deepu vs. State (NCT of Delhi) reported in (2012) 8 SCC
21. Paragraph '22' of the said judgment is reproduced hereunder for a ready reference:-
"22. In our considered opinion, the "sterling witness"
should be of a very high quality and calibre whose version should, therefore, be unassailable. The
court considering the version of such witness should be in a position to accept it for its face value
without any hesitation. To test the quality of such a witness, the status of the witness would be
immaterial and what would be relevant is the truthfulness of the statement made by such a witness.
What would be more relevant would be the consistency of the statement right from the starting
point till the end, namely, at the time when the witness makes the initial statement and ultimately
before the court. It should be natural and consistent with the case of the prosecution qua the
accused. There should not be any prevarication in the version of such a witness. The witness should
be in a position to withstand the cross-examination of any length and howsoever strenuous it may
be and under no circumstance should give room for any doubt as to the factum of the occurrence,
the persons involved, as well as the sequence of it. Such a version should have co-relation with each
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176256628/ 8
Deepak Ray vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
and every one of other supporting material such Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023
dt.09-10-2025 as the recoveries made, the weapons used, the manner of offence committed, the
scientific evidence and the expert opinion. The said version should consistently match with the
version of every other witness. It can even be stated that it should be akin to the test applied in the
case of circumstantial evidence where there should not be any missing link in the chain of
circumstances to hold the accused guilty of the offence alleged against him. Only if the version of
such a witness qualifies the above test as well as all other such similar tests to be applied, can it be
held that such a witness can be called as a "sterling witness" whose version can be accepted by the
court without any corroboration and based on which the guilty can be punished. To be more precise,
the version of the said witness on the core spectrum of the crime should remain intact while all other
attendant materials, namely, oral, documentary and material objects should match the said version
in material particulars in order to enable the court trying the offence to rely on the core version to
sieve the other supporting materials for holding the offender guilty of the charge alleged."
27. In the present case, we are of the considered opinion that the evidence of PW-2 alone cannot be
taken as a clinching evidence to sustain the conviction of the appellant. She is required to be
corroborated in material particulars but neither the evidence of the I.O. nor that of the Doctor are
corroborating her oral testimony. The FSL Report (Exhibit '6') is of no use because on the one hand,
it is not known that who had handed over the 'petticoat' to the I.O. and on the other hand, PW-1 says
that she Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.375 of 2023 dt.09-10-2025 had given only saree to the
I.O and no other cloth, at the same time, we find that the semen said to be present on the 'petticoat'
has not been matched with that of the appellant. In such circumstance, the trustworthiness of PW-2
becomes doubtful and this coupled with delay of 36 hours in lodging of the FIR would further prove
fatal to the prosecution case.
28. In result, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial court cannot sustain. It is
liable to be set aside.
29. This appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment of conviction dated 11.04.2022 and the
consequent order of sentence dated 19.04.2022 passed by learned Additional District and Sessions
Judge- III-cum-Special Judge, SC/ST Act, Saharsa, Bihar in Special Case No.58 of 2018 arising out
of Mahishi P.S. Case No.60 of 2018 are, accordingly, set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the
charges giving him benefit of doubt.
30. The appellant is said to be in custody, hence he is ordered to be released forthwith, if not wanted
in any other case.
31. A copy of this judgment together with the trial court's record be sent back.
