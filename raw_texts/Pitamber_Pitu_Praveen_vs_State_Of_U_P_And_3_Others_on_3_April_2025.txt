"1. Heard Mr. Ramdhan, the learned counsel for applicant and Mr. Prashant Kumar,

"Heard Mr. Ramdhan, the learned counsel for applicant and the learned A.G.A. for
State.
Perused the record.
This application for bail has been filed by applicant Pitamber @ Pitu @ Praveen
seeking his enlargement on bail in Case Crime No. 120 of 2023, under Sections 342,
354, 354A, 354D, 376D, 504, 506 IPC and Sections 5/6, 7/8 PCOSO. Act, P.S.
Sikandrarau, District Hathras, during the pendency of trial.
After some arguments, it transpires that the age of the prosecutrix has been
determined with reference to the date of birth of the prosecutrix mentioned in the
scholar register/transfer certificate. As per the said documents, the date of birth of
the prosecutrix is said to be 08.09.2008.
Prima facie, the determination of age of the prosecutrix made with reference to above
mentioned documents is manifestly illegal. By virtue of the provisions contained in
Section 94 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the age of
the prosecutrix could be determined only with reference to her date of birth
mentioned in any of the documents recognized under Section 94 (2) (i) and 94 (2) (ii)
of the Act, 2015. There is no document on record regarding the date of birth of the
prosecutrix in consonance with the provisions of Section 94 of Act, 2015.
Learned A.G.A. submits that charge sheet has been submitted on 29.4.2023.

Section 173 (8) Cr. P. C. before Court concerned seeking the permission of Court to

concerned, the Investigating Officer shall proceed to discover the date of birth of the

document which is in consonance with the provisions of Section 94 of the Act, 2015
regarding the date of birth of the prosrecutrix. The necessary exercise shall be
completed within a period of three weeks from today. The copy of the supplementary
case diary shall be transmitted to this Court through the learned A.G.A. before the
next date fixed.
Matter shall, accordingly, re-appear as fresh on 23.112023."
3. Since the order dated 31.10.2023 was not complied with, therefore, adjournment was prayed by
the learned A.G.A. on the next date i.e. 23.11.2023. Accordingly, the matter was adjourned. Court
passed the following order dated 23.11.2023;-
"1. On the matter being taken up, the learned A.G.A prays for and is granted a week's

cavalier fashion.

5. Mr. Prashant Kumar, the learned A.G.A. has filed the personal affidavits of
Investigating Officer, Superintendent of Police and Additional Superintendent of
Police, which are taken on record.
6. Mr. Prashant Kumar, the learned A.G.A. fairly submits that on account of Hathras
Mahotsav in progress, it is impossible for the Superintedent of Police, Hathras to
leave the station.He has therefore, filed his personal affidavit seeking indulgence of
this Court. However, the Additional Superintendent of Police has been deputed to
appear before this Court. Considering the explanation offered by the Superintendent
of Police, his personal appearance is exempted.
7. Perused the affidavit filed by the Additional Superintendent of Police and the
Investigating Officer. The Court finds that in view of the averments made in the
affidavits filed by the aforesaid officers, their personal appearance is also not
required on future dates. Accordingly, their personal appearance on future is also

8. This application for bail has been filed by applicant-Pitamber @ Pitu @ Praveen
seeking his enlargement on bail in Case Crime No. 120 of 2023, under Sections 342,
354, 354-A, 354-D, 376-D, 504, 506 IPC and Sections 5/6, 7/8 POCSO Act, Police
Station-Sikandrarau, District-Hathras during the pendency of trial.
9. At the very outset, the learned A.G.A. submits that notice of present application for
bail has already been served upon first informant-opposite party 2 on 17.08.2023.
However, in spite of service of notice, no one has put in appearance on behalf of first
informant-opposite party 2 to oppose this application for bail.
10. Record shows that in respect of an incident, which is alleged to have occurred on
20.03.2023, a delayed FIR dated 21.03.2023 was lodged by first informant-Rakesh
Kumar (father of the prosecutrix) and was registered as Case Crime No. 120 of 2023,
under Sections 342, 354, 354-A, 354-B, 376, 511, 504, 506 IPC and Sections 7/8/18
POCSO Act, Police Station-Sikandrarau, District-Hathras. In the aforesaid FIR, 3
persons namely (1) Prem Singh, (2) Pawan and (3) Pitu have been nominated as
named accused.
11. The gravamen of the allegations made in the FIR is to the effect that named
accused Prem Singh and Pawan deliberately and forcibly dislodged the modesty of
the prosecutrix.
12. After above-mentioned FIR was lodged, Investigating Officer proceeded with
statutory investigation of concerned case crime number in terms of Chapter-XII
Cr.P.C. The statement of the prosecutrix was recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
Same is on record at page 49 of the paper book. The prosecutrix in her aforesaid
statement has fully supported the FIR. Thereafter, the prosecutrix was requested for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126839640/ 4
Pitamber @ Pitu @ Praveen vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 3 April, 2025
her internal medical examination. The Doctor, who medically examined the
prosecutrix, did not find any injury on her body so as to denote commission of
deliberate or forceful sexual assault. No adverse opinion was formed by the Doctor
with regard to the private part of the prosecutrix either. The Urine Pregnancy Test of
the prosecutrix was conducted. The result of the same is in negative.
13. During course of investigation, Investigating Officer recovered the School Leaving
Certificate of the prosecutrix wherein the date of birth of the prosecutrix is
mentioned as 08.09.2008. The occurrence giving rise to present criminal
proceedings occurred on 20.03.2023. As such, the prosecutrix was aged about 14
years, 6 months and 12 days. Investigating Officer further examined the first
informant and other witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C. Witnesses so examined have
substantilly supported the FIR. On the basis of above and other material collected by
Investigating Officer during course of investigation, he came to the conclusion that
complicity of all the named accused is established in the crime in question. He,
accordingly, submitted the charge sheet dated 29.04.2023 whereby 2 of the named
accused i.e. Pitamber @ Pitu @ Praveen and Prem Singh have been charge sheeted
under Sections 342, 354, 354-A, 354-B, 376-D, 504, 506 IPC and Sections 5/6, 7/8
POCSO Act whereas once of the named accused Pawan @ Deepu @ Bachcha has been
declared juvenile for which the charge sheet has been sent to Junvenie Justice Board
on 29.04.2023..
14. Subsequent to the order dated 31.10.2023 passed by this Court, Investigating
Officer conducted further investigation and the date of birth of the prosecutrix
recorded in the institution first attended by her has also been recovered which is
08.09.2008.
15. Learned counsel for applicant contends that though the applicant is named as well
as charge sheeted accused yet he is liable to be enlarged on bail. The medical evidence
does not support the ocular version of the occurrence as disclosed in the statements
of the prosecutrix recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C, before the Doctor, who
medically examined the her and under Section 164 Cr.P.C. He, therefore, contends
that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail.
16. Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents inasmuch as, he has no
criminal history to his credit except the present one. Applicant is in jail since
17.04.2023. As such, he has undergone more than 8 months of incarceration. The
police report in terms of Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. has already been submitted. As such,
the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against applicant
stands crystallized. However, up to this stage, no such circumstance has emerged on
record necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial. On
the above premise, he submits that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. In case,
the applicant is enlarged on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall
co-operate with the trial.

Pitamber @ Pitu @ Praveen vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 3 April, 2025
17. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. has opposed the present application for bail. He
submits that since applicant is a named and charge sheeted accused, therefore, he
does not deserve any indulgence by this Court. The prosecutrix in her statements
recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C., before the Doctor, who medically examined her
and under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has clearly supported the FIR. She has also described
the act of applicant including the manner in which, criminality was committed upon
her. Since the prosecutrix is a young girl of tender age and below 16 years of age,
therefore, it cannot be said that the present criminal proceedings are false or
malicious accentuated by mala-fide. There is nothing on record to infer the innocence
of applicant either. As such, on sympathy be shown by this Court in favour of
applicant.
18. When confronted with above, the learned counsel for applicant could not
overcome the same.
19. Having heard, the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State,
upon perusal of record, evidence, nature and gravity of offence, complicity of
accused, accusations made coupled with the fact that the prosecutrix is a young girl
aged about 14 years, 6 months and 18 days, the learned counsel for applicant could
not contradict the age of the prosecutrix from any other material, the prosecutrix in
her statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C., before the Doctor, who medically examined
her and under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has clearly implicated the applicant for the
criminality committed upon her, she has also detailed the manner of occurrence, in
view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in Phool Singh Vs. State of M.P. (2022) 2
SCC 74 the prosecution of an accused for an offence of rape and sexual assault can be
maintained even in the absence of medical evidence and on the solitary statement of
the prosecutrix, however, the statement of prosecutrix showed clear and specific,
when the statements of the prosecutrix referred to above are taken as a whole and
examined in the light of above, it cannot be said that the same suffer from the vice of
exaggeration, embellishment and contradiction but to the contrary, they are clear,
categorical and consistent i.e. unambiguous, as such, the statements of the prosecutix
are of impeccable character, there is nothing on record to infer that the prosecution
of applicant is false or malicious being accentuated by mala-fide, there is nothing to
infer the innocence of applicant either, therefore, irrespective of the varied
submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicant in support of the present
application for bail, but without making any comments on the merits of the case, this
Court does not find any good or sufficient ground to enlarge the applicant on bail.
20. As a result, present application for bail fails and is liable to be rejected.
21. It is accordingly rejected. "
5. Learned counsel for applicant submit that though applicant is a named and charge sheeted
accused, however, in view of subsequent developments as have emerged on record of concerned

Pitamber @ Pitu @ Praveen vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 3 April, 2025
Special Sessions Trial the applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail.
6. In furtherance of aforesaid submission, the learned counsel for applicant submits that subsequent
to the order dated 13.10.2023 trial of applicant commenced before Court below. Upto this stage,
three prosecution witnesses of fact have deposed before Court below i.e. PW-1 Rakesh Kumar
(father of the prosecutrix), PW-2 Rakesh Kumar (brother of the prosecutrix), PW-3 prosecutrix.
However, aforementioned witnesses in their depositions before Court below have not supported the
FIR.
7. On the above premise, the learned counsel for applicant submits that once the statements of the
first informant and prosecutrix have been recorded before Court below then in that eventuality it
cannot be said that if, the applicant is enlarged on bail, then he shall either terrorize the witnesses or
shall hamper the course of trial.
8. It is then contended by the learned counsel for applicant that since the first informant and the
prosecutrix in their depositions before Court below have not supported the prosecution story as
unfolded in the FIR, therefore, no good ground now exists to prolong the custodial arrest of
applicant during the pendency of trial. As such, the applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail.
9. Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents inasmuch as, he has no criminal history
to his credit except the present one. Applicant is in jail since 17.04.2023. As such, he has undergone
more than one year of incarceration. The charge sheet/police report in terms of Section 173(2)
Cr.P.C. has already been submitted by the Investigating Officer. As such, the entire evidence sought
to be relied upon by the prosecution against applicant stands crystallized. However, up to this stage,
no such incriminating circumstance has emerged on record necessitating the custodial arrest of
applicant during the pendency of trial. On the above premise, it is thus urged by the learned counsel
for applicant that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. In case, the applicant is enlarged on bail,
he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall co-operate with the trial.
10. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1 has vehemently opposed the prayer for
bail. However, he could not dislodge the factual and legal submissions urged by the learned counsel
for applicant, with reference to the record at this stage.
11. Having heard, the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State and upon perusal of
record, evidence, nature and gravity of offence, accusations made, complicity of accused and
coupled with the fact that three prosecution witnesses of fact have deposed before Court below as
PW-1 Rakesh Kumar (father of the prosecutrix), PW-2 Rakesh Kumar (brother of the prosecutrix),
PW-3 prosecutrix upto this stage, however, aforementioned witnesses in their depositions before
Court below have not supported the prosecution story as unfolded in the FIR and therefore, they
have been declared hostile, once the statements of the first informant and prosecutrix have been
recorded before Court below then in that eventuality it cannot be said that if, applicant is enlarged
on bail, he shall either terrorize the witnesses or shall hamper the course of trial, the police report in
terms of Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. has already been submitted, therefore, the entire evidence sought to
be relied upon by the prosecution against applicant stands crystallized, yet in spite of above, the

Pitamber @ Pitu @ Praveen vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 3 April, 2025
learned A.G.A. could not point out any such circumstance from the record necessitating the
custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial, the judgment of Supreme Court in Sumit
Subhashchandra Gangwal Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 373 (Paragraph 5), the
clean antecedents of applicant, the period of incarceration undergone, therefore, irrespective of the
objections raised by the learned A.G.A. in opposition to this repeat application for bail, but without
making any comments on the merits of the case, applicant has made out a case for bail.
12. Accordingly, the bail application is allowed.
