2. The prosecution story, in short, is that the complainant Rajdhar Vishwakarma lodged a report on
02.09.2011 in the Police Station Batiyagarh and stated that on 31.08.2011 one Kamlesh

Vishwakarma son of his brother-in- law and the present appellant came to his house and stayed
there. Thereafter, on 01.09.2011 they went to the temple of Hanumat Ghati and returned to the
house. However, thereafter, they had offered some sweet stating it to be "Prasad" to them and after
consuming it they became unconscious. On the next day, their neighbor took them to the hospital
and when they came back to their house, they found that gold and silver ornaments were missing
from the house which were worth Rs.80,000/-.
3. After registration of the offence the investigation was set in motion by Shri R.K. Shukla (PW-8)
who was posted as Assistant Sub-Inspector in police station Batiyagarh. The accused Kamlesh @
Amlesh was arrested on 15.09.2011 and on his memorandum, a pair of gold bangle was recovered.
Other ornaments were also recovered, vide Ex. P-4.
4. The present appellant Jittu @ Jitendra was arrested by Shri Pradeep Soni (PW-12) who was
posted as In-charge of Police Station Tejgarh in connection with Crime No. 194/2012. After his
arrest, he has disclosed about the ornaments robbed from the house of the present complainant
Rajdhar Vishwakarma and on his memorandum, Ex.P-12 the articles were seized vide Ex.P-13.
Thus, the articles contained in the said memorandum, Ex.P-13 from Article B to Article G were
identified by the complainant Rajdhar Vishwakarma (PW-2) and his wife Geeta Bai (PW-10).
5. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that so far as present appellant is concerned, he was not
identified and there was no seizure from him, therefore, the conviction is unsustainable. He also
argued that, in case his appeal does not succeed on merit, the same may be entertained on the
ground of sentence as the appellant has already undergone substantial jail sentence. It is further
submitted by him that the appellant was arrested in two other cases and was convicted in those
cases and this Court has already allowed the appeal in part and the sentence has been modified to
the period already undergone. In support of his arguments, he placed reliance on the order dated
10.10.2018 passed in CRA No. 4167/2018 (Jittu @ Jitendra @ Mangal Baba Vs. The State of M.P.).
6. Per-contra, learned Government Advocate for the State submits that there is no illegality in the
order of sentence. The order is passed after taking into consideration the entire evidence. It is
further submitted that the appellant and other co-accused were enjoying the hospitality of the
complainant and thereafter, offered some sweets to the complainant and his wife who became
unconscious and thereafter committed the offence of robbery and house tracepass and, therefore,
the appeal is liable to be dismissed.
7. After having heard, the learned counsel appearing for the parties, I do not find any merit in the
submission advanced on behalf of the appellant so far conviction is concerned.
8. The prosecution has successfully proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The complainant
Rajdhar Vishwakarma (PW-2) has clearly deposed that the co-accused Kamlesh @ Amlesh is the son
of his brother-in-law and the present appellant Jittu @ Jitendra is his friend, both had come to his
house and stayed there and thereafter, they went to Hanumat Ghati Temple and both of them came
back to his house in the night. Kamlesh @ Amlesh had offered some sweet to him and also to his
wife and after consuming the same, both of them became unconscious. When they reached at the

stage of consciousness after about 48 hours, they found that the ornaments kept in the house were
missing.
9. Another witness Geeta Bai (PW-10) also narrated the same version and stated that Kamlesh is the
son of her sister and he had come alongwith the present appellant to her house. They stayed in her
house and went to the temple of Hanumat Ghati after taking breakfast. They came back in the night
and offered some sweets. After consuming the sweets, they became unconscious and after treatment
in the hospital they became conscious. When they returned to the house, they found that the
ornaments were stolen from the house.
10. Report was lodged at Police Station concerned and the investigation was carried out by R.K.
Shukla (PW-8). He arrested the accused Kamlesh @ Amlesh and on his memorendum, her
ornaments (gold bangles) were seized, which were duly proved by the prosecution. The articles
seized, vide Ex.P-4, were identified by the complainant Rajdhar Vishwakarma.
11. The present appellant was also an accused of the another Crime No. 194/2012 registered at the
Police Station Tejgarh. He was arrested by Shri Pradeep Soni (PW-12) and on his memorandum
certain ornaments were seized. He stated that the aforesaid ornaments were stolen from the house
of the complainant. The seized articles were identified by the complainant Rajdhar Vishwakarma
(PW-2) and Geeta Bai (PW-
10), thus the prosecution has successfully established its case beyond any doubt.
12. In view of the aforesaid, I do not find any case for interference in appellate jurisdiction with the
order of conviction. In regard to other submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the
appellant has already undergone substantial jail sentence, the said aspect was also got verified by
the learned Government Advocate for the respondent/State. It is not in dispute that the present
appellant Jittu @ Jitendra remained in jail from 09.01.2013 to 29.04.2014 during the trial.
Thereafter, he was in jail since 26.03.2015 till date. In the other appeal CRA No. 4167/2018 filed by
the present appellant, where the appellant was convicted for offence punishable under Section 394
IPC and sentenced to undergo R.I. for three years alongwith fine of Rs.5000/- with default
stipulation. The Court after taking into consideration the conviction in the present case and the
other facts, has allowed the appeal in part on sentence. Taking into account the period of sentence
already undergone by the present appellant, I am of the considered view that that appellant has
already undergone substantial jail sentence during course of trial and during pendency of the
present appeal and therefore, the appeal is partly allowed on the ground of sentence only. The
sentence of the appellant under Section 450, 328 & 394 of IPC is reduced to the period of jail
sentence already undergone by the present appellant, but the order of conviction and fine is
maintained.
13. In view of the aforesaid assimilation of entire facts and evidence, the present appeal is partly
allowed on the question of sentence only. The appellant be set at liberty forthwith, if not wanted any
other case.
