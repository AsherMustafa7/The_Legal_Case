aforesaid, applicant no.1 and daughter of opposite party no.2 have decided to live
together as husband and wife. The copy of the said compromise/mutual deed, filed

court, where the proceedings are pending, after ensuring the presence of the parties
before it.

along with copy of compromise deed as well as a certified copy of this order. It is
expected that the trial court may fix a date for the verification of the compromise and
after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an appropriate order with respect to the
same in accordance with law, after hearing the informant, as expeditiously as
possible, preferably within a period of four weeks from today. While passing the
order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall also record the statement

parties have entered into a compromise and the copy of the same has also been enclosed along with
verification order, they have no objection, if the proceedings in the aforesaid case are quashed.
