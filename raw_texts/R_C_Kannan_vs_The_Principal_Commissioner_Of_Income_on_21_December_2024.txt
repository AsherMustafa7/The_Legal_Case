Senior Standing Counsel
COMMON ORDER
The petitioners are before this Court against the impugned orders both dated 15.02.2020 passed by
the 1st respondent under Section 264 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as 'IT
Act').
2. By the impugned orders dated 15.02.2020, the applications filed by the respective petitioners
under Section 264 of the IT Act who are husband and wife, have been rejected by two separate
orders which are impugned before this Court.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
3. The operative portion of the impugned orders dated 15.02.2020 read identically. For the purpose
of clarity, the operative portion of the impugned orders passed by the 1st respondent in both writ
petitions reproduced below:-
“Thus, the Income Tax Act has clearly spelt out the situations, where the income that
has to be assessed tax under head “Income from Other Sources”. The assumptions
and presumptions of the AR in the submissions cannot be acceptable in view of the
express provisions as laid out in the aforesaid section. The views given by the AR in
the submissions are not borne out of facts or the law laid down in the Income Tax
Act. The intention of legislature and the purpose for which the aforesaid law is
enacted is very clear. The Central Government has been time and again taking
various initiatives to curb the menace of black money circulation and there had been
dramatic changes in the recent past in the income tax law in this regard. Action
against black money is an on-going process. Such actions include policy-level
initiatives, effective enforcement action on the ground, putting in place robust
legislative and administrative frameworks, systems and processes. One of such
initiatives taken by the Central Government is the introduction of Section
56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) to the Income Tax Act, 1961, via Finance Act, 2012. The objective of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10311139/ 2
R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
introducing Section 56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) was to discourage the generation and use of
unaccounted money done through transaction in immovable property through a
value that is lesser than the value determined by the Stamp Valuation Authorities.
4. It is to be noted further that the then authorized representative had accepted the above action of
the AO as can be seen from the marking of signature in the order sheet against the narration of the
AO in the said order sheet on invoking the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764
of 2020 provisions of said section. Coming to the case laws relied upon by the assessee.
i.CIT Vs. Chandani Bochar 323 ITR 519 (P & H). ii.Sunil Kumar Agarwal Vs. CIT (Calcutta High
Court 225 Taxmann) iii.CIT Vs. Sarijan Realities Ltd.
iv.CIT Vs. Hanuman Prasad Ganeriwala v.Mahtab Alam, New Delhi Vs. ITD vi.K.P.Varghese Vs. ITO
From the above, it is amply clear that the case laws relied upon by the AR is on a different footing
and on a different set of facts and in no way connected or related to the facts of the assessee's case.
Moreover, in the assessee's case, the invoking of Section 56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) of the Act has been
accepted by the Assessee during assessment proceedings and no objection whatsoever, has been
placed on record by the assessee at the assessment stage. It is also noticed from the records that the
tax demanded thereon based on the assessment order supra has been duly complied by the assessee
by payment of taxes in instalment. Hence, the present petition u/s 264 of the Act lacks merit and is
not tenable.
5. Considering the facts of the case, the petition filed by the assessee u/s 264 of the Act is hereby
rejected, as it is held that the AO had rightly invoked the aforesaid Section and brought to tax the
correct amount in the hands of the assessee for the Asst. Year 2015-16.”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
4. The facts of the case are that the petitioners have jointly purchased a property measuring an
extent of 2,791 sq.ft., from one V.Suresh Kumar for a total consideration of Rs.72,00,000/- vide
Registered Doc.No.2722 of 2014 dated 30.06.2014. However, they accepted to pay the stamp duty
on the guideline value of Rs.97,69,000/- at the instance of the SRO.
5. On the aforesaid guideline value, the petitioners paid a sum of Rs.6,00,000/- towards stamp duty.
In the returns of income that were filed by the respective petitioners, they had admitted total income
of Rs.4,90,390/- (Rs.2,26,820/- + Rs.2,63,570/-) respectively.
6. The case of the petitioners was selected for limited scrutiny under CASS and the petitioners were
called upon to attend the personal hearing pursuant to Notice dated 29.07.2016 issued under
Section 143(2) of the IT Act.
7. During the course of the proceedings before the Assessing Officer, copy of the Sale Deed dated
30.06.2014 was produced. The Assessing https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of
2020 Officer agreed for additions to be made. Thus, an Assessment Orders came to be passed on
30.11.2017, whereby, the difference between the value adopted by the respective petitioners in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10311139/ 3
R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
Sale Deed dated 30.06.2014 and the guideline value was taxed in the hands of the respective
petitioners by equally dividing the difference.
8. Thus, a sum of Rs.12,84,500/- (Rs. 25,69,000 divided by 2) came to be added to the income of
the respective petitioners. Details of the additions are as under:
Guideline Value – Rs.97,69,000/-
Sale Consideration – Rs.72,00,000/-
________________
Difference – Rs.25,69,000/-
________________
The amount of Rs.97,69,000/- did not include the stamp duty and registration
charges of Rs.6,00,000/-.
9. In the Return of Income dated 01.09.2015 for the Assessment Year 2015-2016, they have declared
the total consideration of Rs.72,00,000/- towards the purchase.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
10. The Income Tax Officer/Assessing Officer noticed that there was a difference, as stamp duty was
added and eventually assessed the value of the property to Rs.1,03,69,000/-. Under these
circumstances, the assessment was completed by the Assessing Officer.
11. By applying Section 56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) of the IT Act, the Assessing Officer only added a sum of
Rs.12,84,500/- to the income of the petitioners from other sources in addition to the amount
declared in the returns filed by the respective petitioners without including the stamp duty of
Rs.6,00,000/-.
12. Before the Assessing Officer, the petitioners were represented by an Authorized Representative
(AR) who agreed for the additions and thus, based on the above additions, the assessment was
completed on 30.11.2017 for the Assessment Year 2015-2016.
13. Aggrieved over the same, the respective petitioners had filed revision petitions under Section 264
of the IT Act, though belatedly. The 1 st respondent has condoned the delay in the interest of natural
justice but has rejected the revision petitions with the following observations:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 “From the above, it
is amply clear that the case laws relied upon by the AR is on a different footing and on
a different set of facts and in no way connected or related to the facts of the assessee's
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10311139/ 4
R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
case. Moreover, in the assessee's case, the invoking of the Section 56(2)(viib)(ii) of
the Act has been accepted by the assessee during assessment proceedings and no
objection whatsoever, has been placed on record by the assessee at the assessment
stage. It is also noticed from the records that the tax demanded thereon based on the
assessment order supra has been duly complied by the assessee by payment of taxes
in instalment. Hence, the present petition u/s 264 of the Act lacks merit and is not
tenable.”
14. Learned counsel for the petitioners would draw attention to Section 50C(2) of the IT Act.
15. Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that it was incumbent on the part of the
Assessing Officer to have obtained a valuation report from the Stamp Valuation Officer/Stamp
Valuation Authority. It is further submitted that merely because the Authorized Representative of
the respective petitioners had wrongly admitted to the addition ipso facto would not mean that the
value adopted has to be upheld. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
16. Learned counsel for the petitioners would draw attention to Section 56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) of the IT
Act. Learned counsel also referred to Proviso to Section 56(2)(vii)(c) of the IT Act.
17. It is further submitted that the petitioners are individuals who have unnecessarily been exposed
to tax liability which was totally unwarranted merely because the guidelines value of the property
was shown as higher.
18. Learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn attention to the decision of the Division Bench of
this Court referred in The Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai Vs. Shri Vummudi Amarendran
(T.C.A.No.329 of 2020 dated 28.09.2020), wherein, referring to the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in R.Saibharathi Vs. J.Jayalalitha reported in 2004 (2) SCC 9, the Division Bench of
this Court held as follows:-
“7. Before we proceed to consider as to whether proviso inserted in Section 50C of the
Act has to be read retrospective or prospective, we need to point out that the
Assessing Officer did not doubt the bonafides of the transaction done by the assessee,
since the Assessing Officer accepted the fact that the assessee
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 had entered into an
Agreement for Sale of the property in question vide Agreement for Sale dated
04.08.2012, wherein agreed sale consideration was Rs.19 Crores and the assessee had
received Rs.6 Crores by way of account payee cheque on the date of signing the
Agreement. This fact was noted by the CIT(A) and held that the Agreement cannot be
treated to be ante-dated as the assessee had received Rs.6 crores as advance on the
date of Agreement through banking channel. The only reason for the Assessing
Officer to adopt higher value is based upon the guideline value fixed by the State
Government. The question would be as to what is the effect of the guideline value
fixed by the Government and the purpose behind fixing the same. This aspect was
clearly explained in the case of J.Jayalalitha. It has been pointed out that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10311139/ 5
R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
guideline value has relevance only in the context of Section 47A of the Indian Stamp
Act (as amended by Tamil Nadu Act 24 of 1967) which provides for dealing with
instruments of conveyance which are undervalued. The guideline value is a rate fixed
by the authorities under the Stamp Act for the purpose of determining the true
market value of the property disclosed in an instrument requiring payment of stamp
duty. Thus the guideline value fixed is not final but only a prima facie rate prevailing
in an area to ascertain the true or correct market value. It is open to the Registering
Authority as well as the person seeking registration to prove the actual market value
of the property. The authorities cannot regard the guideline valuation as the last word
on the subject of market value but only a factor to be taken note of, if at all available
in respect of an area in which the property transferred lies. It was further pointed out
that this position is made clear in the explanation to Rule 3 of the Tamil Nadu Stamp
(Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments) Rules, 1968; this explanation also will
have to be read in conjunction with explanation to Section 47(A) of the Indian Stamp
Act (as amended by the Tamil Nadu Act 24/1967). It was further pointed out that
undue emphasis on the guideline value without referred to the setting in which it is to
be viewed will obscure the issue for consideration. Further it was held that in any
event, if for the purpose of the Stamp Act, guideline value alone is not a factor to
determine the value of the property, its worth will not be any higher in the context of
assessing the true market value of the properties in question to ascertain whether the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 transaction has
resulted in any offense so as to give a pecuniary advantage to one party or other.”
19. It is submitted that the Division Bench of this Court held that the Assessing Officer could not
have based his conclusion solely based on the guideline value which has been held to be only a prima
facie rate prevailing in the area to ascertain the true or correct market value and it is not the last
word on the subject of market value but only a factor to be taken note of.
20. On the other hand, the learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondents would submit that
the impugned orders does not suffer from any irregularity or illegality warranting interference
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
21. Specifically, the learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondents would draw attention to
the initiatives of the Government for inserting/introducing Section 56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) of the IT Act
vide Finance Act, 2012. It is further submitted that the objective of inserting/introducing the
aforesaid provision was to discourage the generation and use of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 unaccounted money done through transaction in immovable
property through a value that is lesser than the value determined by the Stamp Valuation
Authorities is adopted.
22. It is therefore submitted that the impugned orders do not call for any interference and prays for
dismissal of the writ petition.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10311139/ 6
R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
23. I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondents.
24. I have also perused the Assessment Order dated 30.11.2017 passed under Section 143(3) of the
IT Act by the 2nd respondent in both the Writ Petitions. I have also perused the impugned orders
dated 15.02.2020 passed by the 1st respondent under Section 264 of the IT Act.
25. The point that arises for consideration is whether Section 50C(2) of the IT Act is relevant to the
facts of the case. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
26. Section 50C of the IT Act itself came to be incorporated into the statute book by Finance Act,
2002 w.e.f. 01.04.2003. Section 50C of the IT Act reads as under:-

R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
value adopted in the Sale Deed and the value adopted by the appropriate authority for the purpose
of payment of stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. As far as the buyer is concerned, it is
only Section 56 of the IT Act which is relevant.
29. I shall deal with Section 56 of the IT Act in due course.
30. As per Section 50C(1) of the IT Act where the consideration received or accruing as a result of
transfer by an assessee of the capital asset, being land or building or both, is less than the value
adopted or assessed or assessable by any authority of a State Government for the purpose of
payment of stamp duty value in respect of such transfer, the value so adopted or assessed or
assessable by such authority shall, for the purposes of Section 48, be deemed to be the full value of
the consideration received or accruing as a result of transfer.
31. Thus, the value adopted for the purposes of payment of stamp duty value shall be deemed to be
the full value of the consideration received or accrued as a result of such transfer.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
32. As per sub-section 2 to Section 50C of the IT Act where the assessee claims before any Assessing
Officer that the value adopted or assessed or assessable by the stamp valuation authority under
sub-section (1) exceeds the fair market value of the property as on the date of transfer and the value
so adopted or assessed or assessable by the stamp valuation authority under sub-section (1) to
Section 50C of the IT Act has not been disputed in any appeal or revision or no reference has been
made before any other authority, Court or the High Court, the Assessing Officer as the case may be
refer the valuation of the capital assets to a Valuation Officer. Where such a reference is made, the
provisions of sub-section 2, sub-section 3, sub-section 4, sub-section 5, sub-section 6 of Section 16A,
clause (i) of sub-section (1) and sub-sections (6) and sub-section 7 of Section 23A, sub- section (5) of
Section 24, Section 34AA, Section 35 and Section 37 of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 (27 of 1957), shall
with necessary modifications, apply in relation to such reference as they apply in relation to a
reference made by the Assessing Officer under sub-section 1 of Section 16A of that Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
33. As per Section 56(1) of the IT Act, income of every kind which is not to be excluded from the
“total income” under the Act shall be chargeable to income-tax under the head “Income from other
sources”, if it is not chargeable to income-tax under any of the heads specified in Section 14, Items A
to E.
34. Under sub-section 2 to Section 56, several incomes have been grouped. They are chargeable to
Income-tax under the head “Income from other sources”.
35. TRANSFER OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY WITHOUT CONSIDERATION:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10311139/ 9
R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
Under sub-clause (vii)(b)(i) to sub-section (2) to Section 56 of the IT Act, where an
individual or a Hindu Undivided Family receives any immovable property without
consideration from any person or persons on or after the 1st day of October 2009,
but, before the 1st day of April 2017, where the stamp duty value of such immovable
property exceeds https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
Rs.50,000/- in any previous year, the value of such property for consideration shall
be the income of such person chargeable to income-tax under the head “Income from
other sources.”
36. TRANSFER OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY WITH CONSIDERATION:
On the other hand, under sub-clause (vii)(b)(ii) to sub-section (2) to Section 56 of the
IT Act where an individual or a Hindu Undivided Family receives any immovable
property for consideration which is less than the stamp duty value of the property by
an amount exceeding Rs.50,000/- in any previous year, from any person or persons
on or after the 1st day of October 2009, but, before the 1st day of April 2017, the
differential stamp duty value of such property exceeding such consideration shall be
chargeable to tax.
37. Although Section 56(2)(vii)(c) of the IT Act applies only any property, other than immovable
property, the first proviso to it makes it clear that in case of immovable property, where the stamp
duty value of immovable property as referred to in sub-clause (b) is disputed by the assessee on
grounds mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 50C, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 Assessing Officer may refer the valuation of such property to a
Valuation Officer and the provisions of Section 50C and sub-section (15) of Section 155 shall, as far
as may be, apply in relation to the stamp duty value of such property for the purpose of sub-clause
(b) as they apply for valuation of capital asset under those sections. Section 50C of the IT Act does
not contain a ground for objecting the valuation by the seller of the immovable property. However,
under the first proviso to Section 56(2)(vii)(c) of the IT Act, it is specified as a ground to make a
reference to the Valuation Officer. Thus, there is ambiguity in Section 50C of the IT Act.
38. Section 56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) and Section 56(2)(vii)(c) of the IT Act are reproduced below:-
56. Income from other sources.

39. Sub-Clause (vii) to Section 56(2) of the IT Act was substituted by Finance (No.17) Act, 2013 w.e.f
01.04.2014. Since, the sale was registered on 30.06.2014, the above amendments are relevant.
40. In this case, admittedly, the value declared in the Sale Deed was Rs.72,00,000/-. The value
adopted by the SRO was Rs.97,69,000/-. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of
2020
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10311139/ 12
R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
41. Thus, the differential value exceeds Rs.50,000/-. Therefore, the present case is covered by
Section 56(2)(vii)(b)(ii) of the IT Act as extracted in the above tabular column. Thus, the value
adopted for assessment of the stamp duty by the SRO at Rs.97,69,000/- has to be adopted for the
purpose of computation of Income of the petitioner. If the value is disputed on the grounds
mentioned in sub-section (2) of section 50C, the Assessing Officer may refer the valuation of such
property to a Valuation Officer, and the provisions of Section 50C and sub-section (15) of Section
155 shall, as far as may be, apply in relation to the stamp duty value of such property for the purpose
of sub-clause (b) as they apply for valuation of capital asset under those sections.
42. In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai Vs. Shri Vummudi Amarendran
(T.C.A.No.329 of 2020 dated 28.09.2020), following substantial questions of law were framed by
the Division Bench of this Court:
1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
holding that the amendment to Section 50C which was introduced with effect from
2017-18 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
prospectively was applicable retrospectively for the assessment year 2014-15 when
the language used in the proviso does not indicate that it was inserted as a
clarification?
2. Is not the reasoning and finding of the Tribunal bad by holding that the
prospective amendment to provisions Section 50C for the assessment year 2017-18 is
applicable retrospectively to assessment year 2014-15 without appreciating the fact
that unless explicitly stated a piece of legislation is presumed not to be intended to
have retrospective operation based on the principle ''lex prospicit non respicit''
meaning that the law look forward and not backwards?
The case pertained to the Assessment Year 2014-2015. It dealt with Section 50C(1) of the IT Act as it
stood between 2009 and 2013. There the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in R.Saibharathi
Vs. J.Jayalalitha, 2004 (2) SCC 9 was referred.
43. In Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai Vs. Shri Vummudi Amarendran (T.C.A.No.329 of
2020 dated 28.09.2020), the Division Bench of this Court while deciding whether the amendment
to Section 50C(1) of the IT Act in 2017 can be retrospectively applied to the Assessment Year
2014-15, referred to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax,
Kolkata Vs. Calcutta Export https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020
Company reported in 2018 (404) ITR 654 (SC). There, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had observed
that a new proviso can be given retrospective effect with the insertion on the ground that the proviso
was added to remedy unintended consequences and supply an obvious omission. So, a retrospective
effect would serve the object behind the enactment. Taking note of the same, the Division Bench of
this Court in the aforesaid case held that the proviso to Section 50C(1) of the IT Act can be given a
retrospective effect.

R.C.Kannan vs The Principal Commissioner Of Income ... on 21 December, 2024
44. At the time of personal hearing before the Assessing Officer, the Authorized Representative of
the petitioner did not dispute the valuation. In fact, the Authorized Representative accepted to the
addition which culminated in the Assessment Order dated 30.11.2017.
45. The case of the petitioners has to be looked at from the point of view of Section 56(2)(vii)(b) of
the IT Act which has been extracted above. Since the guideline value of the property is more than the
value adopted in the Sale Deed dated 30.06.2014, the petitioners herein would be entitled to take
advantage of the first proviso to sub-clause (vii)(c) to sub-section 2 to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 Section 56 of the IT Act read with
Section 50C(2) of the IT Act.
46. The first proviso to sub-clause (vii)(c) to sub-section 2 to Section 56 of the IT Act entitles the
petitioner to raise a dispute regarding the valuation of the immovable property as in the case of a
seller under sub- section 2 to Section 50 of the IT Act, in which case, the Assessing Officer has to
refer the valuation of such property viz., capital asset to the Valuation Officer.
47. Provisions of Section 50C & sub-section 15 to Section 155 of the IT Act are to apply in relation to
the stamp duty value of such property for the purpose of sub-clause (vii)(b) to sub-section 2 to
Section 56 of the IT Act as they would apply for valuation of the capital asset under those sections.
48. Thus, it is clear that if the valuation is disputed, the conditions stipulated in sub-clause (a) & (b)
to sub-section 2 to Section 50C will apply. Therefore, I am of the view that the impugned orders
rejecting the request of the respective petitioners for revising the orders is unsustainable and
therefore, the same warrants interference. The Assessing Officer has to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 therefore refer the valuation of the
property viz., capital asset under proviso to sub-clause (vii)(c) to sub-section 2 to Section 56 of the
IT Act to the Valuation Officer.
49. Merely because the Authorized Representative of the petitioner did not raise any objection
before the Assessment Order dated 30.11.2017 was passed, ipso facto would not mean that reference
under sub-clause
(vii)(c) to sub-section 2 to Section 56 of the IT Act would be barred.
50. Even if, no objections was raised before the Assessing Officer prior to the assessment order
being passed, the assessee would still be entitled to raise such objections both before the Revisional
Authority under Section 264 of the IT Act or before the Appellate Commissioner under Section 246A
of the IT Act as these proceedings are continuation of the original assessment proceedings.
51. Under such circumstances, the impugned orders are liable to be quashed and the cases are
remitted back to the 2nd respondent to re-do the exercise under first proviso to sub-clause (vii)(c) to
sub-section 2 to Section https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.5763 & 5764 of 2020 56 of the
IT Act read with sub-section 2 to Section 50C of the IT Act.

52. Since the dispute pertains to Assessment Years 2015-16, the 2nd respondent shall endeavour to
pass a final order on merits, as expeditiously as possible, preferably, within a period of six months
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
53. In the result, these writ petitions are disposed of with the above observations. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
