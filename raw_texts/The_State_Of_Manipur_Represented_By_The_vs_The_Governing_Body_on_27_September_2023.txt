JUDGMENT & ORDER
(CAV)
(A. Guneshwar Sharma, J)
[1] The present application has been filed by the applicants under
Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 read with Rule 3(2) of Chapter IV-A as
well as Rule 2 of the Chapter-VIII of the High Court of Manipur Rules, 2019
for condoning an unintentional delay of 334 days in filing the accompanying
Writ Appeal.
MC(W.A.) No.43 of 2023
Page |4
[2] The brief fact of the present case is that the applicants filed the
accompanying Writ Appeal challenging the legality and propriety of the
impugned Judgment and Order dated 25.02.2022 passed by learned Single
Judge in W.P.(C) No.1057 of 2018. The present Respondents, who were the
writ petitioners, filed W.P.(C) No.1057 of 2018 praying for directing the
State Respondents to allow the petitioners (respondents herein) to function
until the handing and taking over of Mayai Lambi College and Thambal Marik
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144329615/ 3
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs The Governing Body on 27 September, 2023
College and to quash the order dated 20.10.2018 passed by the respondent
No.1 (applicant No.1 herein). The writ petition was disposed on 25.02.2022
with a direction to the State Respondents to absorb the 11(eleven)
employees (Teaching Staff-5 and Non-Teaching - 6) of the Thambal Marik
College, Oinam.
[2.1] Being aggrieved by the order dated 25.02.2022 passed in
W.P.(C) No.1057 of 2018, the accompanying Writ Appeal is preferred mainly
inter-alia on the grounds that the Ld. Single Judge failed to appreciate that
the order dated 20.10.2018 was issued as a natural consequence of the
decision of the State Cabinet taken on 28.02.2018. The Ld. Single Judge,
also failed to give an opportunity to the State respondents to counter/reply
to the Addl. Affidavit filed by the petitioners on 24.02.2022. It is stated that
on 12.12.2022, the Administrative approval for preferring Appeal was

obtained. Thereafter, on 13.12.2022, the concerned File was referred to Law
Dept. and on 19.12.2022, the Deputy Secretary (Law) issued an Order
bearing No.5/29/2922-Case/L-(HC)Pt.dated 19-12-2022 for engagement of

Page |6 [2.3] In pursuance of the Law Dept.'s order dated 19.12.2022, engagement of Govt. Advocate
(High Court) was issued for filing Appeal. [3] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. AG for the applicants
has submitted that while filing the accompanying Writ Appeal, there is an unintentional and bona
fide delay of 334 days which has been caused due to the circumstances as explained hereunder:-

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs The Governing Body on 27 September, 2023
14. 22-12-2022 Dy. Govt. Advocate sent letter to administrative Dept for finishing document
regarding Grounds of Appeal.
15. 05-01-2023 Administrative Dept furnished Grounds of Appeal and documents.
16. 17-01-2023 Additional Grounds for Appeal furnished by Administrative Department.
17. 10-02-2023 Dy. Govt. Advocate sought instructions from Administrative Dept.
18. 23-02-2023 After discussion and examination, Administrative Department return back the duly
signed Appeal Petition.
Page |8 [3.1] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. AG has submitted that there are some delays in file
processing from table to table and from Department to Department during the decision making
process. After calculation, there was delay of 334 days in filing the above referred Writ Appeal. He
has further submitted that some considerable time was consumed by the Government Advocate for
preparation of Memo of Appeal and Misc. Application due to unavoidable workload owing to
shortage of supporting Staff. Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. AG has submitted that there are good
grounds for succeeding the Appeal and has prayed that the Misc. Application, for condoning the
delay of 334 days in filing the accompanying Writ Appeal, be allowed. If the same is not allowed, the
impugned order of granting a relief not prayed in the writ petition will be perpetuated. [4] Mr. D.
Julius Riamei, learned counsel for Respondent Nos.1 & 2 has submitted that the
Applicants/Appellants have failed to show any good and sufficient cause for the delay in filing the
present appeal, as provided under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and Rule 3 (2) of Chapter IV
A of the Manipur High Court Rules, 2019. He has further submitted that the Applicants/Appellants
have filed the present appeal before this Court only after the filing of the Contempt Case No.29 of
2023 for compliance of the order dated 25.02.2022 passed in WP (C) No.1057 of 2018. It is stated
that Page |9 the same clearly manifests the filing of the present appeal as an afterthought. It is
submitted that there was clearly lack of diligence and bonafide on the part of the
Applicant/Appellants while preferring the present appeal. There are unexplained days/months in
the delay while preferring the present appeal as shown in the present application under reply. The
explanation sought to be given for the cause of delay in preferring the appeal is not satisfactory and
lacks bonafide. It is submitted that there is no sufficient cause in explaining the 334 days delay while
preferring the appeal before this Court. The learned Single Judge passed the order on 25.02.2022.
The table shown in para 7 under reply shows huge gaps of unexplained days and there is no
justification for calling the report for the Directorate for the fifth time. Such an unexplained long
days of delay does not warrant a beneficial treatment from this Court. He prays for dismissal of the
Misc. Application for condonation of delay.
[5] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. AG has submitted that with reference to the period in between
28.4.2022 to 12.12.2022, it is explained that the same was caused due to the illness of the concerned
Legal Officer dealing with the matter and at that relevant time, the Directorate was heavily engaged
for conversion of 6(six) Aided Colleges including Mayai Lambi College and Thambal Marik College,
the relevant File could not be P a g e | 10 processed for filing Appeal. Taking over of these Aided
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144329615/ 6
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs The Governing Body on 27 September, 2023
Colleges into full- fledged Government Colleges involved assessment of land, building, other
property, verification of teaching and non-teaching staff, etc. Although the Court's Order was passed
on 25.2.2022, the Administrative Department received the same only on 25.4.2022 vide legal notice
dated 22.4.2022 of the Petitioner's counsel and letter dated 28.4.2022 from the concerned
Government Advocate dealing the case. As such, State Government came to know the Court's Order
dated 25.2.2022 passed in WP(C) No.1057 of 2018 only on 25.4.2022. He further submitted that on
20.5.2022, File was put up by the Legal Office to call a detailed report from the Director (UHE),
Manipur as the matter was related to appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff of Thambal
Marik College, Oinam. On 10.10.2022, Legal Officer (Hr. & Tech. Edn), Government of Manipur also
communicated the Addl. Director, University & Higher Education, Manipur vide letter
No.Writ/11/87/2018- HE/Case dated 10.10.2022 by enclosing the letters dated 4.7.2022 and
9.8.2022 thereby requesting to furnish a detail comment along with relevant documents. On
5.12.2022, although no comment was received from the Director despite repeated reminders, Legal
Officer put up the File for further reference to the Law Department. On 12.6.2023, the Director
(Univ. & Hr. Edn.), Government of Manipur explained that the delay in submission of P a g e | 11
comment/relevant documents to the Government was caused as Shri L. Itobombi Singh, Legal
Officer of Directorate of University and Higher Education was not able to work on it for a long time
due to health issues and also some time was consumed in gathering required information/
documents on the matter for furnishing to the Government. [6] Heard Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy.
AG for the State, Mr. D. Julius Riamei, learned counsel for Respondent Nos.1 & 2, Mr. S. Samarjeet,
learned Sr.PCCG for respondent Nos.3 & 4, Mr. Sushilkumar, learned counsel for respondent No.7,
Mr. P. Tamphamani, learned counsel for respondent No.8 and perused the materials available on
record. [7] Mr. D. Julius Riamei, learned counsel for Respondent Nos.1 & 2 refers to a case of Shri
Gainaichung Malangmei vs. The State of Manipur & Ors., Judgment & Order dated 04.04.2022
passed by a Division Bench of this Court in MC(WA) No.70 of 2022 and Judgment & Order dated
13.03.2023 passed by another Division Bench of this Court in MC(WA) No.48 of 2020 & MC(WA)
No.75 of 2021. He further draws the attention of this Court to the fact that the legal officer was
processing the file for filing the present appeal, while the P a g e | 12 applicants stated that as the
legal officer was unwell the file could not be processed in time.
[8] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. AG refers to a case of State of Nagaland vs. Lipok AO & Others
reported as (2005) 3 SCC 752 where Para 13 is reproduced hereinbelow:-
13. Experience shows that on account of an impersonal machinery (no one in charge
of the matter is directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal)
and the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the note-
making, file-pushing, and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on its part is less difficult to understand
though more difficult to approve. The State which represents collective cause of the community,
does not deserve a litigant-non-grata status. The courts, therefore, have to be informed with the
spirit and philosophy of the provision in the course of the interpretation of the expression of
sufficient cause. Merit is preferred to scuttle a decision on merits in turning down the case on
technicalities of delay in presenting the appeal. Delay as accordingly condoned, the order was set
aside and the matter was remitted to the High Court for disposal on merits after affording
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144329615/ 7
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs The Governing Body on 27 September, 2023
opportunity of hearing to the parties. In Prabha v. Ram Parkash Kalra11 this Court had held that the
court should not adopt an injustice- oriented approach in rejecting the application for condonation
of delay. The appeal was allowed, the delay was condoned and the P a g e | 13 matter was remitted
for expeditious disposal in accordance with law.
[8.1] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. GA also refers to the case of State of Manipur & Others vs.
Koting Lamkang reported as (2019) 10 SCC 408 where Para 6, 7 & 8 are reproduced hereinbelow:-
6. Insofar as the refusal by the High Court to condone the delay of 312 days in the
RFA preferred by the State of Manipur and others, it is apparent that the appellants
did prefer the appeal at first instance on 15-06-2017 before the District Judge.
But since this was before the wrong forum and it was filed after a delay of about eleven months and
there is no explanation for the time taken by the State between 18-7-2016 and 15-6-2017, the delay
in the RFA before the High Court was not condoned. In fact the Court found that the State has not
shown as to what prevented them from preferring the appeal before the District Judge (wrong
forum), until 15-6-2017. The Court also said that the latitude in applying the standards of "sufficient
cause" test is not attracted, in the instant case.
7. But while concluding as above, it was necessary for the Court to also be conscious of the
bureaucratic delay and the slow pace in reaching a government decision and the routine way of
deciding whether the State should prefer an appeal against a judgment adverse to it. Even while
observing that the law of limitation would harshly affect the party, the Court felt P a g e | 14 that the
delay in the appeal filed by the State, should not be condoned.
8. Regard should be had in similar such circumstances to the impersonal nature of the
Government's functioning where individual officers may fail to act responsibly. This in turn, would
result in injustice to the institutional interest of the State. If the appeal by the State are lost for
individual default, those who are at fault, will not usually be individually affected. [8.2] Mr. H.
Debendra, learned Dy. AG further relies on the judgment of Esha Bhattacharjee vs. Managing
Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy & Others reported as (2013) 12 SCC 649. Para 21 is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
21. From the aforesaid authorities the principles that can broadly be culled out are:
21.1. (i) There should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice-
oriented, non-pedantic approach while dealing with an application for condonation of delay, for the
courts are not supposed to legalise injustice but are obliged to remove injustice.
21.2. (ii) The terms "sufficient cause" should be understood in their proper spirit, philosophy and
purpose regard being had to the fact that these terms are basically elastic and P a g e | 15 are to be
applied in proper perspective to the obtaining fact- situation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144329615/ 8
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs The Governing Body on 27 September, 2023
21.3 (iii) Substantial justice being paramount and pivotal the technical considerations should not be
given undue and uncalled for emphasis.
21.4 (iv) No presumption can be attached to deliberate causation of delay but, gross negligence on
the part of the counsel or litigant is to be taken note of.
21.5 (v) Lack of bona fides imputable to a party seeking condonation of delay is a significant and
relevant fact.
21.6 (vi) It is to be kept in mind that adherence to strict proof should not affect public justice and
cause public mischief because the courts are required to be vigilant so that in the ultimate eventuate
there is no real failure of justice.
21.7 (vii) The concept of liberal approach has to encapsulate the conception of reasonableness and it
cannot be allowed a totally unfettered free play.
21.8 (viii) There is a distinction between inordinate delay and a delay of short duration or few days,
for to the former doctrine of prejudice is attracted whereas to the latter it may not be attracted. That
apart, the first one warrants strict approach whereas the second calls for a liberal delineation.
P a g e | 16 21.9 (ix) The conduct, behaviour and attitude of a party relating to its inaction or
negligence are relevant factors to be taken into consideration. It is so as the fundamental principle is
that the courts are required to weigh the scale of balance of justice in respect of both parties and the
said principle cannot be given a total go by in the name of liberal approach.
21.10 (x) If the explanation offered is concocted or the grounds urged in the application are fanciful,
the courts should be vigilant not to expose the other side unnecessarily to face such a litigation.
21.11 (xi) It is to be borne in mind that no one gets away with fraud, misrepresentation or
interpolation by taking recourse to the technicalities of law of limitation.
21.12 (xii) The entire gamut of facts are to be carefully scrutinised and the approach should be based
on the paradigm of judicial discretion which is founded on objective reasoning and not on individual
perception.
21.13 (xiii) The State or a public body or an entity representing a collective cause should be given
some acceptable latitude.
[8.3] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. AG clarifies that there are two legal officers- one in Directorate
and another in the Secretariat. It is the legal officer posted in the Directorate who was unwell at the
relevant time P a g e | 17 and due to his illness, the file could not be processes for a long period of
about 6 months. The legal officer mentioned by Mr. Julius is the one posted in the Secretariat. It is
stated that there is no wrong statement has been made by the applicants while explaining the details
of time taken in preferring the appeal. He submits that the present application requires sympathetic
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144329615/ 9
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs The Governing Body on 27 September, 2023
consideration from this Court in order to prevent implementation of the direction of the learned
Single Judge which is prima facie cannot be executed in the present form. It is pointed out that the
relief granted is not prayed for the writ petitioners. [9] Learned counsel for the other respondents
submit that this Court may pass appropriate order in the facts and circumstances of the present
case.
[10] We have considered the submissions of the parties, the materials on record and relevant case
law in this regard. In the table furnished by the applicants, it is seen that the major delay of about 6
months' time was taken while waiting for report from the Directorate. This has been explained by
learned Dy AG as the concerned legal officer of the Directorate was unwell at the relevant time. For
the remaining period, the time taken for movement of the file from one desk to another and from
one office to another does not P a g e | 18 seem to be fatal. The case laws referred to above lay down
the principle that while considering an application for condonation of delay, a liberal, pragmatic,
justice oriented and non-pedantic approach has to be adopted and mere technicalities should not
amount to in perpetuating injustice. Substantial justice should prevail over hyper technicalities.
Whether a relief not prayed for has been granted or not is an important question which requires
consideration on merit. We are of the view that the delay of 334 days in filing the accompanying
appeal be condoned subject to the payment of a cost of Rs. 5000/- (Rupees five thousand) only in
favour of the High Court Bar Association, Manipur. On submission of proof of payment of such cost,
the Registry is directed to number the accompanying appeal. With these observations and
directions, the application is allowed and disposed of.
