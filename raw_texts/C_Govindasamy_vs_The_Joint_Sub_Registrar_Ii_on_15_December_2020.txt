ORDER
On consent given by either side, the main writ petition itself has been taken up for final hearing.
2. This writ petition has been filed challenging the impugned refusal check slips issued by the 1st
respondent dated 02.11.2020 and for consequential direction to the 1st respondent to register the
sale certificate dated 30.07.2020 issued in favour of the 1st petitioner by the 2nd petitioner.
http://www.judis.nic.in
3. The case of the petitioners is that the 2nd respondent was sanctioned a Housing Loan by the 2nd
petitioner and he created an equitable mortgage in favour of the 2nd petitioner on 17.04.2017 and
this was also registered as Document No.665 of 2017 before the 1st respondent. The borrower
defaulted in payment of the loan and the loan ultimately was classified as 'NPA' on 31.08.2018.
4. The 2nd petitioner initiated proceedings under SARFAESI Act and ultimately, the mortgaged
property was brought for sale through private treaty and the 1st petitioner paid a sum of
Rs.35,10,000/- and the sale was confirmed in his favour. A sale certificate came to be issued in
favour of the 1st petitioner by the 2nd petitioner on 30.07.2020.
5. When the above sale certificate was sought to be registered before the 1st respondent, the same
was refused to be registered on the ground that the subject property was subjected to an order of
attachment by the Sub-Court, Gopichettipalayam in I.A.No.27 of 2018 in O.S.No.11
http://www.judis.nic.in of 2018. Aggrieved by the same, the present writ petition has been filed
before this Court.
6. Heard Ms.V.V.Uthra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of petitioners and Mr.T.M.Pappiah,
learned Special Government Pleader appearing on behalf of first respondent.

7. The issue involved in the present writ petition is squarely covered by earlier order passed by this
Court in W.P.No.16523 of 2020 dated 07.12.2020 and the relevant portions of the order are
extracted hereunder:
'10. The issue involved in the present writ petition is squarely covered by the earlier
orders passed by this Court. One such order, passed in W.P.No.7497 of 2019 dated
26.04.2019 can be relied upon for the purpose of this case. The relevant portions of
the order are extracted hereunder:
''3. The issue as to whether the 2nd respondent is entitled to refuse registration of the
document presented by the petitioner on the ground that the subject matter property
is under Court attachment, is no more res integra, in view of the several orders
passed by this Court in similar issue deciding against the Registration
http://www.judis.nic.in Department. One such recent order was passed by this Court
in W.P.No.1094/2019 dated 26.03.2019, wherein it is observed as follows:
“8. The above issue involved in this case is no more res integra in view of the fact that
the very same issue was already considered by this Court and decided against the
registering authority in a decision made in W.P.No.10647/2007 dated 13.10.2018. In
fact, this Court, while passing the said order, followed the order passed in
W.P.(MD).No.2632/2012 dated 13.03.2013, which in turn, followed the decision of
the Apex Court reported in 1985 (2) SCC 167 (Balkrishan Gupta v. Swadeshi Polytex
Limited). Paragraph Nos. 7 and 8 of the said order reads as follows:
7. The point for consideration in this writ petition is whether the respondent is
entitled to refuse registration of the sale deed on the ground that the subject matter
properties of the sale deed are under Court attachment. The very same issue was
considered by this Court in W.P.No.36079 of 2015 reported in 2016 (3) CTC 493
(S.Praveen Bohra vs. Joint-I Sub-Registrar) and the learned Judge found that the
order of attachment cannot be a bar to register the document. In order to arrive at
such conclusion, the learned Judge relied on several decisions of this Court as well as
Apex Court. At paragraph Nos.6 to 9 of the said decision, the learned Judge has
observed as follows:
6. It is relevant to refer to the unreported http://www.judis.nic.in judgment of the
Madurai Bench of Madras High Court in W.P.(MD) No.2635 of 2012, dated
13.03.2013, in the case of K.D.P.Properties Private Limited v. The SubRegistrar,
relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner, wherein, in paragraph No. 18, a
reference was made to the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (1985) 2
SCC 167, Balkrishan Gupta v. Swadeshi Polytex and it was held as follows:
“18. In (1985) 2 SCC 167 (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134906496/ 3
C.Govindasamy vs The Joint Sub-Registrar-Ii on 15 December, 2020
“30. The consequence of attachment of certain shares of a company held by a
shareholder for purposes of sale in a proceeding under section 149 of the Land
Revenue Act is more or less the same. The effect of an order of attachment is what
Section 149 of the Land Revenue Act itself says. Such attachment is made according
to the law in force for the time being for the attachment and sale of movable property
under the decree of a civil court. Section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 says
that except those items of property mentioned in its proviso, lands, houses or other
buildings, goods, money, banknotes, cheques, bills of exchange, hundis, promissory
notes, Government securities, bonds or other securities of money, debts, shares in a
corporation and all other saleable property, moveable or immovable, belonging to a
judgment-debtor, or over which, or the profits of which, hehas a
http://www.judis.nic.in disposing power which he may exercise for his own benefit,
whether the same be held in the name of the judgment-debtor, or by another person
in trust for him or on his behalf, is liable for attachment and sale in execution of a
decree against him. Section 64 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, states that where
an attachment of a property is made, any private transfer or delivery of the property
attached or of any interest therein and any payment to the judgment debtor of any
debt, dividend or other monies contrary to such attachment, shall be void as against
all claims endorceable under the attachment. What is forbidden under Section 64 of
the Code of Civil Procedure is a private transfer by the judgment-debtor of the
property attached contrary to the attachment, that is, contrary to the claims of the
decree holder under the decree for realisation for which the attachment is effected. A
private transfer under Section 64 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not absolutely
void, that is, not void as against all the world but void only as against the claism
enforceable under the attachment. Until the property is actually sold the judgment
debtor retains title in the property attached. Under Rule 76 of Order 21 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908, the shares in a corporation which are attached may be sold
through a broker.
In the alternative such shares may be sold in public auction under Rule 77 thereof. On such sale
either under Rule 76 or under http://www.judis.nic.in Rule 77, the purchaser acquires title. Until
such sale is effected, all other rights of the judgment debtor remain unaffected even if the shares
may have been seized by the officer of the court under Rule 43 of Order 21 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 for the purpose of effecting the attachment, or through a Receiver or though an
order in terms of Rule 46 of Order 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure may have been served on the
judgment debtor or on the company concerned”.
19. The dictum laid down in the above judgment (1985) 2 SCC 167 (supra), gives a fitting answer to
the issue raised in this writ petition. So far as the order of attachment passed by the DRT is
concerned, the transfer is not void generally but it is void only as against the claims enforceable
under the said attachment. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the sale of the property attached
cannot be construed as illegal sale. However, if the 2nd respondent bank exercises its right as
against the property, the petitioner cannot raise any objection because the sale of the vendor in
favour of the petitioner is void in respect of the order of attachment obtained by the 2nd respondent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134906496/ 4
C.Govindasamy vs The Joint Sub-Registrar-Ii on 15 December, 2020
bank. So, even if the property is sold in favour of the petitioner, the 2nd respondent bank can always
exercise its right as against the said property.
20. In view of the above finding, I am of the opinion that the sale of the subject property pending the
order of attachment is void http://www.judis.nic.in only as against the claims enforceable under the
order of said attachment and not in respect of other claims. Therefore, the sale of the property,
which is under attachment, cannot be said as illegal. In the light of what is stated above, the writ
petition is allowed and the 1st respondent- Sub Registrar, Kochiadai, Madurai, is directed to release
the registered document in favour of the petitioner within a period of one week from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order. No costs.”
7. It is also worthwhile to refer to the unreported judgment of Madurai Bench of Madras High Court
in W.P.(MD) No. 14388 of 2014, dated 01.09.2014, in the case of M. Chitra v. The SubRegistrar,
relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner, wherein, in paragraph No. 5, it was held as
follows:— “5. In such circumstances, merely because there is an order of attachment passed by a
Civil Court, the same cannot be a ground to refuse to register the Memorandum of Deposit of Title
Deeds. If any deposit of title deeds is created in respect of the said property pursuant to the right
acquired by the petitioner, vide settlement deed, dated 04.07.2011 it is always subject to further
orders to be passed by the Civil Court. The petitioner's case is that she acquired title by way of
settlement deed dated 04.07.2011, much prior to the order of attachment. Further, the learned
counsel appearing for the petitioner placed reliance on Order 38, Rule 10 C.P.C. stating that
http://www.judis.nic.in attachment before judgment shall not affect the rights, existing prior to the
attachment, of persons not parties to the suit, nor bar any person holding a decree against the
defendant from applying for the sale of the property under attachment in execution of such decree.
The lending bank namely, Canara Bank, Vadamadurai if satisfies with the title of the petitioner over
the property, can request the Registrar to register the document. In such circumstances, merely
because an order has been passed by the Civil Court effecting attachment, cannot be a bar for
entertaining a document for registration. Hence, the reasons assigned by the respondent refusing to
register, vide his memo, dated 25.07.2014, is not in accordance with law beyond the scope of Section
71 of the Act.”
8. Thus, it is crystal clear that it is well settled principle of law that the order of attachment cannot
be a bar to register the document. Therefore, I am of the view that there is no need for this petitioner
to file an appeal. I am of the opinion that the sale of the subject property, pending the order of
attachment is void only as against the claims enforceable under the order of said attachment and not
in respect of other claims. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the sale of the property attached
cannot be construed as illegal sale.
4. Accordingly, I find that the reasons stated by the 2nd respondent in refusing to register the
document, cannot be sustained. Thus, the Writ Petition is allowed and the http://www.judis.nic.in
impugned order is set aside. Consequently, the matter is remitted back to the 2 nd respondent to
consider the document viz., Decree dated 03.03.2018, submitted by the petitioner, for registration.
Such exercise shall be done by the 2 nd respondent within a period of two weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order. No costs.''

C.Govindasamy vs The Joint Sub-Registrar-Ii on 15 December, 2020
11. It can be seen from the above order that the learned Single Judge has placed reliance upon the
orders passed by the Hon'ble Division Bench and also the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court,
which was inturn relied upon by the Division Bench. The ratio in the above order is that an order of
attachment cannot be a bar to register a document. The reason being that the sale of a subject
property pending the order of attachment is void only as against the claims enforceable under the
order of attachment and not in respect of other claims. Therefore, the sale of the property, which is
under attachment, cannot be said to be illegal where the parties to the transaction have nothing to
do with the pending proceedings in which the order of attachment was passed.
12. This view has been consistently taken by this Court and several orders have been passed in this
regard. In the considered view of this Court, the benefit of this order can also be extended to the
petitioners.'
8. It is clear from the above that the order of attachment before judgment passed by the concerned
Civil Court, will not have any binding effect on the 2nd petitioner and the above order will squarely
apply to the facts of the present case.

9. In the result, the impugned refusal check slips issued by the 1st respondent is hereby quashed and
there shall be a direction to the 1st respondent to entertain the sale certificate dated 30.07.2020 and
the same shall be registered, if it is otherwise in order and subject to the condition that necessary
stamp duty and registration fee is paid. The documents shall be returned after the same is
registered.
10. This Writ Petition is allowed with the above directions. No costs.
