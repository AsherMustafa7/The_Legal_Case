Afsar Husain vs Aligarh Muslim University And 5 Others on 1 May, 2025
respondent-University has placed reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Shankara Cooperative
Housing Society Limited Vs. M. Prabhakar and others (2011) 5 SCC 607 and U.P. Jal Nigam and
another Vs. Jaswant Singh and another (2006) 11 SCC 464 to submit that persons who have not
approached the Court within reasonable period and has not explained delay then the writ petition
would be barred by latches. Learned counsel for respondent-University submits that the petitioner
has retired in the year 2000 from the post of Technical Assistant from the University and the
present writ petition has been filed after 21 years of his retirement and as such, the present writ
petition is required to be dismissed on the ground of delay and latches and law of acquiescence.
4. Learned counsel for petitioner has denied the same and submits that the writ petition is not
barred by latches. Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner was appointed on the post
of Technical Assistant and a scheme for second upward movement was launched on 7.1.1997. The
aforesaid scheme of second upward movement of pay was applicable to petitioner and as such,
petitioner has applied on 21.7.1997 before respondent-University for grant of benefit of second
upward movement. The aforesaid benefit of scheme was given to other employees by order dated
3.9.1997, which is at page 40 of the paper book. Since other employees were granted and petitioner
was not granted, petitioner has approached the respondent-University. In the meantime, on
1.10.1997, a direction was issued by Deputy Registrar of University that all the cases pertaining to
second upward movement may not be processed and be kept in abeyance till further orders. The
aforesaid order dated 1.10.1997 was further clarified by order dated 15.10.1997 issued by Deputy
Registrar of University that all the cases, which has already been processed and order has been
passed to award second upward movement, the same may be cleared and implemented. Learned
counsel for petitioner submits that the effect was that some of the employees' applications for
second upward movement were already processed prior to order dated 1.10.1997 and were given the
aforesaid benefit, however, petitioner's application was not processed and the same remained kept
in abeyance by order dated 1.10.1997 by the respondent-University.
4-A. Learned counsel for petitioner further submits that the matter is remain pending with the
respondent-University, however, petitioner has retired on 30.9.2000. Thereafter, other employees
has filed a writ petition before this Court being Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.9438 of 2006 (Wajid
Husain and others Vs. Vice Chancellor, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh and others) where the
claim for second upward movement was granted to the aforesaid employees. The aforesaid
judgment dated 20.8.2009 was not challenged by the respondent-University, however, application
of petitioner for second upward movement remained pending and was not decided by the
respondent-University and neither the same has been rejected. Learned counsel for petitioner
submits that after retirement when the petitioner found that similarly placed persons have been
granted second upward movement, petitioner preferred a representation dated 25.10.2018 before
Registrar of University, which is at page 73 of the paper book and on the aforesaid representation,
remark was made that matter is under consideration. Copy of which is filed at page 76 of the paper
book. The aforesaid mark has been signed by Deputy Registrar of University.
4-B. Learned counsel for petitioner has further drawn attention of this Court to para 21 of the writ
petition, which is quoted hereinbelow:

Afsar Husain vs Aligarh Muslim University And 5 Others on 1 May, 2025
"21 That aforesaid representation of petitioner was returned in original with
endorsement that matter is under consideration on 18.12.2018 which was received by
petitioner through Building Department."
5. Learned counsel for petitioner submits that the aforesaid para 21 of the petition was replied in the
counter affidavit filed by respondent-University that University has not denied the factum that the
original representation was returned with the mark. Para 31 of the counter affidavit, which is in
reply of para 21 of the writ petition is quoted hereinbelow:
"31. That the contents of paragraph no.21 of the writ petition are not admitted in the
manner as stated hence denied. In reply thereto it is submitted that the matter
pertaining to the 2nd Upward Movement Scheme has not been resolved with
University Grants Commission as yet despite several communications have been
made by the University. The University Grants Commission is not agree to provide
the funds for this purpose."
6. Learned counsel for petitioner further submits that petitioner was suffering from mouth cancer
and as such, could not pursue the matter and the writ petition was filed in the year 2021. Learned
counsel for petitioner submits that the claim for second upward movement was launched in the year
1997 itself. It is the University, who has not passed any order and kept the same pending. Learned
counsel for petitioner submits that University has been representing the petitioner that the matter is
under active consideration and so the petitioner has approached the Court in the year 2021.
7. Learned counsel for respondent-University could not explain whether in compliance of order
dated 20.8.2009, respondent-University has granted the benefits of second upward movement to
petitioners in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.9438 of 2006 (Wajid Husain and others Vs. Vice
Chancellor, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh and others).
8. It is to be seen that the respondent-University has raised an objection with regard to delay and
latches in filing writ petition and has also raised issue that in view of law of acquiescence, writ
petition would not be maintainable. It is to be seen that the law requires that litigant to be vigilant in
approaching the Court. The delay closes the right of litigant to press relief before the Court of law. It
is further to be noted that every delay may not amount to latches, if they were, explainable. In the
present case, claim for second upward movement was initiated by respondent-University on
7.1.1997. Petitioner had applied under the aforesaid scheme on 21.7.1997 while he was in service. As
per office memo dated 3.9.1997, University has granted the aforesaid scheme to some of the
employees, however later on, respondent-University by order dated 1.10.1997 had ordered that
second upward movement may not be processed and be kept in abeyance till further orders.
Thereafter, University again issued an order dated 15.10.1997 clarifying the earlier order dated
1.10.1997 that cases in which application for second upward movement has been passed and order
has been passed, the same may be cleared and implemented. The effect of the same was that some
employees were granted benefit, however, other employees' application were not processed and
were kept in abeyance and no order was passed denying the benefits. Petitioner was under
impression that his application was kept in abeyance and was waiting and in the meantime, he has

retired. However, some employees have approached this Court by means of Civil Misc. Writ Petition
No.9438 of 2006 (Wajid Husain and others Vs. Vice Chancellor, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh
and others) where the second upward movement was granted by judgment dated 20.8.2009.
9. Further University Counsel could not assist the Court whether the aforesaid judgment has been
implemented by University in letter and spirit. Although the University has submitted that on the
direction of University Grants Commission, the claim of some employees, who have been granted
benefits were withdrawn. It is further to be noted that on 25.10.2018 petitioner had again
approached after his retirement in the year 2000 for grant of second upward movement, however,
on the aforesaid representation dated 25.10.2018 endorsement was made by Deputy Registrar that
the representation is returned in original with a remark that the matter is under consideration. It
has not been explained by learned counsel for respondent-University as to what decision has been
taken on the application of petitioner preferred in the year 1997. The employer is required to
address the grievance and claim of employee without delay. However, in the present case, University
has passed an order dated 1.10.1997, keeping the application under abeyance till further orders.
Subsequently, respondent-University has not passed any order, in fact, respondent-University by
remark of the Deputy Registrar on the representation dated 25.10.2018 have assured that the matter
is under consideration. Such a conduct of University itself reflect that University was keeping the
matter pending, which resulted in delay.
10. The emolument which the employees is expected to be received as part of condition of the service
cannot be fizzled out in such a manner by the respondent-University by not addressing the
grievance of the employee since 1997 and keep pending the application of petitioner. If the
University Grants Commission was not permitting, respondent-University ought to have reject the
application, however, could not have kept the same pending for long period. Respondent-University
itself representing the employee that the matter is active consideration till 2018.
11. In view of above, the objection raised by respondent-University with regard to delay and latches
and law of acquiescence is not sustainable and is hereby rejected.
12. At this stage, learned counsel for respondent-University submits that University may be
permitted to decide the claim of petitioner for second upward movement in accordance with law.
13. Learned counsel for petitioner submits that he would have no objection, however,
respondent-University may consider the effect of judgment of this Court dated 20.8.2009 passed in
Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.9438 of 2006 (Wajid Husain and others Vs. Vice Chancellor, Aligarh
Muslim University, Aligarh and others) wherein similarly placed employees have been granted
second upward movement.
14. In view of aforesaid, it is hereby provided that petitioner shall file a fresh representation before
the respondent no.1-Aligarh Muslim University, Aligharh through its Vice Chancellor, within 15 days
from today along with a certified copy of this order. The same shall be considered and decided by
respondent no.1 within a period of one month thereafter.
