Md. Hussimuddin vs Shri Chandra Bahadur Sunwar on 14 March, 2024
Page 1 [3] The facts of the present case in a nutshell are that a piece of homestead land measuring
.06 acre under Patta No. 101 (part) (Old), 74/619 (New), covered by C.S. Dag No. 236/767, situated
at Village No. 8-Mantripukhi (herein after referred to as 'suit land') was owned by the respondent
No. 3 as owner and pattadar.
[4] An agreement of sale dated 12.08.2006 was executed by the respondent No. 3 in favour of the
petitioner for transfer of the said suit land at the consideration amount of Rs. 4,50,000/- (Rupees
four lakh fifty thousand) and thereafter, the petitioner paid a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees two
lakh) as advance payment to the respondent No. 3 with the agreement that the balance amount of
Rs. 2,50,000/- (Rupees two lakh fifty thousand) will be paid in the month of January, 2007. In the
said agreement of sale, the respondent No. 1, who is the father of the respondent No. 3, also put his
signature as one of the attesting witnesses [5] When the petitioner came to know that the name of
the respondent No. 1 was entered into the land record of the suit land vide Mutation order dated
29.11.2006 passed by the SDC, Imphal East, Heingang in Mutation Case No. 717/2006 and
thereafter, the suit land was transferred by way of sale by the respondent No. 1 in favour of the
respondent No. 2 by executing a registered sale deed bearing No. 79 (V) for the year 2007 dated
18.01.2007 and the name of the respondent No. 2 had been entered in the land record of the suit
land, the petitioner filed Original Suit No. 1 of 2007 before the Civil Judge, Junior Division, Imphal
East, Manipur claiming the following reliefs:-
"(i) a decree thereby declaring that the suit land is the absolute property of the
Respondent No. 3 and that Respondent No. 1 has no right and title over the suit land;

[6] As required by Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, summons were issued to the
respondents by the Ld. Civil Judge for appearing before the Court to answer the claims and to file
written statement of their defence. The summons to the respondent No. 1 was served on 08.02.2007
while he was in judicial custody in connection with a criminal case and summons to the respondent
No. 2 was duly served on 07.02.2007. Summons to the respondent No. 3 could not be served in the
ordinary manner and as such, substitute service by way of publishing it in the newspaper was made.
When the respondents failed to appear before the Trial Court, the suit was proceeded ex-parte
against the respondents and the suit was decreed in favour of the petitioner vide judgment and
decree dated 07.05.2008. Thereafter, the petitioner filed an Execution Case No. 4 of 2008 before the
Trial Court for execution of the ex-parte judgment and decree dated 07.05.2008. [7] The
respondents No. 1 & 2, thereafter, filed Judicial Misc. Case No. 66 of 2008/16 of 2014 before the
Trial Court for setting aside the ex-parte judgment and decree dated 07.05.2008 on the ground,
inter-alia, that they came to know about the existence of the judgment and decree only on
24.07.2008. The petitioner filed his objection denying all the allegations made by the respondents
No. 1 & 2 in their application, however, the respondent No. 3 did not appear before the Trial Court
to contest the said application filed by the respondents No. 1 & 2. [8] The case set up by the
respondent No. 1 before the Trial Court in the said application is that the respondent No. 1's father
(late) Narbahadur was the owner Page 3 of the suit land and after the death of Narbahadur, the
respondent No. 3 got his name mutated in the land record of the suit land stealthily and without
giving notice to the respondent No. 1. After knowing the wrong entry of the name of the respondent
No. 3 in the revenue record of the suit land, the respondent No. 1 and the respondent No. 3 come to
a family settlement for allowing to mutate the name of the respondent No. 1 in the revenue record of
the suit land and thereafter, the name of the respondent No. 1 got mutated in the revenue record
vide mutation order 29.11.2006 in mutation case No. 717/SDC/I.E./HNG/2006 after cancelling the
name of the respondent No. 3. Thereafter, the respondent No. 1 sold off the suit land to the
respondent No. 2 by executing a registered sale deed and the respondent No. 2 got her name
mutated in the land records of the suit land vide order dated 18.01.2007 passed by the SDC, Imphal
East, Heingang in Mutation Case No. 31 of 2007.
[9] The petitioner lodged a complaint at the Heingang Police Station against the respondent No. 1 in
connection with the sale of the suit land and the Heingang Police Station registered a case being
F.I.R. No. 10 (1) 2007 Heingang P.S. u/s 420/120-B 34 I.P.C. Thereafter, the respondent No. 1 was
arrested by the Heingang Police on 22.01.2007 and he was in Police and Judicial Custody from
22.01.2007 to 21.04.2007 in connection with the said case. The respondent No. 1 was released on
bail on 21.04.2007 by an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Imphal East. It is the case of the
respondent No. 1 that while he was in Police and Judicial custody, he never receive any summon in
connection with the Original Suit filed by the petitioner and that he has no knowledge about the
Original Suit pending before the Trial Court and that he came to know about the existence of the
ex-parte judgment and decree only on 24.07.2008.
[10] The case set out by the respondent No. 2 in the said application is that she was suffering from
several ailments, viz., swelling below right ear and also forgetfulness and mental depression. The
respondent No. 2 got admitted in the Page 4 Regional Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital on
22.01.2007 and operation was performed on 01.02.2007 and thereafter she was discharged from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108889644/ 3
Md. Hussimuddin vs Shri Chandra Bahadur Sunwar on 14 March, 2024
Hospital on 04.02.2007. The respondent No. 2 was also under the supervision of a medical expert
and a sorcery expert after believing that she was a victim of sorcery. It is the case of the respondent
No. 2 that she was not able to remember anything of the suit as well as the summon which was
alleged to have been served to her and that she did not appear and defend the suit as she has no
knowledge of the suit. The respondent No. 2 mental condition was improved in the 2nd week of
July, 2008 and came to know about the existence of the said ex-parte judgment and decree only on
24.07.2008. It is the case of both the respondents No. 1 & 2 that the summon was not duly served to
both of them for hearing of the suit and that there are sufficient cause for not appearing before the
Trial Court when the case was called on for hearing.
[11] The Trial Court after hearing both the parties came to the conclusion that summons to the
respondents No. 1 & 2 were duly served on 08.02.2007 and 07.02.2007 respectively, however, the
Trial Court set aside the ex-parte judgment and decree dated 07.05.2008 on the ground, inter-alia,
that the respondents No. 1 & 2 were prevented from appearing before the Trial Court when the suit
was called for hearing by passing the order dated 17.09.2014, impugned herein. Hence, the present
petition.
[12] Mr. H. Dijen, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner submitted that under order IX Rule
13 of the CPC, it is provided that an ex-parte decree can be set aside only on 2 (two) grounds, i.e.,
when the Court is satisfied that the summon was not duly served or when the Court is satisfied that
there was sufficient cause which prevented the defendant from appearing before it when the suit was
called on for appearing. It has been submitted that in the present case, there is clear-cut finding
given by the Trial Court in the impugned order that summon was duly served upon respondent No. 1
on 08.02.2007 and summon was duly served to the Page 5 respondent No. 2 on 07.02.2007 and that
summon on the respondent No. 3 was served by way of substitute service by publishing the notice in
the newspaper. The learned counsel submitted that this finding given by the Trial Court is supported
by materials available on record. The learned counsel further submitted that the Trial Court set
aside the ex-parte decree only on the ground that the respondents were prevented from appearing
when the suit was called for hearing. [13] With regard to the ground given by the Trial Court for
setting aside the ex- parte decree, it has been submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner that in the application filed by the respondents No. 1 & 2 before the Trial Court for setting
aside the ex-parte judgment and decree, it has been clearly stated that the respondent No. 1 was
arrested by the Heingang Police on 22.01.2007 in connection with a criminal case and he was kept
in Police and Judicial custody from 22.01.2007 till 21.04.2007, on which date the respondent No. 1
was released on bail and that the respondent No. 2 was admitted at the Regional Institute of Medical
Sciences Hospital on 22.01.2007 and after performing an operation on 01.02.2007, she was
discharged from the Hospital on 04.02.2007. The learned counsel submitted that the ex-parte
judgment and decree was passed by the Trial Court on 05.07.2008 after more than 1 (one) year from
the date the respondent No. 1 was released from police and Judicial custody and after the discharge
of the respondent No. 2 from the Hospital and that the respondents No. 1 & 2 never gave any
explanation or show any sufficient cause which prevented them from appearing before the Trial
Court and to contest the suit during the aforesaid period of more than 1 (one) year. The learned
counsel vehemently submitted that the Trial Court never considered this crucial point and wrongly
arrived at a conclusion that the respondents No. 1 & 2 were prevented from appearing when the suit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108889644/ 4
Md. Hussimuddin vs Shri Chandra Bahadur Sunwar on 14 March, 2024
was called for hearing, without any supporting material and set aside the ex-parte judgment and
decree, thereby causing a grave miscarriage of justice. The learned counsel Page 6 accordingly
submitted that the impugned order is not sustainable in the eyes of law and the same is liable to be
set aside.
[14] Mr. Ng. Premkumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondents No. 1 & 2 submitted that
against the impugned order passed under Order IX Rule 13 of the CPC, a revision lies as provided
under section 115 of the CPC. As there is an effective and alternative statutory remedy for filing a
revision petition against the impugned order, the present petition filed under article 227 of the
constitution of India is not maintainable. It has also been submitted that the words "any sufficient
cause from appearing when the suit was called on for hearing" under Order IX rule 13 of the CPC
must be liberally construed and that it is not justified in taking hyper technical view while
considering an application under Order IX Rule 13 for setting aside an ex-parte decree. The learned
counsel also reiterated the stand taken by the respondents No. 1 & 2 in their applications filed under
Order IX Rule 13, i.e., Judl. Misc. Case No. 66 of 2008/16 of 2014.
In support of his contention about the maintainability of the present petition, the learned counsel
cited the following case laws:-
(i) "Miss Maneck Gustedji Burjarji vs. Sarafazali Nawabali Mirza" reported in (1977) 1
SCC 227 wherein, it has been held, inter-alia by the Hon'ble Apex Court at Paragraph
6 of the judgment that the High Court does not ordinarily, in exercise of its
discretion, entertained an application under article 227 of the constitution where an
adequate alternative legal remedy of filing an appeal is available.
(ii) "Mohamed Ali vs. V. Jaya and Others" reported in (2022) 10 SCC 477 wherein, it
has been held as under:-
"7.1. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision to the facts of
the case on hand, the High Court ought not to have entertained the revision petition
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the ex-parte judgment and
decree passed by the learned Trial Court in view of a specific remedy of appeal as
provided under the Code of Civil Page 7 Procedure itself. Therefore, the High Court
has committed a grave error in entertaining the revision petition under Article 227
challenging the ex-parte judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court and
in quashing and setting aside the same in exercise of powers under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India."
(iii) "Nimai Kar vs. Bishnupada Saha and Another" reported in AIR 2011 Gauhati 1 wherein, a single
Bench of the High Court held that when there is a specific provision in the CPC prescribing a specific
mode for preferring either revision or appeal, an application under article 227 of the constitution is
not maintainable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108889644/ 5
Md. Hussimuddin vs Shri Chandra Bahadur Sunwar on 14 March, 2024
[15] The 2 (two) judgments of the Apex Court, in the case of "Miss Maneck Gustedji Burjarji"
(Supra) and "Mohamed Ali" (Supra) cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner, have been
passed in the particular facts and circumstances of the cases and the Hon'ble Apex Court held that
when there is a statutory alternative remedy by way of an appeal is available, the High court ought
not to have entertained a revision application under article 227 of the constitution of India.
On careful perusal of the said 2 (two) judgments, this Court is of the considered view that in the said
judgments, the Hon'ble Apex Court did not lay down any principle of law having universal
application that when a revision under section 115 of the CPC is available, an application under
article 227 of the constitution is not maintainable. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered view
that the aforesaid 2 (two) judgments of the Apex Court does not support the contention raised by the
learned counsel appearing for the petitioner regarding maintainability of the present petition.
[16] In the case of "Nimai Kar" (Supra) the learned Single Judge held in paragraph 28 of the
Judgment as under:-
"28. From the aforesaid findings of the Apex Court, it can be easily said that the
power u/s 115 of the CPC and the power under Article 227 Page 8 of the Constitution
is quite distinct and different and not interchangeable. Therefore, when there is a
remedy available u/s 115 Code of Civil Procedure, then the Court should not exercise
its power under Article 227 of the Constitution unless it is an exceptional case where
it is so necessary to interfere with the order of the Court subordinate to it to prevent
from miscarriage of justice. In Koyilerian Janaki and Ors. v. Rent Controller (Munsif)
Cannore and Ors., (2000) 9 SCC 406 the Apex Court in para-4 of the said report held
that.... "The power under Article 227 is exercisable where it is found by the High
Court that due to a certain grave error an injustice has been caused to a party."
[17] On perusal of the above quoted paragraph 28 of the judgment, it is cleared that the learned
Single Judge also acknowledged and held that where it is so necessary to interfere with the order of
the Court subordinate to it, the High court can exercise its power under article 227 of the
constitution to prevent miscarriage of justice despite availability of an alternative remedy of revision
under section 115 of the CPC. In view of the above, this Court is of the considered view that the
judgment relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner is of no help to the petitioner in view of
the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case. [18] In the case of "Municipal Corporation
of Delhi vs. R.P. Khaitan and Ors." reported in MANU/SC/1760/1999, a Bench of 3 (three) Judges of
the Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:-
"2. The right to approach the High Court under Articles 226 or 227 of the
Constitution or both is within the ambit of the right to avail constitutional remedies
enshrined under Article 32 of the Constitution. These are styled as extraordinary
remedies because they are not part of the ordinary procedure prescribed for
adjudication of dispute in the ordinary Courts of Law. The remedy of revision under
Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure whereby the High Court is empowered to
call for the record of any case which has been decided by any Court subordinate to it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108889644/ 6
Md. Hussimuddin vs Shri Chandra Bahadur Sunwar on 14 March, 2024
and in which no appeal lies thereto is an ordinary one empowering it to pass
appropriate orders when the subordinate Court appears to have exercised a
jurisdiction not vested in it by law or to have failed to exercise its jurisdiction illegally
or with material irregularity. This remedy presupposes the cause having been in a
Court subordinate to such High Court. "3. In these set of appeals the view expressed
by the Delhi High Court has been questioned whereby petitions under Article 226 of
the Page 9 Constitution were held by it to be not maintainable in the presence of the
regular remedy available under Section 115, C.P.C. towards challenging the orders of
the District Judge, Delhi passed under Section 169(1) of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act. Few of these appeals are by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and
the remaining are by the tax-prayers. We treat them all as identical. "3.1.It is true that
the extraordinary remedies provided under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution
are dependent upon the High Court willing to interfere in a matter for which a large
measure of discretion rests with it. Its power is so wide so as to envelop not only all
aspects of the matter but orders can be passed of such nature as the High Court
thinks fit. The jurisdiction as such is not curtailed to meet questions of parameters.
On the other hand, the regular remedy under Section 115, C.P.C. is hedged by the
language of the provision. Only errors of jurisdiction and material irregularities in the
exercise of jurisdiction bring about a cause within the ambit of that provision. All the
same it is worthy of notice that the Forum for the aforementioned three remedies
ordinary as well as extraordinary is with the High Court itself. We see no reason then
as to why the frame of the cause be determinative. It is for the litigant to choose the
remedy and it is for the High Court to grant or deny relief thereon having regard to
the facts and circumstances of each case. We may, however, add that the existence of
an alternative remedy can by itself be a ground for the High Court refusing to exercise
jurisdiction but it is not as if jurisdiction of the High Court is ousted by such
existence. The High Court's dependence on Visheh Kumar v. Shanti Prasad
MANU/SC/0052/1980: [1980]3SCR32 in refusing to convert a petition under
Section 115, C.P.C. to be one under Article 227 of the Constitution may have been
justified on the facts of that case, but the same cannot be treated as a precedent to
oust jurisdiction of the High Court vested in it under the law. The High Court
certainly is entitled to convert any proceeding instituted before it in one manner to be
that of another provided a proper cause has been made out and in the interest of
justice.
"4. For the foregoing reasons, we allow these appeals, set aside the impugned orders
of the High Court and remit the matters back to it to be placed on its file for further
consideration on merits in accordance with law."
[19] In the case of "Raj Shri Agarwal alias Ram Shri Agarwal and Another vs. Sudheer Mohan and
Others" reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 1775, the Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:-
"2. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated
25.04.2022 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Page 10 Allahabad dismissing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108889644/ 7
Md. Hussimuddin vs Shri Chandra Bahadur Sunwar on 14 March, 2024
the writ petition preferred by the appellants, filed under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India, challenging the order passed by the learned trial Court
dismissing the application under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC, the original revisionist has
preferred the present Appeal.
"3. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has dismissed the writ
petition, under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, observing that the writ
petition, under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, is not maintainable as remedy
by way of revision under Section 115 CPC is available to the appellants/plaintiffs. As
observed by this Court in catena of decisions and even in the decisions considered by
the High Court, the view taken by this Court is that where there is availability of
remedy under Section 115 CPC normally "the petition under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India would not lie". That does not mean that writ petition, under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India, shall not be maintainable at all. There is a
difference and distinction between the entertainability and maintainability. The
remedy under Article 227 of the Constitution of India available is a constitutional
remedy under the Constitution of India which cannot be taken away. In a given case
the Court may not exercise the power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India if
the Court is of the opinion that the aggrieved party has another efficacious remedy
available under the CPC. However, to say that the writ petition under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India shall not be maintainable at all is not tenable "4. Even
otherwise, it is required to be noted that, even according to the High Court, the
remedy available to the original plaintiffs was under
Section 115 of the CPC. In that view of the matter, the High Court ought to have
converted the writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India into revision
petition under Section 115 CPC and ought to have considered the same in accordance
with law and on its own merits, rather than permitting the writ petitioners to file a
fresh revision application under Section 115 of the CPC. It would unnecessary
increase the burden of the Court. To avoid further multiplicity, even the High Court
ought to have converted the writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution into
revision under Section 115 of the CPC.
"5. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present Appeal
succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dismissing
the writ petition, under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, on the ground that
the same shall not be maintainable is hereby quashed and set aside. The matter is
remanded to the High Court to consider the writ petition in accordance with law and
on merits for which we have not expressed anything on merits in favour of either
parties."
Page 11 [20] In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case and the principle of law laid
down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of "Municipal Corporation of Delhi" (Supra) and "Raj
Shri Agarwal alias Ram Shri Agarwal" (Supra), this Court cannot agree with the submission
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108889644/ 8
Md. Hussimuddin vs Shri Chandra Bahadur Sunwar on 14 March, 2024
advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents that the present petition is not
maintainable and accordingly, this Court is not inclined to dismiss the present petition as not
maintainable.
[21] In the present case summons to the respondent No. 1 were duly served on 08.02.2007 while he
was in Judicial Custody and summons to the respondent No. 2 were duly served on 07.02.2007 after
her discharged from hospital on 04.02.2007. Since summons have been duly served upon the said
respondents No. 1 & 2, it shall be deemed that they have knowledge about the civil suit filed by the
petitioner. Despite having knowledge about the said civil suit filed by the petitioner in the Court of
Civil Judge, Junior Division, Imphal East, the respondents No. 1 & 2 did not appear before the Trial
Court to contest the said civil suit.
For the period of more than 1 (one) year, w.e.f. 21.04.2007 (when the respondent No. 1 was released
from Judicial Custody) and 04.02.2007 (when the respondent No. 2 was discharged from the
Hospital) till the date of passing the ex- parte judgment and decree on 07.05.2008, no explanation
or sufficient cause had been given by the said respondents No. 1 & 2 which prevented them from
appearing before the Trial Court to contest the suit.
[22] In my considered view, for setting aside an ex-parte decree under Order IX Rule 13, the Trial
Court should first satisfy itself that there were sufficient cause which prevented the respondents No.
1 & 2 from appearing before it when the suit was called on for hearing. However, in the present case,
the Trial Court completely failed to consider and to take into account the fact that the respondents
No. 1 & 2 did not give any explanation or show any sufficient cause which prevented them from
appearing before the Trial Court during the aforesaid period of more than 1 Page 12 (one) year and
passed the impugned order setting aside the ex-parte judgment and decree thereby causing a grave
miscarriage of justice to the petitioner. [23] In the case of "M/s. Garment Craft Vs. Prakash Chand
Goel" reported in AIR 2022 SC 422, it has been held, inter-alia by the Hon'ble Supreme Court at
paragraph 18 of its judgment that the jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Article 227 of
the constitution is in the nature of correctional jurisdiction to set right grave dereliction of duty or
flagrant abuse, violation of fundamental principles of law or justice and that the power under Article
227 is exercised sparingly in appropriate cases, like when there is no evidence at all to justify, or the
finding is so perverse that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion that the
Court or Tribunal has come to. It has also been held that it is axiomatic that such discretionary relief
must be exercised to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice.
[24] On careful perusal of the impugned order passed by the Trial Court and on careful examination
of the materials available on record, this Court come to the conclusion that there was no evidence or
materials available on record to support the conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court that the
respondents No. 1 & 2 were prevented from appearing when the suit was called for hearing and as
such, the impugned order is not sustainable.
