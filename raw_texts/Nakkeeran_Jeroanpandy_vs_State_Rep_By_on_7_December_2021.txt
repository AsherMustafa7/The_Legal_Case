for the offence under Section 498(A) of IPC., and imposing a sentence of two years Rigorous
Imprisonment and a fine of Rs.3,000/-, in default of payment of fine to undergo three months
Simple Imprisonment, even while acquitting the petitioner/accused of the offence under Section

sentence being confirmed by the Learned Sessions Judge, Thiruvannamalai, by Judgment dated
30.01.2014 in Crl.A.No.25 of 2011.
2.On 17.02.2006, PW.1/Thamarai Selvi, lodged a complaint- Ex.P2, thereby alleging that she got
married with the petitioner/accused on 02.03.2000 and after the marriage, the first accused was not
maintaining a proper relationship with the complainant and the first accused always used to hit her
and other accused also abused her physically and ill-treated her. Apart from mentioning specific
incidents she also alleged that the first accused/petitioner herein committed bigamy and contracted
a marriage https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis with one Datchayani and thereafter, he totally
neglected her, hence, the complaint.
3.PW.10/Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, registered a case in Crime No.2 of 2006
against the petitioner herein and his mother Joshvin, who is the second accused, his brother /
Maran as the third accused, One Lakshmi, wife of Maran as the fourth accused, his sister Juliee as
the fifth accused and Datchayani, the alleged lady, who married the petitioner at the second time, as
the sixth accused, for the offences under Sections 498(A), 406, 494 and 506(ii) of IPC.,
4.After completing the investigation. On 10.03.2007 PW.10 laid a final report proposing all the
above accused guilty of the above mentioned offenses, before the learned Judicial Magistrate, Arani,
who took the case on file as C.C.No.373 of 2007 and issued summons to the accused. Upon being
questioned, the accused denied the charges and stood trial. The prosecution examined the first
informant / Thamarai Selvi as PW.1., her father / Chinnasamy as PW.2, one Venkatesan, who is the
sister's husband as PW.3, the mother of PW.1/Ellammal as PW.4; One Vincent, the sister of PW.1 as
PW.5; One Father Bathros of Kaanikkai https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Madha Temple as PW.6;
One Alex, who is the common friend of both the accused and PW.1, who witnessed the second
marriage of the first accused/petitioner in Velanganni Temple as PW- 7; One Anbu, who is also

6.Upon being questioned under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., about the evidence let in against them and
the incriminating circumstances against them, all the accused denied the same as false. On behalf of
the defence, while cross-examining, the prosecution witnesses, the legal notice issued
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis by PW.1 to the petitioner /accused was marked as Ex.D1; the
order passed in the Divorce petition filed by PW.1 in the Sub-Court, Arani, is marked as Ex.D2; and
the Divorce petition filed by PW.1 before the District Court, Thiruvannamalai as Ex.D3. No oral
evidence was let in on behalf of the defence.
7.The Learned Judicial Magistrate proceeded to hear the arguments of the Learned Assistant Public
Prosecutor and the learned counsel appearing for the accused. By Judgment dated 25.11.2011 it
found that there is a valid marriage between PW.1 and the petitioner/first accused. As per the
evidence of PW.1 coupled with PW.2, the accused had tortured PW.1, after getting her salary, to get
more money from her parents and because of the vagabond life led by the first accused, he has been
inflicting cruelty on PW.1. Therefore, PW.1 had to come out of the matrimonial home. PW.1 was
harassed, by demands of more dowry and found that the accused had been committing cruelty from
the years 2000 to 2005. The Trial Court found that the other offences including that of the bigamy
as not proved beyond reasonable doubt and therefore acquitted accused 2 to 6 in toto and the
petitioner/accused for the other offenses of 406, 494 and 506(ii) but, convicting the
petitioner/accused for the offence https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis under Section 498(A) of IPC
and sentenced him as aforesaid.
8.Aggrieved by the findings and sentence, the petitioner herein filed an appeal in Crl.A.No.25 of
2011 before the learned Sessions Judge, Thiruvannamalai and by Judgment dated 30.01.2014, after
considering the evidence on record in paragraph Nos.12 and 13, the Appellate Court confirmed the
findings and conclusions reached by the Trial Court. As a matter of fact, in paragraphs Nos.15 & 16,
the appellate court held that even A2 to A5 are liable to be punished, but the prosecution had not
filed any Cross Appeal. Therefore the appellate court confirmed the conviction as well as the
punishment against the petitioner. Thereupon, this Criminal Revision is laid before this Court.
9.Heard Mr.B.M.Subash, learned counsel for the petitioner. According to him, there are three sets of
allegations, which are there on record to drive home the charge of cruelty. First, PW.1 alleged that
she has been subjected to physical torture and torture of demanding more dowry between the years
2000 to 2005. Those allegations are to be negated because, she herself in Ex.D1/legal notice has
said that Datchayani and her husband are living happily during the year 2000 to 2005. The second
limb https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of allegations is regarding the specific incident dated
16.11.2005 and upon cross-examination, she herself went back on the said allegations and admitted
in the cross-examination that the incident on 16.11.2005 did not happen. Therefore, what remains is
the third limb of allegations of cruelty on account of the extramarital relationship of the petitioner.
According to the Learned Counsel, the mere allegation of having extramarital relationship will not
amount to mental cruelty so as to constitute an offence under Section 498(A) of IPC. Therefore,
according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, both the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate
Court committed a grave error in considering the evidence in a perverse manner and therefore, this
Court should interfere in exercise of revisional jurisdiction. He would further submit that the Lower
Appellate Court, as a matter of fact, has not independently considered and applied its mind to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161944220/ 3
Nakkeeran @ Jeroanpandy vs State Rep.By on 7 December, 2021
evidence relied and as in one sentence confirmed the Trial Court Judgment and therefore, the same
is bad in law.
10.In support of his submissions, the learned counsel relied upon the Hon'ble Supreme Court
Judgment in Jogi & Ors., Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh1 in Crl.A.No.1350 of 2021, for the
proposition, that the 1 LL 2021 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis SC 639 Appellate Court erred in
not giving detailed reasons. The learned counsel also relied upon Manju Ram Kalita Vs. State of
Assam 2 for the proposition that cruelty has to be understood and given a specific statutory meaning
as provided under Section 498(A) of IPC., and gravity and seriousness of the act have to be weighed.
The learned counsel relied upon another Judgment of K.V.Prakash Babu Vs. State of Karnataka3 for
the proposition that extramarital relationship per se would not be mental cruelty within the ambit of
Section 498(A) of IPC. The learned counsel further relied upon a Judgment in Manikkam Vs. State
of Tamil Nadu4 for the proposition that mental cruelty for the purposes of Section 498-A has
nothing to do with the demand of dowry. The learned also relied upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in Tahsildar Singh And Another vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh5 for the
proposition when a document is shown to the witness in the cross-examination, and if the witness
admits the document, it is not necessary to further question the witness on the contents of the
document.

1959 SC 1012 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
11.Mr.L.Bhaskaran, learned Government Advocate (crl.side) appearing for the first respondent
would submit that the evidence of PW.1, coupled with PW.2, PW.7 & PW.8 would conclusively prove
that there was cruelty unleashed by the petitioner/accused against PW.1. Just because, the Trial
Court acquitted the accused for the offence under Section 494 of IPC., the same would not be a
reason for interfering with the finding of mental cruelty inflicted on PW.1 by the petitioner/accused
having extramarital relationship. He would further submit that on 17.09.2006 itself through the
sixth accused, the petitioner has begotten a child and placed a copy of the birth certificate before this
Court. He would point out that the divorce proceedings between the PW-1 and the petitioner/first
accused are still pending, he would impress upon this Court that there is no error in the finding by
the Trial Court or the First Appellate Court, so as to interfere in revisional jurisdiction.
12.Mr.B.Sri Ram, learned counsel appearing for the victim / second respondent/PW.1 would submit
that on a careful consideration of evidence of PW.1, it would be clear that she has categorically
deposed in detail about the various physical and mental torture meted out to her by the first
accused. As a matter of fact, the evidence of other witnesses would https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
corroborate the said facts. The contents in the legal notice were not specifically put to her in the
cross-examination and therefore, the allegations cannot be negated, on the strength of Ex.D1 alone.
He would rely upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Munna Devi Vs. State of
Rajasthan and another6 and in D.Stephens Vs. Nosibolla7 for the proposition finding of the Trial
Court and the Lower Appellate Court cannot be lightly interfered with by the revisional Court and
nature of the revisional jurisdiction is one of limited judicial review and re-appreciation of the entire
evidence in revision is impermissible.

Nakkeeran @ Jeroanpandy vs State Rep.By on 7 December, 2021
13.I have considered the material evidence on records and the submissions of the learned counsel on
either side. As far as the first set of allegations of physical torture and mental cruelty during the
period 2000
-2005 is concerned when the petitioner herself has caused Ex.D1/legal notice, wherein it is
specifically avered that PW-1 and the petitioner/accused were living happily during 2000-2005.
Ex-D1, is caused by the PW-1 and therefore, once she admits in the cross- examination that the
notice is given on her instructions and the same being marked, it throws doubt on the allegations
leveled. 6 (2001) 9 SCC 631 7 1951 SCR 284 : AIR 1951 SC 196 : (1951) 52 Cri LJ 510s
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
14.Secondly, I am also in agreement with the learned counsel for the petitioner that as far as the
alleged incident occurred on 16.05.2012 is concerned PW.1 has categorically admitted in her
cross-examination that the incident did not happen.
15.Be that as it may, PW-1, categorically stated that the petitioner/husband was having extramarital
relationship with one Datchayani, who was also prosecuted as accused/A6 for the offence under
Section 494 of IPC., but, however, the Trial Court acquitted the said Datchayani as well as the
petitioner for the offence of Section 494 of IPC. In this regard, the evidence cannot be looked into in
piecemeal. This Court has to read the evidence of PW.1, PW.7 & PW.8 as a whole and a proper
reading would convey the essence that cruelty, predominantly mental cruelty, was unleashed on
PW.1, on account of the extramarital affairs developed by the petitioner herein. To this, the learned
counsel would rely on paragraph No.15 of the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
K.V.Prakash Babu case mentioned supra. Which is extracted hereunder:
"15.The concept of mental cruelty depends upon the milieu and the strata from which
the persons come from and definitely has an individualistic perception regard
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis being had to one's endurance and sensitivity. It is
difficult to generalise but certainly, it can be appreciated in a set of established facts.
Extra marital relationship, per se, or as such would not come within the ambit of
Section 498(A) of IPC. It would constitute a criminal offence. There is no denial of
the fact that the cruelty need not be physical but a mental torture or abnormal
behaviour that amounts to cruelty or harassment in a given case. It will depend upon
the facts of the said case. To explicate, solely because the husband is involved in an
extra-marital relationship and there is some suspicion in the mind of wife, that
cannot be regarded as mental cruelty which would attract mental cruelty for
satisfying the ingredients of Section 306 of IPC."
But the perusal of the above dictum would itself make it clear that the Court has to take into
consideration the said abnormal behaviour with the facts and circumstances of the case and it has to
be decided whether the conduct amounted to cruelty. Therefore, looking at the evidence of PW.1,
PW.7 & PW.8, which is on record, it is clear that there was extramarital relationship. It has caused
such an effect on the mental health of PW.1, which resulted in serious domestic discord and her
leaving the matrimonial home. As a matter of fact, as per the evidence on record, PW.1 went out of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161944220/ 5
Nakkeeran @ Jeroanpandy vs State Rep.By on 7 December, 2021
the matrimonial home on 16.11.2005.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
16.During the course of the hearing of the learned Government Advocate (crl.side) appearing for the
first respondent, also produced the Birth certificate, evidencing the birth of a child for the
petitioner/accused and the said A6/ Datchayani, which was born on 17.09.2006 itself. Therefore,
the Court cannot close its eyes to the hard evidence and the facts of this case. It is pertinent to point
out even the Appellate Court has taken an exception to the prosecution in non-filing of Cross Appeal
as against the acquittal of A2 to A6, in this case.
17.Considering all the factors cumulatively, I hold that the action of the petitioner/accused in having
extramarital relationship, which has further caused grave mental trauma and affected the mental
health of PW.1, leading to serious circumstances, in conjunction with the act of PW.1 being forced to
leave the matrimonial home, would amount to cruelty to her within Section 498(A) of IPC.
18.During his arguments, the Learned Counsel replied by pointing out that PW.1 was also in an
extramarital relationship with one Ramu and that they have cross-examined her. Except throwing
allegations on PW.1 in the cross-examination, the defence has not done anything
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis towards the proof of allegations and under the said circumstances,
I reject the said submission without merits.
19.In view of my aforesaid findings, there is no any illegality or any error in the conclusion of the
Trial Court and the Lower Appellate Court that the petitioner is guilty of the offence under Section
498(A) of IPC.
20.However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case I am inclined to modify the
sentence of imprisonment alone imposed on the petitioner/accused by reducing it as six months
imprisonment from that of one year.
21.The Criminal Revision Case is accordingly partly allowed.
