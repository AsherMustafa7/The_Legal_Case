protections were not granted by this Court while admitting the bail
applications.
[3] In AB No.49 of 2022, it is stated that there is no material against
the petitioners who are elected Ward Members. The FIR discloses that
unknown officials of BDO Thoubal and private party created duplicate job card
holders in Wangbal and they have manipulated the linked bank accounts in
the MGNREGS job card details and the same was fraudulently withdrawn
through Business Correspondent (BC): Th. Kamala (the petitioner in AB No.48
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 5
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
of 2022). It is stated that the petitioners/Ward Members have no right, power
and privilege to do anything regarding encashment of money for the wages of
the job card holders and the same is dealt by this Panchayat Officials. It is
also stated that the elected Ward Members don't fall within the meaning of
Public Servant as defined under Section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988 and as such registration of FIR against them is not maintainable.
It is further stated that the FIR is registered by the political
opponents of the petitioners who were defeated in the last election. It is prayed
that the petitioners be released on anticipatory bail and they will abide by all
the conditions imposed by this Court and there is no apprehension of
absconding or tampering with the witnesses and the evidences.

Kamala Devi is a Business Correspondent (BC) of Punjab National Bank,
Thoubal of the Wangbal Village and her duty is in assisting the job card holder
in opening bank account and she has no role in the actual transaction of fund
to the accounts of the beneficiaries. Besides this, it is stated that customer will

functions by facilitating in opening of accounts for the beneficiaries of
MGNREGS of pension fund, self-help group and scholarship for student, etc.
It is also further stated that she has no role in actual disbursement of fund
except for facilitating in the opening of account and transaction and there is

Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
bail and she will abide by any conditions imposed by this Court.
[4] The State have filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that these
2(two) elected Ward Members in connivance with business correspondent of
PNB Bank and other unnamed officials and the BDO official and other private
party have hatched criminal conspiracy to cheat the job card holders of their
wages and they have succeeded in doing the same . They have created
duplicate and fake job cards, opened accounts in the name of non-existent or
wrong persons and make withdrawals by not giving full amount to the job card
holders and in collusion, they have made conspiracy, cheating and criminal
misappropriation of property belonging to the job card holders. It is stated that
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
Page |8
their custodial interrogation is required to reveal the role of the other co-
accused and to discover the whole gamut of conspiracy. It is stated that the
present FIR has been lodged on the direction of this Court by order dated
08.04.2022 passed in a PIL to conduct an enquiry regarding fraudulent
transactions in MGNREGS fund.
It is stated that, during the investigation, it was learnt that the
accused, Thoudam Kamala Devi who is serving as a Business Correspondent
Agent (BCA) of Punjab National Bank, Thoubal Branch, taking advantage of
her position and knowledge of the working of the banks and in conspiracy with
the other co-accused, namely, Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu and Nepram
Khomdonbi Devi, has opened bank accounts of many residents of Wangbal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 7
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
G.P. but has not given the account holders their bank passbooks and account
numbers. All these account holders of Wangbal G.P. were made to transact
the bank accounts through her (Thoudam Kamala) with the help of her
compact biometric USB device (a morpho machine was seized from her
residence). The account holders of Wangbal G.P. never knew the actual
wages amount credited to or debited from their respective bank accounts.
They only pressed their fingers in her morpho machine which read their
fingerprints and allow the transactions. After that, the accused, Thoudam
Kamala would give some cash amount as MGNREGS wages without
revealing the actual wages credited into their bank accounts.
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
Page |9
It is stated that on examination of some job card holders of Wangbal G.P.
of Wards 1 and 2, it is revealed that the accused, Thoudam Kamala had never
handed over the job card holders their actual MGNREGS wages on the advice
of elected members (co-accused) but always held back a major portion of the
MGNREGS wages for their own profit. It is suspected that Thoudam Kamala
shared this illegal profit with the co-accused, namely Laishram (O) Athokpam
Thoinu and Nepram Khomdonbi Devi, who are the elected ward Members of
ward number 1 and 2 respectively.
It is also stated that the job card holders are completely unaware of the
MGNREGS wages amount credited to their account or how Thoudam Kamala
in conspiracy with Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu and Nepram Khomdonbi
Devi, had taken out/transferred money from their bank account to another
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 8
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
bank account without their knowledge.
[5] Heard Mr. S. Jibon, learned counsel for the petitioners in AB No.49
of 2022, Mr. N. Mahendra, learned counsel for the petitioner in AB No.48 of
2022 and Mr. RK Umakanta, learned PP for the respondent.
[6] Mr. S. Jibon, learned counsel for the petitioner has raised the
preliminary objection that the petitioners are not public servants as defined by
Section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and hence, the FIR lodged
under PC Act is not maintainable. He further states that amount of fund
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
P a g e | 10
misappropriation or illegal withdrawal is not given in the present case and as
such no offences under Section 420 and 403 IPC are made out.
On plain reading of the OE filed by the complainant, the whole
illegal transaction, fabrication of job card is done by some unknown BDO
officials as well as some private parties and there is no material against the
petitioners as such, he prayed that the bail application may be allowed.
[7] Mr. N. Mahendra, learned counsel for the petitioner in AB No.48
of 2022 submits that the petitioner is only a Business Correspondent Agent of
Punjab National Bank whose primary duty is to facilitate opening of account
of the beneficiaries of MGNREGS of pension fund, self-help group and
scholarship student, etc. and in facilitating withdrawal. It is also stated that the
petitioner has no role in the actual transaction and funds are transferred to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 9
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
respective accounts of the beneficiaries. She enables the transaction by using
the thumb impression of the beneficiary with the help of her compact biometric
USB device. She being only a private, the charge under PC Act will not be
attracted to her and there is no sufficient material to link her to the conspiracy
with the co-accused. Accordingly, Mr. N. Mahendra, learned counsel for the
petitioner in AB No.48 of 2022 prays that the bail application may be allowed
and the petitioner will abide by any conditions as imposed by this Court.
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
P a g e | 11
[8] Mr. RK Umakanta, learned PP for the State states that during the
investigation, many instances are given/mentioned where funds of job card
holders were transferred to the accounts of other persons, even a person of
unsound mind was given job card and his account was linked to some other
person's account and most of the job card holders examined by the police
during the course of investigation, said that they were not given full payment
of the wages and a major portion was withheld by the accused persons and
the conspiracy between the Ward Members and the Bank Correspondent was
revealed during the investigation. Regarding the plea of Mr. S. Jibon, learned
counsel for the petitioners in AB No.49 of 2022 that the elected Ward Members
are not public servant within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the PC Act, Mr.
RK Umakanta, learned PP draws the attention of this Court to the provisions
of Section 2(c)(viii) of Prevention of Corruption Act where public servant is
defined as:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 10
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
"(viii) any person who holds an office by virtue of which he is
authorised or required to perform any public duty."
Sub Section (b) to Section 2 of the Act defines 'public duty' as a duty in
which the State, the public or the community at large has an interest.
So, he submits that on perusal of the Manipur Panchayati Raj Act,
1994, the elected members of Panchayati Raj are entrusted to perform public
duty with respect to the administration of the local self-Government in rural
areas of Manipur and for any matter connected therewith and incidental
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
P a g e | 12
thereto. He draws the attention of this Court to the object of the Manipur
Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 which provides for administration of local self-
government in the rural areas of Manipur. He submits that the elected
members of local body are public servants within the inclusive definition of
Section 2(c)(viii) read with Section 2(b) of PC Act.
The members of the local body being a public servant will be clear from
Section 2(k) of the Manipur Rural Local Bodies Ombudsman Act, 2013 where
members of District Council/Panchayat including its Pradhan or Adhyaksa are
defined as public servant.
[9] Mr. R K Umankanta, learned PP concludes that on co-joint reading
of Sections 2(b), 2(c)(viii) of PC Act, the Manipur Panchayati Raj Act and
Section 2(k) of the Manipur Rural Local Bodies Ombudsman Act, 2013, it is
clear that the elected public members of the Panchayati bodies are public
servants within the meaning of Section 2(c)(viii) of the PC Act. He refers to the
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Manish Trivedi Vs. State
of Rajasthan (2014) 14 SCC 420 where, it was held that every member of the
Panchayat is deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of Section 21
of the IPC. Hence, Mr. RK Umakanta, learned PP submits that as the elected
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 11
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
Ward Members of the Wangbal Gram Panchayat are public servant within the
meaning of Section 2(c)(viii) of PC Act and hence, the charge under PC Act
against the accused Nos.3 Business Correspondent (BC) PNB, Thoubal for
hatching conspiracy with the elected members, is maintainable.
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
P a g e | 13
Mr. RK Umakanta, learned PP also refers to the case of P.
Chidambaram Vs. Directorate of Enforcement reported in (2019) 9 SCC
24 where it was held that power under Section 438 CrPC being an extra-
ordinary remedy, has to be exercised sparingly, more so in case of economic
offences which affect the economic fabric of the society. He has pointed out
that since the petitioners are not co-operating with the investigation and did
not appear before the Investigating Officer during the course of investigation
for the last 5(five) months and the investigation is at the initial stage and the
whole gamut of conspiracy and the transaction are to be discovered, the
custodial interrogation of the accused persons is required. Accordingly, he
prays for rejecting the bail application.
Whether the Elected Members of Panchayat are Public Servants?
[10] This Court has considered the rival submissions of the parties and
perused the materials on record and the case law cited at bar. It will be fruitful
to consider the decisions of the Apex Court in this regard.
[11] A 5 Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court held in the case
of M. Karunanidhi v. Union of India: (1979) 3 SCC 431 that a Chief Minister
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 12
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
is a public servant within the meaning of Section 21(12) of IPC as he is getting
salary from state exchequer for performing public function. Relevant para are
reproduced below:
"57. Three facts, therefore, have been proved beyond doubt:
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
P a g e | 14
1. That a Minister is appointed or dismissed by the Governor and is,
therefore, subordinate to him whatever be the nature and status of his
constitutional functions.
2. That a Chief Minister or a Minister gets salary for the public work done
or the public duty performed by him.
3. That the said salary is paid to the Chief Minister or the Minister from the
Government funds.
It is thus incontrovertible, that the holder of a public office such as the
Chief Minister is a public servant in respect of whom the Constitution
provides that he will get his salary from the Government Treasury so long
he holds his office on account of the public service that he discharges. The
salary given to the Chief Minister is co-terminus with his office and is not
paid like other constitutional functionaries such as the President and the
Speaker. These facts, therefore, point to one and only one conclusion and
that is that the Chief Minister is in the pay of the Government and is,
therefore, a public servant within the meaning of Section 21(12) of the
Penal Code."
[12] Another 5 Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court held in the case
of P.V. Narasimha Rao v. State (CBI/SPE), (1998) 4 SCC 626 that Members
of Parliament and State Legislatures are public servants within the meaning of
Section 2(c)(viii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Para 82 and 85 are
reproduced below for clarity.
"82. Having regard to the object of the 1988 Act as indicated in the
Statement of Objects and Reasons, namely, to widen the scope of the
definition of the expression "public servant", which is sought to be
achieved by introducing the definition of "public duty" in Section 2(b) and
the definition of "public servant" in Section 2(c) which enlarges the scope
of the existing definition of public servant contained in Section 21 IPC, we
do not find any justification for restricting the scope of the wide words used
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14200437/ 13
Laishram (O) Athokpam Thoinu vs The Officer-In-Charge on 3 March, 2023
in sub-clause (viii) of Section 2(c) in the 1988 Act on the basis of the
statement of the Minister so as to exclude Members of Parliament and
Members of the State Legislatures. In our opinion the words used in sub-
clause (viii) of Section 2(c) are clear and unambiguous and they cannot
be cut down on the basis of the statement made by the Minister while
piloting the Bill in Parliament.
AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022
P a g e | 15
......................................................................................
85. Having considered the submissions of the learned counsel on the meaning of the expression
"public servant" contained in Section 2(c) of the 1988 Act, we are of the view that a Member of
Parliament is a public servant for the purpose of the 1988 Act."
[13] The above cited judgments held that elected members are all public servants. It is clear from the
preamble of the Manipur Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 that the Panchayat Body is mandated to perform
the function of local self-Government in the rural areas of Manipur and for matter connected
therewith and incidental thereto. Further, Section 2(k) of the Manipur Rural Local Bodies
Ombudsman Act, 2013 defines members of District Council/Panchayat including its Pradhan or
Adhyaksa are defined as public servants. No doubt administration of local self-Government is a
public duty within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the PC Act. Hence, the elected members will be
"public servants" within the meaning of Section 2(c)(viii) of PC Act and the objections of Mr. S.
Jibon, learned counsel for the petitioners regarding the non-maintainability of the offence under PC
Act is rejected and the present FIR has no inherent defect and since the accused No.3, Bank
Business Correspondent has also participated in conspiracy with accused Nos.1 and 2, elected Ward
Members, there is no inherent defect in the FIR qua the accused persons.
[14] As revealed from the affidavit filed by the State, it is seen that linking of the job card holders
was made to other persons' accounts and hence AB Nos.49 and 48 of 2022 P a g e | 16 there is
cheating and misappropriation on the part of the petitioners and other co-accused. It is also seen
that the job card account was prepared even in the name of unsound person and the same was
linked to other person's account. Such instances which are mentioned in the counter affidavit filed
by the State were revealed during the course of investigation. It may also be noted that the
petitioners herein have never appeared before the IO and participated in the investigation and
without properly examining them and conducting interrogation, the whole picture of the conspiracy
and the fraudulent activities cannot be discovered. Many of the job card holders were not provided
with full payment and a large part of the wages were retained by the petitioners in collusion clearing
indicating materials for the offence of criminal conspiracy, cheating and misappropriation of money.
