ORDER (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] By way of this writ petition, the petitioner assails the order dated 08.09.2022 of
the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, whereby he was subjected to
preventive detention in exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. He seeks a
consequential writ of habeas corpus to set him at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned
Government Advocate, for respondents No. 1, 2 & 4; and Mr. W. Darakeshwar, learned Sr. PCCG,
appearing for respondent No. 3.
[3] The primary ground of attack urged by Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned counsel, against the impugned
order of detention is the delay on the part of the authorities in dealing with the petitioner's
representation against his detention order. According to him, the said representation has not been
disposed of till date. The petitioner's representation is dated 23.09.2022. [4] As per the para-wise
comments furnished to Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned Government Advocate, by the
Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, the said representation was forwarded by him on the
same day to the concerned authority for necessary further action. However, the
affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, makes no
mention of the said representation having been received by the Home Department. It appears that
the Advisory Board was furnished a copy W.P. (Crl) No. 1 of 2023 Page 2 of the petitioner's
representation only by the Investigating Officer and not by the Home Department of the State
Government. It is therefore clear that there was a serious lapse in the forwarding of the petitioner's
representation dated 23.09.2022 and it is not even clear as to where and how this failure occurred.
[5] The file of the detaining authority was produced by Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned Government
Advocate, but it sheds no light on the issue as the representation made by the petitioner was never
received by the Home Department.
[6] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme
Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to
indifference or any other lapse, such delay would adversely affect further detention of the prisoner.
According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in
disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the delay is very short, as even longer
delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is
explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that case was a mere 5 days. [7]
Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur [AIR 1972 Supreme Court
438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground that there was unexplained
delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by the detenu. [8] More
recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and others [(Criminal
Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the Supreme Court
W.P. (Crl) No. 1 of 2023 Page 3 held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State

Md. Najir vs Special Secretary (Home) on 2 February, 2023
Government denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the
delay by the State Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the
procedural rights and guarantees granted to a detenu. [9] Though it is laudable that the Government
of Manipur is waging a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit
drug manufacture, trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its
responsibility to ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the
Constitutional and statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite
this Court stating to this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to
compliance with the prescribed norms.
[10] The unexplained delay on the part of the authorities in dealing with the detenu's representation
dated 23.09.2022 clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on their part, which is
inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The same would also be
fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order. [11] The order of
detention dated 08.09.2022 issued by the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, is
accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand set aside. The
petitioner, Md. Najir, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, shall be set at liberty
forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly required in connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 1 of 2023 is accordingly allowed.
W.P. (Crl) No. 1 of 2023 Page 4 In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs. A copy of
this order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information and
necessary further action in the context of educating all the authorities concerned in the State of
Manipur as to what are the procedural norms that they need to adhere to while exercising power
and jurisdiction under preventive detention laws.
