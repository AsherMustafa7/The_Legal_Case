ORDER
(03.04.2019) These matters were analogously heard on the joint request of the parties. The facts are
taken from WP No.18718/2017.
2. The petitioner was initially appointed as Junior Engineer in Gramin Vidyut Sahkari Samiti, Rewa
on 23.9.1986 (Annexure P/5). The State Government has taken a decision regarding abolition of
Gramin Vidyut Sahkari Samiti and consequently the services of the petitioner were mereged with
the M.P. State Electricity Board (MPSEB) by order dated 18.5.2004 (Annexure P/6) with effect from
15.3.2002. The petitioner has prayed for following reliefs in this petition:
"(i) It is, therefore, prayed that this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to quash the
impugned orders dated 15.12.2014 (Annexure P/1), order dated 09-10-15 (Annexure
P-2), order dated 27-07-2015 (Annexure P-3) and other dated 25-03-17 (Annexure
P-4) and the respondents be directed to give the benefits of third higher pay scale to
the petitioner by counting his previous service from the date of his entitlement in
terms of order dated 04-01-2016 with all service benefits including arrears.
(ii) Respondents be further directed to give the benefits of Revision of Pay
Regulation, 2001 as well as benefits of 6th Pay Commission w.e.f. 01-01-2006 by
modifying the pay fixation dated 11-02-15 with arrears and merge the EPF account
into the GPF account w.e.f. 15-03-2002 and give the benefit of pension at par with
the original employees of MPEB by counting his previous service.
13 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters
(iii) This Hon'ble Court be further pleased to pass any such other orders as this Hon'ble Court may
deem fit under the circumstances of the case."
[Emphasis Supplied]
3. Shri Ajeet Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in these petitions, the
petitioners are similarly situated and have prayed for similar reliefs. If any other uncommon relief is
involved in any matter, such petitioners may be permitted to raise the same in separate fresh
petition/s.
4. To elaborate, Shri Ajeet Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that petitioner in the
instant case was absorbed with effect from 15.3.2002. The respondents have passed the impugned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 12
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
order dated 15.12.2014 (Annexure P/1) whereby it was directed that services of the absorbed
employees shall be counted from the date of absorption for the purposes of grant of higher pay-scale
whereas respondents should have counted the services rendered by the absorbed employees in
erstwhile societies for the purposes of counting their eligibility for grant of higher pay-scale. Learned
counsel for the petitioners submits that para 4 of this order dated 15.12.2014 makes it clear that such
absorbed employees shall get benefit of certain allowances and medical benefits etc. from the date of
issuance of order i.e. 15.12.2014 whereas they were entitled to get the benefits from the date of
absorption. The very same document dated 15.12.2014 was subject matter of challenge before this
Court in WP No.3547/2015 (Uma Shankar Dwivedi vs. State of M.P. and others) decided on
06.10.2015. This Court by order dated 16.10.2015 has set aside the same order dated 15.12.2014. The
employer assailed it before the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.9146-9148/2018. The Apex Court with
little 14 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters modification mentioned in para 4 of the
order which is related with Pay Revision Regulations, 2001 did not disturb the remaining part of
order passed by this Court. Thus, for all practical purposes, the impugned order dated 15.12.2014
except the modification mentioned herein above had attained finality. In the teeth of this order, it is
no more open to the respondents to deprive the petitioners from fruits of medical benefits and other
allowances from the date of absorption. Putting it differently, it is argued that petitioners are
entitled to get these benefits from the date of their absorption.
5. Further more, it is urged that clause 6 of this order dated 15.12.2014 must also be treated as set
aside in view of order passed by this Court in the case of Umashankar Dwivedi (Supra). Shri Ajeet
Singh by taking this court to the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Panchraj Tiwari vs.
MPSEB reported in (2014) 5 SCC 101 contended that once service is merged with another service,
the merged service gets its birth in the integrated service and loses its original identity. Thus,
petitioners for all practical purposes became employees of the respondent-employer and their origin
has lost its significance. Thus, petitioners are entitled to get the benefit of revision of pay-scale and
pension. It is argued that two revisions have taken place in the past. The first revision is pursuant to
'M.P. State Electricity Board (Class III and Class IV Employees) Revision of Pay Regulations, 2001
('Regulations'). Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in clause 1(c)(vi), it was made clear
that these Regulations were not applicable to employees of the Societies who were absorbed in the
Board to whom the pre-revised pay-scales were not applicable. The 15 W.P. No.14594/2014 and
other connected matters Regulations came into being with effect from 1 st January, 2001. The
petitioners who were absorbed subsequent thereto became employees of MPSEB from the date of
their absorption. These Regulations and revised pay-scales arising thereto should be made
applicable on the petitioners.
6. The second pay revision took place with effect from 01.01.2006. It is submitted that by order
dated 18.08.2009 Annexure P/17, the revision of pay-scale was made applicable to the absorbed
employees. In clause 3(c), it was clarified that the arrears of revision of pay shall be payable to the
absorbed employees with effect from 01.08.2009 whereas, for the regular employees of the MPEB, it
was paid from due date i.e. 01.01.2006. Learned counsel submits that this issue also travelled before
the Indore Bench. By order of Indore Bench in WP No.1962/2010 decided on 13.09.2011
(Annexure-P/17) the said action of employer was disapproved. The employer unsuccessfully
challenged the order of writ court before the Division Bench in review jurisdiction. Thereafter, by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 13
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
communication dated 14.1.2015 Annexure P/18, similarly situated absorbed employees, who were
petitioners before the Indore Bench, were given the benefit of revision of pay-scale and arrears with
effect from 1.1.2006. The next contention of learned counsel for the petitioners is for grant of
pension. The basis for this argument is the same i.e. once petitioners became employees of
respondents-Electricity Board, there is no justification in not extending the same pensionary
benefits which were extended to the employees of M.P.S.E.B. Reliance is placed on the judgment of
Indore Bench in WPS No115/2005 (Bijli Karmachari Snagh vs. M.P.S.E.B.) decided on 07.05.2015.
Shri Singh urged that Writ Appeal and SLP(C) 16 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters
No.24772/2016 filed against this judgment were dismissed. It is submitted that in the light of this
judgment, the benefits have already been extended in favour of the similarly situated employees.
7. In nutshell, petitioners have prayed for counting their services rendered in erstwhile societies for
the purposes of grant of time-scale of pay and categorically pleaded in the prayer clause that this
relief may be granted in terms of the order dated 2.1.2016 (Annexure P/22). In addition, as noticed,
the petitioners have prayed for grant of revision of pay as per Regulations of 2001 from the date of
absorption, benefit of revision of pay as per 6th Pay Commission with effect from 1.1.2006 or from
the date of the absorption of the petitioners. The petitioners have prayed for a direction to merge the
EPF Account into GPF Account with effect 15.3.2002 and give the benefit of pension at par with the
original employees of M.P.S.E.B. by counting their previous services.
8. Shri Mukesh Kumar Agrawal, learned counsel for the employer submits that the event of
absorption took place on two occasions. First absorption is relating to eight societies namely:
Multai, Manawar, Banda, Pichor, Gohad and Mungawali. This merger had taken place by order
dated 18.05.2004 w.e.f 15.03.2002. Another merger had taken place on 13.08.2010 relating to
societies of Sidhi, Amarpatan, Loundi, and Nowgaon.
9. Shri Agrawal urged that the petitioners in these batch of petitions became employees of MPSEB
pursuant to two different mergers. It is submitted that so far benefit of revision of pay-scale as per
regulations of 2001 is concerned, the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No. 9146-9148/2018 17 W.P.
No.14594/2014 and other connected matters Uma Shankar Dwivedi's case clearly opined in para 4
that parity can be claimed in limited cases.
10. In the light of this para, Shri Agrawal submits that if petitioners are similarly situated then the
matter is different. Otherwise, the order passed by Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Uma
Shankar Dwivedi(supra) WP No. 3547/2015 dated 06.10.2015 stood modified in view of para 4 of
said order passed by Apex Court.
11. Shri Agrawal urged that subject to fulfillment of conditions mentioned in para 4 of the judgment
in Uma Shankar Dwivedi's case, the regulations of 2001 can be made applicable to the absorbed
employee from the date they became employees of respondent employer.
12. So far benefit of 6th and 7th Pay Commission is concerned, in view of para 5 of judgment of
Supreme Court in Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra), Shri M.K. Agrawal fairly admitted that the
erstwhile employees of societies are entitled to get the benefit of such revision of pay-scale from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 14
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
date they became employees of the respondent/employer.
13. Shri Agrawal submits that the petitioners were earlier governed by different pension
scheme/EPF scheme. The amount of contribution, method of collection, authority with whom
amount was deposited, mode of payment of pension and its calculation, everything was different.
They can switch over to a different pension scheme only when law/rule permits. The petitioners
have not filed any application praying to switch over from earlier scheme to the pension rules
applicable to the MPSEB. In absence thereof, no relief is due to the petitioners.
14. Shri Anoop Nair appeared in WP No. 934/2018 and urged that 18 W.P. No.14594/2014 and
other connected matters petitioners are not entitled to get the benefit of pension as prayed for by
them.
15. Shri J.K. Pillai, appeared in certain matters on behalf of P.F. Organization. He urged that earlier
when petitioners were employees of erstwhile societies, the employer use to deduct the employees
contribution and add their own contribution and deposit it before the P.F. authorities. The day
petitioners became employees of present employer, the said arrangement discontinued. The present
employer is exempted from the purview of employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions
Act 1952. Present employer has created its own trust on which P.F. Organization has no power of
Superintendence. Thus a practical difficulty exists relating to switch over from one method/system
of P.F. to another method governed by different set of rules.
16. Shri Ved Prakash Tiwari appeared in WP No. 22379/2018 and borrowed the arguments
advanced by the other counsel for the employer.
17. Shri A.P. Shroti, learned counsel for the employer has filed written submissions. It is urged that
M.P. Power Management Co. Ltd. is the holding company of all the Distribution Companies
(DISCOMs) including the answering respondent company and, therefore, the order dated 15.12.2014
is applicable mutatis mutandis to all the companies. The petitioners have not challenged the order
dated 18.06.2014 which had attained finality and in absence thereof, petitions deserve to be
dismissed. The petitioner - Praveen Kumar Tiwari filed W.P. Nos.10719/2014 and 20284/2015
challenging inter alia the inaction to pay pension and order dated 15.12.2014. Although this pleading
is not taken in the reply filed, 19 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters since it is
self-evident, this Court can take notice of the same. A list of cases is prepared to show that the order
dated 15.12.2014 has not been challenged in those cases.
18. Regarding claim for pension, GPF, higher pay scale and up- gradation, it is argued that in the
case of Panchraj Tiwari (supra), the terms of absorption were reproduced by Supreme Court. In para
17 of the said judgment, it was made clear that although absorbed employees from the date of
absorption shall be treated as juniors to the juniormost employees of the Electricity Board, all other
principal conditions of absorption shall remain as such. The petitioners/erstwhile employees of the
society were members of EPF Scheme and, therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to get the
benefit of GPF Scheme. Indore Bench order dated 07.05.2015 passed sub silentio the order dated
18.06.2014 which was based on the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Panchraj Tiwari
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 15
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
(supra). This judgment did not consider Para 3.1 and 3.5 of judgment of Panchraj Tiwari (supra)
though it was referred in the said Indore Bench judgment. Hence, said judgment cannot be treated
as binding precedent regarding issue of pension and other conditions of absorption. It is stated that
benefit of pay/higher pay scale was not available to the employees of the Rural Electricity
Co-operative Society. After becoming employees of the MPSEB, they became entitled for
up-gradation of pay on completion of nine years of service and were accordingly granted benefit of
up-gradation.
19. The stand of Shri Shroti regarding 5th and 6th Pay Commission benefits is that as directed in
Civil Appeal of M.P. P.K.V.V. Company Vs. Uma Shankar Dwivedi, the cases are being decided by
the answering 20 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters respondent society-wise and
individual orders are being issued.
20. No other point is pressed by learned counsel for the parties.
21. I have bestowed my anxious consideration on the rival contentions and perused the record.
22. As noticed, there is a chequered history of litigations for various claims of erstwhile employees of
societies who were absorbed in M.P.S.E.B. Before dealing with the claim point-wise, it is condign to
refer certain findings given by the Supreme Court. In Panchraj Tiwari (supra), the Apex Court
opined as under:
"6.3. Once a service is merged with another service, the merged service gets its birth
in the integrated service and loses its original identity. There cannot be a situation,
where even after merger, absorption or integration, such services which were merged
or absorbed, still retain their original status. If so, it is not an absorption or merger or
integration, it will only be a working arrangement without any functional integration.
7. In the instant case, the undisputed factual and legal position is that there is
absorption of the employees of the Rural Electricity Cooperative Society, Rewa with
M.P. SEB. The Society has been deregistered, there is only one service thereafter and
thus there is functional integration. On the basis of the protection of the designation
and pay scale, the employees have to be posted in the equivalent category. Since it is
not specifically provided as to the position of such employees in the integrated
service, it is a settled equitable principle that such employees are placed as junior to
the juniormost officer of the category concerned in M.P. SEB on the date of
absorption viz. 15-3-2002.
16. The instant is a case where there is complete denial of promotion forever which
cannot be comprehended under the constitutional scheme of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India. In this context, we shall refer to a beautiful discussion on this
aspect in S.S. Bola case[(1997) 8 SCC 522] at para 153. The relevant portion reads as
follows: (SCC p. 634) AB. A distinction between right to be considered for promotion
and an interest to be considered for promotion has always been maintained. Seniority
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 16
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
is a facet of interest. The rules prescribe themethod of recruitment/selection.
Seniority is governed by the rules existing as on the date of consideration for
promotion. Seniority is required to be worked out according to the existing rules. No
one has a vested right to promotion or seniority. But an officer has an interest to
seniority acquired by working out the rules. The seniority should be taken away only
by operation of 21 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters valid law. Right
to be considered for promotion is a rule prescribed by conditions of service. A rule
which affects chances of promotion of a person relates to conditions of service. The
rule/provision in an Act merely affecting the chances of promotion [Ed.: The words
between the two asterisks are emphasised in original.] would not be [Ed.: The words
between the two asterisks are emphasised in original.] regarded as varying the
conditions of service. The chances of promotion are not conditions of service. A rule
which merely affects the chances of promotion does not amount to change in the
conditions of service. However, once a declaration of law, on the basis of existing
rules, is made by a constitutional court and a mandamus is issued or direction given
for its enforcement by preparing the seniority list, operation of the declaration of law
and the mandamus and directions issued by the Court is the result of the declaration
of law but not the operation of the rules per se."
(emphasis supplied)
17. In the above circumstances, we set aside the judgment in appeal. The absorbed employees of the
Rural Electricity Cooperative Societies, having due regard to their date of appointment/promotion
in each category in the respective societies, shall be placed with effect from the date of absorption
viz. 15-3-2002 as juniors to the juniormost employee of the Electricity Board in the respective
category. Thereafter, they shall be considered for further promotions as per the rules/regulations of
M.P. SEB. All other principles/conditions of absorption shall remain as such. However, it is made
clear that on such promotions, in the exigencies of service, the employee concerned would also be
liable to be transferred out of the circle, if so required.
18. The appellant accordingly shall be entitled to retrospective promotions on a par with and with
effect from the dates on which the juniormost graduate engineer in the parent service on the date of
absorption obtained such promotions. However, we make it clear that benefits till date need to be
worked out only notionally.
23. In Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra), the Supreme Court in Para 4 has held held as under:
"4. We make it clear that in case Appellant No.1 has extended the benefit of the pay
revision Regulations of 2001, despite the exclusion in the Notification dated
27.04.2006, to those employees where the pre-revised pay scales had not been
applied, the respondent/employees belonging to the Rewa Society will not be
discriminated."
24. Claim regarding benefit of Revision of Pay Regulations, 2001:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 17
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
(i) Shri Ajeet Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners by placing reliance on the
judgment of this Court in Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra) and judgment of Indore
Bench in W.P. No.1962/2010 (Electricity Supply 22 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other
connected matters Employees Union Vs. State of M.P.) stated that all the petitioners
are entitled to get the benefit of pay scale arising out of Regulations of 2001 from the
date of their absorption. By order dated 14.01.2015 (Annexure-
P/18), the order of the Indore Bench in W.P. No.1962/2010 has been implemented and arrears
arising thereto have been paid to the employees.
(ii) Pausing here for a moment, the opening sentence of the order dated 14.01.2015 (Annexure-P/18)
shows that it relates to employees of Manawar Society who were absorbed in M.P.S.E.B. Pertinently,
before absorption, in their parent society also they were getting the same pay scale which their
counter-parts in M.P. S.E.B. were getting at the time of absorption. This is a very important and
distinguishable feature and, therefore, at the outset, this fact has been highlighted. This Court in
W.P. No.No.3547/2017 (Uma Shankar Dwivedi Vs. State) directed that the initial pay at the time of
merger would be the same as they were getting when they were working in the society on the date of
merger. However, it was clarified that such employees would be eligible to get benefit of revision of
pay scale in accordance with the provisions of 5 th and 6th Pay Commission. The arrears arising out
of benefit of 5 th and 6th Pay Commission are required to be paid to the petitioners.
(iii) As noticed, in the appeal, the Apex Court clarified it in Para 4 (reproduced above) and made it
clear that the parity has a limited application. Thus, it is noteworthy that even this Court in the case
of Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra) did not grant benefit of revised pay scale as per Regulations of
2001 and the Apex Court in no uncertain terms made it clear that if appellant No.1 extended the
benefit of pay revision under 23 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters Regulations of
2001 to such employees who were not enjoying the pre- revised pay scales, employees of Rewa
Society cannot be given step motherly treatment. This aspect came up for consideration before the
Division Bench of this Court in 2012 (5) MPHT 183 (Gwalior Bench) (M.P.S.E.B. Vs. Brajendra
Singh Kushwah and others), it was held as under:
"22. The judgment dated 13-9-2011 in W.P. No. 12029/2010, on which heavy reliance
has been placed by the writ Court while rendering the impugned order, has been
delivered on the following two assumptions:
--
(i) That, the employees serving the REC Society (Manawar) were at par with the
employees of the MPSEB in the matter of pay scales; and
(ii) Since the REC Society (Manawar) employees were treated at par with the MPSEB
employees in the matter of pay scales, the bar contained in Clause 1(c)(vi) of the
Regulations of 2001 will not apply.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 18
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
23. The above said two features persuaded the Single Bench of this Court while rendering the
judgment dated 13-9-2011 in WP No. 12029/2010 by issuing directions for treating the employees of
REC Society (Manawar) at par with the MPSEB employees in the matter of pay scale and
accordingly issued the directions for grant of all benefits to such absorbed employees as were
extended to the original employees of the Board.
24. In the present case, the distinguishing feature is the pay disparity which existed not only since
prior to the date of absorption but also continued subsequent thereto on account of the terms and
conditions contained in the order of the Commission granting sanction for revocation of 10 REC
Societies and the consequential orders of absorption. It is neither pleaded nor it is the case of the
petitioners that there was parity of pay scale before or after absorption between the absorbed
employees vis-a-vis the original employees of the Board. Resultantly the petitioners not having
challenged the terms and conditions contained in the order of sanction for revocation of licence
dated 20-2-2002 and also contained in the order of absorption issued by the Board, are now
estopped from challenging the necessary fallout/consequence of pay disparity stemming out of the
said unchallenged terms and conditions.
25. Learned counsel for the Board has placed reliance on various decisions including the Division
Bench decision of this Court dated 27- 7-2007 in Writ Appeal No. 1361/2006 rendered at the
Principal Seat, wherein the Division Bench while dealing with facts and circumstances similar to the
ones existing in this case, upheld the order of the Single Bench passed in Writ Petition No. 463/1999
by holding in paragraphs 18 and 19 of its decision as follows:
"18. Submissions of Mr. Ruprah, learned counsel is that as the 24 W.P.
No.14594/2014 and other connected matters applicant's case was considered by the
society for promotion and at the time of absorption it was mentioned that they would
be absorbed on the same terms and conditions as existing in the society and he was
Junior Engineer and, therefore, he was entitled to be promoted as Assistant Engineer
as such Junior Engineers who have been similarly placed under the services of the
Board have been promoted. As is perceivable the Board had issued further
guidelines/terms and conditions as per order/circular dated 5-6-2004. On reading of
the further terms and conditions it cannot be said that the employee who has been
absorbed in the Board will get the benefit of the Board as if he was an employee of the
Board from very inception. The Board at the time of absorption has fixed the terms
and conditions and on a perusal of such terms and conditions it is quite clear that the
Junior Engineer shall be given the designation but would not be considered for
promotion by applying the Board's regulations as if he was in the Board's services.
The said terms and conditions fixed by the Board are in consonance with the decision
rendered in Ram Parvesh Singh (supra) wherein it has been held that the Board has
no obligation towards the employees of the previous owner's undertaking. Be it noted
to arrive at such a conclusion their Lordships have placed reliance on the decision
rendered in Bhola Nath Mukherjee v. Government of W.B., (1997) 1 SCC 562.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 19
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
19. In view of our preceding analysis we do not find any merit in the present writ appeal and
accordingly the same stands dismissed. However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case
there shall be no order as to costs."
26. In view of the above, it appears that the decision of the Single Bench rendered on 13-9-2011 in
WP No. 12029/2010 was based upon different set of facts and circumstances where the parity
between the absorbed REC Societies employees and the original employees of the Board was not
disputed. Thus, the said decision in W.P. No. 12029/2010 and the reliance placed thereupon is of no
avail to the petitioners/respondents herein, in the present case where no such parity existed either
before or after absorption. Thus, this Court is impelled to hold that the reliance placed by the Writ
Court on the order dated 13-9- 2011 passed in W.P. No. 12029/2010 while passing the impugned
order is misplaced.
27. In the conspectus of the above facts and circumstances and the findings rendered, the Writ
Appeal No. 137/2012, MPSEB v. Brajendra Singh Kushwah is allowed whereas Writ Appeal No.
202/2012, Brajendra Singh Kushwah v. MPSEB is dismissed and the impugned order dated
27-1-2012 passed in Writ Petition No. 2459/2010 is set aside. No order as to costs."
[Emphasis Supplied]
(iv) This judgment of Gwalior Bench was assailed by the employees before the Apex Court in SLP (C)
No.28516/2013 decided on 27.04.2015. The respondent-Board in Para 5 of counter-affidavit filed
before the 25 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters Supreme Court decided to grant the
benefit to the petitioners and, therefore, in terms of the counter affidavit, SLP was disposed of.
(v) In 2013 SCC OnLine MP 10181 (Mukesh Chandra Gupta and others Vs. M.P. State Electricity
Board and others) decided on 09.12.2013, the argument of absorbed employees was based on a
Division Bench judgment of Indore Bench in W.A. No.685/2011 (M.P. State Electricity Board Vs.
Electricity Supply Employees Union) decided on 22.04.2013. This Court in Para 8 & 9 opined as
under:
"8. No doubt, the Indore Bench considered the judgment of Brajendra Singh
Kushwah (supra). A perusal of page 5 of the judgment shows that in the Rural
Electrification Cooperative Society, Manawar the employees were getting pay scale at
par with the respondent-Board. In other words, the pay scales granted to the
employees of Cooperative Society were similar to that of the employees of the Board
before absorption. The absorption order gave protection to employees that existing
terms and conditions will follow. Since in Manawar Society the pay scales were same,
the conditions of absorption were directed to be implemented. However, in Brajendra
Singh Kushwah (supra) the conditions were different. Therefore, Indore Bench in
para 8 of the judgment opined that the present case stands on different factual
footing because the members of respondent No. 1-Union were getting the same pay
scale as employees of the Board prior to their absorption.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 20
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
9. In the present case, admittedly, the pay scales of the petitioners were inferior in the
erstwhile society and, therefore, Indore Bench judgment is of no assistance to them.
The judgment in Brajendra Singh Kushwah (supra) will hold the field. It is apt to
quote paras 24 and 26 of the judgments in Brajendra Singh Kushwah (supra), which
reads as under:-
[Emphasis Supplied]
(vi) A careful reading of the judgments passed in Brajendra Singh Kushwah and
Mukesh Chandra Gupta (supra) makes it clear like noon day that absorbed employees
of Manawar Society were getting pay scale at par with the employees of the
respondent Board. Thus, as per the terms and conditions of the absorption, they had
protection of their service conditions and for this reason, the erstwhile employees of
Manawar Society were given the benefit of same pay scale on their absorption. This
principle and 26 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters benefit of such
parity based on the Regulations of 2001 can be extended only for such employees
who are covered by Para 4 of the order passed by Supreme Court in the case of Uma
Shankar Dwivedi (supra). This aspect is answered accordingly.
25. Claim regarding 6th Pay Commission :
(i) This aspect is no more res integra. In Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra), this Court
opined that absorbed employees are entitled to get 5 th and 6th Pay Commission
benefits. The Apex Court in Para 5 of said judgment opined as under:
"5. As far as implementation of recommendations of Sixth and Seventh Pay
Commissions are concerned, there cannot be any dispute. The benefits will be
extended to the employees of the REC Societies with effect from the date of the
benefits of the Sixth and Seventh Pay Commission have been given to the employees
of Appellant No.1. If there is any arrears to be paid in this regard, the same shall be
paid within three months from today."
[Emphasis Supplied]
(ii) In this view of the matter, it can be safely concluded that absorbed employees are entitled to get
the benefit of corresponding pay scale as per the recommendations of 6th Pay Commission from due
date with arrears of pay.
26. Claim regarding counting previous service for grant of higher pay scale/financial up-gradation
and claim of family pension as per policy applicable to the regular employees of M.P.S.E.B. :
(i) This Court in Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra) opined that if previous service
conditions of the absorbed employees are protected, it cannot be said that they would
not be entitled to get the benefit of service condition available in the Board. If this is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 21
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
allowed, it will mean that absorbed employees are treated as a class separate than the
regular establishment of
27 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters the respondent-Board. Thus, it will amount to
discrimination which runs contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution of India. This cannot be
permitted by framing any policy etc. In no uncertain terms, a finding was given that there was no
policy made in this respect and even when the policy was made, no such restriction was placed by
the respondent-Board, once absorption is completed, the petitioners became part and parcel of main
stream in the establishment of the Board and as such would be entitled to the application of service
conditions of the Board. In Paras 6.3 and 7 of the judgment of Panchraj Tiwari (supra), the Apex
Court has taken the same view.
27. In view of aforesaid judgments, it is clear that upon absorption in M.P. S.E.B., the petitioners
became employees of the Board for all purposes. They cannot be discriminated on the basis of their
birth mark. Otherwise, it will amount to divide a homogeneous class and create a class within the
class which is impermissible in the teeth of Article 14 of the Constitution. In Para 7 of the judgment
of Panchraj Tiwari (supra), their Lordships held that on such integration of service and upon joining
in M.P.S.E.B., the absorbed employees shall be placed as junior to the juniormost officer on the date
of absorption viz. 15.03.2002. Thus, the petitioners will get bottom seniority on the date of
absorption. The ancillary question is : whether services rendered by them in the erstwhile
employment can be counted for the purpose of qualifying service for pension and qualifying
service/eligibility condition for the purpose of grant of time scale of pay ? The question of grant of
pension is no more res integra. The Indore Bench in W.P. (s) No.1151/2005 considered this aspect
28 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters in great detail. Various judgments passed by
the High Court and judgment of Apex Court in Panchraj Tiwari (supra) were considered by Indore
Bench. After meticulous examination of legal position, the Indore Bench opined as under:
"11- Meaning thereby, the employees who have been absorbed were treating at par
with the employees of the M.P. State Electricity Board in the matter of pay scale,
dearness allowance and other fringe benefits, meaning thereby, for all purposes the
employees of the Societies are the employees of M.P. State Electricity Board and the
same benefits which have been extended to the employees of M.P. State Electricity
Board have been extended to the employees who have been absorbed pursuant to
closure of the Society where they were initially appointed.
12- Learned counsel for the petitioner has fairly admitted before this Court that all
the benefits have been granted to the employees of the Society, however, in the
matter of grant of pension, the respondents are not paying the pensionary dues to the
employees who absorbed in the services of the Board.
13- This Court in the light of the judgment delivered in the earlier round of litigation
and also keeping in view the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Brajendra Singh Kushwaha (Supra) and the order passed in the case of Panchraj
Tiwari (Supra) is of the considered opinion that once the employees have absorbed in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 22
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
the services of the M.P. State Electricity Board they are the employees of M.P. State
Electricity Board for all purposes. A instrumentality of the State cannot be permitted
to discriminate between its employees by treating the absorbed employees as a
different class of employees. There is one only class of employees i.e. employees
working in the M.P. State Electricity Board. There is a pensionary scheme for the
employees of the M.P. State Electricity Board, and therefore, the members of the
petitioner - Union, meaning thereby, all the employees absorbed in the services of
M.P. State Electricity Board are certainly entitled for the benefits of pension scheme
and other fringe benefits for which the employees of M.P.State Electricity Board are
entitled.
14- Resultantly, the writ petition stands allowed. The respondents are directed to
extend the pensionary benefits and other fringe benefits to the absorbed employees
who are now the employees of M.P. State Electricity Board. The exercise of passing
necessary orders in respect of pensionary benefits and other fringe benefits be passed
within a period of ninety days from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
The writ petition stands allowed. No order as to costs."
[Emphasis Supplied]
28. It is relevant to note that the employer took the same stand before 29 W.P. No.14594/2014 and
other connected matters Indore Bench that the absorbed employees and regular employees of the
Board are governed by different set of Pension Scheme etc. This stand could not find favour before
the Indore Bench. The said order of W.P. No.1151/2005 was assailed in W.A. No.334/2015 (M.P.
State Electricity Board (Now known as M.P. Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Co. Ltd. Indore Vs.
Bijali Karmchari Sangh) decided on 14.06.2016. The Division Bench after considering the judgment
of Apex Court in Panchraj Tiwari and Brajendra Singh Kushwah (supra) opined as under:
"The Hon'ble Single Judge has reproduced the relevant part of all the judgments,
hence the issue regarding the service conditions of the employees and societies who
were absorbed in the Board is no more res integra and has been settled by this Court
as well as by the Supreme Court. It is not in dispute that the employees who were
absorbed are treated at par with the employees of the Board shall get the benefits
which includes pensionary benefits and other fringe benefits also. Further contention
of the appellant is also liable to be rejected in respect of that the employees of
petitioner-society covered under the Employees Provident Fund Act and Payment of
Gratuity Act, 1972 because once it has been held that after absorption they are treated
at par with the employees of Board then they shall get the same benefits which has
been granted to the employees of the Board."
[Emphasis Supplied]
29. The writ Court and Division Bench in said writ appeal considered the judgment of Panchraj
Tiwari (supra) in extenso and, therefore, I am unable to persuade myself with the argument of Shri
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 23
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
Shroti that said judgment may be treated as sub silentio. In view of this binding judgment passed in
W.A. No.334/2015 against which SLP No.24772/2016 was dismissed on merits on 30.11.2018, I am
inclined to hold that the judgment of Indore Bench in Bijali Karmchari Sangh decided on
07.05.2015 will apply mutatis mutandis to present batch of petitions. Thus subject to fulfilling the
formalities, petitioners are entitled to get pensions and fringe benefits as per the judgment of Bijlai
Karmchari Sangh (supra).
30 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters
30. There is no scintilla of doubt that services rendered by the petitioners in the society are taken
into account for the purpose of qualifying service for determining pension/retiral dues. The question
is : whether those services can be counted for the purpose of grant of higher pay scale ? In the relief
clause, the petitioners have categorically prayed that their previous services from the date of
entitlement in terms of the order dated 04.01.2016 may be directed to be counted for the purpose of
grant of third higher pay scale. A careful reading of terms and conditions for grant of third time
scale of pay (higher pay scale) mentioned in circular dated 04.01.2016 (Annexure-P/22) shows that
the service shall be counted in any cadre from the date of appointment to the post, which is a regular
post of that cadre. For example, it is mentioned that in a ministerial grade, O.A. Grade III is entry
post whereas for Line Staff, it is Line Attendant. Similarly, in Engineering/Officer Cadre, Junior
Engineer/Assistant Engineer or equivalent is the entry post. As per Clause (ii) of the terms and
conditions, the service can be counted from the date of appointment in any cadre. As per FR-9(iv),
"Cadre" means "the strength of service or a part of service sanctioned as a separate unit". By no
stretch of imagination, it can be said that previous service of the petitioners before absorption was
rendered in the cadre of M.P.S.E.B. In absence thereto, those services cannot be taken into account
for the purpose of grant of higher pay scale. Thus, this claim is devoid of merits and deserves
rejection.
31. Claim regarding benefit of medical reimbursement and allowances:
The petitioners have challenged the order dated 15.12.2014 [(Annexure-
P/1) Clause (4)] whereby while granting the benefits of medical 31 W.P.
No.14594/2014 and other connected matters reimbursement, allowances arising out
of working during National Festivals and other allowances and benefits were
extended from the date of order viz. 15.12.2014. This is trite in view of the judgment
of Supreme Court in Panchraj Tiwari (supra) that once petitioners are absorbed in
M.P.S.E.B., they became employees of M.P.S.E.B.. Their origin/birth mark pales into
insignificance. The respondents themselves decided to grant them aforesaid benefit
from 15.12.2014. There is no justification in depriving them from these benefits from
the date of absorption. Thus, I am constrained to hold that action of the employer in
extending the aforesaid benefits mentioned in Clause (4) of the order dated
15.12.2014 from the date of issuance of order is bad in law. Indeed, the petitioners are
entitled to get the said benefits from the date of absorption.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190343853/ 24
Naresh Chandra Pawar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 April, 2019
32. In view of the foregoing analysis, these batch of petitions are disposed of with
following directions:
(i) The petitioners may claim and shall be entitled to get the pay scale prescribed in
the Regulations of 2001 provided their cases are covered by Para 4 of the order
passed by the Supreme Court in the case of Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra). If their
cases are covered, the petitioners may file applications claiming the said benefits and
if they are similar qua the employees of Manawar Society and their cases are covered
by Para 4 of the judgment of Uma Shankar Dwivedi (supra), it shall be the duty of the
respondents to extend the similar benefit of pay scale to the petitioners from due
