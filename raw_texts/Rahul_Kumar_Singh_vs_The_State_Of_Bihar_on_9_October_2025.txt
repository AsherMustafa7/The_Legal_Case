11. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.N. Mukherjee v. Union of
India, reported as (1990) 4 SCC 594, while considering one of Patna High Court CWJC No.11354 of
2024 dt.09-10-2025 the questions, whether there is a general principle of law which requires an
administrative authority to record the reasons for its decision, had held as under:-
36. Reasons, when recorded by an administrative authority in an order passed by it
while exercising quasi-judicial functions, would no doubt facilitate the exercise of its
jurisdiction by the appellate or supervisory authority. But the other considerations,
referred to above, which have also weighed with this Court in holding that an
administrative authority must record reasons for its decision, are of no less
significance. These considerations show that the recording of reasons by an
administrative authority serves a salutary purpose, namely, it excludes chances of
arbitrariness and ensures a degree of fairness in the process of decision making. The
said purpose would apply equally to all decisions and its application cannot be
confined to decisions which are subject to appeal, revision or judicial review. In our
opinion, therefore, the requirement that reasons be recorded should govern the
decisions of an administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial functions
irrespective of the fact whether the decision is subject to appeal, revision or judicial
review. It may, however, be added that it is not required that the reasons should be as
elaborate as in the decision of a court of law. The extent and nature of the reasons
would depend on particular facts and circumstances. What is necessary is that the
reasons are clear and explicit so as to indicate that the authority has given due
consideration to the points in controversy. The need for recording of reasons is
greater in a case where the order is passed at the original stage. The appellate or
revisional authority, if it affirms such an order, need not give separate reasons if the
appellate or revisional authority agrees with the reasons contained in the order under
challenge.
37. Having considered the rationale for the requirement to record the reasons for the
Patna High Court CWJC No.11354 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 decision of an
administrative authority exercising quasi-judicial functions we may now examine the
legal basis for imposing this obligation. While considering this aspect the
Donoughmore Committee observed that it may well be argued that there is a third
principle of natural justice, namely, that a party is entitled to know the reason for the
decision, be it judicial or quasi-judicial. The Committee expressed the opinion that
"there are some cases where the refusal to give grounds for a decision may be plainly
unfair; and this may be so, even when the decision is final and no further proceedings
are open to the disappointed party by way of appeal or otherwise" and that "where
further proceedings are open to a disappointed party, it is contrary to natural justice
that the silence of the Minister or the Ministerial Tribunal should deprive them of the
opportunity". (p. 80) Prof. H.W.R. Wade has also expressed the view that "natural
justice may provide the best rubric for it, since the giving of reasons is required by the
ordinary man's sense of justice". (See Wade, Administrative Law, 6th edn. p. 548.) In
Siemens Engineering Co. case [(1976) 2 SCC 981 : 1976 Supp SCR 489] this Court has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184118963/ 5
Rahul Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
taken the same view when it observed that "the rule requiring reasons to be given in
support of an order is, like the principles of audi alteram partem, a basic principle of
natural justice which must inform every quasi-
judicial process". This decision proceeds on the basis that the two well known principles of natural
justice, namely (i) that no man should be a judge in his own cause, and (ii) that no person should be
judged without a hearing, are not exhaustive and that in addition to these two principles there may
be rules which seek to ensure fairness in the process of decision-making and can be regarded as part
of the principles of natural justice. This view is in consonance with the law laid down by this Court
in A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India [(1969) 2 SCC 262 :
(1970) 1 SCR 457] wherein it has been held : (SCR pp. 468-69 : SCC p. 272, para 20)
Patna High Court CWJC No.11354 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 "The concept of natural
justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years. In the past it was
thought that it included just two rules namely : (i) no one shall be a judge in his own
cause (nemo debet esse judex propria causa), and
(ii) no decision shall be given against a party without affording him a reasonable
hearing (audi alteram partem). Very soon thereafter a third rule was envisaged and
that is that quasi-judicial enquiries must he held in good faith, without bias and not
arbitrarily or unreasonably. But in the course of years many more subsidiary rules
came to be added to the rules of natural justice."
38. A similar trend is discernible in the decisions of English courts wherein it has been held that
natural justice demands that the decision should be based on some evidence of probative value. (See
: R. v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner ex p. Moore [(1965) 1 QB 456 : (1965) 1 All ER 81] ;
Mahon v. Air New Zealand Ltd. [1984 AC 648 : (1984) 3 All ER 201] )
39. The object underlying the rules of natural justice "is to prevent miscarriage of justice"
and secure "fair play in action". As pointed out earlier the requirement about
recording of reasons for its decision by an administrative authority exercising
quasi-judicial functions achieves this object by excluding chances of arbitrariness and
ensuring a degree of fairness in the process of decision-making. Keeping in view the
expanding horizon of the principles of natural justice, we are of the opinion, that the
requirement to record reason can be regarded as one of the principles of natural
justice which govern exercise of power by administrative authorities. The rules of
natural justice are not embodied rules. The extent of their application depends upon
the particular statutory framework whereunder jurisdiction has been conferred on
the administrative authority. With regard to the exercise of a particular power by an
administrative authority including exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial functions the
legislature, while conferring the said Patna High Court CWJC No.11354 of 2024
dt.09-10-2025 power, may feel that it would not be in the larger public interest that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184118963/ 6
Rahul Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
the reasons for the order passed by the administrative authority be recorded in the
order and be communicated to the aggrieved party and it may dispense with such a
requirement. It may do so by making an express provision to that effect as those
contained in the Administrative Procedure Act, 1946 of U.S.A. and the Administrative
Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, 1977 of Australia whereby the orders passed by
certain specified authorities are excluded from the ambit of the enactment. Such an
exclusion can also arise by necessary implication from the nature of the subject
matter, the scheme and the provisions of the enactment. The public interest
underly-ing such a provision would outweigh the salutary purpose served by the
requirement to record the reasons. The said requirement cannot, therefore, be
insisted upon in such a case.
40. For the reasons aforesaid, it must be concluded that except in cases where the requirement has
been dispensed with expressly or by necessary implication, an administrative authority exercising
judicial or quasi-judicial functions is required to record the reasons for its decision.
12. Summarizing the principles of law, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kranti Associates
(P) Ltd. v. Masood Ahmed Khan, reported as (2010) 9 SCC 496, had held as under -
"46. The position in the United States has been indicated by this Court in S.N.
Mukherjee [(1990) 4 SCC 594 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 669 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 242 : (1991) 16
ATC 445 : AIR 1990 SC 1984] in SCC p. 602, para 11 : AIR para 11 at p. 1988 of the
judgment. This Court held that in the United States the courts have Patna High Court
CWJC No.11354 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 always insisted on the recording of reasons
by administrative authorities in exercise of their powers. It was further held that such
recording of reasons is required as "the courts cannot exercise their duty of review
unless they are advised of the considerations underlying the action under review". In
S.N. Mukherjee [(1990) 4 SCC 594 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 669 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 242 :
(1991) 16 ATC 445 : AIR 1990 SC 1984] this Court relied on the decisions of the US
Court in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corpn. [87 L Ed 626 : 318
US 80 (1942)] and Dunlop v.
Bachowski [44 L Ed 2d 377 : 421 US 560 (1974)] in support of its opinion discussed
above."
"47. Summarizing the above discussion, this Court holds:
(a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in
administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
(b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions.
(c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of justice
that justice must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184118963/ 7
Rahul Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
(d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible arbitrary
exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.
(e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision-maker on
relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous considerations.
(f) Reasons have virtually become Patna High Court CWJC No.11354 of 2024
dt.09-10-2025 as indispensable a component of a decision-making process as
observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial and even by
administrative bodies.
(g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior courts.
(h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and
constitutional governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts.
This is virtually the lifeblood of judicial decision-making justifying the principle that reason is the
soul of justice.
(i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as different as the judges
and authorities who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common purpose
which is to demonstrate by reason that the relevant factors have been objectively
considered. This is important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice delivery
system.
(j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and
transparency.
(k) If a judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about his/her
decision-making process then it is impossible to know whether the person deciding is
faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to principles of incrementalism.
(l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct. A pretence of
reasons or "rubber-stamp reasons" is not to be equated with a valid decision-making
process.
(m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of restraint on abuse
of judicial powers.
Transparency in decision-making not only makes the judges and decision-makers less prone to
errors but also makes them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial
Candor [(1987) 100 Harvard Law Review 731-37] .)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184118963/ 8
Rahul Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
(n) Since the requirement to record Patna High Court CWJC No.11354 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025
reasons emanates from the broad doctrine of fairness in decision-making, the said requirement is
now virtually a component of human rights and was considered part of Strasbourg Jurisprudence.
See Ruiz Torija v. Spain [(1994) 19 EHRR 553] EHRR, at 562 para 29 and Anya v. University of
Oxford [2001 EWCA Civ 405 (CA)] , wherein the Court referred to Article 6 of the European
Convention of Human Rights which requires, "adequate and intelligent reasons must be given for
judicial decisions".
(o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting up precedents for the
future. Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the
essence and is virtually a part of "due process".
13. The doctrine of audi alteram partem has three basic essentials. Firstly, a person against whom an
order is required to be passed or whose rights are likely to be affected adversely, must be granted an
opportunity of being heard. Secondly, the authority concerned should provide a fair and transparent
procedure and lastly, the authority concerned must apply its mind and dispose of the matter by a
reasoned or speaking order. A disciplinary authority acting in a quasi- judicial capacity, arriving at
an adverse finding to impose a punishment must support the same with cogent reasons. The orderly
functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency
acted, be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained. The importance of passing a Patna High Court
CWJC No.11354 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 reasoned order by such an authority is sine qua non and
numerous judicial precedents have time and again underscored the imperative and fundamental
importance of recording the reasons.
14. Pertinently, the law laid down in Roop Singh Negi v. Punjab National Bank, reported as (2009) 2
SCC 570 had held that examination of witnesses is not an inviolable rule and that it would depend
on the facts of each case. Considering the facts of the present case, it is clear, that the finding of guilt
in the factual prism of the present case could not have been arrived at without examination of the
witnesses, and therefore not affording an opportunity to the petitioner to cross-examine the
witnesses and directly drawing a conclusion is violative of the principles of natural justice and as
such would vitiate the process.
15. Further, turning to the facts of the present case, it is evident that the respondent authorities
acting in quasi- judicial capacity have to act fairly. Pertinently, the petitioner was not afforded an
opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and the documents relied upon have also not been
supplied to him. The documents must not only be placed in the disciplinary proceedings but also be
proved for it to be relied upon in the Patna High Court CWJC No.11354 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025
proceedings.
16. It is trite law that the disciplinary authority acting in quasi-judicial capacity must meet the
threshold of preponderance of possibilities before arriving at a finding of guilt. In the present case, it
appears that the disciplinary authority has failed to meet the threshold and awarded the maximum
punishment without strictly adhering to the Principles of natural justice.

Rahul Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
17. The disciplinary authority not having afforded adequate opportunity to defend himself and not
passing an order after due consideration can not be sustained.
18. Accordingly considering the afore-quoted decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the
deviation from the strict adherence to the principles of natural justice, as noted herein above, the
punishment of dismissal imposed upon the petitioner can not be sustained. Therefore the impugned
orders dated 25.08.2017 passed by Superintendent of Police, Madhubani by which the petitioner
was dismissed from service and the appellate order dated 10.08.2018, rejecting the appeal are
hereby quashed. The respondent no. 5 is hereby directed to reinstate the petitioner in the service
forthwith. The petitioner shall be entitled to all consequential benefits as are admissible Patna High
Court CWJC No.11354 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 under law.
19. The certified copy of the order by which the learned trial Court had discharged the petitioner is
taken on record.
20. This writ petition is allowed to the above extent.
