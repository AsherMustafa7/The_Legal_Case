6. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is a citizen of Myanmar
having his residence at Kawhmu Village, Moha Rangoon, Myanmar. He along with 9 others were
initially arrested in connection with FIR No.94(08)2019 on the file of the Thoubal Police Station
under Section 22(c)/29/60 of the ND & PS Act and after filing the charge sheet in Special Trial Case

Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
No.12 of 2020, the charge hearing of the case was done. By the order dated 20.01.2021, the trial
Court discharged all the 9 accused from liabilities of the case, including the petitioner, who was
arrayed as accused No.2.
7. The learned counsel further submitted that aggrieved by the discharge order, the respondent State
preferred Criminal Revision Petition No.10 of 2021 and by the order dated 17.4.2021, this Court
stayed the order of discharge and issued an interim order directing the learned Special Judge,
Thoubal to issue warrant for arresting the petitioner and remanding him into judicial custody.
Aggrieved by such order, the petitioner has filed M.C.No.2 of 2021. In the meanwhile, the petitioner
filed Criminal Miscellaneous (B) Case No.65 of 2021 under Section 390 Cr.P.C. before the learned
Special Judge, Thoubal praying to release him on bail. However, MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of
2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 Page |5 the said application was dismissed on the ground
that M.C.No.2 of 2021 is pending.
8. The learned counsel then submitted that since the Superintendent of Manipur Central Jail failed
to release the petitioner pursuant to the discharge order, he had filed Criminal Miscellaneous Case
No.6 of 2021 before the learned Special Judge, wherein the Superintendent of Police submitted his
reply stating that the petitioner being a foreign national was released on 21.1.2021 and received by a
team of District Police, Imphal East led by SI of Police, Heingang Police Station. However,
concealing this fact, the Heingang Police arrested the petitioner by registering FIR No.10(01)2021
under Section 14A(a)/14(A)(b) of the Foreigner Act and he was produced before the learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Imphal East and the learned CJM, Imphal East remanded him to police custody
till 27.1.2021.
9. The learned counsel next submitted that by the order dated 27.1.2021, the petitioner was released
on bail, however, he was kept in the safe custody of the Investigating Officer. In the meantime,
charge sheet was filed in the said case and the petitioner was discharged from liabilities on 11.2.2021
with a direction to the police to hand over the petitioner to the Immigration Office or the
MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 Page |6 concerned
Department for doing the needful. Since the respondent Police failed to follow the direction, the
petitioner filed Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.75 of 2021 before the CJM, Imphal East for
contempt. By the order dated 19.4.2021, the said Miscellaneous Case was disposed of by the learned
CJM, Imphal East forwarding the case to the High Court for passing necessary orders regarding the
custody of the petitioner.
10. The learned counsel argued that the Visa of the petitioner had expired and unless the same is
validated, there is no question of him leaving the country and returning to his home country.
Further, there is no possibility of the petitioner absconding and interfering with the prosecution. On
the other hand, if the petitioner is again remanded, he would be put to great prejudice, as there will
be no opportunity of regularizing his documents for staying in India. Further, there is possibility of
dismissing the Criminal Revision Petition filed by the respondent State.
11. According to the learned counsel, the petitioner was affected HIV positive while in custody at
Manipur Central Jail and he was issued with Patient Booklet for giving Antiretrovial Therapy. Now
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6328118/ 3
Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
the petitioner is facing danger to his health and sees no hope for his future life. The jail is now
becoming his death call and MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of
2021 Page |7 therefore, immediate remedial measures are requested to protect his life and personal
safety. For the purpose of considering the case of bail, the medical report/reports of the petitioner
maintained by the Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa are to be called for.
12. The learned counsel finally argued that despite the petitioner being discharged from liabilities,
he was unnecessarily detained in the jail from the date of Initial arrest till today, thereby facing
untold and inhuman hardship. Unless the petitioner is enlarged on bail, he shall be greatly
prejudiced. He has come to India by a valid Visa and passport and he is ready to comply with any
condition Imposed on him by this Court, Including any direction to surrender his passport In the
Court and also to stay at a place designated by this Court and also to report to the concerned police
station from time to time. Earlier, the petitioner approached the learned Special Judge, Thoubal by
filing Criminal Miscellaneous Case (B) No.65 of 2021. However, the same was dismissed on the
ground that M.C.No.2 of 2021 is pending. In such facts and circumstances, the learned counsel for
the petitioner prays for release of the petitioner on bail.
13. Opposing the prayers made in the petitions, Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Additional Advocate
General submitted that the MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of
2021 Page |8 petitioner is the real owner of the seized WY tablets and in fact, he had transported the
seized consignment with the other co-accused from Moreh to Imphal and then to Bangladesh via
Dimapur, Silchar, Agartala respectively. The respondent State has preferred a Criminal Revision
Petition No.10 of 2021 against the order passed by the learned Special Judge discharging the
accused persons.
14. He further submitted that pursuant to the order dated 20.1.2021, the officer-in-charge of
Thoubal Police Station received release order and after completing the formalities, the Reversed
Section of Jail staff tried to find out the relatives of the petitioner, but no relatives were found to
receive the petitioner till 4.30 p.m. on 20.1.2021. The petitioner could not be released as it becomes
dark and the authority wanted to release him on bright day light. Accordingly, the petitioner was
released from jail on 21.1.2021 at 10.30 a.m.
15. He further added that on 21.1.2021 while a team of Heingang Police Station was on patrolling,
they found the petitioner was found at loitering at Khabeisoi area and he was arrested as he violated
the Visa norms by not registering with Foreigner Registration Office. Accordingly, a case in FIR
No.10(01)2021 under Section 14A(a)/14A(b) of the Foreigner Act was registered MC(Crl.Revn.P.)
Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 Page |9 against him. Further, the
officer-in-charge of Heingang Police Station tried to hand over the petitioner to the Immigration
Office in order to comply with the direction of this Court, but no response has been communicated
from the concerned authorities.
16. The learned Additional Advocate General further submitted that the prayer of the petitioner to
enlarge him on bail cannot be considered in view of the fact that he is a foreign national with
hardened criminal record and as such, if he enlarged on bail, then he will abscond unknown areas in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6328118/ 4
Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
Myanmar and it will be very difficult for the prosecution to complete the trial in the criminal case
registered against him.
17. Insofar as the prayer of the petitioner to call for the medical records from the Jail authority is
concerned, the learned Additional Advocate General argued that the officer-in-charge of Thoubal
Police Station has not received any information regarding the confirmation of the HIV positive of
the petitioner. He further submitted that the warrant of arrest issued by the learned Special Judge in
Special Trial Case No.12 of 2021 was executed and the petitioner was remanded into judicial
Custody on 26.4.2021, where he was subjected to medical examination, but no complaint of such
disease was found. However, the respondent Police came to know MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of
2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 10 from the medical documents produced by the
petitioner that ART treatment has already started and as such, the immediate treatment is not
required. Therefore, there is no question of calling for the medical records from the Jail authorities.
18. Coming to the prayer of the petitioner to enlarge him on bail, the learned Additional Advocate
General argued that the petitioner and other accused were discharged on 20.1.2021 on wrong
presumption of facts and laws and that the learned Special Judge misconstrued the facts of the
present case and also the relevant provision of law by applying Section 42 (1) of the ND & PS Act. In
fact, the petitioner had expired his Visa and unless the same is validated, there is no guarantee that
he may not leave India as he was an International drug smuggler, as he has his own organization in
everywhere. There is also every possibility that the petitioner may commit similar offence if he is
released on bail as he has link with his own associates.
19. According to the learned Additional Advocate General, if the petitioner was released on bail, he
will not appear before the Court as and when required. It is their apprehension that he may flee
away to this country by any means as he regularly visited Manipur for transporting the WY tablets to
Bangladesh through MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a
g e | 11 Tripura. The main Criminal Revision Petition No.10 of 2021 may be heard finally as the
order dated 20.1.2021 is directly contrary to the settled law of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and thus,
prayed for dismissal of the bail petition along with the other two petitions, namely M.C.Nos.2 and 7
of 2021.
20. This Court considered the rival submissions of parties and also perused the materials available
on record.
21. The grievance of the petitioner is that he and the other accused were initially arrested by the
Thoubal Police in connection with FIR No.94(08)2019 and after the charge sheet was filed in
Special Trial Case no.12 of 2020 on the file of the Special Judge (ND & PS), Thoubal, the charge
hearing was conducted and by the order dated 20.1.2021, the learned Special Judge discharged all
the accused.
22. According to the petitioner, after passing the order for discharge, the Superintendent of Manipur
Central Jail has failed to release the petitioner. However, concealing the fact, the Heingang Police
arrested the petitioner by registering FIR No.10(01)2021 under Section 14A(a) and (b) of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6328118/ 5
Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
Foreigners Act and produced before the learned CJM, Imphal East and remanded him to police
custody and still the petitioner is in custody. According to the MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of
2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 12 petitioner, charge in FIR No.10(01)2021 was
filed and considered and the petitioner was discharged from liabilities on 11.2.2021 by the learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Imphal East. While discharging the petitioner, the learned CJM observed
that the accused is admittedly a Foreigner and at present he does not possess valid documents for
his stay in the country. Hence, the accused is to be handed over to the Immigration office/or
concerned Department for doing the needful. Since the petitioner has been kept in custody without
handing over to the Immigration office, the petitioner filed contempt proceedings in Criminal
Miscellaneous Case No.75 of 2021. By the order dated 19.4.2021, the learned CJM, Imphal East
forwarded the same to the High Court for passing necessary orders regarding the custody of the
petitioner.
23. In the meanwhile, aggrieved by the order dated 20.1.2021, the State has preferred Criminal
Revision Petition and by the order dated 17.4.2021, this Court, while admitting the Revision, stayed
the operation of the order dated 20.1.2021 passed by the learned Special Judge. This Court also
directed the learned Special Judge, Thoubal to issue warrant for arresting the petitioner and remand
him into judicial custody. In view of the above facts and circumstances, the petitioner has filed
M.C.No.2 of 2021 to recall MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of
2021 P a g e | 13 the order dated 17.4.2021 and M.C.No.3 of 2021 to enlarge him on bail. According
to the petitioner, he was affected by HIV positive, for which he was taking ART treatment. Since the
petitioner was facing grave danger to his health and in order to show that he was affected seriously,
the medical records are to be called for. Accordingly, a prayer is made in M.C.No.7 of 2021.
24. On the other hand, it is the say of the respondent State that when M.C.No.2 of 2021 is pending
for recalling of the order dated 17.4.2021 passed by this Court, M.C.No.3 of 2021 for releasing him
on bail is not maintainable. Ultimately, the prayer in M.C.Nos.2 of 2021 and 3 of 2021 is similar.
According to the respondent State, earlier, the petitioner has filed Criminal Misc. (B) Case No.65 of
2021 before the learned Special Judge for releasing him on bail and the same was dismissed on
7.7.2021. Therefore, taking note of the factual situation and the respondent State has every hope to
succeed in the Criminal Revision Petition and also if the petitioner is released, he will not appear
before the Court as and when required as he was a foreign national. Further, the Court also directed
the learned Special Judge, Thoubal to issue warrant for arresting the petitioner and remand him
into judicial custody. In view of the above facts and circumstances, the petitioner has filed
MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 14 M.C.No.2 of
2021 to recall the order dated 17.4.2021 and M.C.No.3 of 2021 to enlarge him on bail. According to
the petitioner, he was affected by HIV positive, for which he was taking ART treatment. Since the
petitioner was facing grave danger to his health and in order to show that he was affected seriously,
the medical records are to be called for. Accordingly, a prayer is made in M.C.No.7 of 2021.
25. On the other hand, it is the say of the respondent State that when M.C.No.2 of 2021 is pending
for recalling of the order dated 17.4.2021 passed by this Court, M.C.No.3 of 2021 for releasing him
on bail is not maintainable. Ultimately, the prayer in M.C.Nos.2 of 2021 and 3 of 2021 is similar.
According to the respondent State, earlier, the petitioner has filed Criminal Misc. (B) Case No.65 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6328118/ 6
Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
2021 before the learned Special Judge for releasing him on bail in and the same was dismissed on
7.7.2021. Therefore, taking note of the factual situation and the respondent State has every hope to
succeed in the Criminal Revision Petition and also if the petitioner is released, he will not appear
before the Court as and when required as he was a foreign national. Further, ART treatment to the
petitioner has already started and as such, immediate treatment is not required and therefore, the
question of calling for MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P
a g e | 15 the medical records of the petitioner does not arise. Thus, prayed for dismissal of the all
three petitions.
26. There is no dispute that pursuant to the discharge order dated 20.1.2021 passed in Special Trial
Case No.12 of 2020 and upon the receipt of the order and also after completing the formalities, the
Reversed Section of Jail tried to find out the relatives of the petitioner, however, no relatives were
found to receive the petitioner till 4.30 P.M. and the Jail authority decided to release him on bright
day light and accordingly, he was released on 21.1.2021 at 10.30 A.M.
27. There is also no dispute that in the second case being FIR No.10(1) HNG PS registered under
Section 14A of the Foreigner Act, the learned CJM, Imphal East, discharged him by the order dated
11.2.2021 in Criminal (P) Case No.3 of 2021. As against the discharge of the petitioner in the
aforesaid case, the State has not been preferred any appeal or revision. As such, there is no case
pending against the petitioner. However, he is in custody.
28. The material produced before this Court would disclose that the petitioner was in custody from
24.8.2019, the day of his entry to Manipur till his arrest in FIR No.10 stated above. At the time his
entry, the petitioner was having valid Visa and the Visa MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:-
Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 16 expired during the period he remained in judicial custody.
Thus, the stay of the petitioner exceeding the period for which the Visa was issued cannot be termed
to be voluntary, as Section 14(a) of the Foreigner Act provides that the stay has to be voluntary. In
such view of the matter, the stay of the petitioner will not be covered under the aforesaid provision.
Likewise the provision of Section 14(b) also does not attract as the petitioner allegedly came to
Manipur to conduct betel nut business, however, he has remained in custody throughout his stay.
Taking note of the all theses facts, the petitioner was discharged from FIR No.10(1)2021 HNG PS
and the learned CJM, Imphal East has also rightly held so. In the absence of any rebuttal from the
side of the respondent State and also in the absence of any appeal or revision against the order dated
11.2.2021, this Court is of the considered view that as such there is no case pending against the
petitioner.
29. At this juncture, the point to be considered in these petitions is whether the petitioner is entitled
to enlarge on bail as prayed for by him.
30. As stated above, the petitioner was arrested on 24.8.2019 in connection with FIR No.94(8)2019
and since then he has been in judicial custody and when he was discharged from the
MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 17 said case on
20.1.2021 and nobody came to receive the petitioner from the jail, the jail authorities kept him in jail
and on the next day, they released him. However, on 21.1.2021, the Heingang Police registered an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6328118/ 7
Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
FIR against the petitioner in FIR No.10(1)2021 under the Foreigner Act alleging that the petitioner
had violated the Visa norms by not registering with the Foreigner Registration Office.
31. Admittedly, the petitioner is in custody from day one he reached Manipur and on 21.01.2021 that
is on the next day of discharge from the charges in FIR No.94(8)2019 by the learned Special Judge,
the respondent police arrested the petitioner alleging that he had violated the Visa norms. From the
above narrated facts and also as held by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Imphal East in
Criminal (P) Case No.3 of 2021, it is clear that the petitioner was having valid Visa while entering
Manipur during 2019. In view of the above, this Court is of the view that how it could be said that
the petitioner had violated the Visa norms, as the petitioner was in custody. Thus, as of now there is
no case pending against the petitioner for retaining him in jail. Further, nothing has been produced
by the respondent State to show that pursuant to the order dated 11.2.2021 passed by the learned
CJM, Imphal East, the petitioner was handed over to the Immigration MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and
7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 18 Officer or the concerned Department. That
apart, the respondent State allowed the order dated 11.02.2021 to attain finality. Thus, the detention
of the petitioner in the jail is questionable in view of the discharge from the offence under Section 14
of the Foreigner Act by the learned CJM, Imphal East. Thus, the personal liberty of the petitioner is
very much affected.
32. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, when this Court considers the bail
application of the petitioner, it is apposite to mention that Article 14 of the Constitution of India
guarantees equality before law or equal protection of laws within the territory of India, which is
applicable to "person" which would also include the "citizen" of the country and "non-citizen". This
reflects that the Indian Legal system does not bring the nationality of an individual into
consideration while granting him the benefit of the provisions of bail. There is no discrimination or
differentiation in granting bail to a foreign national in India. That apart, the personal liberty is of
utmost importance in our constitutional system recognized under Article 21 of the Constitution of
India. Deprivation of personal liberty must be founded on the most serious considerations relevant
to welfare objectives of the society as specified in the Constitution.
MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 19
33. Time and again, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the personal liberty, deprived when bail is
refused, is too precious a value of our constitutional system recognized under Article 21 that the
crucial power to negate it is a great trust exercisable, not casually but judicially, with lively concern
for the cost to the individual and community. To glamorize impressionistic orders as discretionary
may, on occasions, make a litigative gamble decisive of a fundamental right. After all, personal
liberty of an accused or convict is fundamental, suffering lawful eclipse only in terms of procedure
established by law. Thus personal liberty is not curbed except in accordance to the procedure
established by law in order to strike a balance between the right to individual liberty and the interest
of society.
34. In the Indian legal system, the procedure of bail is provided in the Criminal Procedure Code.
Bail has not been defined in the Code although the offences are classified as bailable and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6328118/ 8
Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
non-bailable. In the former class, the grant of bail is a matter of course. It may be given either by the
police-officer in charge of a Police Station having the accused in his custody or by the Court. The
release may be ordered on the accused executing a bond and even without sureties. In the latter
class, the accused may be MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of
2021 P a g e | 20 released on bail but no bail can be granted where the accused appears on
reasonable grounds to be guilty of an offence punishable either with death or with imprisonment for
life. As soon as reasonable grounds for the guilt cease to appear, the accused is entitled to be
released on bail or on his own recognizance; he can also be released, for similar reasons between the
close of the case and delivery of judgment. When a person is released on bail the order with reasons
therefore should be in writing.
35. There are case laws to the proposition that merely because the accused is a foreign national, he
cannot be deprived of the benefits of bail. Law does not permit any differentiation between Indian
Nationals and Foreign Nationals in the matter of granting bail. What is permissible is that,
considering the facts and circumstances of each case, the Court can impose different conditions
which are necessary to ensure that the accused will be available for facing the trial. It cannot be said
that an accused will not be granted bail because he is a Foreign National. Here, in the case on hand,
as stated supra, there is no case pending against the petitioner and in fact, in the offence alleged
against him under Section 14 of the Foreigner Act, he was discharged and the only case, the
petitioner is now facing is the Criminal Revision Petition, MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021
Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 21 which was filed by the respondent State against the
discharge order passed by the learned Special Judge in Special Trial Case No.12 of 2020, wherein
the petitioner had entered appearance through his counsel and the physical presence in that case is
not required.
36. In the case Mohammed Kunju and another v State of Karnataka, AIR 2000 SC 6, the accused
was a foreign national. When he was granted bail, he jumped it and slipped out of India. As a result,
legal action against his sureties for levy of the penalty under their forfeited bail bonds was initiated.
That action was challenged by the sureties before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. While dealing with
the legality or otherwise of the said legal proceeding against sureties, an observation was made by
Hon'ble Supreme Court that while granting bail to the accused foreign national, the Court could
have imposed condition to surrender his passport as a measure to prevent him to escape out of
India.
37. Ordinarily one cannot leave the country without the passport. Though the possibility of fleeing of
an accused from trial may be more in the case of foreign national, it cannot be said that the accused
cannot be granted bail merely because he is a foreign national. There is no law which authorizes or
permits discrimination between a foreign national and an Indian national in the matter of
MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 22 granting bail
what is permissible is that, considering the facts and circumstances of each case, the Court can
impose different conditions to ensure that the accused will be available for facing trial. Nothing
placed on record to show that criminal cases are pending against the petitioner.

38. It appears that pursuant to the order passed in the Criminal Revision Petition No.10 of 2021,
dated 17.4.2021, the petitioner is in judicial custody and the petitioner has also filed M.C.No.2 of
2021 to recall the said order by stating that there is no question of him leaving the country and
returning to his home country and also there is no possibility of the petitioner absconding and
interfering with the prosecution. Further, the Visa of the petitioner had expired and unless the same
is validated, there is no question of him leaving the country.
39. It would be disgrace if Courts are going to keep persons incarcerated merely because they are of
foreign origin even though prima facie no case is made out against them. This would be a negation
of valued principles of rule of law and vocative of the constitutional mandate and principles of
human rights. Because the petitioner being a foreign national, it does not mean that he is not
entitled the benefit of bail. Therefore, this Court is of MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:-
Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 23 the view that while granting bail to a foreign national
firmly believes in imposing certain conditions like surrender of passport, bail bonds, attendance
before the Consulate or the Investigating Officer, etc. in order to prevent misuse of the provision, as
there may be chances of the accused absconding after getting bail.
40. At this stage, learned Additional Advocate General argued that if the petitioner is enlarged on
bail, he will flee away to this country and therefore, he cannot be enlarged on bail.
41. The fact that the petitioner will abscond by itself cannot be a ground for detaining him in prison
indefinitely, as he is in custody for more than two and half years. The police had power to take
action against the absconding offenders also. There is no law which authorizes or permits
discrimination between a foreign national and Indian national in the matter of granting bail and as
stated supra, the Court can impose different conditions to ensure that the petitioner will be available
for facing trial.
42. It is reiterated that law does not authorise or permit any discrimination between a foreign
National and an Indian National in the matter of granting bail. What is permissible is that,
considering the facts and circumstances of each case, the Court can impose different conditions
which are necessary to ensure that MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No.
10 of 2021 P a g e | 24 the accused will be available for facing trial. It cannot be said that an accused
will not be granted bail because he is a foreign national.
43. It is also the submission of the learned Additional Advocate General that the prayer for bail was
already made by the petitioner in M.C.No.2 of 2021 by recalling the order dated 17.4.2021.
Therefore, the bail application being M.C.No.3 of 2021 is not maintainable. The aforesaid argument
cannot be countenanced for the reason that same prayer made twice will disentitle the petitioner for
bail. Taking into consideration the facts and the circumstances in which the petitioner is in custody
and also the health condition, this Court is of the view that the petitioner is entitled for bail in the
interest of justice.
44. In view of the findings arrived at by this Court that the petitioner is entitled for bail, the interim
order dated 17.4.2021 passed in the Criminal Revision Petition is recalled and accordingly, M.C.No.2

Kom 12:14:32 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 27 April, 2022
of 2021 is allowed.
45. Insofar as the M.C.No.7 of 2021 is concerned, taking note of the health condition of the
petitioner, the medical records of the petitioner as prayed in the petition is ordered to be called for
from Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa. Accordingly, M.C.No.7 of 2021 is allowed.
MC(Crl.Revn.P.) Nos. 2,3 and 7 of 2021 Ref:- Crl. Rev. Petn. No. 10 of 2021 P a g e | 25
46. Having regard to the entire facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find any justification for
detaining the petitioner in prison any longer. Therefore, the petitioner, who is in custody since
24.08.2019 should be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/-
(Rupees One Lakh) only with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned
Special Judge, (ND&PS), Imphal and subject to the conditions that (a) the petitioner is directed to
report before the Learned Special Judge, (ND&PS), Thoubal once in a week i.e. every Monday at 10
a.m. until further orders; (b) he shall surrender his passport, if not already seized; (c) he shall not
leave the country without permission of the learned Special Judge, (ND&PS), Imphal; (d) he shall
not involve in any act which will create a reasonable ground to assume that the petitioner is trying to
create hurdle which will entail cancellation of his bail.
