*****
COMMON ORDER
Criminal Original Petitions have been filed to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.336 of 2020,
pending on the file of the Judicial Magistrate Court No.I, Mannargudi/trial Court.
2.Since the issues in both Criminal Original Petitions are similar, this Court decides to dispose the
above petitions by way of common order. The petitioners are referred to as accused, as per their
rank, in charge sheet.
3.Gist of the case is that the native of A1 is Meelathiruppalakkudi Village, Mannargudi Taluk,
Thiruvarur District, who is presently working as Software Engineer in America. A1 got married the
2nd respondent on 18.10.2012 in Santhosh Marriage Hall at Mannargudi. A2, A3 & A4 are
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 the father-in-law,
mother-in-law and sister-in-law of the 2nd respondent respectively and A5 is the husband of A4.
After the marriage, A1 and the 2nd respondent started their matrimonial life in America. On
18.08.2015, they were blessed with a male child Guru, who was born in Texas, America, hence, their
son is an American citizen by birth. On 13.01.2018, A1, the 2nd respondent and their son Guru had
come to India and were residing with A2 to A5. From 13.01.2018 to 02.02.2018, all the accused and
the 2nd respondent were living together, at that time, the accused demanded delivery expenses
incurred for Guru from the parents of the 2nd respondent and also ten sovereigns of gold chain and
diamond ear stud. Earlier, on 14.01.2016, a general power of attorney was executed by the 2nd
respondent in favour of A4 for availing housing loan and also to purchase properties. Thereafter, the
accused insisted the 2nd respondent for executing yet another power of attorney, which was refused.
During the ear piercing ceremony of Guru, the demand for diamond stud and ten sovereigns of gold
chain were made by the accused, which was not agreeable and not complied with. Due to which, the
dispute arouse and thereby, the 2nd respondent was abused, harassed
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 and subjected to cruelty both
physically and mentally.
4.It is further alleged that the accused planned an illegal design and made the 2nd respondent and
Guru to stay in her parents house on the pretext that A1 would come and pick up on the date of
departure to USA. On the contrary, there was no communication from A1. Later, on 07.02.2018, the
2nd respondent came to know that her husband is not inclined to take her back to USA. When she
had gone to the house of the accused to enquire about the same, it was informed that A1 already left
India on 05.02.2018 leaving back the 2nd respondent and her son Guru. The other accused/A2 to
A5 abused and thrown her away from the house, since she cancelled the power of attorney executed
in favour of A4. The 2nd respondent was not in a position to reach America, as her husband had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54241648/ 2
Selvaraj vs The State Represented By on 22 December, 2021
taken her passport and travel documents with him. When the 2nd respondent contacted her
husband/A1, A1 reiterated that his family demand to be complied and thereafter he would consider
in sending her passport and travel documents.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
5.The 2nd respondent's son Guru is suffering from hearing problem and he was under speech
therapy treatment in USA. The particulars of the medical treatment were taken and retained by A1
and he refused to send it back. In the absence of medical documents of Guru, the treatment could
not be continued. Now, the 2nd respondent is not supported with any aid for herself as well as for
her son Guru. Further, the marriage gifts and valuables were also retained by the accused and they
refused to handover her valuables and belongings. Unable to tolerate any further, the 2nd
respondent lodged a complaint to the 1st respondent Police and a case was registered in Crime No.2
of 2020, for offence, under Sections 498(A), 352, 379, 143, 120(b), 406, 149 & 109 of IPC, Section 4
of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, 2002 and Section 75 of the Juvenile
Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. After completion of investigation, charge sheet
has been filed before the trial Court and the same was taken on file as C.C.No.336 of 2020, against
which the present Criminal Original Petitions.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
6.The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner/A1 in Crl.O.P.No.7575 of 2021 submitted
that A1 and the 2nd respondent were residing in America after their marriage. On 13.01.2018, A1,
the 2nd respondent and their son Guru had come to India for ear piercing ceremony and they were
residing with A2 to A5 till 02.02.2018. On 02.02.2018, the 2nd respondent had gone to her parents
house and she failed to join her husband/A1, despite knowing the date (05.02.2018) of departure to
USA as planned. The 2nd respondent requested her husband/A1 that she would stay with her
parents for some more time, hence, her travel plan was deferred and rescheduled to 04.07.2018.
Admittedly, in this case, after the marriage in the year 2012, A1 and the 2nd respondent were
staying in America. Only during the year 2018, for ear piercing ceremony, they had come to India.
During their stay in America, there was no dispute between A1 and the 2nd respondent and they
were living happily and blessed with a male child Guru, who was born in the year 2015. Guru is
suffering from hearing and speech problem, for which he was given some medical treatment in
America. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
7.The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the 2nd respondent made allegations only after
she came to India. Since the 2 nd respondent was not interested to return back to America, she
created a false story as though the family members of A1, insisted her for delivery expenses,
expenses for ear piercing ceremony and forced her to execute a power of attorney in favour of A4.
Thus, the allegations are made with ulterior motive to stay with her parents and not to return back
to USA. The allegations are made not only against her husband/A1, but also against A1's aged
parents, sister and brother-in-law, who did nothing against the 2nd respondent. He further
submitted that only on the request of the 2nd respondent, A1 rescheduled the date of her travel to
USA. The return date of travel was very much known to the 2nd respondent. It is to be noted that at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54241648/ 3
Selvaraj vs The State Represented By on 22 December, 2021
the time of leaving America, the return ticket was booked. While this being so, now making
allegations as though without informing the 2nd respondent, A1 left India is far from truth. The
allegation that A1 had taken away the passport and travel documents of the 2nd respondent and
medical records of her son Guru, are also false. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677
& 7575 of 2021
8.The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the 1st respondent Police failed to conduct any
preliminary enquiry in a matrimonial dispute and failed to seek explanation from the accused and
mechanically registered FIR against all the accused. According to the 2nd respondent, the dispute
started during the month of January 2018 and the complaint in this case came to be given only on
22.02.2020 with delay of two years. The 1st respondent Police without finding the reason for delay,
registered the FIR on 27.02.2020 within five days of lodging the complaint. The general power of
attorney executed was of the year 2016. Since the 2nd respondent was adamant to stay back in India
for continuing her son Guru's speech therapy treatment, her return ticket was rescheduled. Hence,
he prayed for quashing of the proceedings against A1.
9.The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners/A2 to A5 in Crl.O.P.No.4677 of
2021 submitted that admittedly, the 2nd respondent and A1 were living in America from the year
2012 to 2018. During the year 2015, a male child Guru was born in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 America. A2 to A5 had no reason to make any demand from the
2nd respondent, more so insisting her to incur the delivery expenses. The delivery of baby took place
in America in the year 2015. He further submitted that the 2nd respondent had come to India for ear
piercing ceremony of Guru, which was decided much earlier when she and A1 were in America. The
ear piercing ceremony was held on 19.01.2018 at Melathirupalakudi Arulmighu Mathuraveeran
Temple. The demand of diamond stud and gold chain by A4 is unreasonable. In fact the diamond
stud was purchased by A4 on her own money during the year 2013 in Lalitha Jeweleries Mart. While
being so, there is no reason for A4 to demand diamond ear stud. The power of attorney was executed
by the 2nd respondent in favour of A4 on 14.01.2016 for availing housing loan in ICICI Home
Finance Company Limited. On 04.01.2019, a notice was sent to A4 for cancellation of power of
attorney. In the cancellation notice, dated 04.01.2019, the 2nd respondent only made bald
allegations that A4 could have created encumbrance by using the power of attorney and nothing
more.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
10.The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the 1st respondent Police not considered any
of these facts and for the reasons best known, registered the FIR, completed the investigation and
filed the charge sheet against the accused. Earlier, listing seven witnesses as LW1 to LW7, charge
sheet was made ready by the 1st respondent Police. Thereafter, some more witnesses were
examined, Sections were altered, which is not proper. In this case, A2 is a retired Police official, who
is known for his integrity and honesty. A5 is a Bench Clerk in District Court, Thiruvarur. A4 is a
Teacher working in a school at Mannargudi. A4 and A5 are living separately 15 kilometers away
from the A1's house. At no point of time, they lived as joint family along with A1 and the 2nd
respondent. He further submitted that to brook vengeance and on ulterior motive, the complaint
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54241648/ 4
Selvaraj vs The State Represented By on 22 December, 2021
was made against A2 to A5, who are in-laws of the 2nd respondent. The reschedule of flight ticket of
2nd respondent and Guru is not known to A2 to A5. This decision was taken by A1 and the 2nd
respondent mutually for the purpose of their son's speech therapy treatment. Further, the 2nd
respondent expressed her inclination to stay with her parents for some more time. The power of
attorney was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 unilaterally
cancelled by the 2nd respondent though it was executed by the 2nd respondent and A1. The
cancellation of power of attorney is not mentioned in the complaint and that has been completely
suppressed by the 2nd respondent.
11.The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that there might be some misunderstanding
between A1 and the 2nd respondent, which is common in matrimonial relationship. As regards, A2
to A5, there is no iota of material to show that with common intention, they abetted A1 in any
manner to harass the 2nd respondent. Since they happened to be father, mother, sister and
brother-in-law of A1, they are falsely implicated in this case to spite vengeance. In a matrimonial
case, there would be exaggeration and vilification, which has to be analyzed in a fair manner. Only if
there is any material, the in-laws can be arrayed as accused, which is the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex
Court as well as this Court. The 1st respondent Police for the reason best known, not conducted any
preliminary enquiry in this case, more particularly against A2 to A5. No enquiry was conducted to
ascertain whether there was retention and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 &
7575 of 2021 detention of passport and travel documents of the 2nd respondent and medical records
of Guru. A1 is very certain that he is not in possession of the same and filed affidavit, dated
28.11.2021 before this Court duly notarized in America. Hence, he prayed for quashing of the
proceedings against A2 to A5.
12.The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner filed typed set containing the copy of general power
of attorney, flight tickets, diamond stud bill of A4, cancellation notice, dated 04.01.2019, invitation
for ear piercing ceremony and other documents.
13.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent filed counter and
submitted that on the complaint of the 2nd respondent, a case in Crime No.2 of 2020 was registered
against the accused, for offence under Sections 498(A), 352, 379 of IPC and Section 4 of the Tamil
Nadu Prohibition of Women Harassment Act. The prosecution case is that on 22.02.2020 at about
05.00 p.m, the 2nd respondent lodged a complaint before the 1st respondent Police narrating
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 the events and details of cruelty
suffered by her, details of the medical treatment of the child Guru, they coming to India on
13.01.2018, demand of dowry made by the accused and forcing the 2 nd respondent to execute a
fresh power of attorney in favour of A4 including some more clauses. The 2nd respondent averred in
the complaint that in an illegal design, she was made to stay with her parents from 02.02.2018.
Within three days, without informing her, A1 left to USA taking away the passport and travel
documents of the 2nd respondent and medical records of Guru. During the matrimonial life in
America, A1 was constantly ill-treated and abused the 2nd respondent. When the 2nd respondent
approached A2 to A5 on 07.02.2018 seeking answer for A1 deserting her and her son, A2 to A5
abused, assaulted and chased her away.

Selvaraj vs The State Represented By on 22 December, 2021
14.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor further submitted that the demand of dowry made by
the accused and subjecting the 2nd respondent to cruelty both mental and physical are clearly
mentioned in the complaint and the same were also confirmed by the witnesses in their statement
recorded during investigation. The Doctor, who gave https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 treatment to Guru confirms about the non-availability of the past
medical records. He further submitted that email communications and whatsapp messages collected
clearly confirms the demand of dowry as well as the retention and detention of passport and travel
documents of the 2nd respondent and medical records of Guru. In this case, during investigation 14
witnesses were examined as LW1 to LW14. The statement of witnesses confirms the offence
committed by the accused. On completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed by the 1 st
respondent Police before the trial Court. The trial Court on perusal of charge sheet, found prima
facie material against the accused, took the case on file as C.C.No.336 of 2020 and issued summons
for appearance of accused. A1 fled the country and now, he is absconding. On receipt of summons,
the accused approached this Court and obtained stay of proceedings in C.C.No.336 of 2020. Due to
which, the trial could not be progressed. The points raised by the learned Senior Counsel for
petitioner are matter for trial, which are to be decided during trial and not in a Quash Petition.
Hence, he prayed for dismissal of petitions with a direction to complete the trial within a stipulated
time. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
15.The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent filed counter in both petitions along with typed set.
He submitted that in this case, A1 is working in Bloomington, Minnesota, USA, who came to India,
married the 2nd respondent on 18.10.2012 at Mannargudi. After the marriage, the 2nd respondent
and her husband/A1 were living in San Antonio, Texas, USA. Out of their wedlock, a male baby Guru
was born to them on 18.08.2015 in Methodist Stone Oak Hospital, San Antonio, Texas, USA. The
delivery expenses for the child was covered by USA insurance company. On 13.01.2018, the 2nd
respondent, A1 and their son Guru came to India by Emirates Flight and landed in Chennai. On
19.01.2018, ear piercing ceremony was conducted for Guru. At that time, all the accused demanded
gold and diamond ornaments. They forced the 2nd respondent to execute a fresh general power of
attorney in favour of A4. Further, the delivery expenses were also demanded. Since the 2 nd
respondent has not complied the demand of the accused, she and her son were sent back to her
parents house on 02.02.2018. Without informing the 2nd respondent, on 05.02.2018, A1 left India
and went to USA taking away the passport and travel documents of the 2nd respondent and
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 medical records of Guru. Only
on 07.02.2018, the 2nd respondent came to know that A1 left India. When the same was questioned
with A2 to A5, she was abused, assaulted, threatened and was chased away. Despite sincere steps
being taken, the accused was not inclined to take back the 2nd respondent and not facilitated her to
return to USA and not handed back the passport, travel documents and medical records of Guru. All
efforts went in vain. When the 2nd respondent contacted her husband/A1 by email and whatsapp,
A1 admitted the retention of passport and travel documents and medical records of Guru and
informed that he will not send the same to her and she has to lead her life till her last breath in her
native along with her parents. Further, A1 blocked her number and he became unaccessible.
16.The learned counsel further submitted that the 2nd respondent continued treatment for her son
Guru in Krishna Child Care Centre, Thanjavur, where Dr.Venkateshwaran gave treatment to her son
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54241648/ 6
Selvaraj vs The State Represented By on 22 December, 2021
and thereafter, referred her son to Dr.Lakshmi Narayanan, Senior Consultant for better treatment.
The medical reports of Guru for speech therapy https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 treatment in USA were retained and detained by A1. Without
passport, the 2nd respondent's son Guru, a USA citizen, is residing overstay in India. Further, the
2nd respondent approached the authorities such as Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi; Joint
Secretary, National Commission for Women; Consulate General of India. All went in vain. Till date,
the 2nd respondent is unable to get her passport and travel documents and and medical records of
Guru. Due to the act of A1, the child Guru is denied of his rightful treatment. The 2nd respondent
sent a representation to the Superintendent of Police, Thiruvarur and to the District Collector,
Thiruvarur to get back the passport and medical records of Guru.
17.It is further submitted that A2 to A5 has not taken any steps to resolve the dispute and get back
the passport and travel documents of 2nd respondent and medical records of Guru. On the other
hand, they abetted A1 to continue his illegal act. A2 is a retired Police Official, who got influence
with the Police in Thiruvarur District. A5 is a Bench Clerk in District Court, Thiruvarur and an office
bearer of the Association. A5 by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
using his position, ensures the delay in progress of the trial and put the case on cold storage.
Initially, the accused thwarted the progress of the investigation and now, they are attempting to
delay the progress of the trial by all means. It is to be seen that in this case, despite specific
complaint against the accused about the retention and detention of the passport and travel
documents and medical records of Guru, the 1st respondent Police failed to take any effective step.
On the other hand, allowed A2 to A5 to get anticipatory bail during investigation. He further
submitted that A1 is now in America and he is not appearing before the trial Court. Though the 1st
respondent Police is aware about A1's address in America, no steps has been taken to send summons
to him in his USA address through Indian Embassy officials. It would be appropriate to get warrant
against the absconding accused and take steps to get issuance of Look Out Circular. The case is kept
pending for the reason that if the summon could not be served on A1, the case would split up and
thereafter, ti would be easy for other accused to get away from the case by shifting the entire blame
on the absconding accused and to obtain favourable orders. Later using that favourable order, A1
will https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 escape from this case. This
illegal design is well orchestrated and implemented with the aid of A5, who is a Court staff.
18.The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent prayed this Court to transfer the case to some other
Court and further sought direction for securing the presence of the accused by taking coercive steps
and for completing the trial proceedings within a stipulated time.
19.In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent relied on the decision of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of “Taramani Prakash Versus State of Madhya Pradesh and
others reported in (2015) 11 SCC 260”, wherein it had held that the question whether the victim was
harassed and treated with cruelty is a matter for trial. The above decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court
consistently followed in the cases of “R.Sivagnanam and others Versus State represented by
Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Velore, Namakkal and another in Crl.O.P.No.26902
of 2012; Ayyavu and others Versus State rep., by All Women Police Station, Erode and
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 another in Crl.O.P.No.3247 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54241648/ 7
Selvaraj vs The State Represented By on 22 December, 2021
2013 and in the case of Hajera Hajira Fatima Versus State of Telungana reported in
MANU/TL/0108/2021.”
20.This Court considered the rival submissions and perused the materials available on record.
21.It is seen that the marriage between A1 and the 2nd respondent had taken place on 18.10.2012.
Out of marriage, they have a male child Guru, who born on 18.08.2015. On 13.01.2018, A1, 2nd
respondent and their Child Guru returned to India for ear piercing ceremony. At that time, the
demand for dowry for diamond stud, gold chain and delivery expense were made by the accused.
Earlier, a general power of attorney was executed by the 2nd respondent on 14.01.2016 in favour of
A4 for availing housing in ICICI Home Finance Company Limited. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent
was harassed to execute yet another power of attorney including some more clauses, which was not
agreeable to the 2nd respondent.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
22.It is not in dispute that the minor Guru is suffering from speech problem and he is required to
undergo continuous speech therapy treatment. The previous medical records of Guru is very much
needed for continuing further speech therapy treatment, which is now denied at the instance of A1.
The email and whatsapp communication between A1 and the 2nd respondent clearly confirms that
the passport and travel documents of the 2nd respondent and medical records of Guru are in the
custody of A1. Now, the 2nd respondent is running from pillar to post to secure her passport and
travel documents and medical records of Guru. Despite sending communications to Ministry of
External Affairs, New Delhi; Joint Secretary, National Commission for Women; Consulate General
of India from the year 2018, till date she is yet to get back her travel documents and medical records
of her son Guru. It is a well known fact that no person has got authority to retain and detain the
passport, travel and medical documents of others. More so, in this case, the minor Guru is a patient,
who is with speech problem, which cannot be brushed aside. A2 is a retired Police official and A5 is a
Court staff, which also cannot be loose sight of.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021
23.The Email communications and whatsapp messages sent by A1 to the 2nd respondent is contrary
to the affidavit of A1 produced before this Court. The affidavit, dated 28.11.2021 of A1 is extracted
hereunder:-
“I, S.Vinoth, S/o, Selvaraj, aged about 41 years, Residing at No.18211, Bulverde RD,
APT 4208, San Antonio, TX, 78259, United States of America, do hereby solemnly
affirm and sincerely state as follows;
1. I am the Petitioner herein and I have been arraigned as the 1" accused in C.C.No.
336 of 2020, on the file of Judicial Magistrate, Mannargudi, Thiruvarur and as such I
am well acquainted with the facts of the case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54241648/ 8
Selvaraj vs The State Represented By on 22 December, 2021
2. I state that myself and the 2nd Respondent came down to Mannargudi on
13.01.2018 from the United States of America with our return tickets originally
booked for 05.02.2018. We came to Mannargudi for our son's head tonsuring
function which was scheduled to be held on 19 January, 2018. After the function, the
2 Respondent insisted that she will stay back in Mannargudi for my son's speech
therapy treatment. Obliging her decision, the requisition for rescheduling the tickets
to July 2018 was sent on 01.02.2018 itself, that is when the 2nd respondent was in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 my house. I had
rescheduled the flight tickets of the 2nd Respondent and our son to 4th July, 2018.
She went to her parents' house on 02.02.2018 with all her belongings.
3. As planned earlier I had left India on 05.02.2018 as per my original return tickets.
I state that at no point of time, I was in possession of the passport of the 2nd
Respondent and the Child. The Passport of my son and the 2nd Respondent is very
much available with the 2nd Respondent.
4. I state that the 2 Respondent waited for two years i.e from 05.02.2018 to
20.01.2020 and then lodged the false complaint which is under challenge. 5. I state
that the 2nd Respondent had falsely implicated my parents, sister and her husband in
order to threaten us. In and by this affidavit, I swear that the passport of the 2nd
Respondent and my son and the medical records of my son are not with me and are
only with my wife, the 2 Respondent.
Hence it is therefore prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to allow the above CRLOP field
to quash the charge sheet in C.C.No.336 of 2020, pending on the file
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis CRL.O.P.Nos.4677 & 7575 of 2021 of Judicial Magistrate No.1,
Mannargudi, Thiruvarur and pass appropriate orders as this Hon'ble Court deems fit and thus
render justice.”
24.From the affidavit of A1, it is seen that A1 totally denies the possession of passport and travel
documents of the 2 nd respondent and also his son's medical records. The affidavit is contra to the
email and whatsapp messages sent by A1 to the 2nd respondent. This is a serious matter to be
looked into. Thus, the question whether the 2nd respondent was harassed and treated with cruelty
by the accused is a matter for trial. At this stage, quashing of proceedings against the accused does
not arise. Therefore, the points raised by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the accused are
necessarily to be decided during the trial.
25.In the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Taramani Parakh (cited
supra), and considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is not inclined to quash
the proceedings against the accused. Accordingly, both Criminal Original Petitions are dismissed.

secure A1. Hence, the trial Court is directed to take coercive steps to secure the absconding accused
