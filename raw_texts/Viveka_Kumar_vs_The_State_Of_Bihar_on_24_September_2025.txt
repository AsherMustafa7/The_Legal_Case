Viveka Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 24 September, 2025
Headquarter, Water Resources Department, Govt. of Bihar, Patna, whereby and
where-under petitioner's registration of contract license/Registration No. 17/2020
(First class) has illegally been black listed for ten years.
ii) For issuance of appropriate writ, order or direction specially in the nature of
Mandamus, commanding the Respondent authorities to return the earnest money
deposited by the petitioner for performance of contract work.
iii) Any other relief or reliefs to which the petitioner may be found entitled in the
facts and circumstances of this case."
3. Perusal of the blacklisting order, it is crystal clear that it is not a speaking or reasoned order so as
to affirm. Respondents are exercising quasi judicial function insofar as blacklisting Contractors. In
such an event, they are bound to follow the certain principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in paragraph-40 in the case of ORYX Fisheries Private Limited Versus Union of India and
Others, reported in (2010) 13 Supreme Court Cases 427. Paragraph-40 reads as under:
"40. In Kranti Associates [(2010) 9 SCC 496 :
(2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 852] this Court after considering various judgments formulated
certain principles in Patna High Court CWJC No.15849 of 2025 dt.24-09-2025 SCC
para 47 of the judgment which are set out below : (SCC pp. 510-12) "(a) In India the
judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in administrative decisions, if
such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
(b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions.
(c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of justice
that justice must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.
(d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible arbitrary
exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.
(e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision-maker on
relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous considerations.
(f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a
decision-making process as observing principles of natural justice by judicial,
quasi-judicial and even by administrative bodies.
(g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior courts.

(h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and constitutional
governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts. This is virtually the lifeblood
of judicial decision-making justifying the principle that reason is the soul of justice.
(i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as different as the judges and
authorities who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common purpose which is to
demonstrate by reason that the relevant factors have been objectively considered. This is important
for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice delivery system.
(j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and transparency.
(k) If a judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about his/her decision-making
process then it is impossible to know whether the person deciding is faithful to the doctrine of
precedent or to principles of incrementalism.
(l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct. A pretence of reasons or
'rubber- stamp reasons' is not to be equated with a valid decision-making process.
(m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial
powers. Transparency in decision-making not only makes the Patna High Court CWJC No.15849 of
2025 dt.24-09-2025 judges and decision-makers less prone to errors but also makes them subject to
broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor(1987) 100 Harv. L. Rev. 731-37.)
(n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the broad doctrine of fairness in
decision- making, the said requirement is now virtually a component of human rights and was
considered part of Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See Ruiz Torija v. Spain [(1994) 19 EHRR 553] ,
EHRR at p. 562, para 29 and Anya v. University of Oxford [2001 EWCA Civ 405 : 2001 ICR 847
(CA)] , wherein the Court referred to Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights which
requires, 'adequate and intelligent reasons must be given for judicial decisions'.
(o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting up precedents for the
future. Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the
essence and is virtually a part of 'due process'."
In the light of the aforementioned principles, the respondents have not adhered to the principles
while ordering blacklisting. Accordingly, the petitioner has made out a case so as to interfere with
the blacklisting order dated 21.10.2021 (Annexure-P/11 to the writ petition), it is set aside.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15849 of 2025 dt.24-09-2025
4. The matter is remanded to the concerned authority to pass a fresh order, after providing
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and to proceed to pass a reasoned and speaking order.
