Vs.

B E F O R E
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AHANTHEM BIMOL SINGH 28-03-2023 Heard Mr. M. Rakesh, learned
counsel appearing for the applicant, Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. N.
Zequeson, learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 and Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior
counsel assisted by Syed Murtaza Ahmed, learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 4. None
appeared for the other respondents.
The present application had been filed praying for granting leave to the applicant to file his written
objection to the misc. application being MC(El. Petn.) No. 73 of 2022 filed by the respondent No.1
raising preliminary objection to the maintainability of the election petition filed by the applicant.
It has been submitted by Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent No.
1/ contesting respondent that the applicant had filed the said written objection beyond 90 days and
no sufficient reason had been given by the applicant explaining the delay in filing the said written
objection. The learned senior counsel further submitted that since no sufficient reason had been
given explaining the delay in filing the said written objection, the present application is liable to be
rejected.
Mr. M. Rakesh, learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the delay in filing the
said written objection was caused due to time taken in making inquiries, consultations, preparations
and other clerical tasks and also in verification and obtaining various documents from the
concerned authorities/Department and that by allowing the present application and permitting the
applicant to file his written objection will not cause any prejudice to any of the parties including the
contesting respondent No. 1 and that if the prayer of the applicant is not allowed and if he is not
allowed to file his written objection to the misc. application raising maintainability of the election
petition, a grave loss and injury will be caused to the present applicant. The learned senior counsel
further submitted that the present applicant has no intention to delay any of the proceedings and
that since he is the petitioner himself challenging the election of the respondent No. 1, he has no
reason for delaying any of the proceedings in connection with the said election petition. The learned

counsel further submitted that the applicant is willing and ready to pay cost to compensate any
difficulty caused to the respondent No. 1.
After hearing the submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties and after
careful perusal of the record, this Court find sufficient reason for condoning the delay in filing the
aforesaid written objection filed by the applicant in connection with MC(El.Petn.) No. 73 of 2022.
This court is also of the considered view that if the present application is not allowed, a grave injury
and irreparable loss will be caused to the present applicant. However, since some inconvenience had
been caused to the respondent No. 1 by filing of the present application, it will be appropriate to
allow the present application subject to payment of cost of Rs. 15,000/- (rupees fifteen thousand) to
be paid by the applicant to the counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 within a period of two
weeks from today.
With the aforesaid directions, the present application is allowed.
Registry is directed to place on record the written objection filed by the applicant in the connected
misc. application.
The present application stands disposed of.
