ORDER
(09.05.2019) Per: Sujoy Paul, J.
Regard being had to the similitude of the questions involved, on the joint request of the parties, the
matters are analogously heard on admission and decided by this common order. The writ appeals
are arising out of orders passed by learned Single Judge affirming the reference order passed by
State Government in exercise of power under Section 17(2) of the Working Journalists and Other
Newspaper Employees (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1955 (Act of 1955),
whereas writ petitions are filed questioning the reference order passed in exercise of said power.
(2) Draped in brevity, the newspaper employees filed application claiming the benefit of Majithia
Wage Board (Board) before the Deputy Labour Commissioner. The employer was put to notice. The
claim of employee was resisted on various grounds. The Deputy Labour Commissioner apprised the
State Government about the dispute and in turn the Government sent the reference for adjudication
before the labour Court.
(3) Shri Sanjay Kaushal, learned senior counsel assisted by Shri Uttam Maheshwari, Advocate
appearing in WA-1101-2018 for the employer urged that the learned Single Judge has erred in
affirming the reference order of the Government. He urged that validity of Clause 20(j) of the award
of the Board was upheld by the Supreme Court. As per the award, it is open to the employee to
continue with existing pay and forego the higher wages flowing from the Board. The employee, in
the instant case, had foregone the higher benefits by exercising an option. Hence, there existed no
dispute which requires any adjudication. The Deputy Labour Commissioner and appropriate
Government treated the story narrated by employee as gospel truth and presupposed that he is
entitled for an amount based on the Board award.
(4) Learned senior counsel submits that: (i) Section 17 (1) & (2) are almost pari materia to Sections
33 (C)(1) and 33(C)(2) of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (ID Act). The provisions are in the nature of
execution proceedings. Thus, in absence of prior determination and adjudication of claim of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199674873/ 8
Nai Dunia A Unit Of Jagran Publications ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 9 May, 2019
employee, power under Section 17(2) cannot be invoked. Reliance is placed on AIR 1958 SC 507,
[M/s. Kasturi and Sons (Private) Ltd. vs. Shri N. Salivateeswaran & anr.] & 1993(1) LLN 373,
[Keshvlal M. Rao vs. State of Gujarat & ors.]; (ii) in absence of quantification and decision on the
entitlement of employee, reference is bad in law; (iii) learned Single Judge erred in holding that
employer can raise objection before the Labour Court regarding validity of the reference. The labour
Court itself assumes jurisdiction on the basis of reference and therefore labour Court cannot decide
the validity of reference. Moreso, when question of competence of Government/authority in making
the reference is involved. The question of competence of authority/Government to refer the matter
to labour Court cannot be treated to be an ancillary question. To elaborate, it is contended that apart
from point (i) above as per Section 10(1)(c) of ID Act, such disputes can be referred for adjudication
to labour Court which relates to any matter specified in the Second Schedule. Clause (d) of this
provision enables the Tribunal to adjudicate the disputes which are related with Second & Third
Schedules. By taking this Court to the Second & Third Schedules of the ID Act, Shri Kaushal, learned
senior counsel urged that demand of wages is not covered under Second Schedule. Indeed, it is part
of the Third Schedule. Hence, the reference to a labour Court in place of to a Tribunal is clearly bad
in law.
(5) Shri Mohd. Ali, Advocate appearing in WP-16588-2018 submitted that in the application for
demand of wages submitted by the applicant there is no averment that he is an employee of the
petitioner/employer. In the response filed by the petitioner before the Deputy Labour
Commissioner, the employer made it clear that he is employee of a difference agency. Hence,
question of granting him wages as per Board does not arise. Unless employee-employer relation is
established, reference is impressible.
(6) Shri Sankalp Kochar, Advocate appearing for the employer relied on the judgment of High Court
of Punjab and Haryana passed in CWP No.16275/2018 decided on 25.03.2019, (Jagran Parkashan
Limited vs. State of Punjab and others).
(7) Per-contra, Shri Praveen Dubey, learned Deputy AG supported the reference and the orders
passed by learned Single Judges. He submitted that (reference orders are in consonance with
Section 17(2) of the Act of 1955. The labour Court will determine whether any amount is due in
favour of the news- paper employees. Employer will get full opportunity to putforth its case before
the Court. After determination as to the amount due only, the amount can be recovered as per
Sub-section (3) r/w (1) of Section 17 of the Act of 1955.
(8) Shri Navnidhi Parharya, Advocate appearing for the employee in WP- 18085-2018 also
supported the reference and almost borrowed the arguments of learned Deputy AG. In addition, she
placed reliance on the judgment of Supreme Court which is at Page No.87 of the petition. Similarly,
Shri Ashok Shrivastava and Shri Ketan Vishwnar supported the impugned reference/order of Single
Judge. Shri Vishnar placed reliance on condition of license (Annexure-P/5) filed with
WP-18091-2018 and stated that as per the terms and conditions of license, the principal employer is
under an obligation to pay the wages as per the Board. He relied on judgment of Supreme Court in
Civil Apeal No. 678 of 2006, (BCPP Mazdoor Sangh & anr. vs. NTPC & ors.).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199674873/ 9
Nai Dunia A Unit Of Jagran Publications ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 9 May, 2019
(9) The parties confined their arguments to the extent indicated above. The legal authorities cited by
them are already referred hereinabove.
(10) We have heard the learned counsel for the parties to a great length and perused the relevant
record.
(11) In the case of M/s. Kasturi (supra) the Apex Court considered the unamended provision of
Section 17 of the Act of 1955. In the unamended Section 17, there was no provision for making
reference to the labour Court for adjudication of the dispute. In this backdrop, in M/s. Kasturi
(supra) certain findings were given, on which heavy reliance is placed by learned senior counsel.
After the amendment in Section 17 aforesaid, the matter again travelled to Supreme Court in 1987
(3) SCC 507, [Samarjit Ghosh vs. M/s. Bennett Coleman & Company & anr.]. The Apex Court
expressed its view as under:
"6. When all the provisions of Section 17 are considered together it is apparent that
they constitute a single scheme. In simple terms the scheme is this. A newspaper
employee, who claims that an amount due to him has not been paid by his employer,
can apply to the State Government for recovery of the amount. If no dispute arises as
to the amount due the Collector will recover the amount from the employer and pay it
over to the newspaper employee. If a question arises as to the amount due, it is a
question which arises on the application made by the newspaper employee, and the
application having been made before the appropriate State Government it is that
State Government which will call for an adjudication of the dispute by referring the
question to a Labour Court. When the Labour Court has decided the question, it will
forward its decision to the State Government which made the reference, and
thereafter the State Government will direct that recovery proceedings shall be taken.
In other words the State Government before whom the application for recovery is
made is the State Government which will refer the question as to the amount due to a
Labour Court, and the Labour Court upon reaching its decision will forward the
decision to the State Government, which will then direct recovery of the amount."
[Emphasis Supplied] A plain reading of this para makes it clear like noon day that Section 17 is a
Code in itself. If upon considering the claim application of the employee and its response by the
employer, the question arises regarding the amount due the State Government can call for an
adjudication of the dispute by referring the question to a labour Court.
(12) Before a Division Bench of this Court in MP-311-1980, [M/s. Nav Bharat Press vs. State of M.P.]
decided on 28.07.1980 a question cropped up relating to interpretation of Wage Board
recommendations and Section 17(2) aforesaid. The Division Bench opined as under:
"From the facts stated above, it is clear that a dispute did arise within the meaning of
Section 17(2) of the Act relating to the interpretation of the Wage Board
Recommendations in the context of dearness allowance payable to the employees.
The dispute cannot be decided without properly interpreting the Wage Board Report
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199674873/ 10
Nai Dunia A Unit Of Jagran Publications ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 9 May, 2019
in the light of the Census Report of 1971. Such a matter could not have been
determined by the Labour Commissioner under Section 17(1). In our opinion, the
State Government was bound to make a reference under Section 17(2)."
[Emphasis Supplied] (13) In 1980 Lab IC 684, [M/s. Newspapers and Perodical, Banglore vs. State
of Karnatak] their Lordships opined as under:
"The above observations of the Supreme Court apply equally even while construing
the ambit and scope of Section 17 as it stands now (after its substitution by Central
Act No. 65 of 1962). The position has not changed except for the fact that under
sub-section (2), as it stands now, the State Government has been conferred with
powers to refer the question, the question being as to what amount, if any, is due to a
working journalist from his employer, to an appropriate Labour Court for
adjudication. The amount due under the Act means wages, which the newspaper
employee claims he is entitled to get from his employer,-as fixed by the Wage Board
constituted under the Act to that category of employees to which he claims that he
belongs. As observed by the Supreme Court in Kasturi & Sons [AIR 1958 SC 507.]
case that it is only if and after the amount due to the employee has been duly
determined that the stage is reached to recover that amount invoking Section 17."
[Emphasis Supplied] The Karnataka High Court considered the change in Section 17 of the Act [after
pronouncement of judgment in the case of M/s. Kasturi (supra)] and clearly held that State
Government has now been conferred with the power to refer the question as to what amount is due
to an employee from his employer.
This adjudication needs to be done by labour Court.
(14) Justice Dipak Mishra (as his Lordship then was) speaking for this Court in 2000 (3) MPHT
240, [Nav Bharat Press (Pvt. Ltd.) vs. State of M.P.] considered the legislative changes in Section 17
right from the era of M/s. Kasturi (supra) to the present day. The Court also considered the
aforesaid judgment of Karnataka High Court and Division Bench judgment of this Court. After
taking stock of said judgments, this Court opined as under:
"On a reading of the amended provisions and keeping in view the decisions governing
the field, it is graphically clear that a dispute arising with regard to amount due under
the Act has to be referred to the appropriate Labour Court constituted under the
industrial Disputes Act, 1947. When the due is disputed on one ground or other the
authority cannot adjudicate that lis and determine the rights. In the case at hand on a
perusal of Annex. D, it is absolutely dear that the claim of the petitioner was resisted
on the ground that he was never an employee of the petitioner. This stand has also
been taken note of by the Dy. Labour Commissioner but he proceeded to adjudicate
the matter. In the opinion of this Court when a dispute of this nature was raised
before the Dy. Labour Commissioner he could not have adjudicated the controversy
under Section 17(1) of the Act and the matter could have been referred for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199674873/ 11
Nai Dunia A Unit Of Jagran Publications ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 9 May, 2019
adjudication under Section 17(2) of the Act.
In view of the aforesaid analysis, the order passed vide Annex. I is untenable and is
liable to be quashed and accordingly, I do so. However, it is directed that the State
Government shall make a reference of the dispute to the competent Labour Court
constituted under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 within a period of 2 months from
receipt of this order."
[Emphasis Supplied] A plain glance of this judgment shows that when employee and employer were
at loggerheads on the question of "amount due", this Court opined that Deputy Labour
Commissioner erred in passing the impugned order and the State Government shall make a
reference to the labour Court. The ratio decidendi flowing from this judgment is that when there
exists a dispute about "amount due" or about existence of employee-employer relationship, matter
needs to be referred by the State Government to appropriate labour Court. In 2017 (8) SCC 435,
[Avishek Raja v. Sanjay Gupta] the Supreme Court poignantly held as under:
"26. Insofar as the highly contentious issue of Clause 20(j) of the Award read with the
provisions of the Act is concerned, it is clear that what the Act guarantees to each
"newspaper employee" as defined in Section 2(c) of the Act is the entitlement to
receive wages as recommended by the Wage Board and approved and notified by the
Central Government under Section 12 of the Act. The wages notified supersedes all
existing contracts governing wages as may be in force. However, the legislature has
made it clear by incorporating the provisions of Section 16 that, notwithstanding the
wages as may be fixed and notified, it will always be open to the employee concerned
to agree to and accept any benefits which is more favourable to him than what has
been notified under Section 12 of the Act. Clause 20(j) of the Majithia Wage Board
Award will, therefore, have to be read and understood in the above light. The Act is
silent on the availability of an option to receive less than what is due to an employee
under the Act. Such an option really lies in the domain of the doctrine of waiver, an
issue that does not arise in the present case in view of the specific stand of the
employees concerned in the present case with regard to the involuntary nature of the
undertakings allegedly furnished by them. The dispute that arises, therefore, has to
be resolved by the fact- finding authority under Section 17 of the Act, as adverted to
hereinafter.
28. There is nothing either in the provisions of the Act or in the terms of the Wage
Board Award which would enable us to hold that the benefits of the Award would be
restricted to the regular employees and not contractual employees. In this regard, we
have taken note of the definition of "newspaper employees", "working journalist" and
"non-journalist newspaper employees"
as defined in Sections 2(c), 2(f) and 2(dd) of the Act. Insofar as "variable pay" is concerned, as
already noticed and extracted in para 10 above, this Court while dealing with the concept of variable
pay has taken the view that the said relief has been incorporated in the Majithia Wage Board Award
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/199674873/ 12
Nai Dunia A Unit Of Jagran Publications ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 9 May, 2019
in order to give fair and equitable treatment to employees of newspapers. Therefore, no question of
withholding the said benefit by taking any other view with regard to "variable pay" can arise. In fact,
a reading of the relevant part of the Award would go to show that the concept of "variable pay"
which was introduced in the Award stems from grade pay contained in the Report of the Sixth Pay
Commission and was intended to bring the working journalist and non-journalist employees
covered by the Act on a par with the Central Government employees to the extent possible. So far as
the concept of heavy cash losses is concerned, we are of the view that the very expression itself
indicates that the same is different from mere financial difficulties and such losses apart from the
extent of being crippling in nature must be consistent over the period of time stipulated in the
Award. This is a question of fact that has to be determined from case to case.
29. Having clarified all doubts and ambiguities in the matter and upon holding that none of the
newspaper establishments should, in the facts of the cases before us, be held guilty of commission of
contempt, we direct that henceforth all complaints with regard to non-implementation of the
Majithia Wage Board Award or otherwise be dealt with in terms of the mechanism provided under
Section 17 of the Act. It would be more appropriate to resolve such complaints and grievances by
resort to the enforcement and remedial machinery provided under the Act rather than by any future
approaches to the courts in exercise of the contempt jurisdiction of the courts or otherwise."
[Emphasis Supplied] (15) In view of this judgment also, it is the mechanism provided under Section
17 of the Act which will address the claim of the employee regarding demand of wages as per the
Board. Since Act of 1955 was held to be silent about option of an employee to still get lesser wages
then what was due to an employee under the Act, it was poignantly held that it is in the domain of
doctrine of waiver. Whether undertaking/auction is submitted by employee voluntary or under
compelling circumstances is a question of fact which needs adjudication by labour Court. Para 28 of
the judgment of Avishek Raja (supra) makes it clear that benefit of Wage Board Award is applicable
to contractual employees also. Existence of employee-employer relation, existence of an option by
an employee whether given on his own volition or not are disputed questions of fact which needs
adjudication by labour Court. These questions, in our opinion can be gone into by labour Court
while deciding the reference.
(16) The argument of learned senior counsel based on Section 10(1)(c) & (d) referred hereinabove
appears to be attractive at the first blush but lost its complete shine on a deeper scrutiny of the
matter. In the Central Act (ID Act, 1947) the Second Schedule contains six entries, whereas the
Third Schedule is pregnant with eleven entries. By MP Labour Laws (Amendment) & Miscellaneous
Provisions Act, 2003 (28 of 2003) Second Schedule of Central Act is renumbered as "Part-A" and
"Part-B" was inserted. Entry No.7 of Part-B covers the Act of 1955. Even otherwise, Entry Nos.1 & 2
of the main Second Schedule provides jurisdiction to labour Court to examine propriety, legality of
an order passed by the employer under the standing order and interpretation of standing order. It is
a matter of common knowledge in industrial jurisprudence normally service conditions of industrial
workers are governed by provisions popularly called as "standing order". The "standing order" is not
defined in the ID Act, 1947. The expression "standing order", in our considered view has to be given
a wide meaning. Any binding provision which governs any of the service conditions of the employee
must be equated with "standing order".

(17) Any narrow or technical interpretation will lead to an absurd result and will not be as per
legislative intent ingrained in aforesaid entries of Second Schedule. This is trite law that while
considering a statutory provision the Court must consider the text and the context both {See: 1977
(2) SCC 256, [Board of Mining Examination vs. Ramjee] & 1987 (1) 424, [RBI vs. Peerless General
Finance and Investment Co. Ltd.]}. In the context, "standing order" is used in Second Schedule, it
will cover the conditions envisaged in the Wage Board Award. Reference may be made to the
judgment of Supreme Court in Huawei Technologies Company Ltd. vs. Sterlite Technologies Ltd.,
2016(3) MPLJ 15 and 2009 (10) SCC 293, [SBP & Co. (2) vs. Patel Engg. Ltd.] (wherein expression
'Rules' appearing in Section 15(2) of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was directed to be
understood with reference to provisions for appointment contained in arbitration agreement. The
term 'Rules' appearing in Section 15(2) of the Act will have to be understood with reference to the
provisions for appointment contained in the relevant contract. This judgment can be used for the
purpose of analogy. Thus, we are unable to persuade ourselves with the line of argument advanced
by learned senior counsel that reference order itself suffers from a jurisdictional error. In the result,
the argument that jurisdictional error and validity of reference cannot be gone into by labour Court
pales into insignificance.
(18) So far judgment in Jagran Parkashan (supra) cited by Shri Kochar is concerned, suffice it to say
in the said case impugned order was passed by Assistant Labour Commissioner referring two
disputes for adjudication before the labour Court. As per the statutory provision prevailing in the
concerned State, the High Court opined that ALC has passed the impugned order dated 13.12.2016
without jurisdiction. The State was directed to consider making a reference of dispute under Section
17(2) of the Act for adjudication before appropriate Labour Court. In the instant case, reference is
made by the State Government and, therefore, the said judgment has no application in the instant
case.
(19) So far as judgment of Keshvlal M. Rao (supra) is concerned, in our considered view on account
of different language employed and mechanism provided in Section 17(2) of the Act of 1955, it
cannot be treated as pari materia to Section 33(C)(2) of the ID Act. We respectfully recorded our
disagreement with the view taken in Keshavlal M. Rao (supra). Apart from this, in view of
judgments of Samarjit Ghosh (supra), Navbharat (supra) and recent judgment of Supreme Court in
the case of Avishek Raja (supra), otherwise the judgment of Keshvlal M. Rao (supra) cannot be
pressed into service.
(20) Apart from this, it is relevant to mention that order of reference is in the realm of an
administrative act. [See: Constitution Bench judgment reported in AIR 1953 SC 53, (State of Madras
vs. C.P. Sarathy)]. Similarly in Shambhu Nath Goyal vs. Bank of Baroda, Jullundur, (1978) 3 SCC
353, it was held that in making a reference under Section 10 of the ID Act, the appropriate
government is doing an administrative act and not a judicial or quasi judicial act. Hence, any factual
foundation in the order of Deputy Labour Commissioner or in the reference order will not create any
right in favour of the parties. The Labour Court will be free to adjudicate the matter on its own
merits in accordance with law.

(21) As analyzed above, no fault can be found in the orders of reference passed by State Government
and impugned orders of learned Single Judges. Resultantly, the writ appeals and writ petitions are
dismissed. No cost.
(22) A typed copy of this order be kept in all the connected matters.
