JUDGMENT
(Delivered by the Hon'ble Chief Justice) Heard learned counsel for the appellant and the learned
counsel for the State.
2. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the learned Single Judge failed to appreciate that
the period of suspension was prolonged by the respondents themselves and, therefore, if the
respondents have prolonged the suspension period without holding any enquiry, then the
allegations that were made against respondents 4 and 5 could not have been made the basis for
dismissing the appellant's writ petition and, hence, the judgment of the learned Single Judge
deserves to be set aside and the appellant deserves to be reinstated after quashing the suspension
order dated 7.9.2012. _____________ http://www.judis.nic.in C.M.P.Nos.7453, 7546 and 7547 of
2020
3. Learned counsel for the appellant by placing reliance on the judgment in the case of Ajay Kumar
Choudhary v. Union of India, (2015) 7 SCC 291 urged that when the respondents themselves failed
to provide any material relating to the disciplinary proceedings being continued against the
appellant, the learned Single Judge committed an error by relying on the contents of the additional
counter affidavit filed by the District Collector, which has given no explanation for the cause of delay
in the enquiry. Not only this, the allegations were against respondents 4 and 5, and even otherwise,
in the absence of any competent enquiry proceedings, there was no justification to continue the
appellant under suspension and any denial of service benefits to the appellant is absolutely arbitrary
and hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
4. The contention of the learned counsel is that the fourth respondent had been making allegations
against the appellant and, therefore, it was the said respondent who was responsible for any such
misappropriation of the funds of the village, but without any enquiry and without any specific
charge, the appellant was unjustifiably kept under suspension for the past eight years. He, therefore,
submits _____________ http://www.judis.nic.in C.M.P.Nos.7453, 7546 and 7547 of 2020 that
the dismissal of the writ petition should be reversed keeping in view the submissions raised and the
appeal be allowed.
5. We have considered the submissions raised and a prolonged period of suspension by itself may
not be sufficient to call for any interference. To the contrary, this is a case where there were
allegations of a criminal case having been filed vis-a-vis graft charges against respondents 4 and 5,
and the appellant was also indicated to have been involved therein, which is evident from the
counter (additional counter affidavit) filed by the District Collector before the learned Single Judge.
6. We have come across a Division Bench judgment in the case of The Director Genreal of Police v.
T.Kamarajan [Judgment dated 19.11.2019 in W.A.No.3957 of 2019], where such an argument was

R.Elumalai vs The District Collector on 20 July, 2020
advanced on the strength of the judgment in Ajay Kumar Choudhary case (supra), where after
considering the same, the Division Bench referred to the judgment of the Delhi High Court in Govt.
of NCT of Delhi v. Dr.Rishi Anand, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 10506, particularly paragraph (22) thereof,
and held that in cases where graft charges, _____________ http://www.judis.nic.in
C.M.P.Nos.7453, 7546 and 7547 of 2020 including criminal trial are involved, the protection under
Article 21 of the Constitution of India carte blanche would not be available. We find ourselves in
agreement with the said judgment and, therefore, this case in particular on its peculiar facts as
discussed by the learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment, does not qualify for any exercise
of discretion in favour of the appellant.
7. We enquired from the learned counsel for the appellant that the impugned judgment is dated
20.1.2020 with a clear direction to conclude the proceedings within three months, but the
appellant's counsel simply replied that he has no information of any such proceedings, nor the
respondents have undertaken any further proceedings, but there is nothing on record to indicate the
same. What we find is there does not appear to be any effort on the part of the appellant to have
tendered a copy of the judgment before the District Collector for an early disposal of the enquiry as
directed by the learned Single Judge, and it appears that after having waited for almost three
months, the present appeal was preferred in March, 2020.
_____________ http://www.judis.nic.in C.M.P.Nos.7453, 7546 and 7547 of 2020
8. We, therefore, find no reason to entertain the appeal, and as indicated above, the learned Single
Judge does not appear to have committed any error in calling upon the District Collector,
Villupuram, to complete the enquiry proceedings within three months. If the enquiry has not yet
been concluded, the same shall be concluded by the District Collector without any further delay, as
directed by the learned Single Judge.
The appeal SR is consigned to records. C.M.P.Nos.7453, 7546 and 7547 of 2020 are dismissed.
