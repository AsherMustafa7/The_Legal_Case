ORDER
The petitioner has challenged an order of suspension dated 24.01.2018, passed by the Deputy
Registrar of Cooperative Societies (Housing)/R2. The petitioner had been employed as Secretary of
Gandhinagar Cooperative Housing Society/R3.
2.Pursuant to an inspection under Section 82 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983 (in
short 'Act'), proceedings were initiated in contemplation of suspension of the petitioner for certain
allegations relating to non-maintenance of ledgers and accounts, receipts and bills concerning loans
extended to the members of the society and alleged misappropriation in that regard.
3.The petitioner had challenged the notice by way of writ petition in W.P.(MD)No.11007 of 2016
seeking a direction to R2 to grant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis two months’ time for production
of all relevant documents. That writ petition came to be disposed on 22.06.2016, this Court
sustaining the notice dated 16.06.2016 initiating disciplinary action, but extending the time by six
weeks to enable the petitioner to produce the relevant documents.
4.Thereafter, enquiry was conducted culminating in the impugned order dated 24.01.2018
suspending the petitioner in terms of Section 76 of the Act. It is relevant to note that no charge
memo has been issued till date and the disciplinary proceedings are yet to commence.
5.The impugned order of suspension has been challenged by the petitioner mainly on the ground
that it has been passed by an authority who lacks competence in that regard. The conferment of
powers to certain officers as Registrars under the Act is dealt with G.O.Ms.No.31, H&U, dated
08.01.1990.
6.Therein, the Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies (Inspection Cell) has been delegated the
powers that vest with Registrar to render various acts including specifically powers under Section 76
of the Act, that provides for suspension of a paid officer or servant of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Society.
7.The Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Societies (Housing) has been conferred with various powers
under the Act, specifically barring the power set out under various acts, specifically Section 76 of the
Act.
8.The relevant portion of the GO is extracted below:

9.In this case, admittedly, the impugned order has been passed https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis by
the Deputy Registrar / R2, who has not been delegated such power, but has been expressly debarred
from exercising the power of suspension under Section 76 of the Act.
10.Thus, while Joint Registrars have been vested with certain rights by way of a positive entitlement,
the Deputy Registrars have been denied certain rights by way of a negative directive, that is, by way
of denial.
11.Mr.A.K.Manikkam, learned Special Government Pleader would attempt to save the day by
referring to Rule 12(2) of the Tamil Nadu Civil Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955, which
deals with the power vesting in an authority superior to the appointing authority, to impose penalty
on members of state service and reads thus:
(2) Power of the higher authority of the appointing authority to impose penalties on
members of State Services.- Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, the
appointing authority or any authority administratively higher to the appointing
authority may impose the penalties specified in items (i), (iii) to (viii) and (ix) of Rule
8 on members of the State Services:
Provided that where the members of the State Services have been appointed by the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Government or by any authority administratively
higher than the appointing authority, the penalties mentioned in item (iii) in so far as
it relates to withholding of promotion and items
(iv). (vi), (vii) and (viii) in Rule 8 shall be imposed only by the Government or by
such higher authority:
Provided further that where the State Government are the appointing authority for
members holding the posts included in the State Services, the Heads of Departments
concerned may impose any of the penalties specified in item
(i) and item (iii) in so far as it relates to withholding of increments and items (v) and
(ix) in Rule 8 on those members other than such members who are immediately
below such Heads of Departments:
Provided also that all authorities directly higher to the members holding the posts
included in the State Services may frame charges against such members of the State
Services under Rule 17(b) or issue show cause notice under Rule 17(a) even if they are
not the competent authority to impose the penalty and they may conduct the inquiry
themselves or request the competent authority to appoint an inquiry officer to
conduct the inquiry. They shall remit the papers to the competent authority for
passing final orders, after the case is processed up to the level of completion of
inquiry or after receipt of explanation to show cause notice, as the case may be:

V.Ramaraj vs / on 20 December, 2021
Provided also that where the appointing authority or the authority administratively
higher to the appointing https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis authority have passed
orders of suspension under Rule 17(e) on the members of the State Services, they may
exercise the power to impose the penalty specified in item (ix) in Rule 8 on such
members. (vide G.O.Ms.No.19, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (N)
Department, dated 11.2.2008, wef. 11.2.2008).
12. His attempt is to say that notwithstanding that an authority may be designated competent to
impose penalty, the appointing authority or any authority administratively superior to the
appointing authority may also impose such penalty.
13.This Rule, if at all, would only fortify the submission of the petitioner, as the first principle
reiterated therein is that, while an authority superior to a competent authority might well kick-start
the proceedings in question, such proceedings must be concluded only as provided for specifically in
the Rules.
14.For the aforesaid discussion, the impugned order fails as having been passed by an authority who
lacks competence, and one specifically barred from dealing with the subject of suspension. This writ
petition is allowed. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
