Mahanadi Coalfields Limited & vs Jalaram Transport on 9 May, 2025
1. These Appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred
to as "A&C Act") have been filed seeking setting aside of the Judgment dated 11.20.2017 passed by
the learned Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK District Judge, Jharsuguda in Arbitration
Petition No. 1 of 2016, Arbitration Petition No. 2 of 2016, Arbitration Petition No. 3 of 2016 and
Arbitration Petition No. 4 of 2016. Since these Appeals arise from the similar questions of law and
facts and involve similar contentions, the same were taken up for hearing together and are being
dealt with by this common judgment and order.
I. FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE:
2. The present dispute arises over recovery of excess payment made to the Respondent Contractors
by the Appellant. The Appellant, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited is a Central Government Public
Sector Undertaking who floated tender, i.e. NIT 287 on 26.12.2002 for transportation of crushed
coal from Samaleswari Open Cast Project, Coal Handling Plant, hereinafter referred to as "SOCP,
CHP" to Lajkur Railway Siding No.I, II and III of Ib Valley Area, MCL. Lead (distance) mentioned in
NIT-287 was 4-5 kms. from SOCP, CHP to Railway Siding No.I & II. The Respondent Contractors
were successful bidders and the Appellant entered into individual contracts with each of them. On
7.4.2003 letter of intent was issued to the Respondent Contractors. Work orders were issued on
2.6.2003. On 23.6.2003, the agreements were signed. Date of commencement of the work was
27.4.2003. Period of completion of the work was two years from the date of commencement of the
work. Scheduled date of completion of the work was 26.4.2005. The Respondent Contractors
executed additional quantity of work and the Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK time for
completion of the additional quantity of the work was extended twice till 30.4.2006.
3. Internally, without notifying the Respondent Contractors, it was found that the distances
mentioned in the NIT were more than the actual distance covered by the Respondent Contractors.
Therefore, the Appellants arrived at a decision to recover the excess amounts paid to the
Respondent Contractors as they had allegedly covered less distance than what was specified in the
Agreement. The Appellants accordingly invoked Clause 16 of the General Terms and Conditions of
the Contract and made recovery of the excess payment by deducting the amounts from the running
bill.
4. Aggrieved, the Respondent Contractors approached this Court vide W.P.(C) No. 6366/2006,
6367/2006, 6368/2006 and 6369/2006 apart from four other identically placed contractors also
challenging the deductions so made. This Court vide its order dated 30.3.2010 was pleased to allow
the Writ Petitions and directed the present Appellants to refund the amounts deducted.
5. Further aggrieved, the Appellant Company preferred SLP No. 17482/2010, 17569/2010,
17619/2010 and 17622/2010 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court vide
order dated 10.10.2014 disposed off the Civil Appeal No. 9711/2014 (arising out of SLP No.
17482/2010), Civil Appeal No. 9712/2014 (arising out of SLP No. 17569/2010), Civil Appeal No.
9713/2014 (arising out of SLP No. 17619/2010) and Civil Appeal No. 9714/2014 (arising out of SLP
No. Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK 17622/2010) apart from four other identical
appeals holding that this Court ought not to have interfered when there are disputed questions of

facts involved. Thereafter, the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to appoint Ld. Single Arbitrator,
Retd. Justice A. Suryanarayan Naidu to adjudicate upon the dispute between the Parties.

7. Aggrieved, the Appellant assailed the final award dated 1.3.2016 under Section 34 of the A&C Act
in the Court of the Learned District Judge, Jharsuguda vide Arbitration Petition No. 1 of 2016,
Arbitration Petition No. 2 of 2016, Arbitration Petition No. 3 of 2016 and Arbitration Petition No. 4
of 2016 respectively. Vide separate judgments all dated 11.10.2017 in Arbitration Petition No. 1 of
2016, Arbitration Petition No. 2 of 2016, Arbitration Petition No. 3 of 2016 and Arbitration Petition
No. 4 of 2016, the Ld. District Judge, Jharsuguda was pleased to dismiss the same upon arriving at
the conclusion that the award was not in violation of the public policy of India, did not contain any
plausible fact that would shock the conscience of the court and did not have any patent illegality on
the face of the record.
8. Aggrieved by the judgments dated 11.10.2017 in Arbitration Petition No. 1 of 2016, Arbitration
Petition No. 2 of 2016, Arbitration Petition No. 3 of 2016 and Arbitration Petition No. 4 of 2016, the
instant Appeals have been preferred. As the facts leading up to the instant Appeal have been laid
down, this Court shall endeavour to summarise the contentions of the Parties and the broad grounds
that have been raised Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK to seek the exercise of this
Court's limited jurisdiction available under S. 37 of the A&C Act.
II. APPELLANT'S SUBMISSIONS:
9. The Ld. Counsel for the Appellant assails the arbitral award and the judgment of
the learned District Judge, mainly on the ground that the learned District Judge has
completely failed to deal with or cogently answer the grounds raised by the present
appellant in its application under Section 34 of the A & C Act, 1996, challenging the
Award dated 1.3.2016, passed by the Learned Sole Arbitrator, and has disposed of the
matter in a cursory, casual and lackadaisical manner with complete non-application
of mind contrary to the well settled propositions of law and, hence, both the
impugned order and the Final Award are liable to be set aside.
10.It is also contended that the Ld. District Judge being the final court on facts did
not take into account the alleged errors in facts that had been committed by the Ld.
Arbitrator and therefore by allegedly relying on the erroneous findings of the Ld.
Arbitrator, the Ld. District Judge has committed gross illegality and such a judgment
is liable to be interfered with and set aside.
III. RESPONDENT'S SUBMISSIONS:
11.Per contra, Learned Counsels for the present Respondent contends that the
Appellant has not been able to showcase any reasonable ground for interfering with
the impugned judgment apart from making bald statements towards the same. It was
vehemently submitted that the Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK scope of
interference of this Court in an application u/s Section 37 of the A&C Act is extremely
limited and this Court cannot reappreciate evidence at this stage, therefore it may not
revisit the factual findings of the Ld. Tribunal apart from testing the same on the
mantle of reasonableness. It was also submitted that the Ld. District Judge had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177811516/ 4
Mahanadi Coalfields Limited & vs Jalaram Transport on 9 May, 2025
considered all the material aspects of the contentions raised by the parties and also
duly regarded their submissions thereby warranting no interference with the
concurrent views of the Ld. Arbitral Tribunal as well as the Ld. District Judge.
12.It is submitted that the award is based on appreciation of the material and
evidence that were placed before the arbitrator and it is not open in these
proceedings to re-appraise the same. It is thus prayed that the present appeal be
dismissed.
IV. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
13.Having heard the parties and perused the materials available on record, this court here has
identified the following issues to be determined:
A. Whether this Court should interfere with the impugned order given the narrow
scope of its powers under Section 37 of the A&C Act?
V. ISSUE A: WHETHER THIS COURT SHOULD INTERFERE WITH THE
IMPUGNED ORDER GIVEN THE NARROW SCOPE OF ITS POWERS UNDER
SECTION 37 OF THE A&C ACT?
14. It is trite in law that whilst exercising power under Section 34 of the 1996 Act the Court does not
sit in appeal over the arbitral award.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Interference with an arbitral award is only on limited
grounds as set out in Section 34 of the 1996 Act. A possible view by the arbitrator on facts is to be
respected as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied
upon. It is only when an arbitral award could be categorized as perverse, that on an error of fact an
arbitral award may be set aside. Further, a mere erroneous application of the law or wrong
appreciation of evidence by itself is not a ground to set aside an award as is clear from the provisions
of subsection (2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act.
15.In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd.1, a three-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that Courts need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards are not to be
interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court concludes that the perversity of the
award goes to the root of the matter and there is no possibility of an alternative interpretation that
may sustain the arbitral award. It was observed that jurisdiction under Section 34 cannot be equated
with the normal appellate jurisdiction. Rather, the approach ought to be to respect the finality of the
arbitral award as well as party's autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum
as provided under the law.
16.It is also a settled proposition that errors of fact cannot be corrected by the court while exercising
the jurisdiction under Section 34 of the A&C (2019) 20 SCC 1 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Act as it does not sit in appeal over the award. In Parsa Kente Collieries Ltd. v. Rajasthan
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177811516/ 5
Mahanadi Coalfields Limited & vs Jalaram Transport on 9 May, 2025
Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.2, it was further inter alia held that a possible view by the
Arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the Arbitrator is the ultimate master of the
quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. It was further
observed that thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in
quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. Reliance can also be
placed upon NHAI v. ITD Cementation (India) Ltd.3, and SAIL v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Ltd.4.
The view was reiterated in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. (supra) wherein it was inter alia held that the
courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and
interpretation of contract exists. It was reminded that the court should defer to the view taken by the
Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such an award
portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the A&C Act. In South East Asia Marine Engg.
& Constructions Ltd. [SEAMAC Limited] v. Oil India Ltd.5 , it was inter alia held that the courts
should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of
the contract exists. (2019) 7 SCC 236 (2015) 14 SCC 21 (2009) 10 SCC 63 (2020) 5 SCC 164
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
17.This Court also places further reliance on the Hon'ble Apex Court's judgment in Madnani
Construction Corpn. (P) Ltd. v. Union of India6 wherein it was held that:
"20. It is well settled that the arbitrator is the master of facts. When the arbitrator on
the basis of record and materials which are placed before him by the Railways came
to such specific findings and which have not been stigmatised as perverse by the High
Court, the High Court in reaching its conclusions cannot ignore those findings. But it
appears that in the instant case, the High Court has come to the aforesaid finding that
the items mentioned above are excepted matters and non-arbitrable by completely
ignoring the factual finding by the arbitrator and without holding that those findings
are perverse."
18.Where Section 34 is concerned, the position is well settled by now that the court does not sit in
appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on the limited ground provided under
Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the public policy of India. As per the legal position
clarified through decisions of this Court prior to the amendments to the 1996 Act in 2015, a violation
of Indian public policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian law, a
violation of the interest of India, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of patent
illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the concept of the 'fundamental policy of Indian law'
would cover compliance with statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial (2010) 1 SCC 549
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK approach, compliance with the principles of natural
justice, and reasonableness.
19.It is only if one of these conditions is met that the court may interfere with an arbitral award in
terms of Section 34(2)(b)(ii), but such interference does not entail a review of the merits of the
dispute, and is limited to situations where the findings of the arbitrator are arbitrary, capricious or
perverse, or when the conscience of the court is shocked, or when the illegality is not trivial but goes
to the root of the matter. An arbitral award may not be interfered with if the view taken by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177811516/ 6
Mahanadi Coalfields Limited & vs Jalaram Transport on 9 May, 2025
arbitrator is a possible view based on facts.
20.Therefore, to reiterate, the scope of interference in proceedings under Section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been laid down by the courts time and time again, more
recently summarised in the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Indian Railways Catering
and Tourism Corp Ltd. v. Brandavan Foods Products7. The operative portion of which reads as
under:
"42. The scope of examination of an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Act can be
traced, more significantly so, in Associate Builders v. DDA, 2024 : DHC : 6114 O.M.P.
(COMM) 495/2022 & Conn. matters (2015) 3 SCC 49, Ssangyong Engg. &
Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131and Delhi Airport Metro Express
(P) Ltd. v. DMRC, (2022) 1 SCC 131. Reliance is also placed upon, inter alia, Dyna
Technologies (P) Ltd. v.Crompton Greaves Ltd. (2019) 20 SCC 1; UHL Power Co. Ltd.
v. State 2024 : DHC : 6114 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK of H.P.
(2022) 4 SCC 116; South East Asia Marine Engineering & Constructions Ltd. v. Oil
India Ltd. (2020) 5 SCC 164; Patel Engineering Ltd. v.North Eastern Electric Power
Corporation Ltd. (2020) 7 SCC 167; PSA SICAL Terminals (P) Ltd. v. Board of
Trustees of V.O. Chidambranar Port Trust Tuticorin, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 508; and
Army Welfare Housing Organisation v. Sumangal Services (P) Ltd. (2004) 9 SCC 619.
43. For the sake of brevity, the principles delineated in the aforesaid cases are summarised
hereinafter.
44. The award can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality if : a) the view taken by the arbitral
tribunal is impossible or such that no reasonable person could arrive at it; b) if the arbitral tribunal
exceeds its jurisdiction by going beyond the contract, and adjudicating upon issues not referred to it;
c) the finding of the arbitral tribunal is based on no evidence or it ignores material evidence.
Rewriting of contractual terms by the Arbitrator is completely prohibited, and an Award which
suffers from such perversity is liable to be set aside. The illegality must go to the root of the matter
and does not include mere erroneous application of law or a contravention of law which is unrelated
to public policy or public interest. If two views are possible, the Court will not interfere with the view
of the arbitral tribunal if it has taken one of the two views. Reappreciation of evidence is also
impermissible.
45. The award can also be set aside on the ground of it being in contravention with public policy of
India, the scope of which includes : a) fraud or corruption; b) violation of Sections 75 and 81 of the
Act; c) any contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; d) violation of the most basic
notions of justice or morality, so as to shock the conscience of the Court. The Court does not
function as a Court of appeal, and errors of fact cannot be corrected. The arbitrator's findings on
facts must be accepted, as Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK the arbitrator is the
ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence in making the award.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177811516/ 7
Mahanadi Coalfields Limited & vs Jalaram Transport on 9 May, 2025
46. It is also relevant to note that the Court cannot modify or rewrite the Award, and can only set it
aside, post which the parties can re-initiate arbitration proceedings, if they so choose. However,
partial setting aside is valid and justified, if the part proposed to be annulled is independent and can
be removed without affecting the rest of the award. For this, reliance is placed upon McDermott
International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181; S.V. Samudram v. State of
Karnataka (2024) 3 SCC 623 and National Highways Authority of India v. Trichy Thanjavur
Expressway Ltd. 2023 SCC OnLine Del 5183."
21.Moreover, on the aspect of the Ld. Arbitrator being the master of facts, the Supreme Court has
recently in NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services (P) Ltd.8, has held as under:
"12. Further, it is also a settled proposition that where the arbitrator has taken a
possible view, although a different view may be possible on the same evidence, the
court would not interfere with the award. This Court in Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v.
Union of India [Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India, (1999) 9 SCC 449], held as
follows : (SCC p. 475, paras 36-37) "36. Be it noted that by reason of a long catena of
cases, it is now a well-settled principle of law that reappraisal of evidence by the court
is not permissible and as a matter of fact exercise of power by the court to reappraise
the evidence is unknown to proceedings under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act. In
the event of there being no reasons in the award, question of interference of the court
would not arise at all. In (2021) 19 SCC 694 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK the event, however, there are reasons, the interference would still be not
available within the jurisdiction of the court unless of course, there exist a total
perversity in the award or the judgment is based on a wrong proposition of law. In
the event however two views are possible on a question of law as well, the court
would not be justified in interfering with the award.
37. The common phraseology "error apparent on the face of the record does not itself,
however, mean and imply closer scrutiny of the merits of documents and materials
on record.
The court as a matter of fact, cannot substitute its evaluation and come to the conclusion that the
arbitrator had acted contrary to the bargain between the parties. If the view of the arbitrator is a
possible view the award or the reasoning contained therein cannot be examined."
22.It is no longer res integra that the scope for interference in an appeal under Section 37 of the Act
is narrow. In order to succeed, the Appellant must establish that the finding of the arbitrator is
based on no evidence or the arbitrator has taken into account material which is irrelevant or has
ignored vital evidence.
23.This Court also notes that it has been repeatedly held that while entertaining appeals under
Section 37 of the Act, the court is not actually sitting as a court of appeal over the award of the
Arbitral Tribunal and therefore, the court would not reappreciate or reassess the evidence. The
position of law stands crystallised today, that findings, of fact as well as of law, of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177811516/ 8
Mahanadi Coalfields Limited & vs Jalaram Transport on 9 May, 2025
arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal are ordinarily not amenable to interference either under Sections 34 or
Section 37 of the Act. The scope of interference is only where the finding of the tribunal Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK is either contrary to the terms of the contract between the
parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that interference, by this Court, is absolutely necessary. The arbitrator
Tribunal is the final arbiter on facts as well as in law, and even errors, factual or legal, which stop
short of perversity, do not merit interference under Section 34 or Section 37 of the Act.
24.While deciding an appeal it must be kept in mind that the arbitrator Tribunal is the final arbiter
on facts as well as law, and even errors, factual or legal, which stop short of perversity, do not merit
interference under Section 34 or Section 37 of the Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has
consistently held that an arbitration award should not be lightly interfered with. In this regard we
may place reliance on the Hon'ble Apex Court's judgments in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General
Electric Co.9; ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd.10; Hindustan Zinc Ltd. v. Friends Coal Carbonisation11 and
Associate Builders v. DDA12.
25.The scope of judicial scrutiny and interference by an appellate court under Section 37 of the Act
is even more restricted, than while deciding a petition under Section 34 of the Act. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd.13 held as under:
1994 Supp (1) SCC 644 (2003) 5 SCC 705 (2006) 4 SCC 445 (2015) 3 SCC 49 (2006)
11 SCC 181 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK "52. The 1996 Act makes
provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only
to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only,
like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The
court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the
parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, scheme of the provision
aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be
justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's
jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality
offered by it'."
26.It is also settled law that the courts cannot travel beyond the scope of Section 34 in an appeal
under Section 37 from an order of the court in an application preferred by a party to set aside an
arbitral award under Section 34 of the A&C Act as has been laid down by the Supreme Court in
MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd.14 where the Apex Court held:
"14. As far as interference with an order made under Section 34, as per Section 37, is
concerned, it cannot be disputed that such interference under Section 37 cannot
travel beyond the restrictions laid down under Section 34. In other words, the court
cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award, and must
only ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under Section 34 has not
exceeded the scope of the provision. Thus, it is evident that in case an arbitral award
has been confirmed by the court under Section 34 and by the court in an appeal
under Section 37, this Court must be extremely cautious and slow to disturb such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177811516/ 9
Mahanadi Coalfields Limited & vs Jalaram Transport on 9 May, 2025
concurrent findings."
(2019) 4 SCC 163 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
27.Section 34 of the Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts for review of arbitral
award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like,
when an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, which includes cases of fraud, breach of
fundamental policy of Indian law and breach of public morality. The other ground provided under
Section 34 is patent illegality. It specifically provides that an award cannot be set aside on the
ground of erroneous application of law or on re-appreciation of fact. In the decision of McDermott
International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. (supra), a reference was made to the decision of U.P.
State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar15 and it was observed that under Section 34 of the
Act of 1996 there is a departure from the scheme of Section 16 in the 1940 Act where perhaps the
court was given wider amplitude of powers. The Apex Court interpreted the scope of interference
under Section 34 and observed that the court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only
quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. The scheme of
the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be
justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by
opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it. Under Section 34(2) of
the Act 1996 the court is empowered to set aside an arbitral award on the grounds specified therein.
There is no specific 2009 SCC OnLine All 624 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK power
granted to the court to itself allow the claims originally made before the Arbitral Tribunal where it
finds the Arbitral Tribunal erred in rejecting such claims. If such a power is recognised as falling
within the ambit of Section 34(4) of the Act, then the court would be acting no different from an
appellate court which would be contrary to the legislative intent of the Section 34 of the Act, 1996.
The court shall decline to decide the claim that had been rejected even if wrongly so by the learned
Arbitrator.
28.In the decision of Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Cromption Greaves Ltd.16, the Supreme Court
noted that only when there is complete perversity in the reasoning then it can be challenged under
the provisions of Section 34 of the Act. The power vested under Section 34(4) of the Act, 1996 to
cure defects can be utilised in cases where the arbitral award does not provide any reasoning or if
the award has some gap in the reasoning or otherwise and that can be cured so as to avoid the
challenge based on the aforesaid curable defects under Section 34 of the Act.
29.It is well recognized in Arbitration jurisprudence that the scope of interference by the Courts in
arbitration proceedings and arbitral awards is narrow and that the Courts ought to be cautious and
circumspect in interfering with any award which is passed by an arbitral tribunal which has been
appointed pursuant to an agreement (2019) 20 SCC 1 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
between the parties to the dispute. The exceptions of the aforementioned rule finds place in Section
34 and Section 37 of the Act wherein certain instances have been outlined where the Courts can
interfere with any award passed by arbitral tribunals and set it aside. This court therefore shall also
examine the award with the aforesaid restrictive mandate of law.

30.Furthermore, this Court is cognizant that Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act
provides a statutory forum for appeal, inter alia, against an order either setting aside or refusing to
set aside an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Act. The scope of such an appeal is inherently
limited to the grounds enumerated under Section 34, thereby ensuring that the appellate process
remains confined to the specific parameters established by the statute.
31.In view of the foregoing, this Court shall carefully examine the arguments advanced by the
counsel for the Appellant, wherein it is asserted that the claims upheld by the Arbitrator are
inconsistent with the terms of the contract or that the impugned Award lacks any supporting
material or evidence.
32.Prima facie, a perusal of the impugned judgment and Award unequivocally demonstrates that the
Arbitrator relied upon written submissions, documentary evidence, and the statements of the
parties involved in the transaction to determine and quantify the claims.
33. The Ld. District Judge has first and foremost taken note of the scope of its powers under Section
34 of the A&C Act and the settled position of Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK law
pertaining to the grounds where it may exercise it's powers which is in line with the position of law
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in PSA SICAL Terminals Pvt. Ltd. v. Board of Trustees of
V.O. Chidambranar Port Trust Tuticorin and Ors.17; K. Sugumar and Anr. v. Hindustan Petroleum
Corporation Ltd. & Anr.18; UHL Power Company Ltd. v. State of Himachal Pradesh19; Sutlej
Construction Limited v. Union Territory of Chandigarh20; Venture Global Engineering v. Satyam
Computer Services Limited and Anr.21 and Patel Engineering Limited v. North Eastern Electric
Power Corporation Limited22.
34.Thereafter, the Ld. District Judge has taken note of the contentions of the Parties including the
law relied upon by either side. Then the Ld. District Judge applied it's mind and referring to the
findings of the Ld. Arbitrator has come to the conclusion that the Ld. Arbitrator has arrived at it's
findings after due consideration of the documents on record, the agreement and the evidence
adduced by the Parties. Such a finding having being arrived at cannot be trifled with in the absence
of a glaring error as it is trite in law that a finding arrived at by the Ld. Arbitral Tribunal if plausible,
cannot be interfered with. AIR 2021 SC 4661 (2020) 12 SCC 539 (2022) 4 SCC 116 (2018) 1 SCC 718
(2010) 8 SCC 660 (2020) 7 SCC 167 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
35.This Court, therefore, does not find that the order of the Tribunal, as confirmed by the learned
District Judge, is so perverse or suffers from patent illegality which requires interference.
36.In view of the discussion above, this Court finds no infirmity, illegality or impropriety in the
award and order of the learned District Judge, which would require interference in the present
appeal. Appeal is accordingly dismissed.
VI. CONCLUSION:

37.Therefore, in light of the discussion above, keeping the settled principles of law in mind and for
the reasons given above, this Court is of the considered view that the impugned orders as well as the
Arbitral Awards warrant no interference under Section 37 of the A&C Act.
38.The amounts awarded in favour of the Respondent Contractors are directed to be disbursed in
their favour, along with interest accrued, within a period of four weeks from the date of this
judgement/ order.
39.These appeals are disposed of, accordingly. No order as to costs.
40. Interim order, if any, passed earlier in any of the aforesaid Appeals stands vacated.
