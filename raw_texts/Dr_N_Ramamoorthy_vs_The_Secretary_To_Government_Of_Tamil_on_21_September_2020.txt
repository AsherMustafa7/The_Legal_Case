ORDER
Heard the learned counsel on either side.
2. The fourth respondent herein was a chit subscriber in the chit group run by the third respondent.
He had taken the prize amount. But he committed default. Therefore, the third respondent filed
ARC.No.54 of 2006 before the second respondent herein. The petitioner herein was the guarantor.
He was also made a party to the said proceedings. The Deputy Registrar of Chit passed an award in
favour of the third respondent on 19.06.2009. The petitioner filed the instant chit appeal before the
Government in the year 2020. But there was a huge delay in filing the appeal. The first respondent
by the impugned order took the stand that the delay is enormous and it has not been sufficiently
explained. http://www.judis.nic.in
3. This order refusing to condone the delay on the part of the petitioner is put to challenge in this
writ petition.
4. Though the learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for respondents 1 and 2 as well as
the learned counsel appearing for the third respondent submitted that the impugned order does not
warrant any interference.
5. I am of the view that the petitioner deserves to be given an opportunity. This is for more than one
reason, the petitioner was not a person who personally borrowed. He is the guarantor. That apart,
he has specifically averred in the affidavit filed in support of this writ petition that the award passed
by the second respondent was not communicated to him. It is also seen that the third respondent
filed an execution petition only in the year 2019. The petitioner states that only thereafter, he
became aware of passing of the award by the second respondent.

6. There is no material to indicate that the award was communicated to the writ petitioner herein.
Hence, the Government Order impugned in this writ petition stands quashed. The delay occasioned
in filing the chit appeal before the first respondent stands condoned. The first respondent shall
number the chit appeal and dispose it of on merits and in accordance with law within a period of
sixteen weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
